I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game.

There are no instructions, no warnings, and the game does not hold your hand - it just throws you into a trial by fire, and I constantly felt that I was just barely holding on.\n\nThe game gives you two weapons (at a time), a sword, the ability to rapidly dodge short distances, and precious few hit points, and then brings on wave after wave of enemies, all with strong AI that are not afraid to flank you or attack you en masse. Multiple enemy types with various strengths and weaknesses constantly joined forces to put me into harrowing positions that I could just barely eek may way through. Any gamer who has ever watched a game and incredulously thought, "Why are they lining up and attacking one at a time? No one would ever do that," will love this game. The challenge level is real, even in (for lack of a better description) platforming elements, where the player's blink/teleport/dodge is utilized like a real game element, and not just a "press x to not die" style safety button. But even when you do die (and you will... a lot), death is never overly penalized. In my many, many deaths playing this Beta, I never felt overwhelmed at a need to replay huge chunks of the game; the checkpoint system is invisible, which is to say executed perfectly.\n\nThe game drips atmosphere. Without anything even resembling a story being delivered, I feel like I know this world; it could also be that the team has just perfectly captured the feeling of a dystopian dream, including the earnestness of the character you're playing. I don't know what the Drifter wants, or why, but I do know that no one would go through all of this unless it was truly life or death. The pixel style artwork is phenomenal, even if the 2D/3D design sometimes tricks the eye a bit when giving the illusion of depth and height simultaneously. The music is INSANELY good. Rich, deep, mysterious, and in the style of the artwork, evokes what might have been in a masterpiece of the 8bit/16bit era.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. My only complaint about the beta was its length. I'm dying to play more. If anyone has any questions, feel free to message me.","March 31","true","6.3"," 363 of 413 people (88%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","88","363","413","19","10"

You've lost the thrill for the challenge.\n\nThat's when you'll try New Game + mode where you replay the game with all abilities unlocked from the beginning...but your health is capped at 40% which means enemies will kill you in two regular hits or one single heavy attack. Bosses one shot as well in this mode.\n\n\nPeople often compare this game's difficulty in NG+ mode with Dark souls. It's nothing like it. It's much fairer.\n\nYou don't have to guess what enemies do. You don't have to die at least one time against each boss because their attacks are unpredictible. When an enemy is about to attack, you know what it will do and where. This game doesn't test your guess work, or your patience against die-and-retry kinds of boss. It tests your reflexes and quick decision making because yes, all attacks are easily predictible, but rarely over 0.25s in advance.\n\n\nOne last thing : to fully apreciate this game, you have to know that the guy behind its idea was born with several life-threatening heart defects. This is why despite its esoteric, borderline childish art style, the game doesn't shy away from heart/blood or even death symbolisms so keep an eye out for those.\n\n...Now that i think about it, this game is almost a life lesson.\n\nOne last (but important) thing, playing with a controller is much easier.","April 20","true","34.6"," 130 of 138 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","130","138","12","9"

People have been saying it's like Dark Souls, and while I can see why they would say that, I don't think that's really accurate, either.\n\nThis game is all about timing and finese. If you try to button mash through combat against anything but the most basic of enemy, you're gonna get wrecked. Likewise, you can't just spam health items to cheese the combat because using a health item during combat is probably going to have the opposite effect from what you were hoping. Healing doesn't happen instantly, and trying to heal in combat leaves you open. The enemies will take advantage and punish you.\n\nYou've got your standard sword, which is your basic melee attack. You also get a gun fairly early, and it really comes in handy on certain enemies.  There's an evade roll that you're gonna get real familiar with, and it is used for both setting up counter attacks as well as exploring and uncovering secrets.\n\nThis game has a lot of secrets, by the way. You'll want to check any walls that look odd, and keep an eye out for platforms that might be on the very edge of the screen, only showing a few pixels. It's also not uncommon for secret areas to have other secret areas inside them. It might be worth noting that some of these hidden areas are manditory for progressing through the game, so if you hate exploring you'll probably end up using a walkthrough. Like a silly little casual.\n\nAs you collect currency, mainly from all the secret areas you'll come across, you can buy various upgrades in town. There are vendors for different types of skills. One vendor sells various sword upgrades, another sells gun upgrades, and one has evade roll upgrades. There are a couple others around, too.\n\nI do have one issue with the game, and that is the fact that there is no dialogue or text at all in the story. The story is told to you via pictures. I feel like it wasn't the best choice for this game, because the story is really weird, and very hard to understand. I was lost before the intro cutscene finished. It makes it hard to get invested in the story when it's basically nonsense. Keep in mind I'm not saying this is a strike against the game, I'm saying it's something I personally didn't like.\n\nStill, this is a really fun game with neat aesthetics and intense combat.\n\nYou should probably get it.\n\nUnless you're a smelly casual.","April 2","true","21.9"," 255 of 311 people (82%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","82","255","311","88","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/recommended/257850/","Aizawaa","crowbAr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/","342 products in account","rating: worth buying at full price\nscore: 9/10 - must play\nsimilar games: FEZ, Dark Souls, Transistor, Legend of Zelda, Megaman Zero\ntags: Beautiful, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalypse, Exploration, Combat, Hard\n\nHyper Light Drifter is one of the top league Indie games like Transistor, Shovel Knight or Banner Saga. With 6 hours playtime it isn't that long (although you might need longer if you die more often), but in my opinion it was the perfect playtime for this game and it felt really complete and round. But there is also a next game+ mode, which I will definitly play, especially because you can't get all upgrades on your first playthrough.\nUPDATE: Next Game+ mode is a bit dissapointing. All that changes is that your Health gets limited to 2, so you die in one hit against bosses and can only take one hit from  some normal enemies. I still try to beat this mode, but it isn't what I hoped a "next game+" mode would offer.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a Top Down game where you explore a "post apocalyptic" like world and fight monsters. You also meet other characters, but there is no understandable language in this game. When NPCs talk to you you see images of what they are talking about. I think this is okay, if these characters would speak english for example, it could hurt the atmossphere. And even though you don't hear a single word, some characters are actually really cool. There is also lots of mystery involved and even after beating the game, I'm still not 100% sure what really happened. Maybe I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, maybe the game isn't bringing across it's story well, I don't know, but I still had a very satisfying experience.\n\nExploration is one of my favorite things in video games, but I'm not talking about exploration like in Firewatch or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I'm talking about exploration in games like Dark Souls and Half-Life, and there is plenty of that in this game. The level design is open, but also focused and guides you. There are always side paths where you can find stuff and there are also really well hidden, but also well hinted, secrets. You also never get lost, because you have a map and every area has a unique theme. Also there are landmarks like giant corpses of some giant beings which help you orientate in the world. The world of this game is really amazing actually, and it's so beatiful.\n\nWhat really rounds up this world and the atmossphere is the music. It just perfectly fits this game and is so well made. It sounds a bit like it's inspired by FEZ actually (not only that). I also love how the music just flows, there are not sudden stops or clear moments where music starts and where it ends. All of this is so well made and helps to create this unique, beautiful and immersive world, which is just fun to run around in, but what about the combat?\n\nI love the combat. I really really love it. I love that this game makes no compromises. This game isn't extremely difficult, but it punishes beginner mistakes, like button mashing. You have to completely understand each mechanic to be able to succeed, but there are plenty of opportunties where you will learn them. Every area has it's own enemy types, each with it's own strength and weaknesses. Some hit hard and have lots of HP, but are slow, some are really fast but have really low hp, some have ranged attacks, some have multiple attack types. This means that when you are in a fight you have to priortize different enemies, just like in Doom or Serious Sam. Like in Dark Souls you have a limited amount of healing items you can carry, and using a healing item takes a little bit of time, so you have to time it right. Also you have to decide if you want to heal early or late, depending on how much you are willing to risk.\n\nWhat really made me love this game are the bossfights. ALL of them are really well made, although one boss was a bit too easy and I beat him first try (the boss of the water world, the frog thingy). Every boss starts with a small number of attack types and is not too overwhelming, but the more the fight continues, the crazier attacks they will use. Because of this there is no trial and error. You can watch the bosses do their things while you keep dodging. Also when you die and restart, you won't get overwhelmed immediately. There is much more to the gameplay I could talk about, but all that should matter for this review is that the combat is really well made, well thought out and also extremely responsiv and beginner friendly (but the game is really hard). You will need a controller though.\n\nBtw I didn't even notice the 30 fps, because of pixel art and the game is still very responsive, but 60 fps would obviously be better.","April 2","true","11.6"," 148 of 177 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","148","177","7","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EchoNine/recommended/257850/","EchoNine","Echo Nine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EchoNine/","257 products in account","DISCLAIMER\nI don't write a lot of reviews so I know my review might be bad, but I had to for Hyper Light Drifter. It probably says I have 12 hours in this game, but at the time of writing this review, 7 of those hours are from the release build and the rest from the preview build.\n\nEdit Reason: I forgot to talk about how it runs.. Sorry..\nEdit Reason 2: Reworded a few things.\n\nKick Starter:\nAs a kick starter backer, this game has given more that I expected. The preview build of the game was amazing and hyped me up for the release. And I wasn't let down at all.\n\nSo What Is It?:\nMany reviews already tell you what the game is like so, I'll keep it simple. Hyper Light Difter is a top down, action adventure, pixel art master piece. The mechanics (which involve sword play, dashing and ranged weapons) are rock solid and never fault you for unknown reasons. The atmoshpere and sound design are honestly one of the best experiences i've had in a long time, the story is super interesting and cryptic (this is a bonus or a flaw depending on how you like your stories) and lastly the game feels SO good to play.\n\nAnything Else?:\nThe game's difficulty gives me a dark souls 1 vibe, PLEASE don't misunderstand what I mean by this.\n\nWhat I mean is; the game is hard but fair, deaths that happen are your fault. Very very rarely will something kill you and leave you thinking "there is no way I could have saw that coming." Apart from experiencing a boss for the first time, which will leave you crushed into the ground after your first attempt.\n\nCool Opinions, What about the controls?:\nThe controls feel perfect on a gamepad, as I used a xbox360 type controller. Personally I find HLD is best played on a game pad but still controls well on keyboard(APART FROM DASHING, SEE FORUMS). The drifter (the character you play) moves very smoothly and is easy to control in pretty much any situation.\n\nStill Some One Sided Opinions in there, what about length?:\nWell here is where the game is slightly pulled down. SLIGHTLY. My first playthrough was about 5 hours and 30 mins. I didn't explore every single thing, although I did sit down and just look at the beautiful pixel art at times, so you could probably pull it out to 8 - 10 hours if you wanna find EVERYTHING. But if you are worried about the length, there is new game +. And trust me, this game has replay value.\n\nWhat If I Don't Care About Secrets and Stuff?:\nWell you should because there is countless secret areas in the game. And a lot of these areas you need to find to continue the story, at least I think you do... Either way just keep your eye out if you are interested in secrets. IF NOT, you could probably beat the game in like 4 hours. I'm not a speed runner so I couldn't tell you.\n\nNew Game +? (More info to come):\nYup, instead of 5 health, you have 2! Goodluck! :)\nEnemy placement seems the same but holy ♥♥♥♥ its difficult. You have to completely adapt to a new playstyle and have even quicker reactions.\n\nWhat about how the game RUNS?:\nWell its locked to 30fps. The devs said it was due to the logic in Game Maker coded to work  with 30 fps, but other people on the forum said that the devs could of easily created the game 60fps with no issues. So take that as you will. I also seem to get a fair bit of screen tear some times, but this only happens if the camera is moving constantly.\n\nBugs?:\nOnly one I've found so far. I dashed too fasted into a boss fight and my character was perma stuck in the "i'm standing still for the boss intro to look cool" phase. I couldn't move but couldn't take damage, so i just restared the game (it restarted me at the begining of the boss room) and it worked fine.\n\nSoooo Do You Recommend it?:\nFuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk yes. This game honestly blew my mind. Every sence is just too ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. The enviromental story telling lets your mind go crazy, the combat feels too good... You can interact with NPCs by pressing Y (or your equivalent button) and they way the communicate back to you is very Journey style, where as your little robot guy pings a sound and the NPC responds with it's own sound. ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. HIGHLY RECOMMEND with a game pad.\n\nSO LASTLY:\nIf you like games with combat that requires good reaction and a decent amount of thinking, a LOT of hidden secrets, a fun as ♥♥♥♥ dash ability, not much story hand holding (you gotta figure a lot of ♥♥♥♥ out), beautiful pixel art and lastly, engrossing atmosphere, then you should 100% get Hyper Light Difter.\n\nAnd if you don't like it, refund it? Sooo what are you worried about...","March 31","true","34.8"," 159 of 194 people (82%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","82","159","194","15","14"

Improvement comes from you and learning how to use the skills and equpment is what grants you strength. You can play through it without any optional upgrades at all, I think.\n\nYou cna also play the stages in any order but it's usually recommended to get the multi-dash upgrade first for an easier time.\n\nThere's also platforming here which is a delight for me who grew up with platformers.\n\nThe game is very atmospheric with it's gorgeous pixel visuals and animations but I do feel apathetic playing it most of the time. I can't find any emotional attachments to any of the characters because it's a silent game. Pure visual story telling would work if the story was simple but I get the feeling that it's far more complex than it seems. There's even a bit of time travel here from what I understand. This might just be my own preference because I can't stand narratives in games with silent protagonists.\n\nMy only real con about this game is that it feels kinda' short or I just found an exploit and ripped right through the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/257850/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","953 products in account","Overview:Hyper Light Drifter is a 2D action-adventure RPG game inspired by and made as an homage to 8-bit and 16-bit classics from the 80s and 90s. The game consists of fast-paced, real-time strategic-combat gameplay. The game is developed and published by Heart Machine, made using GameMaker: Studio. It’s available for PC, OS X and is planned to be available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the future. It is a very special game.\n\n\nStory:This game’s story has to be fully inferred. There’s no dialogue, only imagery; this takes after SNES’ games’ tendencies to not have any dialogue. The Drifter (our protagonist) is ill, he coughs up blood constantly, implying his impending death. The protagonist’s illness is inspired by the game’s creator’s own battle with heart disease. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is a major inspiration for the game’s world. Hidden around the game is ancient technology forgotten by the world’s inhabitants, The Drifter sets out on a journey to find a cure for his illness and in his journey is revealed the secrets of this ancient technology. However, his adventure is not without obstacles. There are many enemies throughout the game, four main bosses to the North; South; East; and West; as well as some other bosses in some locations of the game.\n\nThe narrative through imagery is extremely atmospherical, which in turn conveys different emotions. There are some NPCs in the game which have certain stories to tell, most of which deal with themes such as hardship and needing help from the good-hearted protagonist. Although it’s a bit difficult to understand the story in its entirety, the game manages to leave you feeling like you’ve just been through quite the adventure by the time you finish it.\n\n\nGameplay:The gameplay is extremely fun, it is also challenging. The Drifter uses an energy sword for melee attacks, ranged weapons like guns, and AoE attacks. The enemies in the game become more abundant and progressively harder to defeat, forcing the player to experiment with different tactics. The game’s creator, Alex Preston, says the game is a combination between TLOZ: A Link to the Past and Diablo. You can save and restore health at certain checkpoints in the game, which also serve as fast-travel points. These points can be found in the central city, and in the four areas surrounding the city. The player can upgrade certain aspects of the Drifter’s ability by finding batteries, which function like money/ability points. The developers also recently added a local co-op mode which is in BETA. Each boss has a very particular pattern, and have varying levels of difficulty, the last of which is the hardest. Even if this game takes after titles such as Dark Souls, it is not as hard, though gamers who enjoy a challenge will definitely enjoy this one. It’s simple but testing, can be casual at times, but unforgiving if you’re careless.\n\n\nVisual:Two words: Pixel Art. This game has a very attractive aesthetic, all rendered in beautiful pixel art. The animations are wonderful and the environmental design is a delight to look at. Even though it is clearly a 2D game, some of the animations are executed so well that it almost seems like it might be 3D at times. From the visual effects to the simple animations of doors opening, swords swinging, and things exploding. It’s all fluid and satisfying to see. Although the cover art and concept art for the game is relatively minimalistic, in-game everything is fairly detailed, considering it’s all pixel art. The character feels alive and never feels odd to move or strike with. The atmosphere and ambience that the game’s visuals manifest is enough to immerse you into playing it for hours on end.\n\n\nSound:Sound in this game is what makes it all work. Combat sounds, environmental sounds, and character speech sounds, they’re all great, but the sound that makes it all come together is the music. It’s not very surprising that the soundtrack is so good, since the composer is Disasterpeace, the same guy who made the soundtrack for Fez. The 16-bit style music is a nostalgic trip to the SNES and is what completes the immersive experience of playing the game. The image-based narrative goes side by side with the soundtrack, making all extremely cohesive.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:To be entirely honest, I didn’t expect much about this game except that it had Dark Souls-esque gameplay and a nostalgic aesthetic... until I started playing it. When I did, it quickly took me back to my childhood experiences of playing games like The Legend of Zelda, I must have put in close to four hours in my first session, I simply could not put the controller down. The story drew me in, the gameplay satisfied and challenged me, and I’ve enjoyed every minute. When I finished it I was surprised to see the credits go on for so long, Heart Machine aside, this was a fairly big production for an indie game. The special thanks section has some interesting names in it. I can’t help but have full respect for Heart Machine in reaching out to different people, funding their game with kickstarter, and delivering a truly special product. This game is very special.","May 2","true","15.2"," 49 of 49 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","49","49","0","5"

This game is great. Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an "Indie" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title.

Fighting bosses will feel like a read duel, where every hard hit will count for both sides with devastating effects; bravery and skill are well rewarded,despite the weird controls, meaning that if you don't need to "git gud" at the game, you can atually wreck even the advanced bosses with few well placed hits/shots.\n4- collecting secrets and currencies needed to upgrade your equipment never feels boring as the hidden areas, even if well hidden sometimes, are fun to be explored and admired when finally discovered and reached\n5- the map is really,really big, full of remarkable (secret) locations, landscapes,dungeons and a main village with houses and available shops as well\n6- the game is challenging and extremely hard at times, giving high satisfaction when the player is finally able to grasp and then master all the combat and movement mechanics\n7- Movement and combat upgrades are creative,satisfying and beautiful, despite the horrendous framerate\n\nBAD ONES:\n1- HL Drifter is plagued by an unstable 30 fps lock, meaning that during intense boss fights or hard arena-like rooms your framerate will drop to 10-12 fps, causing you to take damage or even worse,dying and repeating the whole level/dungeon section even when it's not your own fault. This problem becomes extremely important on New Game + mode, where you basically die with one single hit; the game itself is really hard and in New Game + HLD becomes the bad clone of Titan Souls, but with a halved framerate and with shoddy controls.\nExample: one of the most important weapons in the game will take effect only 2-3 seconds after you've pushed its command button. Imagine playing CSGO with a 2 seconds input delay. Have fun losing.\n2- The game map is nonsensical and useless. I'll quote Dr.Manhattan from Watchmen here: "I would only agree that a symbolic clock is as nourishing to the intellect as a photo of oxygen to a drowning man."\nHow can i describe this map? Imagine to get lost in a cave below a city, now you'll have to find your way back home by using the metropolitan city map. Unless you have good memory, you might get lost and confused.\n3- HLD uses almost the same narrative system adopted by Teslagrad, meaning that the story is showed by small cutscenes and obscure, wordless comic balloons. HLD...fails miserably in mimicking Teslagrad; the real story and the rhunes' alphabet were deciphered by a clever and passionated Steam user and the lore was explained by some cool Reddit's posts. The game itself doesn't do NOTHING to be clear or less cryptic! Even collecting and reading all the  monument stones  will not reveal ANYTHING to you,at all!\n4- Weapons' upgrades are extremely superficial, allowing you to improve only their magazine size. Some weapons are useless and obsolete from the exact moment you've picked them, making the game and combats less varied. They suffer the same fate of the PP-Bizon in CSGO competitive matches, meaning that that weapon is useful in few situations and only in a precise part of the match, making it pointless for the following matches.\n\nTO SUM UP:\nHyper Light Drifter is a gorgeous looking 2D game, plagued by a poor narration, sometimes wacky controls and awful framerate locked at 30 fps, often unstable. If you're going to buy it remember that playing it without collecting any item or completing any secret area will give you for 20$ a 5-hour long videogame.","May 22","true","35.4"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","39","43","3","4"

You die to a boss and you respawn immediately before the fight able to try again within moments. Bed of Chaos from Dark Souls 1 made you walk one minute across a pool of lava before you could re-fight him.\n\nI had to take a pause in the game to soak in the beautifully crafted environments. This game didn't need to look so damn good but it decided to look ultra F-I-N-E anway.The colors pop vibrantly like the neon 80's. Music is a little bland and forgettable though.\n\nThe game doesn't do any handholding so here are some important tips that will save you some trouble.\n\n1) The levels are all about the same difficulty. You can do them in any order.\n2) Tackle the East first, that boss is the easiest and your reward is a very high dps weapon\n3) Purchase the triple dash before you head North. You'll want it for both the level and the boss.\n4) The boss in the west is the hardest by far\n5) The dash attack item is useless--the input is only one frame long so it never comes out.","April 1","true","9.0"," 64 of 86 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","64","86","0","6"

It requires a level of mastery and reflex that isn't really like any other top-down adventure game I've played.  Makes successful combat very satisfying and makes you want more.\n\n-Lumping this in with other pixel style games is unfair.  I personally hate pixel art games.  This game is dazzling.  Beautiful art design that is more stylized; it doesn't use pixel art as a compromise for poor art-design or limited resources.  It elevates the style to a new level, and I doubt many who use the style will be able to answer.\n\n-The Legend of Zelda influence is there, and it's compelling.  The cinematic qualities aren't overbearing, but they definitely enhance the experience enough to add intrigue.\n\n$20.00 might seem like a high price, but it's more than worth it for this.

Slice, dash, shoot. You eventually get other weapons and a few new abilities, like 2 flavors of dash attacks, projectile reflection and a charge attack.   Enemies have patterns that you exploit to damage them and try not to get hurt in return. It's simple but overall fairly solid.  Bosses are extra challenging and pretty fun.  The length of the game didn't overstay its welcome, but near the end it was definitely becoming a little boring fighting normal enemies.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game looks beautiful, both in motion and in stills. The opening is probably one of the coolest openings I can remember. Each 'main' section of the game world has it's own theme both above and below ground. There's a few cool setpieces in the game for you to appreciate [A battle frozen in crystal, remains of a titan, etc] , sometimes little details too.  I wish there were more of these honestly, just cool places to explore and appreciate, to try and put the story together, as oftentimes areas within the same zone kind of just blend together.\n\nMusic:\n\nThe game's music is very low key for the most part, ambient electronica. While on paper that sounds boring, in game it's used to great effect, with special musical cues during cinematic scenes or exploring an important area.\n\n-Questionable-:\n\nThe story:\nAside from the monoliths, which are in their own language, there's no written text or dialogue in the game. That would be fine, but there's a real minimal amount of 'picture dialogue' in game. It's all very nice, I just wish there was more of it.  Most of the story is derived from conjecture. There's no real character growth, either from the player or the NPCs, even as the world changes.\n\n\n\n-The bad-:\n\nMechanics:\nI never got good at chain dashing. Maybe that's a personal thing, but it probably isn't helped by the 30fps max that a fast paced pixel art game shouldn't be running at.  You also get a shield dash, which seems to only work about 3/4's of the time.  That's probably also my fault, I think it has weird vulnerabilities on startup and end.  Weapons don't really feel balanced. The pistol is worthless compared to every other weapon (except against those 1 HP birdmen) and the homing shard launcher is also a little underwhelming. The lasergun is too situational.\n\n\nSecrets:\nThey're terrible. They're a chore. They're poorly implemented.\n\n\nThey usually come in a few varieties. Invisible hallways, some of which have the BAREST of visual cues, a few that almost have zero, and about 3 that actually have reasonable hints. The worst part about these is that they're not consistent, having you end up just wallhugging the entire game. It really brings the entire experience down.\n\nThere's also hidden platforms. These are probably the worst. In some locations if you stand on an exact player sized area, your drone will make a little ping and you can activate it to reveal some platforms that you can dash on to. These kinds of secrets are absolutely terrible.  A few of them have the absolute slightest of hints (a hole in a fence of a walled platform), but even then finding these kinds of secrets is more of a chore when it should be exhileration.\n\nThere's also a few secrets where if you dash to one platform your normally locked camera will be moved to see a new area. I found most of these by myself, but they still were unintuative.\n\nThe worst hidden area I can remember is in the southern sector of the game, where you have to make a blind dash towards off screen to get on another platform.\n\nOther:\n\nThere's also the map. It's very general, and for the most part, won't really be a help to anyone, aside from when you're looking at a guide to find where you missed secrets.  The game doesn't really have any puzzles.  I felt this to be a little wierd for a game that cited link to the past as a main influence. I wish the game had less obtuse hiding locations and more challenges for items.\n\n\nReplayability:\nThe game stayed fun all the way through, but I didn't find any joy at going through it again, even with the alternate drifter or the 2 HP NG+ mode, which I realized in advance I probably wasn't good enough for, at least not without a lot of redoing.  The game just doesn't really offer enough ways to play differently, or an exciting story to experience again\n\n\n\n\n\n-  Overall - :  Good for one playthrough for most players, only those looking for an abstract kind of suffering will replay on NG+  At it's price of 20bux, it's reasonable.\n\ntl;dr\n\nHyper Light Drifter wants to be Link to the Past:Prepare to Die Edition with super metroid exploring, but ends up being Metroid II: Indie Edition.","April 14","true","16.4"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","35","41","4","0"

Which is why it was so glorious when his health bar hit zero, and my drifter did his victory dance. Those who would complain of difficult boss fights in games, well, this game has them.

There are a number of upgrades affecting your sword, your guns, your movement, your health packs, and grenades. I'm about 23% through the game, based on what I've collected so far, and I can say at this point that it really doesn't matter what I picked up, except for maybe multi-dash/projectile reflection. Of the two boss fights I've done, they've seemed to be the most useful skills to have. I'd wager neither are necessary.\n\nThe game is devoid of text, and there's no voice acting. Everything you discover, you do so through images that present events, and visuals that explain your purpose, etc. Talking to people consists of seeing a few images that make up their story, and in many cases, a symbol is added to your map. You're on your own to divine what everything means. Exploration of the world helps in this regard, as the atmosphere provides you context for the world you're in.\n\nBonus points for that skeleton giant on the mountainside in the north. Seeing it in the background, and then actually encountering that area proper screamed Dark Souls.\n\nEach enemy has a differing amount of life, and a different moveset. If you're impatient, you'll quickly find your Navi-like sprite shouting at you to heal. Once you've run the gamut against a few of the same type of enemies, you'll no longer find yourself in this situation, instead dispatching groups of shuriken-throwing ninjas with untenable grace. I suggest picking up the sword-projectile deflection as soon as possible, as your ability to deflect can transform a pain-staking ambush into a slaughterhouse ballet.\n\nBosses require a Dark Soulsesque amount of patience. Learning their moves, learning where you'll be safe, when you can attack using your different weapons, and again, maintaining safety, are your priorities. It can get frustrating, but I wouldn't call it twitch-style play. There's a certain amount of a grace period with regards to timing, at least as far as I've made it. You can set yourself up with quite a few potions with relative ease, allowing a greater grace for mistakes. Dying resets you to the closest checkpoint, which usually occur when you swap screens. Occasionally, you'll encouter ambush-style encounters where you can't escape until you clear the field, usually ending in a checkpoint. If you die in an area without hitting a checkpoint, all upgrades gained and enemies killed will respawn. Most enemies in an area do not respawn once dispatched.\n\nHealth packs respawn, so you can properly prepare for boss fights, as well as exploring new areas.\n\nOne of the few things I haven't yet mentioned is the ability to unlock "magenta triangles" for each of the areas you go to. I've yet to realize their significance in the context of lore. They're used to unlock specific doors in each of the 4 areas. Specifically, each area has its' own pieces, which you'll collect as you explore, allowing access for further exploration.\n\nFinally, there are a number of locked doors, labelled with a key symbol, which I've yet to unlock. Mysterious.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to stop writing and continue playing. I have the urge to see another gorgeous vista. Plus, there're some water-submerged ruins that need picking through with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nAdieu.","April 2","true","10.6"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","34","44","3","2"

It feels like an amalgam of my own past, escaping into 8-bit NES and titles like Blaster Master and Guardian Legend and Crystalis, although it's not a direct reference to any of those games... But it's like that, especially if you grew up playing 8- and 16-bit video games developed in Japan... Somehow mixed in all this is the DNA of visionary anime like Nausicaa and other fare.\n\nIt feels like a conversation held in the chiptune pixelated language of an entire era and aesthetic. Something somber about it all, too, a bit gothic perhaps.  The game invites profound awe and introspection just one layer below the action with every sprite, background, and audio track.\n\nHyper Light Drifter seems to come from the heart, and stands loudly proclaiming the artform of gaming lives on even as the world, wonder, and hope of our childhoods fade and are replaced with something more knowing, more appreciative of the fleeting good, and more weary of all in the world that erodes it.   It's especially poignant today; evocative of a cultural era that seems to be slipping through our fingers as the Japan of a generation or two ago that reached such stunning artistic heights in anime and digital media perhaps begins to fade.\n\nI'm still relatively early in the game, but would enthusiasticly recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep, quiet, beautiful exploration, tremendous atmosphere, exceptional music, and a bit of legitimately challenging twitch gameplay. :)","April 22","true","19.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

You control the drifter and set out to help a town out by ridding surrounding areas from all kinds of baddies. You're armed with your sword and your trusty side-arm, you traverse the lands by using your abilities. This is Hyper Light Drifter.\n\nLet us begin. Although there's no direct dialogue in Hyper Light Drifter, there are pictures that pop up when you meet the friendly npc's you come across that give you an idea of what's happening. You pretty much have to piece the story together from these images. The same with goes for the upgrade shops, you must use pictures to know how much a new item costs and what it does.\n\nThe game features an open world which the player must explore thoroughly in order to complete the game. The world is full of life and death. It's cute and charming yet ominous. It's lively yet has some sense of emptiness and dispair to it. The levels have lower levels which is where you gain keys you will use to unlock other areas and eventually battle the boss of that area.\n\nCombat is inspired by Dark Souls, it's simple but very effective. It's all aboutthe player being able to memorize the enemies paatterns and acting accordingly. Attack, dodge, and attack again. If you've ever played a Dark Souls game or another game inspired by Dark Souls (countless games out there now) then you should know the drill.\n\nPros  Very cool pixel art-style, great use of color makes the game pop\nMysterious and lonely feeling as you explore the world around you\nTranquil soundtrack\nFull controller support\nCons  Locked at 30fps\nNo dialogue to clearly tell players what's going on\nCan't set your own resolution, game uses automatically uses your desktop resolution\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe game started off very strong for me, howerver delving deeper into the game, the world managed to stay consistent in keeping my interest from start to finish. The game was worth the wait to fully experience what the game had to offer. A great alternative to games of the same vain if you need something different.\n\nRating (8.3 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","April 4","true","2.7"," 61 of 100 people (61%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","61","61","100","9","17"

Everything about this game is great, from the music to the art style and overall gameplay. I love how it looks like a simple adventure indie game but at the same time I love how challenging and difficult it is behind all the prettiness that is this game. You cant necessarily improve your character based on just leveling up only, I like that while there are a few upgrades and perks from outfit combos, it's mostly you learning how to improve on your movements and utilizing what you've learned to defeat different enemies. At first it's confusing as you don't really know where to go. There isn't any dialogue at all besides a few figures shown to by certain characters. You choose where to start, either north south east or west and just follow the path and see where it takes you. At first I didn't like that there wasn't a guide as to where to start, but really that's what makes this game so special. It's an unknown world and you immerse yourself in it. Once you explore after a few hours you'll start to get the hang of it. The bosses are amazing, the enemies are unique too. And besides all that there are so many hidden secrets and items to collect from outfits to gear bits. You don't necessarily need to collect everything to progress in the game, but if you're like me you want to 100% it and collect everything. And if the game isn't hard enough for you as it is you can try it on NG+ mode and make your life a whole lot more complicated.\n\nMy only complaints about this game is on collecting items, it was a pain to collect all 186 gearbits and having no idea where to look for the ones I've missed. The game gives you hints as to there being secrets nearby I suggest you look for those once you start the game so you don't realize halfway like me and go through everything again and recheck every corner. (They look like small little squares on the ground)\n\nAnother thing is I highly recommend playing this with a controller. You need to be fast in this game and moving around fast and precisely is pretty hard with a keyboard and mouse. It's much more enjoyable with a controller.\n\nLastly if you liked super brothers sword and sorcery you'll LOVE this.

Definitely, though be warned about bugs.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is an action-adventure RPG game in the vein of titles such as The Legend of Zelda and Diablo. Dropped into a world with hardly a clue of what is happening, you must travel to the four corners of the world (literally) and search for treasures scattered about to discover your destiny.\n\nWhile it's not the largest game world out there, HLD's world has plenty of atmosphere, character, and beauty. It is also littered with many different items, such as Gearbits and customization options for the Drifter, which inspires a bit of poking through every nook and cranny. The other half of HLD, the combat, is the main show. You can pull off different combos and strikes with the Drifter's Hard Light sword, which in turn charges your side arms (such as pistols and shotguns). The Drifter himself is also very nimble and can dash into and out of the fray.\n\nHowever there are some things that don't work too well, as with many things. One issue is the existence of various bugs, primarily for me have been random holes in the ground that are not noticable until walked into. The Drifter often does a hunched animation when near a ledge, and oftentimes I'll see it happen while walking on solid ground for no reason at all, then plummet into nothing and lose HP. Also for a game that has many hidden rooms in walls, it's frustrating to find holes in the ground that probably shouldn't be around at all. Another type of bug was one that blocked progress on a certain boss, requiring me to beat it 2 more times before being done with it.\n\nAs for the aforementioned plethora of collectables, it almost feels like a chore to find them all, especially with the confusing map system. While the map does have a "underground" linked rooms map, I find myself forgetting what important doors are where and end up wandering around the map for a while (though I guess that's the point of the game, to "drift" about). For the last few points I have, sometimes mechanics just don't work right and get frustrating, primarily dashing. Dashing requires a certain rhythm to continuously use and sometimes the game loves to just drop it, or not do it at all, making the "platforming" segments, even fights, a nightmare sometimes. And the music, while eerily relaxing and atmosphere-setting, sometimes gets WAY too loud during the various sight-seeing moments of the game.\n\nOverall, not a terrible game, though I'll have to come back at a later date to find everything, and when they release DLC. I recommend it, but maybe wait a little while for bugs and such to get sorted out?","April 2","true","15.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

A faint summer breeze blushes against your cheek, then dies. Holding tight to your blade, you make your way though a magenta forest. The metalic taste of blood in your moulth reminds you that you don't have much time left.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a post apocalyptic tribute to classical Zelda games. You are a crimson traveler seeking a profaned crystal in hope of finding a cure for your illness. That is all I can tell about the story, not because I'm afraid of spoiling, but because it's fairly difficult to figure it out myself.\n\nMost of the story is told though the enviorment. Between the combat rooms, you travel though graveyards and laboratories, unraveling why the world came to what it is now. Impressive pixel art combined with an immersive ambience create a very strong atmosphere. So, even if you won't understand what you have played, you may still have a jolly fun experience.\n\nNow, the combat. The combat is generally quite simplistic and consists out of dashing, hacking away and occasionally using projectiles. Most of the challange comes from being forced to manage large groups of enemies. In a way, you can classify it as a bullet hell. The dash plays a key role in the game, as you are given a few moment of invincibility each time you use it. So, most of the time in the arena one will spend as a pink blur circuling around the room. The difficulty demands quick reaction times, up until you get the upgrades.\n\nTwo extra medkits, a shotgun and the abulity that allows you to deflect bullets back at the enemy have a tendency to make most encounters anticlimactic.\n\nAfter completing the game, you will probably realize that you've missed about 60 percent of the content, since most of that content is quite well hidden. Everybody is expecting to find a spare upgrade part under the stair case, yet items that unlock new areas and game modes are so criptic to find, that there is no way the majority of players will uncover them without consulting a walkthough.\n\nMy first playthough lasted about 10-12 hours and held my interest quite well. If you are a fan of dungeon crawlers set in a surreal apocalypse, mind giving this one a look. If you are hesitant, try picking this one up during the next Steam sale.\n","April 24","true","12.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","3"

Its absolutely GORGEOUS.\n\nAnd the storytelling?

Not if.  When.  You will die... often.  Get used to it.

The keyboard controls are good, but the mouse aiming just doesn't quite work with the drifting mechanic, as often the direction you're indicating with the cursor will be drifted over, and so the direction of the NEXT drift is the opposite. So basically, joysticks all the way.\n\nThe actual gameplay is excellent, and there's a clear emphasis on the pacing of attacks for a hack'n'slash title. You can't simply ghost an enemy and spam them with melee attacks, as the melee attacks aren't instantaneous in their duration and therefore leave a window for you to be damaged. The pistol/gun is also limited in its ammo, and you must refill it by killing enemies. It means you can't simply spam the gun, as it won't get you through a battle alone. Gameplay wise, the drift mechanic is pretty fun. Apart from traversing gaps in the terrain, it melds well into battling enemies as a dodge mechanic. It also assists in breaking up battles with the previous discussed melee and pistol/gun attacks, and the game seemingly encourages you to alternate between them, which is reinforced by the enemy's attack patterns. Level progression is also extremely Zelda-esque, a large open world with marked objectives and certain areas to continue story progression. So there's linear story progression but in an open-world, though I don't know if this will split into multiple story missions at this point (though it could). The possibility of some degree of non-linear story progression is only suggested to be possible as some story missions require you to travel to fetch various segments that combined will unlock the next story segment, so there's a degree of non-linearity in mission completion as is (the closest example I can think of like this is FEZ cube requirements when unlocking new sections). Additionally, the game also implements an auto-save system, so dying will result in respawning either at the beginning of the level (often occurs in dungeons), or nearby before a battle area. While autosave locations can often be annoying, or make a game overly easy, they have been well implemented in Hyper Light Drifter and strike a good balance, being useful without affecting difficulty. I say this because the game can be f*cking hard at times and no number of saves is going to help you.\n\nWhere the game stands out is its audio and visuals, Disasterpeace delivering on another stellar soundtrack that really drives home the atmosphere of the environment drawn by the phenomenal pixel art. The illustrations are beautiful, and quite frankly, I've never seen pixel art better than this in a game. There are points in the game where you can just stop and look from piece to piece of the environment, noticing the detail put into each. I especially liked the detail put into the non-combat environments such the robots(?) frozen in time, covered with moss. It very much has Studio Ghibli's "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" appeal. It's hard to top this art direction, its been implemented perfectly.\n\nIt's also worth noting the 30 fps lock. While it certainly isn't desirable, I found it to be barely noticeable even when playing with a mouse + keyboard (as framerates have an immediately noticeable impact on the responsiveness of a mouse), so again, a controller is the safe choice and the preferred option for this game.\n\nSo far, so very, very good. I need to update this review when I can play it with a controller, but so far it's very much heading towards a "must own". Its hard to find games like this with such distinctive art direction and executed with such finesse, and actually giving back to the supporters instead of cr@pping on them with microtransactions etc.","March 31","true","14.0"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","26","44","0","0"

As of this writing I'm about 1/4 to 1/3 the way through.\n\nFlat out this game has a fairly high difficulty, exactly where I like it. Battles take much strategy and fairly twitchy reflexes, as well as old-fasioned pattern-learning that made the old games so satisfying to defeat. Be careful what you spend your currency on. I made a poor first choice, then had to learn to use the chosen ability tactically in order to get by the difficult encounters which followed.\n\nMuch to explore, and a whole worlds worth of lore to uncover through scenery, subtle hints, and vague yet amazing picture-based story. The soundtrack is moody, atmospheric, and context based, with layers being added and removed to suit the scene. Way to go Disasterpiece.\n\nSo far this is the best [released] kickstarter game that I was involved in funding.

But this game made a difference. In my opinion, Hyper Light Drifter is a game that you have to try out and make your own idea for the game, but here are the basic reasons of why I loved it so much.\nFirst of all, the creator of the game had this great idea of using pixels in this specific way. This makes it extremely realistic, something that I didn't expect from it. Moreover, almost every soundtrack in the game is catchy and related with the boss or region the character is located. Last but not least, I personally found it interesting to find secrets in the game, once it is really rewarding and it doesn't make it boring.\nBut enough for the pros, let's have a look at the cons. Firstly, there are a couple of glitches that are in the game, but they still don't ruin it and I am sure they will fix it in a couple of days. Secondly, the price is a really big problem, because I don't think that it worths 20 euros. I can't say, it's a really nice game, but a lower price would make it even better. In other words, if there will be any offer of this game, don't hesitate to buy it, or at least try it out and see how it goes.\nAll in all, it's a really nice game but I recommend you to buy it when it will be on an offer and once it will take a while, I think that the glitches will be fixed, too.","April 18","true","28.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you're wrong, you're punished. The game is unforgiving. Is that an enemy who can hurt me or is it an NPC, or a squirrel-deer? You're going to find out and you're given no warning.

The game is gorgeous with fairly large areas and everything is just bursting with color. The soundtrack is extremely good and if you've played Fez, it's by the same guy and has a similar aesthetic (though i will say the town hub's song is a bit too fez like, to the point of copying IMO). Also, besides a few "press button to do this" tutorial messages in the begining (theres like 5 like how to shoot your gun or dash) that's been it for words. Just pictures which, also, look gorgeous. So there's a lot of enviornmental and "figure it out for yourself" story telling.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/facialist/recommended/257850/","facialist","kinggimped","http://steamcommunity.com/id/facialist/","387 products in account","Been waiting with bated breath a couple of years for this game to drop. Every delay to the release has been greeted with a groan. Since yesterday's release I've only been able to play about 3 hours, but here's my experience of Hyper Light Drifter so far.\n\nFor starters, there is no hand holding. No tutorial. I can count on one hand the number of times text has appeared on the screen during the actual game. Everything is learned by the player through well-crafted level design, first forcing you to learn a mechanic in order to proceed, then gradually training you on the different situational uses of that mechanic until it becomes second nature. This creates a satisfying sense that you have learned something organically rather than simply being told how to do it. Mechanics are simple and easy to pick up, but challenging to use very effectively. Best of all, combat feels just as tidy and stylish as it looks.\n\nThe pixel art style is truly beautiful if you like that kind of thing. The levels are detailed and gorgeous with lots of little hidden pathways and small details. You're almost always rewarded for exploring and experimenting with combining your abilities with the level elements. The game leaves it entirely up to you where to go - there's no objective marker to follow. It starts you out at a crossroads and lets you dictate which direction you want to start exploring the world.\n\nAnimations are simple enough to fit the art style, but intricate enough that they immediately communicate what they're trying to communicate. The cut-scenes are remeniscent of the classic *Another World* / *Flashback* games from the 90s.\n\nAs much as the art is stylistically pretty, it is also extremely varied. There is very little in the way of copy-pasting when it comes to the level design. Every map feels individually crafted, every part of the world has a different feel. The ruins of the world you explore feel vast but deserted and creepy; caverns and other underground parts are suitably claustrophobic and atmospheric. It's amazing how such a simplistic art style is able to create such strong and varied atmospheres.\n\nThe combat is challenging to the point of punishing, but incredibly satisfying due to the incredibly tight controls. If you die, it's almost always your fault, and there's almost always something you can take from it. Enemy AI is varied but surprisingly smart - enemies will dodge and flank you, and you have to be precise with your movements. Mashing the sword button will certainly not automatically win engagements.\n\nYou will die a lot. If you don't like punishing games and would rather romp through a story without being challenged at all, this really is not a game for you. At all.\n\nThe checkpoint and fast travel systems are very well implemented. You barely notice they're there.\n\nThe music and overall sound design is incredible and one of my favourite features of the game so far. If you've been watching any of the trailers or know of Disasterpeace's work then you know what to expect - dark, atmospheric chiptune-esque beats that ebb and flow with the on-screen action. SFX are crisp and fit the game's style perfectly.\n\nOverall, I'm very much enjoying my experience so far with Hyper Light Drifter, and can't wait for work to be over so I can dive back in to the world.\n\nMy only criticism so far is minor: the game seems to be capped at 30fps. Nowadays it feels less smooth and satisfying than the 60fps I'm used to in most games, but particularly for a game with this kind of old-school pixel art style. While it hasn't hampered my enjoyment of the game itself it still seemed a strange limitation.","March 31","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, the bosses can be a bit tough and in a less fair way it seems than bosses in Dark Souls. But if you've got patience from playing FromSoft's games (and their ilk), you'll easily have the skills to beat this game.\nThe best bit about it is the atmosphere and exploration. The visuals are lush and gorgeous and really help to draw you into the world Heart Machine have created. The music by Disasterpeace is very similar to Fez's soundtrack, but still lush and entrancing.

I have never in my life, AAA games included ever been so absolutley stunned by the graphics of a game. This is one of if not the most atmospheric game I have ever played, the soundtrack, SFX and visuals come together to make one of the most perfectly beautiful things i have ever seen. Even if the gameplay was terrible i'd recommend this game just for the experience. However, i don't have to recommend it on the presentation alone because the gameplay is FANTASTIC. The three combat mechanics I've seen so far are all wonderful, and blend together perfectly. As of right now i have a gun, a sword, and a dash. The gun is filled via successful hits on enemies/breaking random containers in the world, which makes it fit well in combat as it gives you a powerful and satisfying ranged option whilst never invalidating the sword. The dash flows well in both explorative gameplay and combat, and is exactly the kind of ability that fits the weapons you're given in this game. This game is also difficult, with healing items seeming uncommon and enemies dealing large portions of your health in a single hit. This being said, the game never feels impossible or unfair. This will be, no doubt, my Indie GOTY 2016. I only have two issues with it so far, and both are very minor. The first issue is that you can easily click outside the fullscreen window, and because i have a second monitor i end up going too far right with my mouse sometimes, causing the game to tab out. However, after an hour of gameplay i've taught myself to just not do that and it's almost a nonissue at this point. [[THIS WAS PATCHED DAY 1]The second issue i have with this game is that the death/respawing animation seems to drag on, and (possibly because i'm trash) i die a lot in this game, and sitting there waiting really breaks this game's wonderful combat flow.] However, these two small issues overall don't detract from the gaming magnum opus that is: Hyper Light Drifter.\n\nTL;DR version\n\nGame is really pretty, the combat flows like a river, and issues are minimal.\n\n9/10","March 31","true","6.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Definitely feels like it has a Souls games influence in it. Most areas you will not be able to just button mash your way through. I died a few times before realizing that you really have to pay attention, every hit matters. The checkpoints are pretty generous which is nice, but health packs are fairly scarce (depending on how well you play). I seem to play just well enough to only have about 1 healthpack in reserve usually, so in my opinion it doesn't give you too much or too little, its a good balance and it makes you want to improve. There are plenty of little hidden areas if you pay attention, which give you upgrade materials as an exploratory bonus. The level design feels tight and connected.

This game is beautiful. It's art direction, pixel graphics, music and storytelling are all top notch. NPCs relay stories through pictures, gorgeous pictures. Basically, "Some bad stuff went down in our Animal Crossing Village, and lots of people are dead." You have to head in one of four directions to find out what is going on. There are a few minor bugs so far, but nothing distracting from the awesomeness. The only downside is the controls are definitely geared toward controller play (This is mentioned in the opening screens). Without the controller I get frantic and my mouse flies all over the place, which is bad since dash, slash and shoot go toward the mouse pointer, not the direction you are moving/facing. It's sooo sweet I will probably buy a controller just to enjoy it more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abamita/recommended/257850/","abamita","Abamita","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abamita/","4 products in account","I am enjoying the game a lot. My biggest problems are with the dashing mechanic. Although I can use it proficiently, I still have three issues. The first is that, even when only brushing up against an object, the player gets knocked onto the ground. Considering how much clutter there is in the game, this is too unforgiving and deters use of the dash. Dashing feels much better when fighting a boss, because there is enough space to use it without hitting objects. There are no invincibility frames when dashing, so I don't think allowing slight collisions to slide would make dashing too safe.\n\nThe second problem involves the small cooldown timer when a dash finishes. Every time either a chain dash or a single dash is ended, intentionally or otherwise, it is momentarily impossible to dash. When the next dash is allowed to begin, however, it is actually made impossible to chain. It takes an additional second before another chain can start instead of a single, solitary dash. I think it would be preferable if the developers had made the earliest dash chainable and increased the initial wait time after the first chain ends. It's unsatisfying and frustrating to try to start another chain without knowing that it is actually impossible to do so.\n\nThe third problem is that, if a player performs a chain dash of over three dashes, they will slide along the ground uncontrollably when it ends. What this means is that a player will be punished for being exceptionally competent at dashing in combat. Sliding can send the player into pits or directly into enemy fire. If the developers had given the player some element of control during the slide, or if the slide took less time, it might have worked a lot better.\n\nThe music is a lot weaker than I had expected. Almost all of it is ambient and totally forgettable, whereas the trailer music was a great pleasure to listen to. There is nothing inherently wrong with the individual tracks, but they do not aid in forming the hills and valleys of the game's arc. The music is especially underwhelming during fights with the reprehensible cast of bosses, who deserved fearsome and energetic music to match their characterization. The music is written as though it always wants to stay out of the player's way, and it unfortunately succeeded. I had expected the music to be one of my favorite parts of the game, but that wasn't the case.\n\nTechnically, the game is unimpressive. There are a number of small bugs, although the debilitating ones are quickly getting patched out. The camera does not follow the player closely enough for the speeds the game allows them to reach, occasionally opting to observe a completely empty room. The camera is also positioned in such a way that many damaging falls are simply impossible to see due to the foreground. I am unsure why these ledges were not made into boundaries. I did not expect a perfectly programmed game from such a small team. All of the technical problems are forgiveable with the exception of the keyboard controls. The keyboard controls turn the game into a fight against the mouse, and I want to emphasize that if this game launched without controller support, I probably wouldn't recommend playing it. In their current state, the developers had an obligation to let players know that the keyboard controls are far inferior to a gamepad's, but I don't think that was made clear. Don't play the game on a keyboard.\n\nThose are my main gripes. I'm being critical, but this is one of my favorite games to come out of a small development team. The gameplay is slick and rewarding once players learn how to move fluidly, allowing them to smartly chip away at the enemy horde. At least half of the game's content is in the form of secret areas, meaning that players will discover the game rather than having it shown to them. This works in the game's favor, because it is a game you will want to explore. The pixel art is gorgeous and dreamy, and I've caught myself ceasing play a number of times to gaze at a background or watch the movements of one of the townsfolk. The unique design choice to remove almost all written language pushes the player to explore the foreign world even more. All of the ideas, stories, and item uses are easy to grasp thanks to clever imagery and are presented more effectively and emotionally than they might have been otherwise. The sound design also deserves a mention in this regard. The gutteral sounds made by the inhabitants of the world are always interesting, and the harsh electronic noises that the Drifter creates give a great sense of weight to all of his actions.\n\nAlthough a lot of people have been choosing to focus on the difficulty of the game, it is actually set very reasonably. Any young person with healthy reflexes should be able to beat the game with a good effort. If you have a history with action games, you will be able to finish this one. I personally wish the bosses had put up a better fight, since some of them came close to dying the first time we met. If the dash mechanics were a bit tighter, I'm sure every enemy encounter could have been made more intimidating without added frustration. Despite some visible seams, Hyper Light Drifter is undoubtedly a great game and experience.","April 7","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hyper Light Drifter is such a game and boy, was the surprise nice, when I suddenly received this Steam key out of the seeming blue.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a wonderful experience that combines calm exploration with beautiful visuals and a soothing soundtrack with punishingly hard fights. It's never too hard, however; the game just lets you progress naturally, in a Dark Souls-esque way. (I've never played much of any Dark Souls title, sadly, but after this game, I strongly want to, again.)\n\nThe game rewards curiosity and persistence just as much as it punishes greed and rush, you want to carefully explore the world to not die and lose your progress since the last save. The game isn't perfect tho; while hard, sometimes the checkpoints are mostly set between map transitions, sometimes in such a way that you can easily exploit their placement. Especially when you don't want to repeat the arbitrary collecting action after eery respawn, you just collect after respawning, leave the area, enter again and then you don't have to do so again - that feels a bit counter intuitive to me.\n\nOtherweise I can't think of many other negative aspects in HLD. A few things, that positively stuck out, in my opinion, were the almost total lack of text in the game. Except for the HUD and very brief control explanations, all written and spoken language is abandoned, so the game focuses on visual storytelling instead. Also, Disasterpiece did a great job at the music composition once again and its implementation is superb. The music and sound design do their part on the non verbal storytelling and it shows.\n\nI don't have much more to say right now, except that this game deserves more attention. I am sure more people would (and hopefully will) enjoy this masterpiece but I kind of expect it to become an insider tip.\n\nHighly recommended.","April 6","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as a character with access to a sword, various guns, and a dash. Combat consists of fighting off swarms of enemies with different attack patterns that require learning. With only five points of health and limited full heal kits, surviving takes limiting the hits you let yourself take and the timing/usage of your scarce healing.\n\nThe actual game world is a huge overworld interspersed with dungeons, secret locations, and beautiful, screenshot worthy resting places free of the combat's franticness, that just deserve a moment to take in. The world can be easily navigated physically through dashing to cross the many chasms and visually through the understandable map that shows both the surface and underground layers. There is a central city where you can upgrade your gear with the game world's currency. Surrounding this are the four major zones, which for the most part can be tackled in any order. Each zone has a different theme and different enemies to master. Each zone also has a major boss fight. Some may take a few deaths to fully master the pattern, but they are all very fair despite the challenge.\n\nThe game is a blast to play. Combat becomes a rhythmic mixup of swordplay and gun sniping as you work down large groups of enemies. There are a variety of collectables hidden throughout the game in many of the secret locations (hidden walls, out of the way platforms, etc). I've read complaints that wall hugging is needed at many points to find collectables, but the game does a very good job of subtly showing the locations of hidden places, either by having well placed visual indicators or by showing a peek at the location when you stand in certain spots. You know an area that you can't immediately access is there, so you'll be compelled to find the route to it. The game takes about ten hours or less to complete the main story based on my first playthrough of it. Yet, there is still more to do as I've yet to collect everything or start the game's new game plus mode.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. I've had a few bugs and a few crashes, but the developers have been working since launch with updates to smooth them out. The game has a great feel. Combat is fair, but it's still difficult and requires learning. Nothing beats the feeling of beating a particularly hard mob, and being rewarded with the silent protagonist mirroring your feeling of triumph by victoriously throwing his sword into the ground. It's great, it's fun, and it doesn't require a whole lot of time if you just want to beat it and move on. Go with this game if you like the genre and art of a 2D pixel game with challenging combat, and more importantly a lot of heart.","April 2","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game's combat and special moves resemble Devil May Cry with gun-sword combat, deflecting projectiles, perfect-timed swings and platforming, the game also borrows a lot from Bastion’s top down game mechanics.\n\nThe pacing and level design of the game resemble more closely to a Zelda type game, with freedom to go to three available directions; East, North and West. In my playthrough I started with the North. At the North I learn hints of the backstory and lore through its environments and pictograms-dialog from engaging with the NPC. Talking about environments, there are secrets, hidden switches and hidden rooms everywhere, I once also found a hidden switch that lead to a hidden room with more hidden rooms. Which leads mean to say “Way too much wall hugging” thankfully there are community guides if you so wish to use them.\n\nIn conclusion, Hyper Light Drifter is blend of multiple great games, but does not simply just copy, but make it their own unique design and style.

The game is difficult, but fair and, like Dark Souls, the story is never handed to you and if you want to know whats going on youre going to have to explore a lot. The game also has a total of four dungeons, that can be beaten in any order, well except for the South dungeon. The combat animations are fluid and the mixture of Sword and gun combat is quite satisfying. It is also very dash heavy as it is the only way to avoid enemy attacks. All upgrades can be purchased in any order from the start of the game, but the currency is somewhat scarce and hard to find so pick your upgrades wisely. The games lenghth is around 8 to 10 on your first play through and there are new game plus options for those completionists out there. The only cons I could think of is that there are no words said or spoken by any characters in the game, thus leaving you confused as to what the heck is going on, but if you like that type of story then more power to you. There are also occasional bugs were the a cutscene might trigger too early. The game is also locked at 30 fps so if you cant stand that beware.I would highly recommend this game to all fans of Zelda's combat and Dark Soul's style of story telling, and despite it's minor flaws I believe the art style and combat system are well worth the price of admission.","May 12","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In terms of its story, it is subject to interpretation. Regardless of how you interpret the story, I genuinely enjoyed the game because of its controls, reactionary gameplay, and design. The only possible "complaint" I could have is that it's a bit short (4 hours of gameplay, but that's not bad for a non-AAA title) and I guess also having multiple abilities didn't really seem to make a difference for me. I wish there were more abilities or actions you could do to change up battle strategies a bit, but this is just a minor thing in my opinion.

Wow. I went into this game completely blind, being drawn in by what looked to be great visuals backed by a fantastic soundtrack all supporting tight, satisfying fight mechanics, and it delivered.\n\nDon't play it for the story, necessarily. Just know you're in an apocalyptic world battling warrior raccoons, fanatic bird zealots, cannabalistic frogs, and artificial life experiments gone wrong, all while being haunted by a mysterious shadow. If that doesn't draw you in already, I don't know what else to say.\n\nThe soundtrack and visuals are so well-done and fitting for every moment in the game. If you press the button (or key) for down, your character will actually sit down and chill. This game actually made me want to stop what I was doing and just sit once or twice, just to soak in a particularly fantastic sight, accompanied with great musical ambience.\n\nWhat I really love about this game, though, is the fight mechanics. You will die a lot figuring them out, but once you get it, you will be dashing all over the various arenas of monsters, slaying them with impunity. Reflecting projectiles and unleashing powerful charge attacks are just a few of the abilities at your disposal once you unlock them with the currency you'll find hidden throughout the map.\n\nSpeaking of which, if I had a gripe about the game, its the map. I would prefer to be able to know where I've already been, and whether I've found all the items in that area or not so that I do not have to waste too much time backtracking.\n\nAll in all, this is one of my favorite games I've played this year so far.

Top down, 2D Zelda-ish gameplay but with more emphasis on combat. I've been following the development of this game for a year or so now and I'm really happy with the finished product. Gameplay is really solid and the minimalistic nature of the art and storytelling within the game is nice too. I felt that the game was a little bit too short but it was still fun; the trailer made it seem like it was going to be bigger than just four areas/bosses. Replaying the game to find all the secrets and to get all the upgrades is pretty much the only reason I would play it again. It's a really solid game with challenging combat, but the only downside is that it's locked at 30 fps. It didn't bother me too much, but I know people who would not be happy with that.

That being said, the controls are rather intuitive (I played with a controller, so I can’t really speak for the keyboard and mouse experience), and I would advise that you don’t be afraid to experiment a bit in how you do things in order to find the best method for you. Second, advice if you do play the game: dodge, and dodge often, at least until  you get the ability to reflect bullets with your sword and/or dodge through bullet attacks without taking damage, and then it becomes dodge and reflect often .\n\n******************************************************************\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a game that’s far from easy, but not impossible either. The gameplay is very smooth and the controls are relatively easy to learn — but that doesn’t mean you’ll be  good  at everything right away. You’re thrown into a world that gives you very little and allows you to figure things out for yourself; in a sense, what you put into it is what you get out of it (particularly in terms of the story, but I’ll get to that in a bit). It’s a game that rewards you for secret-hunting, so be on the lookout for everything from secret passages to areas that you can dash to. You will die, and you’ll probably die often. And it will be frustrating at times (at least it was for me). But you’ll find yourself getting back up to try again and again until you get it, and that sense of accomplishment is oh-so-sweet once you make it.\n\n\nThe art in this game is absolutely gorgeous — the lighting is extremely well done, the colors are lovely, and I was surprised when I realized the reason everything looks so  smooth  is that the typical outline you see in pixel art is not there. The animations are extremely smooth, and even the death and resurrection animations are good (I will say I’m extremely glad they patched in the ability to speed up the resurrection animation, especially when you’re dying multiple times trying to defeat a boss). The music and sound design in general is absolutely beautiful as well, to the point where I’m still not tired of hearing it even after having a track loop for 30+ minutes straight as I try to defeat a boss.\n\nThe details in this game are extremely impressive, from the way your blood drops dissolve off the ground to the little victory sword thing your Drifter does when finishing a harder fight. The entire game progresses without a single word, everything being explained through pictures (or in the case of upgrades, little animations) and cutscenes; and yet, I feel like understood the story as well as I personally could have. The “important” characters (those that do more than make a little noise at you when you "ping" them) have their backstories told through pictures as well, and I felt oddly connected to them despite not having what would normally be considered "in-depth" information about them. Especially true for me in the case of  the other Drifter (possibly?), who’s in the same situation as you, or at least it seems that way . And I won’t lie — the ending gave me a few emotions, at least the way that I interpreted it.\n\n\nAll in all, this game is fantastic and I will definitely be playing quite a bit more of it to see what I can find and/or do. This is absolutely a game I recommend.","April 2","true","13.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/257850/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","This game has mad style. Immediately, you’ll notice the pixel art is top notch. There are gorgeous vistas to stop and take a gander at when you’re not too busy with the fast-paced combat or looking for secrets. You’ll behold a devastated world filled with remnants of the past in 4 different environments located at each of the cardinal directions (NWES). The storytelling mostly comes from interpreting images and your surroundings as the games has no dialogue. Sometimes what’s happening is obvious because a bloody corpse says it blatantly. The game also runs only at 30fps which is puzzling considering how much zipping around you’ll be doing.\n\nLook at that view:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658408701\n\nNow, the game doesn’t explain much and while that gives it an air of mystery with the story, it works against it in other parts. Do not accidentally sabotage your playthrough with poor initial upgrade purchases. Upgrades requires Gearbits and you need to find four pieces of them to make one. Making a bad upgrade purchase can cause large amounts of suffering because the combat/mobility upgrades should take priority over anything else. My recommended upgrade path is the sword projectile reflect and chain dodge first, then the dodge projectile shield. From there you can safely branch out and grab whatever upgrade you want. I foolishly grabbed an ammo upgrade before grabbing the sword projectile reflect ability which gave me some serious problems in the Eastern Zone with the ranged enemies. Don’t do what I did. Also know that you can fast travel at almost any time to an activated waypoint, so don’t be afraid to try out the other paths to find more bits.\n\nCombat isn’t about pulling off sweet 100-hit combos and increasing the score multiplier. It’s about timing, mobility, positioning, and skilled execution. You’ll find yourself frequently dodging to and from enemies as you quickly decide to attack or retreat. Dodges don’t have any invincibility frames and enemies have collision so move carefully. Your character will have access to different guns, starting with the pistol. However, the aiming mechanic is extremely clunky. You hold Left Trigger to pull out the gun, aim with the Left Stick, and then fire with the Right Trigger. Your character has to stand still during that whole process which can mean taking hits while trying to shoot. Aiming my shot by facing the enemy before squeezing the Right Trigger worked out much better, especially with the shotgun. For example, you can dodge or run towards an enemy, fire away with RT, then dodge/run away, all without bothering with the terrible aiming mechanic. Hitting with the sword and then firing right after works well too. You’ll need to watch out for enemies or hazards that can knock you down because you’re not safe on the ground. You can be killed while lying down and some bosses will knock the wind out of you.\n\nEach zone has a big bad and those bosses are all about learning patterns and using your tools. They’re not easy foes. I’ve died to all the bosses multiple times before emerging victorious. They have a set pattern and a pattern changeup once you remove enough of their health. Usually this means they’ll speed up, add another attack, or possibly summon adds (enemies). I found myself counting their attacks and looking for their tells in order to overcome them. If you pay enough attention, each attempt will bring you closer to victory as you learn their tactics and counter with your own. I really liked the final boss. The fight was a satisfying and challenging experience. I defeated it with a well-executed reflection of 8-10 projectiles at point blank range. That felt way too good. Mmm.\n\nFinally, in addition to the upgrade woes I mentioned earlier, there are other areas where this game stumbles. The map isn’t very helpful and doesn’t mark any of the collectables except for modules, things necessary for game progression though you can find bonus ones. Its rooms are displayed as basic shapes with the paths that connect them. Your player icon will not be accurately positioned to your true location. I didn’t use it much except for fast traveling and occasional path checking for making sure I’m heading down the right chain of rooms when underground.\n\nThe chain/infinite dodge never felt responsive to me and was sometimes hard to control. This issue could be related to the game running at 30fps. I am not sure. The chain dodge is the main method of traveling quickly. It’s also much faster than the normal 3 dodges at a time. The issue comes from the timing which struggles to feel consistent. Also, the more chain dodges you manage, the faster the timing becomes and those windows are very picky. Sometimes you’ll come to a dead stop if your second button press is off. Or you’ll mess up a third or fourth press which makes your character slide for a considerable amount of distance. The slide looks cool until you realize you’re going off a platform. Sometimes you’ll just slam into a wall and bounce when zipping around. I fell off platforms quite often and I had moments where my second button press left me on top of a disappearing platform instead of starting the chain. For the most part, chain dodging is manageable despite the false starts and slides. It’s also fun when you figure out the tempo, but its unreliability becomes a major problem when trying do some of the optional activities.\n\nMy last criticism is about how some of the secrets are handled in this title. In short, some of them are either tedious, frustrating, or both. One of them involves reaching a chain dodge number of 800 in the dodge shop. That’s 800 dodges in a row which is possible with the upgrade, but maybe should be avoided. I think my top score was around 60 or more. There was also this crystal room with a cosmetic reward at the end. You had to navigate a long and winding hall with 90 degree turns where the floor was mostly covered with crystal hazards by chain dodging. These crystals turn into big dangerous crystals soon after you pass over them that knock you down for 2 damage. My knocked out character would sometimes land on other crystals and succumb to a fatal crystal chain. If you manage to pass all the hazards, you’re then greeted by a room full of mobs and crystal spiders that encase you in a crystal if they touch you. You can take damage and be killed while encased and have to start from the beginning. That place showed me how flawed the chain dodge was. Or maybe that was a bad room. Throughout the game, I just wasn’t too enthusiastic about secrets unless they were hidden Gearbit pieces.\n\nOverall, the game provided me with a good experience, a memorable final boss fight, sweet tunes, and a great amount of style. The game could have been better in the areas I’ve mentioned before, especially with that map.

The combat, while so far a bit basic, is well made and you are required to watch the attack patterns of your enemies to find opening. Similar to the Dark Souls games you can heal mid fight, but you are completely vulnerable for a second while you heal. I only fought one boss so far, but the difficulty level seemed perfect. The difficulty outside of boss fights is more on the easy side, since the game hides health packs at every second corner.\n\nThe world has a beautiful design, that took some heavy inspiration from Neon Genesis Evangelion, and offers quite a bit of freedom for exploration. You are not forced into a linear path, but rather given the choice to explore whichever part of the world you want to start with. The soundtrack has the typical Disasterpeace feel that is reminiscent of FEZ and fits the game quite nicely.\n\nSo far I haven't run into any major bugs, only some animals that were stuck running into a wall and one or two walls that you could walk through that didn't seem intentional. However one major issues with the game is the lock to 30 fps. While it is perfectly playable at that framerate it would look a lot smoother in 60 fps.","March 31","true","14.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/257850/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","This game has mad style. Immediately, you’ll notice the pixel art is top notch. There are gorgeous vistas to stop and take a gander at when you’re not too busy with the fast-paced combat or looking for secrets. You’ll behold a devastated world filled with remnants of the past in 4 different environments located at each of the cardinal directions (NWES). The storytelling mostly comes from interpreting images and your surroundings as the games has no dialogue. Sometimes what’s happening is obvious because a bloody corpse says it blatantly. The game also runs only at 30fps which is puzzling considering how much zipping around you’ll be doing.\n\nLook at that view:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658408701\n\nNow, the game doesn’t explain much and while that gives it an air of mystery with the story, it works against it in other parts. Do not accidentally sabotage your playthrough with poor initial upgrade purchases. Upgrades requires Gearbits and you need to find four pieces of them to make one. Making a bad upgrade purchase can cause large amounts of suffering because the combat/mobility upgrades should take priority over anything else. My recommended upgrade path is the sword projectile reflect and chain dodge first, then the dodge projectile shield. From there you can safely branch out and grab whatever upgrade you want. I foolishly grabbed an ammo upgrade before grabbing the sword projectile reflect ability which gave me some serious problems in the Eastern Zone with the ranged enemies. Don’t do what I did. Also know that you can fast travel at almost any time to an activated waypoint, so don’t be afraid to try out the other paths to find more bits.\n\nCombat isn’t about pulling off sweet 100-hit combos and increasing the score multiplier. It’s about timing, mobility, positioning, and skilled execution. You’ll find yourself frequently dodging to and from enemies as you quickly decide to attack or retreat. Dodges don’t have any invincibility frames and enemies have collision so move carefully. Your character will have access to different guns, starting with the pistol. However, the aiming mechanic is extremely clunky. You hold Left Trigger to pull out the gun, aim with the Left Stick, and then fire with the Right Trigger. Your character has to stand still during that whole process which can mean taking hits while trying to shoot. Aiming my shot by facing the enemy before squeezing the Right Trigger worked out much better, especially with the shotgun. For example, you can dodge or run towards an enemy, fire away with RT, then dodge/run away, all without bothering with the terrible aiming mechanic. Hitting with the sword and then firing right after works well too. You’ll need to watch out for enemies or hazards that can knock you down because you’re not safe on the ground. You can be killed while lying down and some bosses will knock the wind out of you.\n\nEach zone has a big bad and those bosses are all about learning patterns and using your tools. They’re not easy foes. I’ve died to all the bosses multiple times before emerging victorious. They have a set pattern and a pattern changeup once you remove enough of their health. Usually this means they’ll speed up, add another attack, or possibly summon adds (enemies). I found myself counting their attacks and looking for their tells in order to overcome them. If you pay enough attention, each attempt will bring you closer to victory as you learn their tactics and counter with your own. I really liked the final boss. The fight was a satisfying and challenging experience. I defeated it with a well-executed reflection of 8-10 projectiles at point blank range. That felt way too good. Mmm.\n\nFinally, in addition to the upgrade woes I mentioned earlier, there are other areas where this game stumbles. The map isn’t very helpful and doesn’t mark any of the collectables except for modules, things necessary for game progression though you can find bonus ones. Its rooms are displayed as basic shapes with the paths that connect them. Your player icon will not be accurately positioned to your true location. I didn’t use it much except for fast traveling and occasional path checking for making sure I’m heading down the right chain of rooms when underground.\n\nThe chain/infinite dodge never felt responsive to me and was sometimes hard to control. This issue could be related to the game running at 30fps. I am not sure. The chain dodge is the main method of traveling quickly. It’s also much faster than the normal 3 dodges at a time. The issue comes from the timing which struggles to feel consistent. Also, the more chain dodges you manage, the faster the timing becomes and those windows are very picky. Sometimes you’ll come to a dead stop if your second button press is off. Or you’ll mess up a third or fourth press which makes your character slide for a considerable amount of distance. The slide looks cool until you realize you’re going off a platform. Sometimes you’ll just slam into a wall and bounce when zipping around. I fell off platforms quite often and I had moments where my second button press left me on top of a disappearing platform instead of starting the chain. For the most part, chain dodging is manageable despite the false starts and slides. It’s also fun when you figure out the tempo, but its unreliability becomes a major problem when trying do some of the optional activities.\n\nMy last criticism is about how some of the secrets are handled in this title. In short, some of them are either tedious, frustrating, or both. One of them involves reaching a chain dodge number of 800 in the dodge shop.

I feel they were going for an old school zelda 1 feel but it falls flat story wise, even for a game that is solely about adventuring.  In zelda 1 the game clues you in to why you have to collect the tri-force pieces. you collect them to save Zelda and to have a chance to stop Gannon. In drifter though you collect shards for access to boss rooms? (i'll edit this part when I go back in if i'm just being an idiot). If you collect 4 you are privy to a meaningless cutscene that basicly shows you the opening again. What i'm getting at is the story feels so pretentious  that the team forgot to write a story with purpose. I'm all for no word storytelling, but they dropped the ball on this one.\n\nTL;DR The game sufferd from the Peter Molyneux Effect and it was so close to acheivng what I belive the team set out to make, but they just wern't there.\n\nWould I recomend the game? If you just want to turn off and not care then yes, but if you are someone who likes to understand why you are doing the things you do in the game, then no.\n\n(I know this has nothing to do with the game but this rubbed me the wrong way.

Congratulations Heart Machine, you've made audio/visual heroin.\n\nHyper Light Drifter seduces you with it's shimmering prismatic graphics like a dancing peacock in heat, and it plays somewhat like filling your mouth with Pop Rocks, putting on a pair of cushy headphones, and letting someone stomp on your nuts.\n\nI spent the better part of an hour exploring, dashing about, and collecting hidden treasures while occasionally slashing at a monster or two. At one point I actually wondered if maybe we'd all been so distracted by the glittery package that we'd bought a game with no real content.\n\nAnd then I spent the next two hours swearing. I had fun, yes. I even laughed aloud. ...out of frustration after I cleared a gauntlet of nonsense and stopped to breathe a sigh of relief, when suddenly a bullet from offscreen! Splattered brains. The end. But yeah, there was certainly a ton of swearing.\n\nBut that's because it just doesn't let up! Geez, Heart Machine! It's like someone's holding you down and tickling you until it's not funny anymore, and you're yelling "STOP!", and they won't stop, so you start to panic and get violent.\n\nSo far, I'm in love with the game. I'm desperately hoping I'll be able to get enough upgrades and maintain head-to-wall-slamming stamina long enough to finish it. But I'm gonna be honest, if you're just in it for the artwork, and you don't like games that hold you down and tickle you until you're choking for air and wondering if maybe this is how your life ends... you might not enjoy it.\n\nThere's a delicious buttery satisfaction in overcoming an obstacle that you've lost to over and over. Everytime you die, you learn a little, and you progress. But like many of the other reviewers have said, it's not a merciful game and it won't hold your hand.\n\nMuch love to Heart Machine.

YES\nWorth a buy at full price? YES\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a throwback to titles of old akin to classic Legend of Zelda entries. Though the game looks to be something for the casual gamer, be warned, for it is a difficult game to get the hang of if you haven't been up to speed with titles like Dark Souls or Hotline Miami.\n\nThe story is told in a very cryptic manner, with no hand-holding or guidance whatsoever. There is no text, either: only pictures that you must piece together to truly appreciate the story for what it is. You are a drifter, and you must perish an ancient evil, a creature whose name is Judgement, in order to free your world from darkness. You are sick, however, with a fatal disease lacking a known cure, one you seek to find on your journey.\n\nPros:\n+ Beautifully handcrafted pixel art that draws you into this atmospheric world\n+ An original soundtrack full of mystery that truly sets the tone for the game's setting\n+ A cryptic story that isn't spoonfed, and rewards those who pay attention, explore, and seek further explanation\n+ Thrilling combat, both very difficult and highly rewarding and satifying\n+ An open world, designed with exploration and attention to detail in mind\n+ A non-linear choice in which area to go to in whatever order you decide\n\nCons:\n- The difficulty alone might be enough to sway someone away from this game. If you've no prior experience with games such as dark souls, then I strongly recommend you watch videos or read reviews to find out if this game is really for you\n- On occasion, it may become difficult to know exactly where you should be going to progress through certain areas\n- If you're not one who likes to put work into finding out elements of a story, and prefers to have things spoon-fed to them, then the story element of this game is really not for you\n\nConclusion:\nHyper Light Drifter is a beautifully crafted gem, with thrilling combat mechanics, a mysterious world, and a cryptic story that requires you to put a little work in to fully understand why certain things happen. With that said, the game is surprisingly difficult, so if you're not up for the challenge, steer clear.\n\nScore: 9/10\nWorth a buy at full price?

The boss-fights were the shining crown to what was already an excellent experience.\n\nI was able to beat it in 5 hours, and have decided not to go into New Game+, as the New Game alone kicked my ♥♥♥, but the game is stellar and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a challenge, especially those of you who enjoyed Dark Souls.\n\n","May 12","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would say Hyper Light Drifter is a mix of Fez, Dark Souls, Bastion, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.\n\nPutting that aside, I adore this game despite how much hardship it has put me through.  It's not an easy game for the most part, but it's fair, satisfying, and rewarding in the end.  Another aspect I really loved was the level design and how carefully crafted and hidden all of the secret areas and collectibles were.  The visuals and audio were also spectacular from the character and enemy animations to the soundtrack composed by Disasterpeace to the effective and crisp SFX.  The story and world were also very ambiguous and fun to try to piece together with a lot of the big setpieces in the game taking to great effect.\n\n(Possible Spoilers ahead) My main and only real issue with the game is how insignicant the collectibles really are, only really amounting to some different looking gear.  It makes me wishing it had an impact on the story, the cutscenes, or even just the way the world looks (maybe collecting everything made the game turn to night or something).\n\nAll in all, though, I would wholeheardedly recommend this game.

A story whose characters aren't explained, but rather has emotions seeping out of more juicy pixels in the form of very beautiful (and somewhat strange) "cutscenes".\n\nCombat is twitchy, always a do-or-die moment; you have to learn the patterns, get fast, get good, otherwise they will (greatly) overwhelm you, and you will either come out of it exilarated at 1 health or raging at your death having 2 med packs yet to spend.\n\nI recommend it, though not for the faint of heart; you will be murdered; you will rage; and you will probably get carpal-tonnel if you have a bad gamepad.

Congratulations Heart Machine, you've made audio/visual heroin.\n\nHyper Light Drifter seduces you with it's shimmering prismatic graphics like a dancing peacock in heat, and it plays somewhat like filling your mouth with Pop Rocks, putting on a pair of cushy headphones, and letting someone stomp on your nuts.\n\nI spent the better part of an hour exploring, dashing about, and collecting hidden treasures while occasionally slashing at a monster or two. At one point I actually wondered if maybe we'd all been so distracted by the glittery package that we'd bought a game with no real content.\n\nAnd then I spent the next two hours swearing. I had fun, yes. I even laughed aloud. ...out of frustration after I cleared a gauntlet of nonsense and stopped to breathe a sigh of relief, when suddenly a bullet from offscreen! Splattered brains. The end. But yeah, there was certainly a ton of swearing.\n\nBut that's because it just doesn't let up! Geez, Heart Machine! It's like someone's holding you down and tickling you until it's not funny anymore, and you're yelling "STOP!", and they won't stop, so you start to panic and get violent.\n\nSo far, I'm in love with the game. I'm desperately hoping I'll be able to get enough upgrades and maintain head-to-wall-slamming stamina long enough to finish it. But I'm gonna be honest, if you're just in it for the artwork, and you don't like games that hold you down and tickle you until you're choking for air and wondering if maybe this is how your life ends... you might not enjoy it.\n\nThere's a delicious buttery satisfaction in overcoming an obstacle that you've lost to over and over. Everytime you die, you learn a little, and you progress. But like many of the other reviewers have said, it's not a merciful game and it won't hold your hand.\n\nMuch love to Heart Machine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMagi/recommended/257850/","BlueMagi","Eibon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMagi/","423 products in account","Hyper Light Drifter is a game about a world; sure, there’s a lot of fighting and weapons and upgrades (and even a bit of football), but ultimately everything is about the world Heart Machine set out to create. And what a world it winds up being.\n\nYou start off alone, in the mountains, and sick. Hyper Light Drifter is careful to make your sickness apparent, but never let it weigh you down. Immediately, your presence and purpose is set up – an indeterminate time ago, a catastrophe happened, and you’re at ground zero hoping to find a cure. It’s unclear exactly how you’ll find the cure, but the only hope is the technology of a civilization that destroyed itself.\n\nAfter briefly succumbing to illness, the Drifter wakes up in town, and takes their first steps into the unknown. You get scraps of information from the townspeople: someone of the Drifter’s race was mugged on their travels, the mysterious drifter who saved you has a penchant for defending the weak, and the key to finding the cure is in the center of town.\n\nAnd none of these stories are delivered via words – they are presented through carefully, lovingly drawn images of the events. All of the stories you’ll hear are like this: when you enter a new area, you’ll find out about the area boss’ history through visual recollections of their deeds; when you find a secluded survivor, their tragedy is rendered in detail more explicit than text can easily provide; when you run across the other drifter, he simply sketches on your map.\n\nBut these encounters are rare. The world of Hyper Light Drifter is a hostile and uncompromising one, which leaves you without friends or sources of information for most of your journey. To compensate, the world around you is the story. You’ll run across houses and people consumed by crystal, and you’ll see the corpses of giants in the distance that you eventually see up close later. As you go, you start to piece together a rough history of the world just by existing in it. Later, when you find that survivor, it provides just enough clarity to establish a foundation of lore, but doesn’t overwhelm what your imagination can come up with. In the end, how you experience Hyper Light Drifter – and, more importantly, how you perceive Hyper Light Drifter – becomes the narrative.\n\nIt’s also possible to overlook survivors (though they don’t go anywhere, and can be discovered later), which can drastically affect your understanding of the world. The experience of having your own canon superseded by a game is not a common occurrence, but it’s a thrilling experience when pulled off properly. When my Drifter first set out, they were in a hurry to explore: as a player, I wanted to play; as a Drifter, I wanted a cure. As such, I paid little attention to the details around me, and carried out my task and left. When I came back after two more area bosses were defeated, I found the survivor I never spoke to, and all of the details I had overlooked previously were suddenly relevant and ominous.\n\nThis only accounts for the surface, though. One elevator ride down, and you start finding entirely new fragments of lore that help you piece together what happened in this world. You see drifters that were killed – or possibly killed each other – in their quest to retrieve modules; you never learn the cause of their demise. Beyond a new source of narrative nuance, the buried laboratories help teach you one constant truth in Hyper Light Drifter: everything has a secret.\n\nThe Drifter is more than proficient at fighting (though how proficient you, as a player are, is another story), so combat is a way to keep the stakes high while you fulfill your true purpose: exploring. You’ll find fake walls, invisible platforms, and cleverly hidden switches, all which take you to new resources, new story, new items, and new clues.\n\nAnd the best part? You won’t know any of this from the get-go. Even as a player who knew there would be secrets to look for, I overlooked several in the first area I went to. But the second area taught me a bit more about how the world of Hyper Light Drifter works, and by the end of the third, I knew a lot. On return, I found secrets I had easily overlooked – ones that didn’t even take upgraded abilities to reach.\n\nWhich puts Hyper Light Drifter in a really interesting position: it’s Metroidvanian, in a sense, but it rarely gates off areas based on what abilities you have. Rather, Hyper Light Drifter gates off areas based on what you’ve learned about how the world is constructed. There are also gates that require specific areas to be cleared, but you would almost need precognition to find everything in an area your first time through, and that’s what makes exploring so enjoyable.\n\nThis focus on exploration plays brilliantly with how the game presents its narrative, as you are required to explore to the best of your abilities, and encouraged to discover new ways to explore beyond what you’re used to. As such, you naturally run across tons of ponderous scenes, and uncovering well hidden ones feels extra special.\n\nHyper Light Drifter, to me, is a lot of things: it’s Nausica of the Valley of the Wind, but as a game; it seems like a spiritual successor to Bokura no Taiyō; it’s beautiful sprite graphics in an age where sprite graphics are fading away; it’s ambiguous in its narrative in the best possible ways.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a game I’ve known I wanted since 2013 – but it’s also a game I’ve longed to see happen for longer than that.","March 31","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the game is very beautiful, and has some atmospheric(ness) to it, it's definitely not very chill (which is fine). It can be quite challenging and nerv wrecking at times. The map was not done very well and can cause some headaches sometimes with figuring out where to go. So prepare to explore alot. Also, this game has no text in it. Meaning, no characters talk to you with text (only images) and the upgrades aren't described well. The upgrades not being described well is pretty annoying when you're first getting the hang of the game, but you'll figure it out eventually. All in all, absolutley worth buying.

Furthermore, the launch was crippled by FPS drops, but it has since been patched out and the game ran without any issues for the duration of my first playthrough.\n\nThe Good:\n+Excellent combat that relies on timing and mastery of the players abilities.\n+Fluid pixel art that is easy on the eyes.\n+Fantastic music by Disasterpiece, the same artist that produced the music for Fez and Shoot Many Robots.\n+Lots of secrets, hidden paths and upgrades hidden around every corner of the map and dungeons.\n+The story and narrative is told without dialogue, much like Journey was, which makes for a different experience.\n+Enviromental puzzles and challenges break up the hack and slash action.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The game has superb boss fights, but could've used more, especially since the last zone featured more than one.\n-Some enemies will knock your character over and hit you again, before you can dodge away, leading to cheap deaths.\n-Due to opting out of dialogue the story does seem somewhat shallow.\n-Secrets fall between just being in a corner or having incredibly obtuse sollutions that aren't always explained.\n\nBottom Line:\nHyper Light Drifter is a love letter to old retro games and flaunts great gameplay, tells a simplistic story and at times, delivers crushing difficulty.

Now it is really easy nitpick a game such as this. And it would be easy to, but I beleive that this game is an experience. Not one that everyone will finish, but one that deserves to be tried. It reminds me of a game I played quite some time ago, called LISA. Now both are very different games but both are EXPERINCES. Journies on may like to call them. This game is an incredible journey. It is perfectly executed down to the very last pixel. How lucky we are that such games are still being released. Now as I am sure you will hear many many many times ( and experience many many many times if you purchase the game) is that this game is hellishly difficult. I tend to disagree, there are difficult moments in the game (because of enemies and bosses) the fact is that after two or three deaths the attentive gamer will breeze through the game. I found its difficulty to be both rewarding and refreshing, as the game is easy to pick up and difficult to master (but not to difficult). The whole game feels so sureal and fantastical in my memory. I would recomend this to everyone. It really is not that difficult to complete the story and the world building and little things really make the game an absolue joy to play.

This game really uses the 8bit look as a driving force for a hauntingly beatuiful landscape that, as far as I know, hasn't been done before.\n\nAnd that's important because the narrative in here is ENTIRELY VISUALLY DRIVEN. There is ZERO text. The story you piece together comes from the environment, the gorgeous animations, and the small bits of information the npc's give you through pictogrpahic "speech" bubbles. As such the "why" isn't a question answered often. It's more about the "what" and how you, the player, will FEEL about it. The visuals, along with the sometimes brutal combat and a relatively high execution barrier, and the music do a good job to get you in the mood.\n\nMechanically, this game is about two things: exploration and combat. The levels are complex, the map is detailed but only gives you an approximate location. That means spatial memory- "dead reckoning"- is key. Again, the visual design helps here. The areas look distinct enough, but when you get lost I can't help but feel that it was intentional. There are a LOT of secrets in weird corners of each map, and if you're like me and love combing through each area for secrets, this IS that game.\n\nJust as challenging as the exploration is the combat. The game is non-linear, and you can explore any area whenever. Some areas do have harder confrontations than others, however. Don't be afraid to back out of the area and explore somwhere else.\n\nI DO recommend at least trying to tough it out when you get to a difficult part. This game is execution heavy, and reward percision. Timing your strikes and dodges is integral, because the game does punish you for mashing buttons. Honing your execution will carry you through this game, as the upgrades only make the encounters a LITTLE easier.\n\nLot of people compare this to Dark Souls, which is totally out of place. Just cos a game is difficult doesn't mean it's anything like Dark Souls at all. Checkpoints are very generous, often right before an encounter; health is plentiful and enemies respawn only after specific triggers, which means if you're working through an area you'll rarely fight anything twice.\n\nI'm not quite through this game, but the more I play it the more connected I feel to it. There are some glitches with geometry and platforming, but nothing game breaking. I might add to this review when I'm through with the game.\n\nAt the moment this is the highest recommendation I've given a game this year.","April 3","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game perfects a method in creating an experience, in telling a story, that goes beyond conventional narration and theme. It does this by both hiding and slowly revealing details at a pace that leaves you always grasping for more, but always satisfied by what you've discovered. While there are no words and the only communication with other characters is through sets of descriptive images of scenes, the player will understand the purpose and meaning of Hyper Light Drifter if they look carefully enough. You have one simple goal in Hyper Light Drifter, explore and uncover powerful artifacts of the past. Your motivation is as simple and deadly as any in the real world, a terminal and mysterious illness. As you explore more and more of the beautifully drawn and animated world of Hyper Light Drifter, you'll discover the dark secrets of the hidden past and why the Drifter is going down this path. The biggest strength of this game might actually be the ambiguity the story telling allows. Similar to games like Journey in this respect, you'll fall in love with Hyper Light Drifter becuase it lets you unravel the mystery of events in the game's universe rather than shouting a plot at you. This gives a special and personal significance to the character of the Drifter and the circumstances that befall him in the player's heart, not because they are told to like the character, but because they discover they do through their own experience controlling him. I DEFINITELY recommend this game, you will fall in love if you appreciate the deep care and effort an artist puts into their work. With the wonder of a Miyazaki film and the depth of a Souls game, Hyper Light Drifter is one of the best games to come out in the last year, and Heart Machine deserves much more credit than what they're already given for creating it.

I would say Hyper Light Drifter is a mix of Fez, Dark Souls, Bastion, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.\n\nPutting that aside, I adore this game despite how much hardship it has put me through.  It's not an easy game for the most part, but it's fair, satisfying, and rewarding in the end.  Another aspect I really loved was the level design and how carefully crafted and hidden all of the secret areas and collectibles were.  The visuals and audio were also spectacular from the character and enemy animations to the soundtrack composed by Disasterpeace to the effective and crisp SFX.  The story and world were also very ambiguous and fun to try to piece together with a lot of the big setpieces in the game taking to great effect.\n\n(Possible Spoilers ahead) My main and only real issue with the game is how insignicant the collectibles really are, only really amounting to some different looking gear.  It makes me wishing it had an impact on the story, the cutscenes, or even just the way the world looks (maybe collecting everything made the game turn to night or something).\n\nAll in all, though, I would wholeheardedly recommend this game.

YES\nWorth a buy at full price? YES\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a throwback to titles of old akin to classic Legend of Zelda entries. Though the game looks to be something for the casual gamer, be warned, for it is a difficult game to get the hang of if you haven't been up to speed with titles like Dark Souls or Hotline Miami.\n\nThe story is told in a very cryptic manner, with no hand-holding or guidance whatsoever. There is no text, either: only pictures that you must piece together to truly appreciate the story for what it is. You are a drifter, and you must perish an ancient evil, a creature whose name is Judgement, in order to free your world from darkness. You are sick, however, with a fatal disease lacking a known cure, one you seek to find on your journey.\n\nPros:\n+ Beautifully handcrafted pixel art that draws you into this atmospheric world\n+ An original soundtrack full of mystery that truly sets the tone for the game's setting\n+ A cryptic story that isn't spoonfed, and rewards those who pay attention, explore, and seek further explanation\n+ Thrilling combat, both very difficult and highly rewarding and satifying\n+ An open world, designed with exploration and attention to detail in mind\n+ A non-linear choice in which area to go to in whatever order you decide\n\nCons:\n- The difficulty alone might be enough to sway someone away from this game. If you've no prior experience with games such as dark souls, then I strongly recommend you watch videos or read reviews to find out if this game is really for you\n- On occasion, it may become difficult to know exactly where you should be going to progress through certain areas\n- If you're not one who likes to put work into finding out elements of a story, and prefers to have things spoon-fed to them, then the story element of this game is really not for you\n\nConclusion:\nHyper Light Drifter is a beautifully crafted gem, with thrilling combat mechanics, a mysterious world, and a cryptic story that requires you to put a little work in to fully understand why certain things happen. With that said, the game is surprisingly difficult, so if you're not up for the challenge, steer clear.\n\nScore: 9/10\nWorth a buy at full price?

While the game is very beautiful, and has some atmospheric(ness) to it, it's definitely not very chill (which is fine). It can be quite challenging and nerv wrecking at times. The map was not done very well and can cause some headaches sometimes with figuring out where to go. So prepare to explore alot. Also, this game has no text in it. Meaning, no characters talk to you with text (only images) and the upgrades aren't described well. The upgrades not being described well is pretty annoying when you're first getting the hang of the game, but you'll figure it out eventually. All in all, absolutley worth buying.

Furthermore, the launch was crippled by FPS drops, but it has since been patched out and the game ran without any issues for the duration of my first playthrough.\n\nThe Good:\n+Excellent combat that relies on timing and mastery of the players abilities.\n+Fluid pixel art that is easy on the eyes.\n+Fantastic music by Disasterpiece, the same artist that produced the music for Fez and Shoot Many Robots.\n+Lots of secrets, hidden paths and upgrades hidden around every corner of the map and dungeons.\n+The story and narrative is told without dialogue, much like Journey was, which makes for a different experience.\n+Enviromental puzzles and challenges break up the hack and slash action.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The game has superb boss fights, but could've used more, especially since the last zone featured more than one.\n-Some enemies will knock your character over and hit you again, before you can dodge away, leading to cheap deaths.\n-Due to opting out of dialogue the story does seem somewhat shallow.\n-Secrets fall between just being in a corner or having incredibly obtuse sollutions that aren't always explained.\n\nBottom Line:\nHyper Light Drifter is a love letter to old retro games and flaunts great gameplay, tells a simplistic story and at times, delivers crushing difficulty.

Reward stems solely from learning the intricacies of combat. With a few unlockable abilities you are highly mobile, easily able to evade or deflect any incoming attack. But, executing these moves with confidence takes practice and HLD doesn't shy away from punishing you for your errors.\n\nLike the most successful action games, HLD is undeniably cool and stimulating when you fall into its flow. But, this rhythm-harmony is hard to achieve, demanding practice and your undivided attention. Lose it and you'll find yourself completely open to attack or looking at the black death screen -- your colorful sprite lying in a pool of his own blood.\n\nCombat is HLD's most interesting element. You are equipped with a sword that has a single attack combo and a pistol that recharges whenever you attack with the sword. The pistol is just as useful as the sword--even in boss fights--which is an unexpected triumph. Enemies with 2 or 3 hit points can be disposed of with one sword combo, a few pistol shots, or a couple reflected projectiles. Those with more health need a few sword combos and a few shots to take down. But, after completing a single 3-swing combo, your sprite is locked in a sort-of rest animation that leaves you open to attack. Each sword strike has to be timed and enemies never get stunned. Mess up the dash's galloping rhythm and your sprite will slide across the ground for a couple seconds as you helplessly try to regain control. Some guns(yes, there is more than one) have a short cooldown in between shots that can really throw you off if you're not careful. But these moments where, suddenly, combat grinds to halt for a brief couple of seconds really separates it from a generic hack 'n slash requiring little-to-no deliberation.\n\nWith life-threatening challenges around every corner, satisfaction arises from skill-based consistency in battle. This may be a point of issue for some. The nonlinear structure of the game means every area has a similar level of difficulty (excluding the Southern area which isn't immediately accessible). The hardest area will most likely be your first. Although, if you care enough to explore the late game content, there are rooms that will definitely test your skills. But, these rooms always feel extra and are never necessary for progressing through the main game.\n\nHLD presents itself as a very mysterious game and its ambiguity harms more than it helps. NPCs speak in hieroglyphics that resemble symbols you've seen elsewhere. A monitor in your bedroom displays a cryptic diagram. Nothing is explained, save for a few basic controls. After a few hours you will know everything the game has to offer and be left with the matter of finding them. The problem is that you'll think the game has more to offer than it actually does. Much like the NPCs that tell stories in slide-show form, these mysteries are to be seen, not to engage with. They are surface level, solely there to build the world, not to solve.\n\nOn the whole, the ambiguity of its story, characters, and goal prevents HLD from building tension around any particular confrontation or moment. HLD tries to with it short opening cinematic, NPC stories, and one reoccurring nightmare sequence but it's all too little and all too vague. This, coupled with the game's open structure, results in an experience that never escalates to a satisfying conclusion. However, the game has a consistent, dark tone and an atmosphere that is filled with dread. Visually, the game can be dark and frightening as you journey far below the surface. It can be bright and beautiful as you wander through a crystal forest and even epic, with once mobile giants, now forever petrified in stoic backgrounds. HLD combines sci-fi and fantasy in a unique way and it is difficult to not be drawn into its world.\n\nIndividual areas are visually and structurally different, distinctly separate from one another.\nUnlike the game as a whole, each area escalates in the form of sequentially more difficult arena-style battles, climaxing with a boss encounter. Areas will have their own enemy types and combinations, often mixed together in a way that will keep you constantly juggling strategies. Boss fights present proper challenges, spurring the ferocity of combat to new heights in two-phase, lengthy confrontations. Enemy and boss design are both well-done and serve as one of HLD's strongest features.\n\nHLD's biggest problem is its exploration. The map is not really all that helpful. There are three things you're looking for in the game: purple triangles, stone tablets, and keys. Purple triangles are the only items that are mandatory for completion and you only need to find half of them. They are displayed on the map, but are still difficult to find. If you don't want to spend countless hours prowling the world for an item, you won't have to. Finding what is necessary for completion is a fun task that gives you proper time to master the deep combat mechanics. But, if you were looking forward to losing yourself in Hyper Light Drifter intriguing world, trying to piece together an various elusive secrets, I suggest you tailor your expectations.\n\nAfter you have found all the purple triangles, the map is useless. The game doesn't aid in your search for the stone tablets and offers no help finding any of the 16 hidden keys. The environments are riddled with hidden passages, offscreen switches, and invisible platforms. If you are trying to collect everything prepare to run along every wall, every side of every platform, and to dash occasionally off a platform just...because...maybe...\nIt starts to feel tedious. Burn every bush with a red candle.\n\nThe exploration doesn't require any clever use of logic. There are no clues, no puzzles, and really no meaningful reward for end-game exploration. The items you get for finding these secrets are almost always cosmetic. They may boost, for example, the recharge time of your grenades, but nothing you find will alter the way you play the game or the way the game feels. It is a shame that a game with great mechanics fails to offer diversity within them. Only two upgrades, which I acquired quite early in the game, really gave me something new to experiment with, to practice. There is a NG+, where you have 2 hit points and a new outfit. If you are trying to find everything, NG+ is the same exploration with a handicap, but if you are looking for one final test of your combat skills, NG+ will definitely provide it.\n\nIf you are looking for an indie action game to enjoy casually, a game that eases you into concepts and methods and presents an escalating series of challenges up until the end, this might not be the game for you. HLD is almost always a challenge. Even the earliest enemies have the potential to destroy an experienced player. Still, Hyper Light Drifter's atmosphere, world, and combat are all engaging enough to warrant a purchase and worth a good deal of hours spent exploring.","April 8","true","43.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game also (mostly) allows you to play the game in order of area you want, which I thought was a nice touch. The amount of effort put into the story and world building of this game is incredible when taking into consideration not a single piece of English is spoken or written throughout the entire game, makes the world feel more alien and realistic.

Honestly I wasn't expecting too much out of this when I first purchased it. I watched the trailers beforehand and figured it would be a pretty average/so-so game that I would work on every so often out of boredom. Boy was I WRONG. I found myself immediately intrigued when the opening cut scene started to play on the screen after creating my character save. It made me curious as to what was going on and what exactly this story would be about. Even after completing the game (after about 8 hours) I was still left wondering what exactly was the cause/source of the dilemma which your character faces. I suppose that is to be somewhat expected from a game with absolutely no dialogue whatsoever.\n\nThe occasional picture based “dialogues” that you would encounter with a few characters throughout the game would give you a general idea of what to watch out for and where to go, but beyond that the grand plot of the story was left somewhat to speculation. However, I would not count this as a con at all. Quite the contrary, actually; it left it to the imagination as to how this world you play in came to be.\n\nWith that being said, this game is perhaps one of the best I have ever played. It’s simple style, yet complex and diverse atmosphere was breathtaking in its own special way, and the adventure/puzzle/mystery style of it all really made it something that I could not put down. I played it at every chance I could get until I was finished.\n\nHowever, as fun as this game is, it is equally challenging and at times VERY frustrating. It isn’t too hard to figure out the puzzles and places that you need to go in order to acquire the necessary items to progress, but some of the fighting areas (and ESPECIALLY the boss fights) are rather grueling. This is no pushover game when it comes to combat. Some of the mob fights took several tries, and the boss battles took many, many more. What’s more is that it is rather difficult to find health, as it exists in scarcity across the games landscape and dungeons. May Heaven, Hell, and all the hosts that lie within them help you if you happen to enter a big fight without enough health and reserve health. Don’t expect to come out victorious by just “winging it.” It’s difficulty and required persistence WILL make you want to rage quit several times. Period. But not in a bad way… if that makes sense.\n\nOverall, for the price that I paid and the experience that I got out of it, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun and enjoyable (and, again, challenging) way to kill time. Just be prepared to devote some time and patience when going into it. 10/10 would pay and play again.\n","April 8","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really immerses you into the game and sets the tone for the plot. Second, the combat is simple to learn, yet hard to master. You can swing your sword, and shoot a gun. Eventually, you can pick up upgrades that may require you to dash and swing your sword in quick succession, but that is really all there is to it. The enemies are made to be very challenging, so you will need to play smart and never take uneccessary damage in order to preserve as much life as possible. Finally, there are many secrets in this game, and even times when you need to look for something vital to completing the game, it could be hidden. I don't want to spoil anything, but always pay attention to your surroundings and look around very thoroughly in order to get the best experience you can for this game. Nothing in this game bothered me enough to mention, but everyone is different. A thing to mention is the story is very interesting yet hard to comprehend. You pretty much have to imagine a lot of the sotry for yourself, but there are times when you can piece bits of the intended story together based on environment, bosses, and interacting with NPCs (That do not talk in any other way besides showing you pictures) Essentially, if you are not into the types of games that do not hold your hand and tell you where to go, you will dislike this game. Come into this 7-9 hour game expecting a challenge, because that is what you are going to get. I hope many people come to purchase this game and support the developers that worked very hard on creating a game that is memorable in every aspect. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who likes action - RPGs and enjoy dying a lot :D\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nArt - 10\nSoundtrack - 9\nCombat - 9\nStory - 9\n","April 9","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Furthermore, the launch was crippled by FPS drops, but it has since been patched out and the game ran without any issues for the duration of my first playthrough.\n\nThe Good:\n+Excellent combat that relies on timing and mastery of the players abilities.\n+Fluid pixel art that is easy on the eyes.\n+Fantastic music by Disasterpiece, the same artist that produced the music for Fez and Shoot Many Robots.\n+Lots of secrets, hidden paths and upgrades hidden around every corner of the map and dungeons.\n+The story and narrative is told without dialogue, much like Journey was, which makes for a different experience.\n+Enviromental puzzles and challenges break up the hack and slash action.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The game has superb boss fights, but could've used more, especially since the last zone featured more than one.\n-Some enemies will knock your character over and hit you again, before you can dodge away, leading to cheap deaths.\n-Due to opting out of dialogue the story does seem somewhat shallow.\n-Secrets fall between just being in a corner or having incredibly obtuse sollutions that aren't always explained.\n\nBottom Line:\nHyper Light Drifter is a love letter to old retro games and flaunts great gameplay, tells a simplistic story and at times, delivers crushing difficulty.

This game really uses the 8bit look as a driving force for a hauntingly beatuiful landscape that, as far as I know, hasn't been done before.\n\nAnd that's important because the narrative in here is ENTIRELY VISUALLY DRIVEN. There is ZERO text. The story you piece together comes from the environment, the gorgeous animations, and the small bits of information the npc's give you through pictogrpahic "speech" bubbles. As such the "why" isn't a question answered often. It's more about the "what" and how you, the player, will FEEL about it. The visuals, along with the sometimes brutal combat and a relatively high execution barrier, and the music do a good job to get you in the mood.\n\nMechanically, this game is about two things: exploration and combat. The levels are complex, the map is detailed but only gives you an approximate location. That means spatial memory- "dead reckoning"- is key. Again, the visual design helps here. The areas look distinct enough, but when you get lost I can't help but feel that it was intentional. There are a LOT of secrets in weird corners of each map, and if you're like me and love combing through each area for secrets, this IS that game.\n\nJust as challenging as the exploration is the combat. The game is non-linear, and you can explore any area whenever. Some areas do have harder confrontations than others, however. Don't be afraid to back out of the area and explore somwhere else.\n\nI DO recommend at least trying to tough it out when you get to a difficult part. This game is execution heavy, and reward percision. Timing your strikes and dodges is integral, because the game does punish you for mashing buttons. Honing your execution will carry you through this game, as the upgrades only make the encounters a LITTLE easier.\n\nLot of people compare this to Dark Souls, which is totally out of place. Just cos a game is difficult doesn't mean it's anything like Dark Souls at all. Checkpoints are very generous, often right before an encounter; health is plentiful and enemies respawn only after specific triggers, which means if you're working through an area you'll rarely fight anything twice.\n\nI'm not quite through this game, but the more I play it the more connected I feel to it. There are some glitches with geometry and platforming, but nothing game breaking. I might add to this review when I'm through with the game.\n\nAt the moment this is the highest recommendation I've given a game this year.","April 3","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's no dialogue at all in the game so you don't get bogged down by long stories or tutorials.\nYou find your way pretty naturally due to the linear nature of the hub. You can only go so far in a direction you're not supposed to yet. That said, there's branching paths and LOADS of hidden secrets.\nCombat's a big focus and it's pretty fun. Dynamic attack patterns from even common enemies is nice. They'll attack differently when you're far away or up close.\nDepending on the power ups you get, your combat style can be a little different. Nothing major though.\nGets a little too easy after you spend enough on power ups.\nExpect about 7-8 hours for the main story.

I think that all games running at 60 fps give us a better experience, versus running at 30fps. That’s not to say 30fps is unplayable, but is a fact.\n-	While playing 90% of the game using my xbox360 controller, I always felt the dashing was easier and more responsive using KB+M. I don’t know if this was due to the 30fps lock or no. But the parts of the game where you need to dash like crazy, where made using KB+M.\n-	Lack of directions plays good for the most part, but can get you frustrated if you stumble into a difficulty spike.\nNow the good:\n-	Art Direction: Oh my god, what a beautiful world, I can’t call this retro style, the only thing retro is the resolution, and everything else is PIXEL ART at its finest!\n-	Music: For the most part simplistic, but setting the tone along the journey.\n-	Combat: Even locked at 30fps, the combat always felt great, with every enemy careful introduced until you starts to face all of them together, and you starts to dance around then, “a dance of dead”.\n-	History: Story without words, only art and context. I ended the game caving for more, needing to know more about this world, how it came to be. But I’m glad with the direction they choose, always leaving me hanging for the next screen.\nI just want to leave a note about exploration: You need to explore to find the secrets, but you always felt imposed to hug every wall, every corner to find then. I think they should have chosen another mechanic for this, leaving a few secretes well hidden, but the rest (the majority) in a way where the scenario hinted us for they existence.\nIf you like to explore a mysterious world and fight like a samurai; and can cope with the 30fps lock, go for it. Hyper Light Drifter is amazing!\n","April 15","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as the Drifter, and view the world from a bird's eye view. The game world is open and vast, and you must go undertake a quest to save existence. Along the way, you will find better equipment, and currency which you can then use to upgrade your equipment and skills.\n\nThis game is gorgeous. Its art style is very reminiscent of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras of videogames, and it certainly plays like a game from that era. The game is challenging, but not brutally difficult. Combined with the music, it is very easy to get lost inside the world of Hyper Light Drifter. Did I mention that this game is gorgeous?\n\nThe story is vague, and told purely through visuals, as there is no spoken language or written english text in the game. There is a coded language than you can decipher (I believe other players have deciphered it) that offer additional clues about the plot for you to interpret.\n\nThe gameplay is both fast-paced, with peaceful lulls in-between, to explore and find the game's countless hidden secrets.\n\nThis little game is a lot of fun. A must play for anyone that loves action games, pixel-based art, or longs for the old days of NES adventures.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this game is that the Steam achievements don't seem to be working properly at the time of this review. However, that's such a minor detail that will probably get fixed, and does not really affect the game itself.\n\nThis game truly is a gem.

It's a bit of a stretch to call Hyper Light Drifter a hack n' slash as there tends to be a lot more strategy to movement that first appearances suggest. With artwork reminiscent of Superbrothers: Sword and Sorcery but combat more akin to Dark souls style of high risk high speed reflex oriented attacks. The minimalist setup of the game only tends to add to the appeal in my humble opinion.   If the game is not challenging enough for you then the New Game+ mode should sate you. The normal play through has you resting at 5 health boxes, with most attacks chipping 1 and a few heavier attacks costing you 2. New Game+ leaves you with 2 health boxes making many previous hits instant death. GLHF!","June 3","true","70.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game delivers on everything from its colorful pixel art style to its atmospheric soundtrack. If you like Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, Dark Souls, Fez, Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP; or any combination of the above, then you'll love this game.\n\nControls: The controls are pretty easy to pick up on, even without going through any kind of tutorials or having your hand held all the way through the game. This game feels like it's catered toward a gaming fanbase that has played enough games of this style, that it's almost a universal language between what's on screen and what you need to do next. I'm currently using a PS4 controller, so I'm not having any problems, although I've heard people are not having as much luck with Xbox Controlelrs or Keyboard and Mouse setups. The only issues I have are no vibration with a wired controller yet, and when it comes to exploring the world, some leaps are almost impossible unless you are lined up just perfect, so you may end up jumping to your death trying to get to some collectibles (worth it).\n\nMusic: Probably one of the main reasons I bought this game. Disasterpeace will undoubtedly go down as one of the best game composers in the future. He is able to incorporate conditional algorithms with his musical textures so that it builds perfectly as you enter points of action or step into new areas. To see this work seemlessly with an art style this minimal is always refreshing. See Fez if you haven't played it yet. Disasterpeace's composition, arrangement and sound design are about as professional as you may come across for Indie Games.\n\nArt: This game is getting compared to a lot of other games such as Bastion, Transistor, Titan Souls, etc., but I can't help but to also think of Swords and Sworcery EP as this game seems so musically driven as well. The color palette is very interesting for a pixel art style, and the contrast really works to make this game stand out from the rest. The minute animations that go on, such as birds flying, animals walking or swimming around, weather effects, to something as simple as your cape fluttering in the wind in a not so obvious repetitive pattern; really helps to show that years of attention to tiny details is what is making this release something a bit more than just another pixel art style game. I look forward to every new area, and I feel like there's a secret within every room.\n\nDifficulty: This brings me to the next part. Many people are complaining that it's too hard, and this apart from the framerate complaints seems to be most consumers' biggest gripe and fear. I'm not going to claim I'm a great gamer or anything, as I've died probably 50 times or more already within the few hours I've played. I've laughed at myself more than getting angry at the game. The respawn times are not that bad, and better yet, the music is more or less unaffected, so it doesn't kill the mood at all when you do die. You just want to keep right on playing and try again. I didn't find the first boss I fought to be that difficult, as I pretty quickly picked up on its patterns, and played it as safe as I could and healed when necessary.\n\nTips: Save your health packs for only when necessary. It's okay to die in this game, so hold on to them until you really need them. Check every nook and cranny, hug every wall, and check every object that looks suspicious. You will find a lot more gearbits (currency) than you may expect that will help you buy upgrades. Being able to deflect back projectiles or dash through them will help you alot for mini-boss/boss fights, as well as when you get surrounded by a lot of people shooting projectiles at you at once. Don't give up on the game. Just go explore another area, fast teleport to the areas where you can heal for free, and search for gearbits to buy upgrades; then go back to the area you had problems with before and try again. The difficulty of this game is not as hard as many are making it out to be. They are just first day reviewers with little to no patience with their character that probably has no upgrades yet. Be patient and do what the game suggests. "Explore a beautiful, vast and ruined world riddled with dangers and lost technologies." You'll find what you need to help you progress further, just like in any Zelda or Metroid game.\n\nFinal Verdict: I'd be kidding myself if I came to any conclusions before I've had one good full playthrough yet, so I'll come back to edit this later. From the short amount of time I've put into it so far; I highly recommend this release, and I feel like I've already got my money's worth.\n\n8/10 at the very least, and that's if you're a rage quitter.","April 1","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

HLD is an Open-ended Action-Adventure game with lovely pixel graphics, a noticeably decent soundtrack, and aspirations to be a Dark Souls-esque game. However it doesn't really stack up to that last part, with much of the difficulty being attributed to HLD's design and engine limitations, one such example being Knockdowns are everywhere. The animation to get up from a single knockdown is long and non-cancelable, plus you're not invincible while doing so which can lead to tons of deaths from enemies and even the hazards peppered around the world. However, that's nothing compared to the controls being what they are, even on a decent machine.\n\nReally it wasn't the difficulty, the gameplay, or even the style of the game that reinforced my gamer rage; it was the controls. The controls were god aweful when I first picked the game up and even with some of the most basic upgrades they felt stiff. This I can only attribute to the GameMaker engine that they used to create HLD. That doesn't mean the controls didn't grow on me over time, say for the Chain Dash, but in certain situations they still feel this way. It also doesn't help that there are virtually no cancels on actions, which harms the fluid combat already in place. There's no canceling an action to dodge which can lead to getting hit quite frequently earlier in the game, as there's no way to really attack and dodge at the same time. It's really when the two dash attacks are finally obtained HLD's combat becomes bearable and coupled with certain pieces of equipment it becomes actually fun to play.\n\nEven with the controls and the mechanics being issues in places, one thing I cannot accept is the optional challenges for the 100% completion. Two such barriers come to mind when seeking completion of the game, The "800 Consecutive Dash" and some of the 8-Module Area Challenges. The Area Challenges can be brutally annoying to complete, but at least they have alternative methods of getting through them. However, The 800 Consecutive Dash is one of the worst design choices I have encountered in recent memory, as it's painfully dreadful to sit and press the dash key that many times. I attempted it and got to around 500 with a gamepad before I gave up, eventually I installed a hotkey program to actually complete the challenge. This 800 Dash requirement was a painful slog and a terrible means of padding out the game, which in turn harms the completion aspect to the game.\n\nOverall, my recommendation is to play Hyper Light Drifter and love it for what it is, but just don't expect it to love you back. It's not Dark Souls, but Hyper Light Drifter for what it's worth is forged in similar fires with lesser materials.","April 5","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This post apocalyptic neon covered action adventure game developed and published by Heart Machine is a very impressive introduction to the developer. If you're an aspiring video game designer using game maker studio, this is a perfect example of what the software can do.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Very atmospheric game\n- Varied enemies that attack differently and look very different from each other\n- Several upgrades that keep the game interesting\n- Interesting bosses that all have diverse move sets and character design\n- Fantastic sound design and soundtrack\n- Beautiful visuals that are teeming with color and character\n- The combat is incredible and feels amazing, really my main reason for falling for this game.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- Bare minimum options\n- 30 fps locked (C'mon, it's 2016)\n- Cutscene volume obnotiously loud\n- shakey start\n- basically useless map which will further confuse the player.\n\nSome of my additional opinions:\n- The story is very confusing and never explained out in the open its for the player to decipher for themselves. I really like this and I'd rather let the environment and NPC's tell me the story without spoon feeding it to me. (NPC's speak in pictures which also makes it a bit difficult to understand)\n- This game gets really difficult and may not be for everyone\n- I really enjoyed New game + I feel like it changed up the base game more than other New game +'s\n\nConclusion:\nI bought this game for $17 and I do not feel ripped off, not in the slightest. This is a really fun yet challenging game that harkens back to classic video games such as Zelda and Metroid without ripping them off. The game envelopes the player in a world bursting with color and imagination. The combat is fluid and reminds me of dark souls (a game I might add, that has mastered melee combat) Lastly the soundtrack is jaw dropping and further immerses the player into the world of Hyper Light Drifter. This game is not for everyone, if you're ready for a challenging video game with no hand holding buy this game.","April 7","true","11.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Additionally, I’ve taken care to keep this review spoiler free.\n\nAt first glance the gameplay is familiar, and is something akin to A Link to the Past. This coupled with the old-timey graphics gives it a nostalgic feel, but HLD is much more than a reskinned Zelda clone. First, the game is challenging and at times down right hard. However difficult, I found the game to be fair. In fact, HLD rewards good planning and practice. For instance, practicing timing drifts/attacks, and making thoughtful use of each firearm will make or break some fights. There were some battles that I was simply overwhelmed the first couple of attempts at them, but after some reflection and planning, I would breeze through what I previously thought to be near impossible.\n\nWhat struck me next was that HLD is an explorers dream come true. The game is packed full of secret areas to uncover. In these areas could be anything: new customs, currency, weapons, or something more mysterious. In fact, the element of mystery and discovery is a major theme in HLD. The story in HLD is not told in a simple spell it out for you sort of manner. Quite the opposite actually.  Instead, you are left to piece together cryptic clues about the broken world your character lives in. Again HLD reward being thoughtful and meticulous. It is entirely possible to traverse the entire game and not understand what is happening.\n\nFinally, the world is perhaps my favorite aspect of HLD. The music and the masterfully crafted zones invoked powerful emotions. At times I felt excitement, wonder, but also sorrow. By the end of the game I felt connected to the world, its inhabitants, and most importantly compelled to uncover its darkest mysteries (an ongoing process for me and many others). Really my only complaint is that of any great gaming experience, the journey while enjoyable is over far too soon.\n\nTLDR: Hyper Light Drift has great music and pixel art, is challenging but fair, and drops you into a mysterious shattered world that begs to be explored end to end.\n","April 13","true","25.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Hyper Light Drifter's vividly imagined, post-apocalyptic sci-fi world is brought to life with some of the best looking pixel-art you could hope to find in a game, and a brilliant ambient soundtrack courtesy of Disasterpiece. The attention to detail on display in each of HLD's 4 areas is astonishing, with all its strange creatures and enemies animated to perfection, and numerous secrets always hidden just out of the corner of the screen. Every inch of game's world seems to provide clues to its lore.\n\nDespite HLD's peaceful appearance, it quickly becomes apparent that the game's combat is brutally unforgiving. It's reminiscent of a top-down, faster-paced Dark Souls. Go into the game with the mindset you would go into a Dark Souls game with, and you'll gradually start to learn enemy patterns, work out how to deal with large groups of enemies, know when to attack and dodge. The more your play improves and the more abilities your character unlocks and upgrades, the more enjoyable and satisfying the combat becomes, as you dash around the screen, reflecting enemy bullets and slicing rockets in half, dodging enemy swipes and responding with your own. The boss battles are also a joy, and represent the steepest challenges of the game. If you are used to the bosses of Dark Souls, of hitting your head against a wall over and over until you learn the boss' patterns and how to deal with them, you will be right in your element here.\n\nThe game can be frustrating at times, but to what extent this hinders your overall enjoyment will depend on what types of games you enjoy playing. If you are willing to face a bit of a challenge in order to immerse yourself in a beautiful game world, you'll love Hyper Light Drifter.\n9.5/10","April 2","true","21.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourmore/recommended/257850/","fourmore","Four More","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourmore/","220 products in account","It took me a little over 6 hours to beat Hyper Light Drifter. 6 hours of atmosphere, intrigue, loss, anger, and, ultimately, victory.\n\nFantastic Aesthetic and Sound DesignLet me start off by saying: wow. Without spoilers, the intro definitely sets the stage for the rest of the game. The environments are intricate, with plenty of little details and set pieces to satisfy any eye. This game has some of the best pixel art that I've seen, and its effect on the player is further amplified by the atmospheric music.\n\nChallenging GameplayHyper Light Drifter expands its gameplay in meaningful ways. In this game, "experience" is in the form of fragments, which you find by exploring the map, slaying bosses, and killing certain enemies. Collect enough fragments, and you can upgrade a skill or weapon. My only complaint about this system is that some skills are far more useful than others. If you chose a skill of less use than the Improved Dash or Sword Reflector, you would probably have a much harder time beating some of the crazier, bullet-hell bosses. Regardless, you learn to beat bosses by memorizing their attack patterns, and damn does it feel good getting that last hit/shot in.\n\nWordless Storytelling I'm a huge fan of games that show us, rather than tell us, what's happening in the story. Other than a few text hints that pop up to explain gameplay mechanics, there isn't a single line of dialogue in Hyper Light Drifter. By not having any words, the game nudges you to look at the lovingly-crafted, pixelated environments for answers. But there is also a downside to this approach: even though I beat it, I still don't understand aspects of the story. This might irritate some people, but if you're like me you don't mind if some things are left up to the imagination.\n\nReplayabilityI didn't 100% the game. I did not discover all items, secrets, and nodes (what I call the purple shining diamond thingies). I only picked up one of the little robo companions. Hell, I just found out after-the-fact that there are alternate capes with special bonuses. I definitely think there's more value here, especially since the game's secrets are tucked away pretty neatly. There's even a New Game+, which seems far more challenging since most attacks will kill you in one hit.\n\nIn ConclusionIf you want an awesome, short-but-sweet, challenging experience, I highly recommend Hyper Light Drifter. For those 100%ers out there I think there's plenty here if you want to go beyond the basic requirements for beating the game. Otherwise, to anyone about to buy the game: enjoy the taste of blood in your mouth.","April 7","true","8.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A little dog tries to lead you over this way, but he's easy to miss.

The soundtrack is wonderfully eerie, and works so hand in hand with the art that you feel like you've been transported to another (beautiful) planet.  The art is insane.  So beautiful and so well crafted, I find my jaw unhinged often.  Gameplay is incredibly fun and rewarding.  Enemies pack a serious punch, and there are often many of them in a very confined space, but you have the tools to prevail.  Once you start getting comfortable with those tools, the combat is fair, but challenging.  The boss difficulty has been seriously overblown; this game is no walk in the park but is completely fair.  Don't let the Rock Paper Shotgun review deter you from buying; this is not the bullet hell insanity of Nuclear Throne (which is great mind you) or the monotonous boss fights of Titan Souls.

The city seems struck as if by a hurricane, and all it's wonders and horrors, crumble and rot in a matter of seconds. The once blue waters of the valley become as scarlet as they fill with the bodies of millions of dead. A crawling shadowed mass pursues you, it's touch a mark of infection, and looming mortality. There is something that can save you, a luminous crystal. You reach for it, but the shadow snuffs it out and covers you. All goes dark. You awaken to a storm.\n\nWelcome to Hyper Light Drifter.\n\nThis is a game that drips atmosphere from every single one of it's stylized pixels. Atmosphere, mystery, and death.\n\nProfessional reviews I've read tend to give it comparison to franchises like Zelda, or Dark Souls. Zelda, due to it's exploratory dungeon crawler set up. Dark Souls, for it's punishing difficulty. Even the game's lead director, Alex Preston makes mention of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, as an inspirational source, along with another famous dungeon crawler, Diablo. But from my perspective, Hyper Light mostly pays clear homage to the console gaming golden age of the Eighties and Nineties. As I've played, I've felt the ancestral spirits of other titles like Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, Robotron, Strider, Contra, and Metroid looking on and nodding a solemn ascent.\n\nHyper Light, like these, is a reflex game. A death game. And if your reflexes are not up to par, if you have a low threshold of patience, and you expect it's world to welcome you and give you a handguided tour to the end credits, Heaven help you. In the wilds and dungeons outside the tranquil town hub, enemies come at you in droves and there is not a single one you will meet that is a pushover. Each one has a pattern of attack that demands study and practice, and just when you think you have that enemy figured out, and take him down, three more just like him take his place, and seconds into THAT fight, eight completely different NEW enemies show up, just for good measure. You've never seen them before, they're faster. Now young Skywalker, you WILL die.\n\nIt takes time and patience to learn how to fight, how to kill, how to live. It takes time to learn what it is you're even supposed to be doing with your life, such as it is, in the game overall.\n\nWhat are you trying to accomplish? Where do you go? The map you earn in the town hub, for example, gives you an idea of where things are, but only in symbols and vauge approximations of distance and location. You refer to the map rather than rely on it. And the assorted menagerie of beings who inhabit that tranquil town hub I mentioned? Most of them won't understand a word you say, and you won't understand them either. This is a genius move on the part of this dev team. You are in a world of visual communication. If there was literacy here, it's long gone, along with the ruined city. Those who you CAN understand, relay their stories entirely in images, and their information may or may not be in service of your vague quest. Even when you speak to the vendors in the hub, who offer new moves, weapons, and upgrades, they aren't giving you a clear picture of how to pay for those upgrades. You have to parse that out through exploring and figuring it out while delving and salvaging in the wilds.\n\nSome professional reviewers seem to fault the developers for choosing to be so cryptic, but they seem to miss the point. The game uses the atmosphere of it's world to relay the story, rather than depend on long tiring dialogues. It uses the environment to remind you over and over again, that you can only truly rely on yourself and your instincts. You are a Drifter after all, cut off from this alien culture you don't understand, trying to solve a mystery. And the only way to solve that mystery is to embrace it, descend into it, and accept the risk of death that comes with exploring it.\n\nHyper Light is an immersive experience, a doorway to another reality, and it is superbly put together. Control of the Drifter in and out of combat is simple and tight, but subtle pros and cons are attached to each part of your arsenal. For example, you can teleport a short distance in any direction you like, at any time. But each "blink" takes the briefest of instances to recover from. In a pitched battle, such an option of movement causes you to feel powerful and vulnerable all at once. Blink with skill and you feel like a god, blink wrong, and you've blinked your last.\n\nThe four world areas that seemlessly connect to the town are menacing, yet beautiful places which beg you to seek out every hidden wall, room, and underground labyrinth. The color paletes used to bring them to life are a delight to the eyes, lulling you into complacency, while warning you of the savagery they contain. A forest of trees with blood red leaves jut into the sky from ground where pale turquoise crystal spires are nestled in grasses of deep blue. Snow capped moutains of black and gray stone tower into the heavens, dead and dying villages of thatch and glowing gem computer boards hanging off their cliff faces like nests.\n\nThe sound design joins with the colors and leaves you in awe. Dungeons hum, with the thrums of forgotten computers and generators the size of skyscrapers rattling your subwooffer, wind moans through those snowcapped black mountain peaks and whipsers threateningly through those scarlet trees.  A seemingly endless and ethereal electronica soundtrack rounds out the package, ebbing and flowing over you like a tide. It grows in intensity the closer you come to a turning point, discovery, or conflict and changes subtly with each area explored.\n\nHyper Light Difter is indeed a game of atmosphere, mystery, death. It takes time to get to know, patience to learn, and it will not coddle you in any way. But it is also a game of life. It asks you to breathe and observe and contemplate and act. Like life it also takes time to know, patience to learn, and will not coddle you in any way, but not because it doesn't have confidence in you. Life is not easy, Hyper Light Drifter is not easy, but both are beautiful and worth exploring, even with the pain inherent in the process. HeartMachine has created a masterpiece of a game with a genuine soul. I am honored to play it, and while it makes me throw the controller down quite often, I continue to give it a chance and accept it as it is. I hope that many others will as well.","April 2","true","16.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/recommended/257850/","LordWeh","Lord Weh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/","344 products in account","I backed Hyper Light Drifter on Kickstarter for $40, which got me a copy of the game on launch, a giftable copy for a friend, and a copy of the digital soundtrack and digital art book.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a blend of its peers that seemingly inspired it; Studio Ghibli, Akira, Diablo, Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls. This is evident from the beautiful opening animation that stylishly hints at a greater world, one that seems to have been fractured by some nebulous but terrible event, beautiful but broken and now tainted by a spreading darkness. Atmospheric music and sound and wonderful pixel-art work together to create a hand-crafted and gentle neon apocalypse tinged with grittiness.\n\nAfter a short intro sequence that sets the scene and provides some minimal tutorial, you are off into the world. There are dungeons to go into, bosses to defeat, weapons to upgrade, secrets to find. It's part Diablo and Legend of Zelda in terms of moment-to-moment gameplay, by way of Dark Souls in terms of storytelling and difficulty. This is a difficult game. But don't let that put you off. When you die you respawn at the last checkpoint (they are numerous, at a minimum once per 'area transition', but often more frequent). The challenge comes in trying to learn the enemies, how they move, what they do, and then deal with them with a minimum loss of resources. The bosses, all of which I found fun, are actual credible challenges requiring multiple attempts. They require you to learn their moves and timings, to vary your tactics, to try again and again, learning a little more each time until you can get them. And you will get them, eventually. They each took me about 20 - 60 attempts, some taking a couple of hours to master. On one I had to go away, thinking that returning later with new items and unlocks would help, but ultimately it was all about learning, timing, and trying again.\n\nI completed the game in about 20 hours, which included a lot of travelling off the beaten path looking for secrets. The game is divided into three 'regions', and a fourth that unlocks once the other three are complete. In these regions you have several 'dungeons', partly linear but with multiple entrances and routes through the regions, it always feels like there is a lot to explore. You'll get lost, you'll go in circles, you'll find dead-ends and eventually begin to figure out the layout and what the requirements are for advancing in each area, you'll discover secrets... I was immersed in this cycle of exploration, discovery, challenge and story. I've seen some people say they've completed the game in about 6 - 7 hours, I can only assume they are much, much better at the boss fights than me, and likely made a dash for the finish line and ignored most hidden areas and side content.\n\nIn terms of story, whilst it is by no means groundbreaking, it is well told and does a good job of immersing you in the world of Hyper Light Drifter. I loved it, it is understated and subtle and slow, hinted at rather than told outright. Ruins, bodies, glimpsed vistas, flashbacks and so-on will drip-feed you the context-delivered story. There is no dialogue, no text to read, you discover it all through images and discovering scenes and putting pieces together. Each region has its own story thread, that ties into the piece as a whole, and you discover some context through finding survivors and other wandering adventurers who offer a glimpse of context through some pixel-art still scenes of their experiences. At the end of it all, I'm not 100% certain I understood what transpired, but I have an idea, the essence of the story pulled me into it and immersed me, I was going with the broader strokes and the finer details seemed unimportant come the final showdown.","April 3","true","19.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198155555655/recommended/257850/","76561198155555655","Josh F","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198155555655/","23 products in account","Hyper Light Drifter is an excellent video game by Heart Machine. A few of its influences are clear from the get-go, such as the top down Zelda games, and having played through it, even recent games such as Bloodborne came to mind. That said it is still its own thing, with its own strong identity. This is helped by the brilliant art direction and pixel art animation, which is hard to fault. Disasterpeace’s soundtrack is moody, atmospheric and just plain gorgeous. The goal of the game is to activate the four pillars located in the Northern, Western, Eastern, and Southern areas.\n\nThe game could best be described as action adventure, with a heavy emphasis on combat. You start the game with a sword and pistol, as well as the ability to dash. Using the combination of these three tools is key to progressing through the game.  The combat can be fast at times, although in some trickier areas a slow approach may be advisable. The enemies are well varied, with some being particularly aggressive. Most of these feel challenging and yet fair, although a certain plant enemy did aggravate me especially with its hard-hitting attacks. Often you may need to switch up the way you face the larger enemies, and it helps the combat from becoming too repetitive.\n\nYou will find various other weapons throughout the game, and also purchase new abilities or upgrades. In the main hub area you can find a selection of shops to do so, and deciding what to spend your currency on can be difficult in itself. Unlike many games such as the Zelda series, the currency is a rare resource, with 4 small ‘blocks’ being used to make a big one. The big ones are then used to purchase new gear. These blocks are found hidden among the environment, or after defeating certain enemies and bosses. If you find an area or boss too difficult, you may want to search these out as the upgrades can help tremendously in the long run.\n\nExploration is another big aspect of the game. From the outset, you have access to three of four main areas - each having a unique look and feel. These are linked to underground areas, which are filled with hidden paths and secrets. Finding the majority of these hidden paths isn’t required to complete the game, but there are still some you may need to find to progress. This brings me to the map, which I feel could have done with a little improvement, since it can be a little dubious at times. A marker system, similar to the one found in Axiom Verge, could have been a great addition especially when looking for a particular item or place. Of all the areas, I found the eastern area to be particularly confusing when going back to search for secrets.\n\nThe boss battles are by far the biggest challenge in the game. The bosses guard the pillars at the end of the areas, and, as in games such as Dark Souls, can be as frustrating to fight as they are rewarding to defeat. Each will test your skills, in both dodging and attacking. Again the variety here is great, with each presenting a different process to defeat them. And well done Heart Machine to making retrying so painless; if you die in an area you start the area again with exactly what you entered it with. This makes it easy to get straight back into the action, and I feel a lot of modern games could learn from this (although loading times can’t be helped in games sometimes, but that’s another discussion in itself.)\n\nMusic and sound design are excellent; from the more ambient sound to the more upbeat tracks everything suits the design of the game. The sounds are great, such as the satisfying noise from your sword swings or the little beeps your companion makes, nothing felt out of place. Overall both music and sound only enriched the game experience.\n\nHaving taken around 16 hours to complete Hyper Light Drifter I’m extremely satisfied with the game, and yet I also want to go and play more, to discover all the hidden secrets I’m yet to find. Far from an easy game, it may put a few people off, but bear with it and you’ve got an excellent adventure. I found the game as compelling as it was addictive. While there have been a few bumps in the release, Alex Preston and his team has delivered a quality video game, one that I hope many others will play and enjoy. Their hard work and dedication should be recognized with such a well-crafted game.\n\nI can’t wait for whatever is next.","April 4","true","18.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Classic NES gameplay action. Intellectually satisfying. Ambient, beautiful music which never gets tired and always adds to the dark atmosphere. Text-free storyline and sub-plots. Easily some of the best pixel art ever to grace a video game. Possibly my favorite animation since Jordan Mechner's original Prince of Persia.\n\nCriticism of this game has been confined to difficulty. These gripes are legit if you're too young to have played 80s-90s classics like the first Castlevania games, games which were challenging on a level that makes Skyrim and Fallout look embarrassing by comparison. This game is not a walk in the park. You should not buy it for the pretty pictures alone. Expect to *play* this game. You'll need skills and brains.\n\nAs for critics saying, "First boss is impossible, I quit --" this mentality is a lot like, "Great Expectations was an excellent novel until it got too hard for me to read."\n\nZelda's overworld + Metroidvania game motifs + art for miles + thought-provoking puzzles + evocative storytelling = indie GotY.\n\nGet a copy. Don't even wait for Steam sales or Humble Bundles (which may not happen). This game is *easily* worth 20 USD. If you liked the original Zelda for NES, Castlevania IV -- Symphony of the Night, and/or Super Metroid on SNES, then this should be one of the best games you've played in a long time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mephiles/recommended/257850/","Mephiles","Daemon Mephiles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mephiles/","195 products in account","After waiting for this game for 2 years.  It finally arrived, but at the cost of the game promised kickstarter strech goals features, that is still on the way.  Thankfully the base game itself is very much a complete experience.  Don't expect a long game, it will take you about 5 or 6 hours to complete.  Which to me is fine and the replay value is pretty high.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a top down action/adventure game that is set in a mysterious Cyberpunk/Fantasy world of the unknown.  You play as a Drifter who suffers from a nasty disease and must traverse into this strange unknown land to find a cure, while dealing with all sorts of pearls.  The story has no dialogue, its instead told by the visuals and photos of what has transpired here.  It offers good clues and histroy about this world before everything became a nightmare.  I only wish the game did expand upon it, if it did have more levels.  Hopefully it'll come in later weeks or months.\n\nGameplay is probably one of the most fun experience I had in 2016.  It mixes combat bits from Bloodborne, Legend of Zelda and Diablo into a single game.  The result is a brutal, challenging combat I have ever played.  Be warned that it's one tough game, but I honestly think it's one of the most fair games ever made.  There's not one moment that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me the hell off.  A lot of deaths will come by your actions, so you have to be very careful on how you deal with tough situations in either 4 levels that you can start with at anytime.  Boss Fights are fun and fair, the enemies are designed well enough (thou I wished they added more, but we'll see.), the controls and combat mechanics are solid.  I do recommend playing with the controller either the PS4 or 360 is up to you.  The Keyboard & Mouse controls are underwhelming, it's very customizable but the experience is better played with the controller.  Level design is solid with good amount of secrets to find and loads of hidden story bits to discover.  You'll be sucking the life outta this game for some time, if you want to see it all.\n\nVisually, it's one fine looking game.  I do think most indie games that tried so hard to capture the old school visuals of the past, but Hyper Light Drifter to me looks more interesting than Undertale.  The detail is solid and the animations are slick and beautiful to look at.  The Soundtrack is also good and it fits well to the game's grim nature.\n\nOverall: While Hyper Light Drifter doesn't provide the ultimate complete experience that we were promised but I do hope Hearts Machine will continue supporting this game for quite awhile.  There's a lot of love been put into this title.  It isn't perfect as the game short lengh and only 4 levels begs for more.  But I strongly recommend this game.  It's challenging, fun and highly replayable.  It might be the best indie game since Shovel Knight.","April 1","true","17.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

World is unique and very serene, especially with the lovely Disasterpiece music.\n\nGoing in gameplay can seem pretty challenging but once you learn the ropes you gain a lot of momentum (and because of this difficult curve can lower off midway through)\n\nExploring is fun and exciting but the backtracking not so much,  the map design is unique but difficult to understand.  Looking for that last collectible in an area turns into a big chore.\n\nBut all that aside I enjoyed it enough to beat it basically overnight,  combat is fast quick and satisfying and bosses even more so.

I saw it and knew it was going to be a game right in my wheelhouse, so I am a bit biased towards the game from that perspective. I have about 2 hours into Hyper Light Drifter and it is wonderful.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, the controls are satisfying, and the soundtrack is very atmospheric. If you like atmospheric games with a more skill-based lean than story-driven narrative, this game will be right up your alley. I honestly have very little understanding of what is happening in the story or why my character is driven to do the things he is doing but I'm really likining the game regardless.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is the 30fps lock. I really wish this game was able to get up to 60fps. Occasionally the frames dip as well when there are a lot of enemies on the screen and my computer is pretty powerful so this may be a struggle for lower end PCs. On the other hand, my CPU is my bottleneck so that could be the issue.\n\nPlay this game, If you're anything like me you'll enjoy the hell out of it.","April 2","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm not an animator, but as someone who creates from animated source material, I appreciate the attention to detail on visuals, which match that of games developed on a scale larger than even its own. The omission of any text from NPC interactions, and even the skill tree, recalls the minuscule nature of Journey, resulting in an experience that transcends spoken languages. The soundtrack is good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shroud3d/recommended/257850/","Shroud3d","Shroud3d","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shroud3d/","184 products in account","Okay, so I'm a little bit torn on this one. It's still a recommendation, but only barely.\n\nThe gameplay is solid. It's part Dark Souls, part 2D Zelda, part Metroidvania. You run around and slash up baddies, collect some guns and fight huge bosses. Basically what you expect from a 2D exploration game.\n\nEverything else though...it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is wrong, but I'll give it a shot. The game is very minimalist and this was done so by choice. There is no real story, no interaction with NPCs other than watching a few pictures, and the map is god awful. You will get lost just because the map says you're somewhere you're not. At that point, just remove the map altogether please.\n\nThe fact that it's an "open world" game does not make a lot of sense to me either. Here's why.\nFrom the starting point, you can go in 3 directions and buy sword, dash, health and gun upgrades with your funds. These directions and upgrades are not at all similar in terms of difficulty and knowing which way to go and which upgrade to purchase is almost crucial to make the later parts of the game easier to handle. Yes, we could argue that placing the items and areas in a set order would make it a lot more similar to traditional Metroidvania style games, but those games are good for a reason. Now, some new players will turn away from this game with a bad taste in their mouth because they didn't go the right direction or buy the right upgrades and were overwhelmed.\n\nOnce you figure out you can in fact go those three directions right from the get-go and buy the double dash and the dash that blocks bullets, the game becomes pretty interesting. Finding strategies for all the enemies and bosses is actually pretty fun, and the devs made sure that even the normal enemies can be challenging. The areas look pretty good, too. The game expresses its own art style, which is hard to do in a world with thousands of indie games per day that are very similar.\n\nThere are 4 major bosses and a final boss, and each area takes a couple of hours at most. The game is not very long in that regard, but there are a ton of optional secrets you can find. I would go back to find all these secrets, but the fact that the map is not at all helpful in any way kinda turns me away from this. To clarify: the secrets are usually hidden by a wall that looks exactly like a normal wall, so you'll find yourself derping into every single wall in hopes of finding them. I'm not particularly looking forward to doing this when there's no map to tell me I've already been there.\n\nWhat I'd really like to see is a patch that includes an actually useful map. Also, make the double dash and protective dash the first upgrades that you have to buy before you can buy anything else. That way, new players can't go wrong anymore and everyone can enjoy the game for what it is.\n","April 8","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

HLD is one of the first games in a while that feels like I'm developing a unique skillset through playing it. So many games now rely on artificial progression systems in the form of rising statistics to add that feeling. There are unlocks in this game, but I'm the one getting better at playing it, not just my character. The different abilities complement each other well once you learn to use them.\n\nHLD might be one of those games that could be great to come into knowing nothing about it. On the other hand, I've found that knowing about the lead developer's heart condition has changed how I see the game in interesting ways. You're free to see what you want in the imagery. But what I've seen so far is a story about a character with a terminal illness, wandering a dying world in search of something. And the quality of the art and sound really helps to sell the gravitas of that story.\n\nBe warned that the game is not easy. Some of the bosses are very difficult, in my opinion. But the game is open enough that you can always come back to an area later if you get stuck. There is a lot to explore, and the game rewards you for doing so. There are many times when you may have more options than you think.","April 13","true","15.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Played two hours of actual game so far with the other seven being the Preview Build.\n\nSo far, I have to say that the combat is great and requires you to think rather than just mash the button over and over to defeat enemies, there is a variety of things to purchase and unlock with the golden things you find through the world that make your character and weapons better, the soundtrack is great and probably my favorite from Disasterpeace, the intro cutscene was amazing from the looks to the music and forboding feel, there are many things to find and collect in the world along with many hidden areas that are sure to give the dedicated of explorers many smiles during their playtime, I like the game having no text to read from characters and such-all dialogue is done through pictures when you talk to a character, them basically showing you what they are trying to say which gives the player the feel of piecing the story together and wondering what has happened to these characters, the game plays wonderful on a controller-I dont understand at all people complaining about the dashing or the combat in the slightest because every feels very tight and crisp, the visuals are great with a varied color pallete that is distinct for each of the four main lands of the game, enemies are varied in my opinion and all look great and have somewhat different behaviors, and lastly the animation on everything in the world and distinctness between every character you see and meet is rather nice and makes you feel like these people are making do in a world with dangers all around this city.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone that enjoys rpgs in the veign of Link to the Past and the challenge and patience of Dark Souls style combat.\n\nPart 2 - 17.5 hours full release completion\n\nBasically all the stuff I said in the first review along with some extras. All the bosses were interesting and having some level of strategy to them with the things that made each of them unique from one another. The use of upgrades for both your weapons and your dash ability is super satisfying, killing the final boss with six of his projectiles reflected back at him was awesome. I personally enjoyed the story being told only through images, cinematics, and the areas instead of text like most other games. Each area was unique in design and asthetic and had some sort of backstory you could learn from the npc you can talk to in each area. As you play the game you are likely to grow attached to the other drifter you meet in each area and feel terrible and it is your duty to avenge him when he eventually dies. The six different guns in the game are, well, different from one another and call all be used to take on a situation differently whether you want to snipe at a distance, shotgun up close, or use a pistol as a utility between sword attacks. Half of the people in the forums are great people and have come together to find many interesting secrets, help one another, and even translate the igname language. The other half cant stop complaining about 30fps which doesnt bother everyone in the world and some people mentioned in the Special Thanks part of the credits (btw, the ST part of the credits is nearly always pooled from all the devs in any production, meaning that the ideals and thanks of one can completely conflict with the ideals and thanks of the others. It's like we're all human or something). All the different equipment sets provide you many different passive abilities that provide some extra replayability and thought when going into a boss fight or an area for the first time. Personally, my current favorite build is BlueWhite for my companion, Pink sword, and White cloak. There's also alot of collectibles for anyone that likes to get everything out of a game.\n\nOverall, this game was a great 17.5 hour adventure rpg (nearly 100%) with great combat, visuals, soundtrack, and an interesting story with a bitter-sweet ending. I recommend it to anyone in need of a fun game that requires you to think and recommends searching every nook and cranny.","March 31","true","35.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I will regard it as one of my dream games.\n\nI can go on about the breathtaking pixel artstyle and excellent sound design... but I will choose not to as you already can get the hint from the trailers and other users.\n\nWhat I will be describing here is my personal unbiased experience of the gameplay.\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Fluid and Responsive combat: that requires the right timing in order to overcome your enemies. Every enemy has a window of oppurtunity to strike them hard including the super challenging bosses. Resulting in a deadly dance of death as you drift around the battle field slashing your enemies before they can strke you and drifting away at just the right moment. Rarely have I played a combat so satisfying, easy to learn and hard to master.\n\n2) Bosses: seldom have I faced challenge in recent past when a game threw me a boss. Reminded me of the goold old days when overcoming a boss felt like a real achievement to show off. Every boss fight is unique and memorable!\n\nThose negative reviews that you have been reading about super hard bosses is only a complaint of people who didn't try enough. Personally it took me around 10 tries for each boss to beat (including the last one). I am not a super pro at games and consider myself average.\n\nThe key is knowing your enemy and timing your attacks and using your upgraded abilities by thinking on your feet. It is NOT unfair. Bosses are supposed to be super hard. Deal with it.\n\n3) Exploration: The world of HLD is brimming with secrets galore... every nook and cranny can lead to a secret pathway containing rare gold artifact that you can use to buy upgrades for your arsenal.\n\n4) Enemy Variety: Every region has seprate enemy units, behaviour and asthetics. Never did the game become boring slash and hack button smasher as every new enemy makes you think on your feet to deal with.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1) Short: yes you might argue good things come in small packages but yes I believe they could have expanded each region further and add more sidequests than the overarching quest you already have. More dugeons would have helped feel the RPG and exploration aspect too. However they chose to focus and make this game purely action oriented. A lost oppurtunity if you ask me.\n\nThe intense actions sequences could have been more paced out with longer gameplay and the loot collection meta game could have breathed more space with more environments and dungeons.\n\n2) Upgrades: Though each sword and dash upgrade is unique and useful in their own way, I felt guns could have  been added with more interesting modules and addons such that modifies the shot pattern or bullets. They could have hidden these modules in secret places to make things more interesting... instead of plain upgrades to magazine.\n\nBastion is a fine example of how to enhance gameplay by adding tactical addons to your existing arsenal. I felt HLD creators lost a lot of oppurtunity here in that regard.\n\n3) Lack of Adventure: You already have all the map revealed to you in the very beginning of the game. I felt it kind of personally took away the wonder and adventure of the game which is based on exploration. Yes the map is abstract, yes you dont know the terrain or the enemy positions of the regions before you visit them, and yet I felt kind of put off by it.\n\n4) No proper quest system: Except your main quest you never encounter any NPCs giving you sidequests of clearing dungeouns / discovering hidden artifacts in lost temples. This serously kind of bummed me as I expected it to be an Action-Adventure-RPG instead they focused it on Action-RPG.\n\nThis could have elivated the game to an altogether different level. Side quests could have been equally cryptic in nature I wouldn't have mind that.\n\nThe game therefore feels a LONG fetch quest for your main questline.\n\n\nRECOMMENDED If you like intense action RPG with a challenging gameplay and breathtaking art and sound production. HLD is one of those rare gems that comes out once a while.\n\nIt has its shortcomings only because they could have made this into a even bigger and better masterpiece of a game than what it already is.\n\nRating (if that matters): 8.5/10","April 4","true","23.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a game about a person (Let's just call him/her Drifter) that's on a journey through an old land of corpses, mutants and lost technologies. The game has solid controls (Controller recommended). They are always tight and responsive, although sometimes I feels as if they may be off, but I probably just suck. The game is already great, and that's shown even more with the beautiful soundtrack and stunning 8 bit visuals. Just looking at it, not even playing it, you can tell that Heart Machine really poured their love for gaming into this masterful  piece.\n\nSince the game has very responsive controls, it has a high difficulty. At many times, it felt unbeatable. But that just makes the emotional reward and love so much better and "Oh so sweet" when you pass a trial. The combat has quite a bit of strategy from what I can tell. Drifter can attack 3 times before he/she gets winded. This is critical in fights because you have to know when and when not to attack an enemy. Successfully hitting an enemy fills up your gun gauge. This of course allows you to shoot. You can also bust random junk around the world to fill it up, making you think about and look for objects to smash. Drifter can also dash to dodge and move from platform to platform. Be aware though, the dash cannot faze through bullets. I learned this the hard way. It's better to use it to zip from cover to cover when swarmed with enemies.\n\nThe dialogue of this game is nonexistent, but clever. Characters never speak, but tell stories in pictures. It gives you a clue as to what they've done or are going to do. I feel this really immerses me alot more than speaking, because the speaking wouldn't fit this kind of game. I feel too as if it goes perfectly with the music score.\n\nIf you're interested in a game that's challenging, visually stunning, beautifully crafted and immersive, than give this a go.\n\nI highly recommend it 10/10","April 6","true","41.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleathedjinn/recommended/257850/","fleathedjinn","Baby-Legs O'Houlihan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleathedjinn/","383 products in account","Hyper Light Drifter (HLD) is a seamless mix of beauty and frustration. The aesthetics are beautiful, but you'll become frustrated by the horribly designed map and UI. The combat is gorgeously fun, but you'll hit a few brick walls in the form of highly difficult enemy group compositions and bosses. The story is lovely in its simplicity, but baffling in its vagueness. It's a battle you'll face between eliciting ooo's at the beauty and AHHH's at the frustrations. What HLD manages to achieve, much how the Soulsborne games have, is balance the difficulty well and make the gameplay so fun that you're willing to throw yourself against the fray again and again just so you have an excuse to play more, and hopefully progress.\n\nStory\nThe story is deceptively simple. What it tells you is just enough to convince you that your hero has motivation to progress in their quest, but withholds enough to leave something to be discovered. There's a detachment between you and the character. The character clearly knows more than you do, but has no means or reason to explain it all to you. Even the information you get from NPCs is not spelled out for you, literally. The denizens of this world all speak in grunts and clicks, but their words are displayed for you in the form of pictures. This kind of story telling is a brilliant way to convey information and one I've always admired.\n\nThe lack of a language (aside from the monoliths, whose unique language is there for something for devout players to decode to get extra information) is also a problem for the player as much as it is a refreshing take. Maps and inventory management is all wordless, and littered with overdesign. The map is virtually useless and will never tell you where you are exactly, just a very general location.\n\nThe story doesn't really unfold through your actions. Every major step toward the end goal is just another chance for the game to bombard you with the same few scenes that you saw at the start, all of which detail either the future or events that have shaped your hero's motivations. Instead, you're expected to infer the story through your environment and the few interactions you have with other characters. Soulsborne does this much in the same way, but it has the added benefit of item descriptions to lay down some more connecting fibers. In any case, you can either play through the game and form your own hypothesis about the story or read forums, subreddits, and watch summary videos.\n\nGameplay\nI mentioned before that this game is beautiful and frustrating, and that the beautiful gameplay helps to push you to want to overcome the frustrating difficulty. The game is all about its fast and fluid combat, peppered with some exploration and secret finding. Both combat and exploration are equally rewarding and enticing, calling you to tackle both with the same measure of dedication over how simply they are founded by complex they are in their execution.\n\nYour first task in HLD is to explore. You pick a path of one of three cardinal directions and set out on your journey to that quadrant's unique ecology. The first few zones, broken up by a fade-to-black transition, are peaceful, serene. The monsters do not live directly on the outskirts of the centralized city. This allows you to familiarize yourself with the environment, and also find a few secrets.\n\nSecrets are found either by running along the walls and finding a hidden alcove or finding invisible platforms to dash onto and find a nearby island of goodies. Once you understand this is how all secrets are hidden, you'll be running along the outskirts of every zone you find. Yet, the secrets are so plentiful that this never feels tedious or unrewarding. They offer resources that are sparse and you are happy to receive them.\n\nThe other half of the gameplay is combat, which is split into thirds: dashing, slashing, and shooting. Movement in combat depends on your dashing between enemies, either to escape or to close the gap and strike. Dashing is fixed to three quick dashes and a short recovery before you can execute those three again. Slashing is much of the same, where you are allowed three quick hits with your sword before having a second to recharge. Shooting is to be used to take out far off enemies that are too dangerous to approach directly or if you want to destroy those last few pips of their health, safely.\n\nObviously, combat is designed very simply. Even the upgrades are few as to not over complicate the process. However, enemies are smart, and many have moves that can take out almost half your health in a single attack. Some will trap you in a pattern and kill you without you realizing what happened. Each enemy has their own tactics and its up to you to figure those out and exploit the weakness in them. Does an enemy dash at you to attack? Bait them into readying their dash, and then dash before they hit you, then close the gap and hit them while they're recharging.\n\nBosses operate on the same rules, just turned up to 11. In typical boss fashion, they are faster, stronger, and have far more health than their minions. Still, if you remember the principles of learning the pattern and exploiting the weakness, they can be taken down just like any other enemy. Again the Soulsborne comparison is made. Bosses are tough, but they rarely feel so difficult that you want to quit the game for being unfair (there's only one boss that I felt was overly difficult, the Western boss).\n\nAudio/Visual\nVisually this game is a treasure. It reminds us that pixel graphics is one of the most beautiful video game art styles to date. Other indie devs need to take note and remember that pixels should not just be a cheap and easy fallback for when graphics are too hard to do for their game. Everything in this game's environment is loaded with so much obvious passion and talent for the craft. On more than one occasion I had to stop and admire the vistas of overgrown ruins and the corpses of giants. Too often a game is judged on a screenshot, thereby stripping away so many of the elements that make it work as a whole and painting an unfair portrait of the game. However, with HLD, the visuals are so strong that a screenshot alone could convince someone to play the game without knowing another detail.\n\nMusically...the game kind of falls flat. The opening track is a haunting, synth-laden, and mesmerizing piece that really got me excited to hear more of what the game would give me, audio-wise. However, all the music after that is very bland, repeating itself after only a few seconds, over and over. The music is dreary, uninteresting, and doesn't help to motivate me or paint a good picture of what the world is like. Thankfully the visual art is there to pick up the slack and then some.\n\nConclusion\nHLD is a work of passion and vision, first and foremost. It's a game that takes simple elements and makes them seem gigantic with how they are utilized. A basic combat system feels engaging, overwhelming, and exciting to master. The rudimentary art style of pixilated graphics is expertly utilized to create stunning and shocking environments and monsters. Exploration, as a concept, is limited in its components but never feels hollow, and is instead an enjoyable experience. The story, while vague, gives you just enough to get you started and leaves the rest scattered about the game world for you to discover.\n\nStill, it's not perfect, and in its quest of "the beauty of simplicity," HLD forgets some necessary elements. The story isn't developed enough, and the music feels uninspired and redundant. More puzzles would have been nice, and exploration, while fun, could have done with more ways to be conducted. I fully expect people to say $20 is too much for a 5-7 hour game, but assigning a monetary value to hours of content rather than the quality of content itself can only do a disservice to those nay-sayers.","April 6","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's minimalistic, mysterious. Its lore is interesting to dig up.\n+ Fighting's done very well; it's fast-paced and you can always be in control.\n+ Level design of most areas is impressive, most secrets have some hint.\n+ Overall boss fights are challenging and interesting.\n+ Enemies are somewhat varied...\n\n- ...although each has max 2 attacks and most have only one.\n- There are only few interesting characters/stories in the world. And they are short and simple.\n- In some fights game throws at you large numbers of same type of enemies - it's challenging, but it's not interesting (conversly some fights have waves set up really well).\n- "open-world' doesn't work for me in this game. The world feels too small and cramped. I feel like it would work better in Demon's Souls style world with warpins only from/to selected places and no direct connections between the hub and the zones.\n- weapon upgrading is just redundant in its currect form.\n- some secrets require wall-hugging/sixth sense to be found.\n- map is useful only for collecting modules\n- Big problem is the amount of content that's not present in final product, although you can see it in 2014 trailer and Kickstarter goals. Bosses, weapons, areas, modes. Even without knowing about it you can fell the game is rushed, especially in South-surface area.\n\nOverall the game's functional (for me), and it's fun that's why I still recommend it, but at the same time I know that HM can do much better. I think that just the scope of what they wanted to make was too much for them, that's why the cuts.\n\nSo why I recommend preview build?\nIt's essentialy the best designed section of the final game, but designed even better. It feels much more complete and coherent. Every secret has some hint, no wall-hugging's needed. It has nearly all that final game nails, and omits elements that didn't work out as much. You only have to accept the fact that it's just a preview build, so it's 2h long.\n\nPS I might edit this review later if anything will spring to mind.","April 1","true","15.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I stumbled upon it on the day it released because I happened to see it on the front page of steam and decided to give it a try, I had no idea it was pretty much exactly the game I've been looking for. By the time you read this you'll probably have already seen the beautiful pixel art, but the gameplay and story that compliment it are really what made this game great, if you ask me.\n\nGameplay: I'm a big fan of metroidvania style games, with the 3D ones I've played being my favorites (Metroid Prime and Dark Souls, mostly). This game incorporated elements of some of my favorites, the fair but challenging difficulty of Dark Souls, and the exploration and upgrades I enjoyed from the Metroid series. The gameplay is similar to games like the 2D Legend of Zeldas and the Diablo series, and boy is it satisfying. The controls are precise and the combat is fast paced, making every fight a struggle for your life. With the upgrades and different weapons you can find, you always have a number of options for how you approach each group of enemies, which are always varied and interesting.\n\nStory: This game has no words, no text, no numbers. The story is told entirely wordlessly, but what a powerful story it is. It's best if you play the game yourself, but I'll say that the story was influenced/inspired by the health issues lead creator of this game, Alex Preson, has dealt with all his life. I love environmental storytelling, and this game did it very well. I got a sense of this deep and tragic world, its inhabitants struggling to survive in the wake of incomprehensible destruction. The details are unclear, but that's what I love about this style of storytelling, much is left up to interperetation and I'm certain there's more I could learn by playing the game again to explore areas I missed on my first time through.\n\nDifficulty: If what I've said so far makes the game sound like it's one you'd like, be warned. This game is very difficult! With only 5 health points and some enemy attacks that do two damage, you can die very quickly. You have to be careful and make split second decisions in the thick of a fight, such as "Do I try to dodge the next attack and heal, or go in for the kill?" Any indecision and you may not survive. The boss fights are excellent, but don't leave much room for error. I found myself starting over many times on each of them, and sometimes surviving with only one health and no health packs left. However, despite this difficulty, the game is fair. I always felt like it was my fault and I could learn something from how I died, and when I finally triumphed, that made it even more rewarding.\n\nBasically, the only things I would warn you about are the potentially prohibitive difficulty and shorter length of the game (about 7.5 hours for me, that's without exploring for hidden areas much). Nevertheless, if you enjoy fast paced gameplay akin to the 2D Legend of Zelda games, don't mind--or think you would enjoy--the challenge the game offers, and like environmental storytelling, you should absoultely give this game a try!","April 2","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mephiles/recommended/257850/","Mephiles","Daemon Mephiles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mephiles/","195 products in account","After waiting for this game for 2 years.  It finally arrived, but at the cost of the game promised kickstarter strech goals features, that is still on the way.  Thankfully the base game itself is very much a complete experience.  Don't expect a long game, it will take you about 5 or 6 hours to complete.  Which to me is fine and the replay value is pretty high.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a top down action/adventure game that is set in a mysterious Cyberpunk/Fantasy world of the unknown.  You play as a Drifter who suffers from a nasty disease and must traverse into this strange unknown land to find a cure, while dealing with all sorts of pearls.  The story has no dialogue, its instead told by the visuals and photos of what has transpired here.  It offers good clues and histroy about this world before everything became a nightmare.  I only wish the game did expand upon it, if it did have more levels.  Hopefully it'll come in later weeks or months.\n\nGameplay is probably one of the most fun experience I had in 2016.  It mixes combat bits from Bloodborne, Legend of Zelda and Diablo into a single game.  The result is a brutal, challenging combat I have ever played.  Be warned that it's one tough game, but I honestly think it's one of the most fair games ever made.  There's not one moment that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me the hell off.  A lot of deaths will come by your actions, so you have to be very careful on how you deal with tough situations in either 4 levels that you can start with at anytime.  Boss Fights are fun and fair, the enemies are designed well enough (thou I wished they added more, but we'll see.), the controls and combat mechanics are solid.  I do recommend playing with the controller either the PS4 or 360 is up to you.  The Keyboard & Mouse controls are underwhelming, it's very customizable but the experience is better played with the controller.  Level design is solid with good amount of secrets to find and loads of hidden story bits to discover.  You'll be sucking the life outta this game for some time, if you want to see it all.\n\nVisually, it's one fine looking game.  I do think most indie games that tried so hard to capture the old school visuals of the past, but Hyper Light Drifter to me looks more interesting than Undertale.  The detail is solid and the animations are slick and beautiful to look at.  The Soundtrack is also good and it fits well to the game's grim nature.\n\nOverall: While Hyper Light Drifter doesn't provide the ultimate complete experience that we were promised but I do hope Hearts Machine will continue supporting this game for quite awhile.  There's a lot of love been put into this title.  It isn't perfect as the game short lengh and only 4 levels begs for more.  But I strongly recommend this game.  It's challenging, fun and highly replayable.  It might be the best indie game since Shovel Knight.","April 1","true","17.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

World is unique and very serene, especially with the lovely Disasterpiece music.\n\nGoing in gameplay can seem pretty challenging but once you learn the ropes you gain a lot of momentum (and because of this difficult curve can lower off midway through)\n\nExploring is fun and exciting but the backtracking not so much,  the map design is unique but difficult to understand.  Looking for that last collectible in an area turns into a big chore.\n\nBut all that aside I enjoyed it enough to beat it basically overnight,  combat is fast quick and satisfying and bosses even more so.  There are many complaints about framerate, checkpoints, and the minimal ui but none of this was a problem for me (I also played with Keyboard+Mouse and didnt have much trouble)\n\nGet this game!","April 2","true","15.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I saw it and knew it was going to be a game right in my wheelhouse, so I am a bit biased towards the game from that perspective. I have about 2 hours into Hyper Light Drifter and it is wonderful.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, the controls are satisfying, and the soundtrack is very atmospheric. If you like atmospheric games with a more skill-based lean than story-driven narrative, this game will be right up your alley. I honestly have very little understanding of what is happening in the story or why my character is driven to do the things he is doing but I'm really likining the game regardless.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is the 30fps lock. I really wish this game was able to get up to 60fps. Occasionally the frames dip as well when there are a lot of enemies on the screen and my computer is pretty powerful so this may be a struggle for lower end PCs. On the other hand, my CPU is my bottleneck so that could be the issue.\n\nPlay this game, If you're anything like me you'll enjoy the hell out of it.","April 2","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Played two hours of actual game so far with the other seven being the Preview Build.\n\nSo far, I have to say that the combat is great and requires you to think rather than just mash the button over and over to defeat enemies, there is a variety of things to purchase and unlock with the golden things you find through the world that make your character and weapons better, the soundtrack is great and probably my favorite from Disasterpeace, the intro cutscene was amazing from the looks to the music and forboding feel, there are many things to find and collect in the world along with many hidden areas that are sure to give the dedicated of explorers many smiles during their playtime, I like the game having no text to read from characters and such-all dialogue is done through pictures when you talk to a character, them basically showing you what they are trying to say which gives the player the feel of piecing the story together and wondering what has happened to these characters, the game plays wonderful on a controller-I dont understand at all people complaining about the dashing or the combat in the slightest because every feels very tight and crisp, the visuals are great with a varied color pallete that is distinct for each of the four main lands of the game, enemies are varied in my opinion and all look great and have somewhat different behaviors, and lastly the animation on everything in the world and distinctness between every character you see and meet is rather nice and makes you feel like these people are making do in a world with dangers all around this city.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone that enjoys rpgs in the veign of Link to the Past and the challenge and patience of Dark Souls style combat.\n\nPart 2 - 17.5 hours full release completion\n\nBasically all the stuff I said in the first review along with some extras. All the bosses were interesting and having some level of strategy to them with the things that made each of them unique from one another. The use of upgrades for both your weapons and your dash ability is super satisfying, killing the final boss with six of his projectiles reflected back at him was awesome. I personally enjoyed the story being told only through images, cinematics, and the areas instead of text like most other games. Each area was unique in design and asthetic and had some sort of backstory you could learn from the npc you can talk to in each area. As you play the game you are likely to grow attached to the other drifter you meet in each area and feel terrible and it is your duty to avenge him when he eventually dies. The six different guns in the game are, well, different from one another and call all be used to take on a situation differently whether you want to snipe at a distance, shotgun up close, or use a pistol as a utility between sword attacks. Half of the people in the forums are great people and have come together to find many interesting secrets, help one another, and even translate the igname language. The other half cant stop complaining about 30fps which doesnt bother everyone in the world and some people mentioned in the Special Thanks part of the credits (btw, the ST part of the credits is nearly always pooled from all the devs in any production, meaning that the ideals and thanks of one can completely conflict with the ideals and thanks of the others. It's like we're all human or something). All the different equipment sets provide you many different passive abilities that provide some extra replayability and thought when going into a boss fight or an area for the first time. Personally, my current favorite build is BlueWhite for my companion, Pink sword, and White cloak. There's also alot of collectibles for anyone that likes to get everything out of a game.\n\nOverall, this game was a great 17.5 hour adventure rpg (nearly 100%) with great combat, visuals, soundtrack, and an interesting story with a bitter-sweet ending. I recommend it to anyone in need of a fun game that requires you to think and recommends searching every nook and cranny.","March 31","true","35.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I will regard it as one of my dream games.\n\nI can go on about the breathtaking pixel artstyle and excellent sound design... but I will choose not to as you already can get the hint from the trailers and other users.\n\nWhat I will be describing here is my personal unbiased experience of the gameplay.\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Fluid and Responsive combat: that requires the right timing in order to overcome your enemies. Every enemy has a window of oppurtunity to strike them hard including the super challenging bosses. Resulting in a deadly dance of death as you drift around the battle field slashing your enemies before they can strke you and drifting away at just the right moment. Rarely have I played a combat so satisfying, easy to learn and hard to master.\n\n2) Bosses: seldom have I faced challenge in recent past when a game threw me a boss. Reminded me of the goold old days when overcoming a boss felt like a real achievement to show off. Every boss fight is unique and memorable!\n\nThose negative reviews that you have been reading about super hard bosses is only a complaint of people who didn't try enough. Personally it took me around 10 tries for each boss to beat (including the last one). I am not a super pro at games and consider myself average.\n\nThe key is knowing your enemy and timing your attacks and using your upgraded abilities by thinking on your feet. It is NOT unfair. Bosses are supposed to be super hard. Deal with it.\n\n3) Exploration: The world of HLD is brimming with secrets galore... every nook and cranny can lead to a secret pathway containing rare gold artifact that you can use to buy upgrades for your arsenal.\n\n4) Enemy Variety: Every region has seprate enemy units, behaviour and asthetics. Never did the game become boring slash and hack button smasher as every new enemy makes you think on your feet to deal with.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1) Short: yes you might argue good things come in small packages but yes I believe they could have expanded each region further and add more sidequests than the overarching quest you already have. More dugeons would have helped feel the RPG and exploration aspect too. However they chose to focus and make this game purely action oriented. A lost oppurtunity if you ask me.\n\nThe intense actions sequences could have been more paced out with longer gameplay and the loot collection meta game could have breathed more space with more environments and dungeons.\n\n2) Upgrades: Though each sword and dash upgrade is unique and useful in their own way, I felt guns could have  been added with more interesting modules and addons such that modifies the shot pattern or bullets. They could have hidden these modules in secret places to make things more interesting... instead of plain upgrades to magazine.\n\nBastion is a fine example of how to enhance gameplay by adding tactical addons to your existing arsenal. I felt HLD creators lost a lot of oppurtunity here in that regard.\n\n3) Lack of Adventure: You already have all the map revealed to you in the very beginning of the game. I felt it kind of personally took away the wonder and adventure of the game which is based on exploration. Yes the map is abstract, yes you dont know the terrain or the enemy positions of the regions before you visit them, and yet I felt kind of put off by it.\n\n4) No proper quest system: Except your main quest you never encounter any NPCs giving you sidequests of clearing dungeouns / discovering hidden artifacts in lost temples. This serously kind of bummed me as I expected it to be an Action-Adventure-RPG instead they focused it on Action-RPG.\n\nThis could have elivated the game to an altogether different level. Side quests could have been equally cryptic in nature I wouldn't have mind that.\n\nThe game therefore feels a LONG fetch quest for your main questline.\n\n\nRECOMMENDED If you like intense action RPG with a challenging gameplay and breathtaking art and sound production. HLD is one of those rare gems that comes out once a while.\n\nIt has its shortcomings only because they could have made this into a even bigger and better masterpiece of a game than what it already is.\n\nRating (if that matters): 8.5/10","April 4","true","23.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It plays like a mix of a zelda esque type deal with difficulty mechanics not seen in any other game like it. You won't find enemies just standing still the whole time and just waiting for you, the game will send them all at once at you, with no mercy whatsoever. But with the how stylish and fluid the combat feels, it's super satisfying clearing out a whole room with a mixture of dashes, slashes, and shooting stuff up. The overall atmosphere is just amazing, no level feels the same as the last with every room and every new area practically having it's own story. The soundtrack is downright awesome with it's different ups and downs moments and it makes every cutscene and every level you play through feel practically like a movie.

The best way to describe it is a fast 2D Bloodborne, but even that doesnt fully capture everything about this game. The graphics are beautiful, and the imagery is original and breathtaking. Throughout the game's environments you're constantly running into pieces of giant robots and abondoned artifacts, and all of it mixes so well together in a technologically advanced post-apocalypse.\n\nThe first time I saw the gameplay a few years ago, it reminded me of an obscure Kojima game called "Boktai" and I wasn't totally wrong. It's a top-down, somewhat isometric view (think zelda), and you have two different types of weapons. first is your sword, which if very quick and satisfying, and second is your gun, which you can aim in a circle and fire in any direction. Your gun has limited ammo, but it can be recharged by fighting enemies and destroying objects. this works especially well during the boss fights, because you can stay far away and fired off a few shots from your gun, then when there's an opening you can get close and get some hits from your sword. During normal gameplay, each kill recharges one bullet, and during boss fights, each sword hit on the boss recharges one bullet, making it really easy to switch between the two tactically. You eventually get more guns and a grenade that recharges over time, and these also have a lot of tactical value. For mobility you have fairly average moving speed, but you also have a dash that can be used continuously. This works both to clear gaps, and as a "dodge roll" to avoid incoming attacks. You can upgrade this dash with other abilities, like lower cooldown so you can chain them together, and an attack that can be used during a dash. You don't have a lot of health, but you can find and carry med kits (like blood vials or estus flasks) to heal when you need to, but it has a delay that makes it necessary to use caution when in combat (still like blood vials or estus flasks).\n\nThe enemies aren't very difficult individually, but when you encounter them in groups, it begins to be a challenge. I've been hearing a lot of people say this game is "too difficult", but I found it to be just the right amount of challenge, it's just something you have to keep retrying, as you do better and better each time you revise your strategy. The game isn't very punishing at all, when you die you restart at the beginning of the room or encounter, and it doesn't take long to reload the save. You definitely have to manage your health pretty heavily, and make sure you have enough estus -- I mean med kits to keep yourself alive. You always have the option of backtracking to heal or find something else to help you (med kits, upgrades, etc).\n\nThe bosses are where everyone seems to be ragequitting, saying they're "impossible" and "way too hard to enjoy", but honestly I don't see that at all. The bosses only seem as hard as the normal encounters, and while I haven't finished the game, I am pretty far (I've completed the north area), and I can say that the bosses are something you chip away at and try not to get frustrated over. If you've ever played a Souls game, then you should be familiar with the concept of retrying a boss over and over and over again making slight amounts of progress each time, only those games are much, much more punishing. I only had to retry about fifteen times to kill the north boss (bird magician), and each try took about three minutes at most. Once you see the patterns and get into a rhythm, it isn't really very difficult or unfair. Now look, I'm not gonna say it isn't difficult, and that's because I'm not that great at very many games. I quit games that are too hard all the time. But if I'm interested enough in a game, I put in the effort to "git gud" and move forward. There are too many games that I've quit for difficulty and come back to so I could push myself to finish them (Metroid Fusion, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2 (the hardest game I've finished probably), Mega Man X 4's final boss (the hardest boss I've killed), Zone of the Enders 2 (which ironically is one of the easiest games for me now), Dark Souls (which I still haven't finished), the list goes on), but I'm glad to say so far this isn't one of them.\n\nTo everyone who's stuck in this game, good luck, keep trying, and explore some and maybe you'll find something to help you.","April 3","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Must-buy for fans of action-adventures looking for a challenge, the the design work is amazing and artistic.\n\nHyper Light Drifter starts with an 8-bit voiceless introduction about a strange, ill wanderer in a ruined land.  It soon leads to a central hub where the Drifter in question begins his adventure - with nary a voiceover and spare text to instruct him.  From there, it's up to you to find your destiny.\n\nIt's hard to not talk about the game's artistry - the 8-bit look includes amazingly crafted backgrounds and enemies.  The music is moody.  The story is told through visual clues and "conversations" that show still pictures or simple displays.  The entire experience feels incredibly crafted.\n\n"Crafted" also applies to the gameplay.  As your nameless hero (heroine?) and their helpful robot/assistant venture into this strange ruined land, you'll need to think about how you play.  Enemies have specific movements and patterns, environments can be used to your advantage - and most things can kill you surprisingly quickly.  The game's layout and enemies are crafted - so must be your actions.\n\nThe game largely focuses on wandering around trying to unlock other areas.  Wandering into new places usually means a confrontation with enemies, a hostile environment, or both.  Your response to these challenges requires thought and precision - button mashing isn't always the solution (though sometimes it actually is, but in a precise way).  Each location has a puzzle-like quality, and though you'll die (often) you usually blame yourself for your mistakes - and try again.\n\nThe environments are semi-linear, loaded with secrets and challenges, and with their own stories to tell.  When not adventuring, there's a central hub town that lets you improve your abilities.  The relative lack of direction leaves you many options, though smart layout design gives you a reasonable idea of what to do.\n\nIt's hard to find a flaw with Hyper Light Drifter except it is very challenging, and unapolagetically so.  It's not a game to play to relax, unless pushing yourself and puzzling out things is your idea of relaxing.  If it is - or if you're in a mood for that - you'll be happy.\n\nA must-buy for people who want a challenging top-down actioner - and the wonderful art and music turn it into an experience not to be missed.","April 4","true","3.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So much so that when I'd heard that it was an action RPG, a genre I don't typically enjoy very much, I was still determined to buy it.\n\nI am pleased to say that this game exceeds any and all expectations.\n\nThe story is masterfully and uniquely told, but I'd rather not give details; it's best experienced first hand. As far as gameplay goes, there are comparisons to be made between both the original Zelda for it's lack of explanation of who you are and what you're supposed to be doing and Dark Souls for it's combat that rewards finese, skill, and efficiency.  You may find yourself lost at first since, as I said before, you're told nothing and are thown into a huge world. It's a bit disorienting, but you'll eventually find your bearings and the world is an absolute joy to explore. The atmosphere is spot on, the landscapes are beautiful, and it manages to capture the scale of this broken, dying world tremendously.\n\nA particularly striking moment was when I went up a mountain and in the distance saw the broken down, snow-covered corpse of an enormous mech of sorts lain on the side of a cliff. After further investigation of said mountain, I found myself next to that very same corpse; dwarfed by it's hand alone as it's lifeless body menacingly stared up at me sporting a gaping mouth and blank, dead eyes.\n\nThis game did something to me that no game has done in quite some time. It turned me into a kid again. I was on a journey in a fascinating, mysterious, and hazardous new world, trumping my adversity with the skill and precision I'd gained along my grand adventure. I wasn't traversing dangerous cliffs and trap puzzles because I was told to. I wanted to know what was in store if I'd completed said challenges. I wasn't angry when I was killed by a boss because I'd learned something from it and I was sure if I'd just adjusted my tactic I could defeat the new relentlessly fierce opponent.\n\nThat said, this game isn't for everybody. Even basic enemies can make quick work of you if you're not careful with your approach and bosses are unforgiving to put it lightly. Interestingly, though, the bosses combine the abilities of all the mobs in their zone which, in my opinion, was a fantastic design choice that forces the player to strategize, time their attacks and dodges, and really  make sure they know how to control the avatar. So they're challenging, yes, but far from impossible and certainly can be beaten in a rather reasonable amount of attempts.\n\nMy gripes with the game are minimal; a birdman NPC blinks in and out of existence for some reason, there's a strange bug where gear bits appear in one place but can be picked up in another, and I did have some slight issues with lag. That could just be my computer, though. It was really strange as well to make it so the player has to aim their gun with the left stick instead of the right; you get used to it, yeah, but I don't see why it couldn't have been the right stick seeing as it has no function anyway. Also I feel like it would have been better to not have a tutorial to add to the "figure it out" aspect of the game, but that's highly subjective and I wouldn't dock any quality points from the game because of it.\n\nOverall, if you want a game that gives you beautiful scenery, fantastically satisfying combat, and a uniquely presented and gripping story, this is for you. This may not be the game for more casual gamers, though, as those bosses can definitely give  you a run for your money.\n\nI'm not completely through with the game just yet, but as of right now it's an 8/10 for me. If the ending is good enough I can easily bump it up to a 9/10.","April 4","true","25.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's vague, a lot of it left up to interpretation, but told very well regardless. Expect a lot of debate over the game's lore and its meaning.\n\n- Presentation is amazing, if you like retro stuff. Art is pixel art, all hand-made from scratch, and music is beautiful, most of it in the form of ambiance. Visuals and audio put together, it's a spectacle to witness. I advise lowering game volume, though, certain cutscenes in the game spike the volume extremely high.\n\n- Game is hard. Very hard, in regards to both lesser enemies and bosses alike. Especially bosses. Not sadistically difficult, though, difficult in a forgiving, "You messed up but can try again" kind of way. Doesn't hold your hand at all, but gives you many options to keep going. Death checkpoints are decent; some very forgiving, others not so much.\n\n- Combat is very satisfying. Sword strikes and gun shots alike have a big impact to them. Very reflex-based, "stay aware and keep on the move" kind of combat.\n\n- Exploration is abundant. Good amount of ground to cover and tons of secrets to find and scavenge for.\n\n- Progression is RPG-like; have to find gold pieces that combine into full gold to buy skills/equipment from town hub shops. Encourages exploration to further upgrades.\n\n- Kind of short game if you take away difficulty. I beat it in around 7 hours, which is not bad, but depending on who you are, it may leave you wanting for more. Secret and achievement hunting will definitely elongate the play time, though.\n\n- You'll feel very proud of yourself overcoming the harder obstacles the game throws at you.\n\n- Main character is really cool. Masked warrior with a cape, who wields a lightsaber in reverse grip, and dashes around at high speeds. So much my aesthetic, it hurts.\n\n- Comparable to Shinobi (PS2) in terms of difficulty and how your character controls, Mega Man in terms of how areas and bosses are structured, and Metroid in terms of exploration.\n\nIf the difficulty isn't off-putting, buy this game.

Thus forcing me to warp home and completely redo the entire area. Wasting 30 minutes.\n-The options menu is pretty lacking, there are proper volume sliders, but I should at least be able to choose my resolution. This isn't a big gripe but it's always annoying to see games with simple graphics neglect such a basic feature.\n\n+Design Choice-\n+-Although I see the lack of dialogue as a good thing for this game, it does make most characters in the game very forgetable. But at the same time maybe they use that to reinforce the fact that your character is all alone, and faces this challenge by himself. So it is up for you to decide if you like that or not.\n\n+SUMMARY-\nOverall the game was a joy to play. The only text in the entire game is used to teach you basic controls. Other than that the game lets you figure things out for yourself. The set pieces are beautiful and the music really imerses you into the game. The boss fights are very difficult (reminiscent of dark souls), and the mystery of the story keeps you going throughout the entirety of the game.\n\n*TL/DR*\nHyper Light Drifter is worth the $20 admission if you enjoy games that will challenge you and tell you a compelling story.","April 3","true","16.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However, it is very, VERY flawed. The game is riddled with glitches, most of which you'll find without even trying. Once, an enemy jumped off a cliff, and spawned an item in the ground that was innaccessible. The AI is hilariously stupid, and will often walk into a wall repeatedly or kill itself by jumping off cliffs. The collision is enough to make a grown man cry. Sometimes I'll jump to a ledge only to land on the very edge of it and fall off. What's even worse is that falling puts you back on the ledge and you're stuck in a loop until you die. Passing a checkpoint with one health and no health restores is a nightmare, as you have to pass the next few rooms without getting hit at all since dying doesn't restore your health.\n\nOverall, unless you can get this game for 10$ or less, don't buy it.

It will waste hours of your time, and take away your enjoyment of the rest of the experience. Not only that, but using a controller makes it impossible to aim while moving, when the keyboard and mouse is able to do so that. Oh, and the map is by far the most useless map I have seen in a video game. This game desperately needs a mini-map, but lacks one. Plus there's just so many different little issues I see that it drives me mad anytime I play this game.\n\nJust as a heads up, I'm writing this review out of frustration created by this game, so I will likely exaggerate a lot here. Even though that may be true, these are still some very serious issues I have had with the game, and I genuinely want to warn those interested in this game about. With that in mind, read away!\n\nFirst off, I want to discuss the modules. Just to let you know, I spend most of my time in Hyper Light Drifter looking for the modules, which are these diamonds you need to collect around the map in order to fight the boss of an area. There are four areas in total, with four modules in each. But you wouldn't know that because the game doesn't even tell you what a module is, more or less what they do. Want to know how I discovered the name of modules? An achievement description. Yes, you heard me right, an achievement description. To make things worse, I only learned the name of the protagonist, and what their goal is through a Steam trading card. What is this, Destiny!?\n\nAnyways, getting back on topic, the issue with thse modules, is that they are required to progress. You need to find three out of four to reach the boss, and then you get the fourth after beating the boss of the area. At least that's the pattern I see after enduring one area of this game. Now yes, it may not seem that bad, but these modules are hidden in the most obscure corners of the areas. I just spent an hour trying to find one, and came back empty handed, ready to write this review. Even after you get to a halfway point in an area, and an NPC puts the location of the modules on your map, it's still too hard to find them. In fact, that leads me onto another thing I hate about Hyper Light Difter: The map.\n\nIt is beyond frustrating to figure out how the map works. You may be at one point in the map, travel north in-game, and then you decide to check your map. But wait... what's this? You moved to the west on the map! Please explain to me how that makes any sense. That's why module locations on the map are mostly useless. They just tell you it's in "that area" when "that area" is gigantic! It's like if you were trying to visit your dying mother in a hospital, but had no idea which room she's in. Obviously, you would ask the person at the front desk. But when you tell them your mother's name, they just point in the general direction of the room and tell you to go find her yourself.\n\nOh, and here's another issue: Why can you not aim with the right analog stick on the PS4 controller? That may sound like a minor issue, but as is, you can't move while aiming with a controller, when you're able to with the keyboard and mouse. I mean really, what were the developers thinking when they did that? I'd like to actually move while aiming, like you can with a keyboard and mouse! But if you use the keyboard and mouse, dodging quickly becomes too difficult. And no, that's not because that control scheme is bad. I actually spent half my time using the keyboard and mouse and really enjoyed it. It's just that you need incredibly high sensitivity (and some pretty insane reflexes) to dodge fast enough with the keyboard and mouse. However, I finally decided to try out the controller, and found that I enjoyed that control scheme more. I just don't understand why aiming with a controller has to restrict movement. And no, do not tell me "oh, well that gives each control scheme advantages and disadvantages." No, these are not playable characters, these are different control schemes. That is an excuse, not an argument. Each control scheme should have the exact same useful features (useful meaning that it actually provides some function to gameplay, and isn't just a useless feature there for laughs).\n\nFinally, I want to know why the developers removed the feature of getting health packs refilled when teleporting. How does removing the feature to refill an already infinite number of healing items make the game harder? It had actually fixed a design flaw, but the developers instead decided to put that flaw back into the game! My logic for it not raising difficulty, is because health packs are already unlimited. Having health packs refilled upon teleporting only saved the player time. But no, now you have to go back to previous areas you've already beat, and get the health packs again without getting hit. That isn't difficult, that's just really inconvenient.\n\nOther than all that, the game is great. The combat is really fun, challenging, and smooth. The game looks and sounds great. I frequently found myself just staring at the scenery. Plus, it's an incredibly unique game. It's just that you'll spend far too much of your time revisiting areas, and trying to find those cursed modules in order to progress. This sucked all fun out of the game for me, and has frustrated me more than any other game I have played.","April 16","false","4.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

It does a few things fairly well.  The combat is fun and fluid, the art is great, and the soundtrack is nice.\n\nHowever, I feel like the game does a lot of things wrong.  For starters, my biggest complaint with the game is the world in it.  You have a decently sized world, but it feels completely lifeless.  None of the characters in the game actually have any dialogue, and all speak through pictures, the story is very loosely explained (And even then, it's EXTREMELY vague on what's actually going on), and while this has sort of become a trend in certain games, it just leaves me feeling disconnected from the game's world, and I don't feel "invested" enough into it.\n\nThe other complaint I have, is a lot of things feel too same-y.  The areas in the game, the enemies, and even just the core gameplay itself.  The main areas in the game have a lot of different rooms and whatnot within them, but there's really not much that makes them feel unique.  The enemies are kind of the same in this regard.  There's just not a lot that really stands out at all, especially compared to the first Kickstarter trailer for the game, which showed a lot of unique and interesting content that was apparently cut from the final game.\n\nNow, while the combat in the game is fun, that's really all there is to the game.  There aren't any puzzles, there aren't any gripping cutscenes or conversations, there aren't any sidequests, or really anything to break up the hack 'n slash gameplay.  It just felt like I was wandering endlessly, killing everything in sight, with no real purpose or goal in doing so.\n\nAs someone who followed the game since it was first announced, and eagerly awaited its release, I was fairly disappointed with the game, and while I didn't actually complete it, I was right at the end, and just couldn't bring myself to bother finishing it, as silly as that may sound.","April 30","false","7.0"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

The integration of all combat techniques is very solid, and mostly stays that way...\n\nUntil the overcomplication of certain mechanics. Although I realize that in order to keep gameplay fresh, a developer must consider ways to continue through their game with obvious progression. The way progression is marked in this is by upgrades that you buy from merchants who say or show literally nothing, and they don't exactly teach you how to use those upgrades. The double dash is finicky, and the primary challenge of "get 400 of these dashes" in a row is POSSIBLE, but it is also PREPOSTEROUS.\n\nThe game looks fantastic.

The world is designed similiarly to how I remember the Megaman Legends games. The way the story and world is presented however reminds me of Dark Souls.\n\nTo put simply, the game is very strange and mysterious, not really explaining to you what the protagonist's goal or purpose is. You are simply given a weapon and a healing item, and there you go, have at it. Very much like Dark Souls. The lore and the world itself reminds me much more of Megaman Legends however, aka ruins full with sci-fi artifacts.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the later 2D Zelda games (think Minish Cap and similiar) but on Steroids, aka the fights get very fast and overwhelming very quickly. This however makes every victory ever so satisfying. The only real difference I noticed in terms of combat is that it feels more weighty than Zelda and can be compared more to Dark Souls, aka if you find yourself stuck in an attack animation and the enemy is about to hit you, you are most likely gonna have to eat that hit.\n\nThe music is a matter of taste, personally I feel like it does a great job of emphasizing the atmosphere of exploring the unknown, without really knowing why. It can get a little bit too intense in certain scenes though, where the volume just goes crazy (I am pretty sure this is intentional, lol).\n\nAnd now the bad\nThere are no rebindable controls for controllers in this game. While I didn't really have an issue with the default layout, people who wish to customize their controls to their own tastes are out of luck, unless you are planning to play with keyboard and mouse, which are rebindable as far as I could see (I didn't try the KB+M controls).\n\nThe biggest issue however, and this was discussed alot on the community hub before the game released as well, is the framerate. Without a doubt, the decision to lock a game this fast to 30 FPS was not benificial to the gameplay at all. Half of the time I die, I literally blame it on the fact that I could have reacted faster to the crazy amount of bullets and enemies flying at me if the game rendered more frames.\nIs it playable at 30 FPS? Yes, without a doubt you can enjoy the game at 30 FPS, but at the same time it would have been better for it to be at 60. Overall, it's more of an annoyance than a gamebreaking issue, so whether or not you feel comfortable with it, is up to you.\n\nConclusion\nDo I recommend this game? Oh hell yes, I do. The gameplay is stellar, the world feels compeling to explore and there are a lot of secrets hidden around. Though I would most likely have enjoyed it even more with a higher framerate, the 30 FPS lock is not stopping me from enjoying the game, at least so far.\n\nSo if you'll excuse me, I got more bullets to dodge and more pits to fall into.","March 31","true","8.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

No spoilers ahead\n\nAtmosphere: The game is just beautiful. Gorgeous. The feeling and atmosphere of the game can be predicted by the 3 trailers, but what you couldn't know is the love to details. The Birds still fly away if you walk near them, so this is a thing. But where I really was suprised is when there was a mirror which had a) a reflection of the player and b) I hit the mirror and it broke! That is just such a need detail. 11/10\nThe music fits the game great. After hearing that the music of the first trailer (which i love to death) was not composed by the composer of this game I was disappointed. When the second trailer was released I was worried, because, well I didn't really liked the music. Suprisingly the music just melts wonderful into the game while playing and just underlines the overall theme of the game.\nThe game has a feeling of solitude and mystery to it. There is not one english letter in the game so far. Just some mysterious symbols. The story is told by pictures. If you talk to story relevant NPCs they will tell their story by several pictures which you have to interprete as you see fitting. This was again rather suprising but in a good way, because this as well fits the overall theme great in my opinion.\n\nThe controls are pretty responding and feel very good, which is the foundation of such a game. It is hard. The combat is fast paced and punishing. If you don't time your attacks or movement well you will die. If you get hit by certain attacks you will get punished by falling to the ground, so if you rush headless into some enemys and one hits you once, it is almost certain that the others will hit you afterwards without giving you a chance to avoid it, because of the first mistake you made.\nYou have environmental obstacles which can kill you and will force you to think how you aproach a certain situation. So you will die a lot. Speaking of dying. You can't save the game whenever you want, it has like a checkpoint system. If you reach the checkpoint the game will save. So far these are in fair distances to one another and if you wan't to quit the game there's a message telling you how long ago the last save was.\n\nThe game offers a lot of secrets, path's you can't see on the first glance. Like in the beta there are invisible platforms, but it looks like that you can make them visible for a short time if you a) stand on them (makes the whole path visible) or if you are at the starting point you can use your companion (which gives you a signal that something is there) to make them visible.\n\nSo far I haven't understand how the level system (if this even is one) works (or rather what improves if you level up) or how the currency works in this game. Maybe those two are connected. The game will give you a really short tutorial, but it looks like you have to figure out most of the mechanics, which i really like. Hate those tutorials and taking all exploration out of a game by forcing everything down your throat.\n\n\nJust one thing. When I close the game it will crash. That is probably not a big thing, because I wanted to exit it anyway, but it just shouldn't happen after such a long development time. A beta for a game was originally a thing to test if a game is running properly and if I will stumple about bugs or if the game won't start (error message) for other people (which i've read on KS) and other systems. If something the game crashes, bugs or similar, that is a no go. You (developer) deceided to exlude most of us from a real beta test and you did this intern for story and suprise purposes (which i can kinda understand), we got "just" a preview build. So I hope you made sure that the game will work properly!\n\nAnyway great Game.","March 31","true","17.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This game is such a work of overwhelming beauty I felt compelled to voice my opinions.\n\nGameplay - When I first started playing Hyper Light Drifter, I questioned how well an action game without I-frames could work - the equivalent idea being an action game with no I frames is like a shmup with no bombs.  As I played more, I realized that when the mechanics are designed to perfection, when every error can be attributed to "no one's fault but my own", it became clear to me that I frames would have been an unnecessary bandage on polish resembling an unblemished mirror.  Aside from the major issue of the game's complete absence of I-frames, the responsive controls and the demanding chain dash timing makes every encounter feel like a personal victory - the drifter never gains level, the stats that grow belong to you, the player.\n\nAesthetic - A beautiful dreamy pastel haze, contrasted heavily by low fantasy brutality where no detail is spared.  Painterly backdrops of ruin placed at choice locations to set the tone for the upcoming area.  Besides the UI, there is not a single word voiced the entire game, however the tone and the ambience do more than necessary for successful storytelling.\n\nSoundtrack - Dynamically shifting music that is always tone appropriate, the quality of the soundtrack is on the same level as Bastion or Transistor.  However the decidedly low-fi instrumentation are chosen specifically to compliment the art design.\n\nOverall - Hyper Light Drifter is a game that is completely uncompromising in every sense of the word.  Everything about this game is honest, from the very demanding difficulty, to the heartbreaking world it's built around.  HLD is a game not only action fans would enjoy, but anyone who's sick to death of formulaic games targetting the greatest possible target audience with no regard to integrity or concinnity of design.  HLD is an original artistic vision that has been fulfilled in the most elegant way possible.\n\ntl;dr - it's really good go play it.\n\npersonal PJSalt - where's my achievement for beating Newgame+ :(","April 3","true","25.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Yes - Here is why I believe so:\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a call back to the games of old - before the internet and online guides were prevelant. During this time frame (more so the nes/snes era) games had an air of mystique, most things were never told, and the world was experienced and not explained. This is the world of Hyper Light drifter.\n\nAlso do you remember the music of your favorite games of old? You probably do. Why do you remember this? Because the music helped to build the moment, and it was integral to the world building of the game that you played. Disasterpiece (who scored Fez) did a brillant job with the score. You really feel like a wander in a strange, but not outlandish, land. The highs and lows of the music correspond with the setpieces known as the backdrops.\n\nBesides the atmosphere being a call back to older games, this game also calls back to a time before there were difficulty levels. This game is difficult, but not impossible. When you die, you don't feel like you were cheated - you just feel like you messed up. I feel like this is the mark of a well developed game - and Heart Machine should be applauded for their first time effort.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is like a mixture of zelda (the grand adventure), and the combat of modern ninja gaiden (fast and furious, with multiple weapons). The movement system that they implemented - a chainable dash - was a great idea as it makes traversing the huge map quite easy (you also have the ablity to teleport to certain locations at any given time - even in dungeons).\n\nThe last time that I felt so good about a neo-classic game was when I played Fez. The difference between this game and fez however (besides the genre/gameplay/etc) is that when playing this game, you will know if you missed something. You will not need ultra complicated maps, decoder rings, etc to be able to get the most of the game. Take your time, enjoy the ride. You will find all sorts of secrets that will make you feel proud of yourself.\n\nSo is Hyper Light Drifter a good game - in my opinon - yes\nIts a throw back to the difficult and yet imaginative days of old - yet its formula helps it to be able to stand on its own without nostalgia.","April 3","true","16.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'd recommend anyone play it if they enjoy difficult games. I've also not beat the game in New Game + yet, I'll get to that in a few days.\n\nAlright, onto the review.\n\nLet's start with the combat system. It's great, easy to pick up. It's satisfying, challenging, fun, and balanced all at once. Enemies can attack through your attacks most of the time, meaning there's no stunlocking any enemies. You have to strategically plan your hits to make sure you hit the enemies enough times and then dash out of the range of their attacks. Multiple enemies can be hard to deal with, but that's why the game includes ranged weapons. Not meant to be used as primary means of damage, but the ranged combat is an easy way to lessen the numbers of enemy groups into more manageable sizes. Bosses, on the other hand, are really, really tough. You've got a lot of health to get rid of, and you only take a few hits\n\nNext up is the visuals and sound. Both are fantastic, truly masterpieces. The visual style is simple in color, but the lighting and quality of animations and detail makes up for any and all mistakes made. Those mistakes are very few and far between, and very hard to see when you're just playing the game. The music is amazing, each area's music slowly changes depending on where you are and what's going on around you. If you're underground, if there are enemies around, if the room you're in is more of a puzzle room, the little touches make it all that much better. What else did we expect? Disasterpiece did the music for the game.\n\nAlright, now we'll look at general gameplay. Most of it's self-explanatory. The movement system is great, just the perfect blend of slippery but perfectly controllable. The dashing system is a nice way to get around fast, and with some practice, Chain Dash can get you around even faster. There's been a few times when I've fallen off of ledges due to minor things, but it doesn't punish you much for falling out of the world. Health packs are thankfully abundant, if you explore enough. The upgrade system is straightforward, but I wish there was a liiiitle more variety in the way of things you can collect for upgrades.\n\nThere's nothing really to write on the story of the game, it's really vague. Play yourself or watch someone else play, then figure out what you want to think of it.","April 3","true","14.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's "Prepare to Die Edition", you will die a lot in here. The game doesn't guide you, doesn't explain anything, you have to discover its secrets, its gameplay, a new world opens up to you full of beauty and dangers. The game oozes love on each pixel. Its music is an amazing work of art. It has many hidden mysteries. There's no languaje, everything is very cryptic and intuitive.

Many would say that that sounds easy and not hard, the difficulty of this game doesnt come from "bullet sponge enemies" or stacking enough health to survive. It comes from using your abilities  to avoid damage and deal damage.

Unfortunately Hyper Light Drifter seems to be very poorly optimized for anyone arguing against using a controller, which I don't have the ability to play the game with in the first place. As much as I'm willing to sacrafice a joystick's versatile direction scheme for the simple and stupid eight directions WASD allows, I can't tolerate the fact that certain functions of the game seem to be broken by K+M use in the game.\n\nMy problem is only this for the time being: it doesn't seem to be possible to change chain dashing direction with just WASD. I can't complete several portions of secrets to the levels in the game without being able to do this. Until an update is released that better accomodates the use of a keyboard, I'm afraid I'll have to shelf HLD. I hope the developers find time to address issues like these in the near future.","May 2","false","4.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

HLD has done an incredible job delivering a beautiful, well-crafted game into a pixel art form with an excellent aesthetic and kind of unique per say, emerging simplistic but nice sound design helps to add beauty to this game. The game mechanics are very simple but it has enough depth to create very complexed and challenging both puzzles and fights, although sometimes it can be overwhelming making the overall experience enjoyable.\nWith a large amount of puzzles - secrets and collectables to obtain is more than likely you will spend 20+ hours to discover them all. The sense of exploration is but the lack of map only readable by the creators is comes down to your memory, is really frustrated to see how bad the map in this game is, it reminds me of FEZ a map that only the creators themselves understand it.\n\nNow HLD presents a weird story, tackling a similar approach of games like Dark Souls where much is left to the player to discuss it, and create their own theories. The problem with this HLD doesn’t deliver enough content and ideas to even create a sense story. It was very disappointed for me see the ending, not only didn’t explained what or where I was there but the ending boss was super easy with 2 tries only I figure him out, in fact it was more challenging the waves of monsters in the town, or the 800+ dashes challenges than the final Boss, so all the hype that caught me to this point was left to bad.\nThe game itself personally think lacks of content, the only incentive to collect all the keys are sort of skins but not really, they are color palette swapping of your original character making you wonder wasn’t enough funding for this game to at least have some extra skins or features. Lastly CO-OP feels cheap, the enemies have same life so the difficult doesn’t increase and makes it easier, the second player can’t interact with the world is just feel doesn’t have the same impact in the game.\n\nSo Hyper Light Drifter as it stands now is beautiful well-crafted game that lacks of content and narrative design and feels more like a lazy design rather than simple. If you want some interesting story this isn’t the game for you, if you prefer some action game with quick fast phased the game does deliver.\n","May 9","false","50.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I spent 3 years following it after backing it on Kickstarter and was sorely disappointed with a game that could be beaten (although not 100% completed) in less than eight hours. Not only that, but I paid $20 for it.\n\nThose who claim this game is difficult probably just aren't very adept at playing many games. The fighting is repetitive, predictable, and forgetful. There are only a handful of enemies in each section of the map and the bosses prove to be the most difficult, though not overpowering. The story, if you can call it that, is vague at best and the best part is that when I beat the game, it froze and whatever ending there was supposed to be, I missed. I'm not really curious enough to play through again to see what happened.\n\nI don't see the intrigue to the New Game+ because the regular game was so underwhelming. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is ambient and relaxing, and the movements are pretty fluid. However, the amount of abilities is pretty limited so there's not much variety to your attacks.\n\nAgain, I really wanted to like this game, but for this price, I just can't recommend it.","April 19","false","9.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Every new mechanic lets you unlock new areas of the map and/or reach previously inaccessible locations in order to further upgrade your character.\n\nThe difficulty is best described as "arcade difficulty," really -- some may compare it to Dark Souls (ahem...opening sentence), but the truth is that the game plays very much like a retro RPG.  Meaning that there are stretches of quiet and beautiful scenery and music followed by frantic monster-filled fights where you slowly learn which threats the most pressing and which you can deal with after dispatching that  freakin' caster.\n\nIn line with the above, the game says it is best played with a controller, though I found that using a mouse works fine, too.  The only thing I would mention, though, is that your character's field of view moves as you move the mouse around to target/aim at things.  Before getting the hang of it, that mechanic produced a little motion sickness, so be careful not to let your mouse fly around (remember that almost everyting is accomplished with the keyboard.\n\nIn case you all are interested, my friend has started a playthrough of the game here (caution, spoilers):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rU8Lyqm1Lo","April 3","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Boss fights are brutal, and a "try and die and try again until you don 't die" situation....there were times I wanted to punch a hole in my wall or strangle a baby kitten over some of the mechanics in this game......\n\n.....and it is hands down, without exaggeration, one of the top 3 video games I have <EVER> played in my 40 years of life.

(If you're going to release a PC game, you should assume most gamers on PC do not use a console controller and don't want to - designing a PC game AROUND using console controllers is like designing a PS4 game that needs keyboard and mouse) - but this is preference and my general observation. There needs to be more slipperiness to movement around corners and walls.\n-the healing delay can be really frustrating in the midst of combat. I have died so many times while trying to heal to a stray bullet (you have to get the timing down)\n-the 'stand up and move on' animation after you die takes entirely too long and is infuriating\n-really, really brutal side-games that requires entirely too much time devotion to accomplish for a small reward (I'm looking at you, 800 count chain-dashing mini-quest!

Just look up some footage of it, you'll see what I mean.\n+ Heavy music combined with beautiful scenery creates a jaw-dropping atmosphere.\n+ Game does not hold your hand on this one.

The presentation of this game was what really caught my eye and the beta that came midway during its development helped remind everyone what this game was all about.\n\nQuite frankly, I've never been so mesmarized by an atmosphere since FTL and Dark Souls. Hyper light drifter did just that and more without any dialogue whatsoever. The game is mysterious and unfolds at a pleasant pace. The soundtrack is very grandiose and dynamically changes depending on the scenery.\n\nThe combat is very fast paced and it'll have you looking around like a bullet hell game ; paying attention to enemy movement and closing in at an opportune time. Even the creator of this game shared his thoughts on his game's combat mechanic, saying that he prefers smarter enemies over larger ones, and boy did he drive that point home! Even the easiest of enemies can dodge, lure, ambush, and flank the player during encounters!\n\nYes, I am in love with the amount of hard work that has been poured into the game and I truly hope there will be a sequel very much like this.

Hyper Light drifter is one of those rare games, and it doesn't dissapoint.\n\nAt the time of this review I'm only two hours in, but I'm already hooked. Hyper Light Drifter is a hack and slash that hits every note with perfect precision, and manages to add it's own beautiful twist that makes it unique. Let me explain.\n\nThe Atmosphere: You are probably already aware that the art style is absolutly fantastic, but the trailers don't give away the full story. Each set piece feels like it is well thought out, and each screen is beautifully composed. Even more so, the music adds to the atmosphere and mood without being distracting or obtrusive. The sound of this game strikes a fantastic balance between emotive expression and being a delicate background foundation to the game. Even the sound effects feel masterfully created. I can not rave about the way this game presents itself more. It is top shelf.\n\nThe Story: So far I'm only right at the very start of the game, but the story has already drawn me in, and it has managed to do so with absoltly no text. This game takes the idea of "show, don't tell" very seriously, and it absolutly delivers. It didn't take very long at all for me to become invested in the characters, and the world feels very real and lived-in. It is hard for me to find fault. Granted, this early on it is entirely possible for the story to fall appart later on, but given how expertly the beginning of the game is constructed, I highly doubt the rest of the story will be anything but fantastic. I'm excited to discover more about this world and the people who inhabit it.\n\nThe Combat: No game is perfect, and Hyper Light Drifter is no exception. The combat feels tight and responsive, but beyond that it doesn't really introduce anything too exciting. Combat is neither brutally hard nor boringly easy, but it can be a little frustrating. Enemy's attacks will follow you accross the screen after you dash out of the way, which can lead to the annoying experience of dodging an enemy's attack only to have the enemy fly accross the screen and kill you anyway. Combat is a little punishing, with enemy's two-hitting you from very early on, meaning you have to play perfectly to progress, and might need to retry a fight ten or more times before you can move on. The ranged weapon feels pretty underpowered, with very limited ammo and an awkward aiming system. Using the gun often feels like a waste of time and effort. Your sword is much more effective, and doesn't cost ammo. On top of that your abilities are the same powers we've seen a hundred times over. One melee attack, One ranged attack, and a dash. Don't get me wrong, the combat is /fine/, but it is only fine where the rest of the game is great.\n\nAll up this game does not dissapoint, and I'm excited to see where the game takes me and what the company produce in the future. Solid performance.\n\nTLDR; Game is good. Spend $$$.","March 31","true","19.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are tons of secret areas and rooms that you need to find to get to unlock upgrades (otherwise you would have a lot of difficulty fighting the bosses). The difficulty bar is set at a moderate height, the game's difficulty is hard enough, but the game itself is generous as it gives you everything you need to not die. The multiple deaths on boss fights can get frustrating, but it doesn't take awy from the game. As for the story, it's only really explained with pictures, which is okay for me, and is quite original. The game doesn't guide you, so you have to figure out a lot of things on your own. I love the pixel art style and soundtrack. It's definitely worth a try, and without question a game to have had the priviledge of playing.\n\nI rate HLD solid 9/11","April 3","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've beaten 3 bosses now in a little under 4 hours (i left the game open when I went to eat). The game is punishing, yet rewarding. Graphically it's astounding. Play wise it's the exact opposite  of child's play. Let's cut to the meat here.\n\nPros-\n1. Reminescent of Zelda, while having difficulty and mechanics you wouldn't find in a LoZ game.\n2. Astounding soundtrack, with music that helps set the tone for every area you're in.\n3. Stunning visuals. I've never had a game that I walk in to a water area and just stopped to look at how beautiful it is.\n4. It makes you think. Exploration gives you upgrades, and upgrades keep you alive, though admittedly they are not completely necessary.\n5. The story telling is done in a way that I haven't seen done this well in a long time. There's no words. When you meet an important NPC they show you what they need to in pictures. There's no "hey go here". There's only a picture of the boss killing people followed by two more somewhat similar pictures.\n\nCons-\n1. This isn't a con for me, but some people do not like the ridiculous difficulty. This game is not easy. It's not even normal. It can be downright frustrating. The fact that it's not a 3d game like dark souls with hidden mechanics and such can make it even worse. All I can do is shoot, cut, and dodge, it can't be that hard right? Wrong.\n2. Personally I like the exploring and using your brain to look in to every crevice. Most parts of the game are telegraphed, a line of tiles on the floor, a bunch of enemies on the way. Sometimes, however, you find you can go in to a building or another area, and there was no hint at all. For some this might cause frustration, though I really think at that point you're not playing the game to enjoy the game, you're playing the game to beat it.\n3. This game felt wrong on the keyboard. It feels like it was build to controller. If you don't have a controller, you're in for a rough time.\n\nAll in all, Hyper Light Drifter is a masterpiece of a game. I haven't had this much fun in a single player game in a long long time. I had to force myself in to bed at 1 AM last night, because I only have a little bit more to go, but life doesn't stop because a fantastic game such as this came out.\n\n10/10.","April 1","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When you drop your guard you will die, well loose 2 health but in a game where health packs aren't falling from the sky, each tick of health is valuable. Dashing wiill save your skin, but can also lead you to death.\n\nSword & gun combo is nice, although you regen ammo from slashing enemies down, they will disappear quickly.\n\nAcquiring upgrades takes time and exploration. and when you do get a chance to acquire an upgrade choose wisely.\n\nThe music adds to it all, Ominous and eerie, it adds to apocalyptic setting, Dilapidated buildings surround you as you explore to find the "shards". Enemies lie waiting for you at the top  of the crumbling staircases within the moss/vine covered ruins, snowy peaks, and in the depths below.\n\nThis game has me hoooked. ill be spending much more time in it, most of which will be trial and error deaths and doing the same things contiually,","April 1","true","24.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'll hug walls, cliffs, edges, trees, everything. If this is something that does not interest you, you might find the game tedious in the long run without a walkthrough. I'm trying to find everything I need to get (I think) the best ending and without any guide, it's becoming quite a chore because there are little to no indications.\n\nCombat is visceral, fast-paced and when you use all of your arsenal, you get pretty powerful. It's not perfect, but it's unique and satisfying. You can unlock a couple new moves and ranged weapons that helps a lot.  Some people have been mentioning the difficulty, but I haven't run into any difficulty wall, most bosses were one-shot except a few that killed me once or twice. Even if it did go well for me, it is probably the hardest game I've played of this genre if you compare it to Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana, Soul Blazer, Terranigma, etc.\n\nThe story is not told with words. When you talk with NPCs, they respond with sounds (the non-important NPCs) or images (those ones explain what happened/is happening in the world). Though I have not experienced the ending yet, I'm hooked. The emphazise on exploration really makes you observe the world with all of its details and that's how the story/universe of Hyper Light Drifter unraveled for me. Your character also goes through a lot of mini-cutscenes as you progress which kept me captivated. The whole setting is kind of mysterious.\n\nI'm 9 hours into the game and I've killed the last boss. I'm exploring the maps to find everything I'm missing to see if the ending change. I haven't tried new game + yet. Expect 8-10 hours of story on your first playthrough. There's a hidden gauntlet/monster arena to complete and a lot of collectables that I have no idea what they unlock yet, it's exciting. If you're in for achievement/trophies, there's one that requires you to not die at all during a playthrough. That's plenty of hours, I'm sure.\n\nTL/DR fast-paced and moderately difficult action/adventure/RPG with minimal rpg elements (unlock a few abilities and such through the collection of tokens), heavy exploration, lot of collecting to do, great pacing and memorable world/ambiance. Just get the damn game.","March 31","true","37.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although the game does have some occasional issues with visual clarity and clutter, it's more than made up for by the sheer amount of excellent visual storytelling, alongside animation that is both attractive and integral to the game's Dark Souls-seque combat system.  Gorgeous use of shape and colour, too.\n\nThe audio is an absolute treat.  The game's hazy, SNES-influenced soundscape mixes perfectly with Rich Vreeland's predictably wonderful musical score, that sounds not unlike what would happen if Tangerine Dream and Boards Of Canada did the sweetest damn collab ever.  Moreover, both the sound and music tie in to other aspects of the game on a  deep level.  Sound is often used to highlight enemy attacks and pinpoint hidden secrets, and the music swells and modulates in such a way as to offer punctuation and drama to the visual storytelling on offer.  It really is a treat.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and responsive but challenging, and punishes sloppy play.  Easy to pick up, tough to beat, satisfying to master.  This game wears its Legend Of Zelda and Dark Souls influences on its sleeve, and is all the better for it.  Bosses can occasionally feel cheap, but this is less down to overall unfairness as it is to complex attack patterns and strategies.  You will try, try and try again, slowly learning how best to chink away at its armour, and when you eventually defeat it, the sense of accomplishment is wonderful.\n\nThis game is not for everybody.  I imagine some people will bounce off its offputting initial difficulty curve and that the bosses will cause many a smashed joypad and ragequit.  However, for those willing to be truly challenged in exchange for some of the best audiovisual storytelling and exploration in videogames, then you can't get much better than this.  I've waited since the Kickstarter back in 2013 and I am in no way disappointed.\n\nIt's an absolute masterpiece.","April 1","true","24.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is mysterious and doesn't reveal itself right away, rather through the enviroment. If you pay attention to the opening cutscene and think about it some it starts to make sense and it is certainly not as limited as others say.\n\nThe combat is fair but challanging. The bosses will take some repitition and learning their patterns is the best way to go about it. This is not a hack n slash and combat is more like precise dueling than some sort of slamathon WWE poundtown. Strike when an oppertunity is available, then retreat and if possible throw a few shots from range. Just play patiently and you will be rewarded. When I died to bosses I found myself encouraged to go again rather than getting frustrated and quitting (which is my normal experience with difficult games ie dark souls).\n\nThe art is tremendous and really sinks you into the world. Make sure you take time to appritiate the details and enjoy the vistas, they are part of the experience! Don't rush through to complete this quickly as you won't understand the game or enjoy it as much. And while you are enjoying it, look for secret walls or cliff edges, they hold worthwhile rewards.\n\nIn all, I highly recommend this game. The difficulty is there but does not alienate those not typically fond of that (me). The art kept me motivated when I struggled and gave me time to breathe. The story kept me enthralled and thinking, but thinking is definitely necessary if you want to understand it. The $20 price tag may seem steep on entry, but the time I've put in this game (6 hours right now and I'm about half way through) does not reflect my enjoyment of this game. I'm usually the cheap kind of gamer but I picked this up first day 10% off and wouldn't regret paying full price.","April 4","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ekaven/recommended/257850/","Ekaven","Ekaven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ekaven/","57 products in account","Amazing game. Here is why:\n-Very smooth and, for the lack of a better term, controlable controls.\n-Fair challenges. I have never died and thought "that was bull."\n-Exploration is very rewarding.\n-Gradual upgrades keep combat fresh.\n-The world is immersive. You can see the art but that is not the only thing. Every sound for movements/actions, music, atmosphere, and even dialogue (not actual dialogue. There are pictures in speach bubbles that tell a story quick and beautifully).\n-Fights are challenging and fun. Every fight including boss fights (for the most part), can be boiled down to maybe...two minutes, but the difficulty will have you trying again and again. Sounds frustrating but it is not as much as it seems. Travel time back to where you died almost always is zero. You almost always spawn right before your big battle. You only get punished with travel time if you die in...say a platfoming area.\n\nI honestly think that anyone giving this a bad rap because of difficulty really has never been challanged before and is used to the new formula of games. I call them interactive movies. It's a big topic but I think you get the gist. Get this game if you are willing be immersed in it with difficulty and all. If trying hard isn't your thing, look elsewhere. Those who stick with it will be rewarded greatly.\n\n","April 4","true","35.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is a masterpiece in all aspects, combining challenging combat reminiscent of Dark Souls with a unique style all it's own. The art style of this game escapes what can be described in words alone, a stylistic blend of otherworldly sci-fy and post-apocalyptic adventure, the game takes pixel art to an entirely new realm of graphic excellence. The beautifully crafted scenery and enemies are a delight to the eye, with the pixel graphics providing just enough fine detail to provide rich, engaging visuals while still allowing the player to apply their own imagination to the scene. The same can be said for the awe-inspiring story, told through vague images and leaving much to speculation. The story is exciting and engaging, but at the same time seemingly absent. The only clues to what you must do are the occasional vague hints told through images, leaving the player to their own devices. This seemingly utter lack of direction allows the player to make their own story, rather than having it spoon fed to them as so many modern games do. The beauty of this game is how it forces you to make your own choices and theories, not knowing if they are even remotely correct. This amount of freedom is liberating- nothing is given easily to the player, they must earn it through skill and perserverence. That level of satisfaction gained from overcoming an obstacle that this game provides in ample supply is essential to connecting and engaging with the player, and is missing from far too many games. The combat is tough but fair, constantly keeping the player on their toes. Combat is fast paced, yet crisp and responsive, with varied and challenging enemies. The soundtrack is a wonder of audio engineering, with scores ranging from light, enchanting melodies to dark, gritty anthems that set the player on edge. The music completes a rich, ambient overall style with the artwork, a beautiful blend that engrosses and envelops the player.\n\nTL:DR\nThis is a masterpiece of modern game design and it would be a disservice to both yourself and society as a whole to not buy it.\nOverall rating: 10/10; Pinnacle of modern game design.","April 4","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Would recommend. Read below for further details.\n\nPROS\n- Atmosphere: From the very beginning you are sucked into this world. The music and art design blend together wonderfully creating a drive to explore your surroundings.\n\n- Combat: Battles require precision over mashing. The controls felt tight and once you understand what enemies are capable of battles become a dance. You'll battle melee and ranged foes, sometimes at once. Dispaching a room of enemies without taking damage is very satisfying.\n\n- Level design: There are four distinct areas to explore in HLD. There is a minimap but I rarely had to use it. The levels have enough branching paths but not too many that you get lost often. There are NUMEROUS hidden nooks and crannies to find. There are some environmental tells but the visuals are so cohesive that the player really has to look and explore to find extra goodies. This is where the dash movement mechanic really shines as you'll constantly find yourself dsahing across gaps to small ledges in search of secrets. The developers really did setup the environment to syngergize with the core movement mechanic of dashing.\n\n- Boss Battles: While many people feel the battles are too hard, I though the difficulty was well tuned. All of the bosses have a unique visual design and require different strategies to beat. There was never a boss I had to replay more than seven times (including the final boss). You revive right outside the boss room and a recent patch sped up the player death animation so restarting was not frustratingand after every death. The battles are tense and require constant focus but that makes victory that much more satisfying. I was able to beat the entire game without buying any healing upgrades so with healing fully upgraded I feel many players can complete the game if they learn the patterns and stay determined.\n\nCONS\n- Upgrade System: Melee attacks, movement abilities, and the secondary gun can be upgraded along with a few other things. In keeping with zero dialogue or explanatory text the upgrades merely show a quick clip of what they are. This does leave some ambiguity in what new abilities do. Also, as all upgrades can be purchased from the beginning, choosing an upgrade is simply guesswork. All of the abilities are useful (to an extent) but the currency to purchase them has to be found through exploration so new upgrades can only be purchased so quickly. Buy one you won't need for some time and you're out currency and the gameplay doesnt change. I did a decent amount of additional exploration and did not find enough currency to upgrade everything. Not a problem to me personally but then I was happy with what I chose to upgrade.\n\n- Autosave System: I understand why the game has auto-save. It allows the devs to provide difficult sections of the game. The game saves so often I don't think I was never bothered but life does happen so be aware you can't stop playing whenever you want (unless you don't mind replaying a section).\n\n- Length: I was only lost once that I can recall and I didn't waste much time dashing around (for a certain achievement) and I beat the game in six hours. I was hoping for an 8-10 hour experience. There is a new game plus and I didn't get all the collectables but for what I'm calling the main game, it was a tad short.\n\nOverall Impression\n- Hyper Light Drifter was worth the 18 USD (sale price). Some of the best boss fights I've played. Great combat. The story presentation being purely visual challenged me to think about the world and what the Drifter's purpose was. Is the game difficult? At times, but you are given all the tools to overcome. Like many of the best indie games, Hyper Light Drifter provides a unique and focused experience you will not get anywhere else.","April 4","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The visuals are some of the most beautiful I've seen in the pixel art genre, and there are various astonishing sights to see, some of which I would stop to study for a couple minutes. The soundtrack is great too, Disasterpeace does some of the most unique chiptune music I've ever heard.\n\nBefore playing I was a little worried since a lot of people have been saying the game is too hard and frustrating to be fun, but after playing it through I wholeheartedly disagree. The bosses are very hard, that I wont deny anyone, but I found all of them really engaging and never frustrating, even though I died repeatedly on a few of them. Combat in this game is more about being aware of your surroundings and timing your actions than simply mashing buttons. I'm not against the idea of an easier difficulty setting for people who don't play this type of game often, but the experience of finally getting it down and sticking it to a boss is really satisfying. Some of the game's appeal would be lost without it.\n\nI finished the game in about 8 or 9 hours of play time, though I feel like there were a lot of secrets I missed, and there is a new game + mode as well so replay value seems good. Definitely will be playing this more in the future.","April 4","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The art style is also objectively gorgeous, and has more detail and consistency than you'd expect.

Its cryptic hints at a background story and its beautiful art whet my appetite in a way no game has since The Legend of Zelda.

The story is mysterious and doesn't reveal itself right away, rather through the enviroment. If you pay attention to the opening cutscene and think about it some it starts to make sense and it is certainly not as limited as others say.\n\nThe combat is fair but challanging. The bosses will take some repitition and learning their patterns is the best way to go about it. This is not a hack n slash and combat is more like precise dueling than some sort of slamathon WWE poundtown. Strike when an oppertunity is available, then retreat and if possible throw a few shots from range. Just play patiently and you will be rewarded. When I died to bosses I found myself encouraged to go again rather than getting frustrated and quitting (which is my normal experience with difficult games ie dark souls).\n\nThe art is tremendous and really sinks you into the world. Make sure you take time to appritiate the details and enjoy the vistas, they are part of the experience! Don't rush through to complete this quickly as you won't understand the game or enjoy it as much. And while you are enjoying it, look for secret walls or cliff edges, they hold worthwhile rewards.\n\nIn all, I highly recommend this game. The difficulty is there but does not alienate those not typically fond of that (me). The art kept me motivated when I struggled and gave me time to breathe. The story kept me enthralled and thinking, but thinking is definitely necessary if you want to understand it.

The music atmosphere and animations make enemies and the main character a pleasure to watch as they attempt to dismantle eachother. The game is also dense with secrets, with unfortunately some boiling down to running against walls and leaps of faith.\n\nI would wadger that a casual play through might clock in at 7-8 hours, depending on how many upgrades your willing to search high and low to finance. Almost all important additions to your abilities are bought from trainers, with the exception of guns that mostly lie behind the games major boss fights. Some are more useful then others: the chain dash is extremely important but upgrading your pistol clip or learning the slash into dash can wait.\n\nThere are issues: frame rate can make executing some of your moves difficult. Your character will sometimes drop dashes when chaining them and there's not much to do, and it gets annoying trying to execute a 7+ chain dash required to clear some of the more difficult puzzels and your imput dropping or your character skidding to his certain death. The secrets in some areas are well marked, but those same markers in the same broad area might just be junk on the floor. It is compounded partially by the style of graphics: the charming pixels with tons of doo-dads on the walls and floor mean that it looks like everything might have a switch or passage behind it.\n\nYou can't track where you've found things aside from the games diamond shards (which act as keys for progression) so you might wander an area for hours trying to find elusive secret collectables only to learn apon consulting a map that you've already cleaned it out long ago. Most of the rewards as you move to full collections tend to be minor: there are outfits that have different effects on them of varying use (some are quite subtle) but the most powerful effects they have are generally obtained past when they mattered anyway.\n\nThat being said there's a lot of fun to be had exploring and buying upgrades and fighting some very intense ambushes and bosses in the grim but very colorful ruins of hyper light drifter.","April 7","true","27.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Whose idea was it to make you dash 800 times in a row? Sadistic. I got to six-hundred and something and buckled under the pressure and wrist strain. Why is the football kid such a prick? I'm supposed to be a hero or something, why do they want to hip-check me the second I get within a couple feet? Brutal.\nAll right, that's all the salt out of me. This game may well be the first of any that I've seen on Steam, looked into a little, and then immediately bought without discussing it with friends. Haven't regretted that decision in the slightest (bar good-natured football kid hate). The game recommends you use a controller, but I recently switched over to using keyboard and mouse instead and I think I actually prefer it - if you want to use k&m, don't feel discouraged. Both options are definitely viable.\nGameplay is fantastic; it has what I gather are Legend of Zelda and Souls Series vibes to it, with a few platformer elements thrown in. Exploration, combat and difficulty definitely seems reminiscent of the impression I got of Bloodborne, with the caveat that checkpoints for the most part seem a bit more frequent/forgiving.\nIt can be a bit challenging to figure out what some things are supposed to do and what your objectives actually are, but considering the almost complete lack of text in the game it's probably pretty fantastic that a blind playthrough is even possible, which it very much is, even if the secrets are pretty easily missable. Luckily, most problems can be solved with the tried-and-tested "go wherever you haven't been yet and interact with whatever looks important" method.\nIt's good. Well worth the £15. Would recommend.","April 7","true","28.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But I had anticipated Hyper Light Drifter for a few months simply going off the trailer, and incredibly, it actually fully held up to my internal hype. The world is absolutely gorgeous, from the central hub to the various worlds to the north, east, etc. Each area has something unique to offer visually and strategically, and while it can be fairly linear in it's pathing to objectives, it also rewards the player that decides to explore, and solve the various puzzles hidden throughout the levels. As for the combat, I'd liken it to that of Bloodborne, oddly enough. You will come to areas where there are several enemies, all of which are stronger than you, and your only advantage over them is their specific attack pattern that you need to learn and counter. You will die. A lot. But as you progress, you will unlock new abilities and hone your reflexes, to the point where things that seemed impossible will be laughable. And holy ♥♥♥♥, is it ever satisfying when you finally clear an area you've been working on for the better part of an hour.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like beautiful, meticulously designed worlds with a diverse array of enemies and plenty of hidden passages to explore, you'll love Hyper Light Drifter.

Being the pinnacle of anime character, you have the ability  that every nekketsu protagonist dream to have : you cough blood.\n\nFor one reason or another, you're going from place to place, doing genocide and regicide all while having acid trip and heart attacks.\n\nThat's pretty much my understanding at least. HLD doesn't talk much to you, or just doesn't at all. Upgrades are immensely useful if you want to have a better experience, so think thrice about what upgrade you chose first : I heavily recommend that you get the attack that send back projectile, it help me a lot (but I'm not your mother you do what you want)\n\nAll in all it's hard, but in a cheap way. Life bar could be restored at each death, it's not like it add challenge, it's just tedious.\n\nbut it's really enjoyable despite that. If you're getting crush by bosses : take a breath, observe them. deal with minions first and chain pistol + sword attack as much as possible. Also you can go in whichever direction you want, so if you're stuck with one boss, try another one, you might get useful weapons along to way to facilitate other encounters too.\n\nThe game is fairly lenghty, expect 5 to 7 hours before finishing it. Aiming for 100% or doing the new game+ will take a lot more time as there's a lot to explore, even though sometime I just don't know how.\n\nI highly recomment this game, do not give up on it because the beginning is tedious : it's not that hard.","April 1","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it is worth a try atleast! I don't mind the 30 fps and the Dev has mentioned why it is locked at 30, but I know a couple people have been complaining about headaches. I've never gotten headaches from any game except when I play Stereoscopic 3d for too long.","April 4","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ekaven/recommended/257850/","Ekaven","Ekaven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ekaven/","57 products in account","Amazing game. Here is why:\n-Very smooth and, for the lack of a better term, controlable controls.\n-Fair challenges. I have never died and thought "that was bull."\n-Exploration is very rewarding.\n-Gradual upgrades keep combat fresh.\n-The world is immersive. You can see the art but that is not the only thing. Every sound for movements/actions, music, atmosphere, and even dialogue (not actual dialogue. There are pictures in speach bubbles that tell a story quick and beautifully).\n-Fights are challenging and fun. Every fight including boss fights (for the most part), can be boiled down to maybe...two minutes, but the difficulty will have you trying again and again. Sounds frustrating but it is not as much as it seems. Travel time back to where you died almost always is zero. You almost always spawn right before your big battle. You only get punished with travel time if you die in...say a platfoming area.\n\nI honestly think that anyone giving this a bad rap because of difficulty really has never been challanged before and is used to the new formula of games. I call them interactive movies. It's a big topic but I think you get the gist. Get this game if you are willing be immersed in it with difficulty and all. If trying hard isn't your thing, look elsewhere. Those who stick with it will be rewarded greatly.\n\n","April 4","true","35.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is a masterpiece in all aspects, combining challenging combat reminiscent of Dark Souls with a unique style all it's own. The art style of this game escapes what can be described in words alone, a stylistic blend of otherworldly sci-fy and post-apocalyptic adventure, the game takes pixel art to an entirely new realm of graphic excellence. The beautifully crafted scenery and enemies are a delight to the eye, with the pixel graphics providing just enough fine detail to provide rich, engaging visuals while still allowing the player to apply their own imagination to the scene. The same can be said for the awe-inspiring story, told through vague images and leaving much to speculation. The story is exciting and engaging, but at the same time seemingly absent. The only clues to what you must do are the occasional vague hints told through images, leaving the player to their own devices. This seemingly utter lack of direction allows the player to make their own story, rather than having it spoon fed to them as so many modern games do. The beauty of this game is how it forces you to make your own choices and theories, not knowing if they are even remotely correct. This amount of freedom is liberating- nothing is given easily to the player, they must earn it through skill and perserverence. That level of satisfaction gained from overcoming an obstacle that this game provides in ample supply is essential to connecting and engaging with the player, and is missing from far too many games. The combat is tough but fair, constantly keeping the player on their toes. Combat is fast paced, yet crisp and responsive, with varied and challenging enemies. The soundtrack is a wonder of audio engineering, with scores ranging from light, enchanting melodies to dark, gritty anthems that set the player on edge. The music completes a rich, ambient overall style with the artwork, a beautiful blend that engrosses and envelops the player.\n\nTL:DR\nThis is a masterpiece of modern game design and it would be a disservice to both yourself and society as a whole to not buy it.\nOverall rating: 10/10; Pinnacle of modern game design.","April 4","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Would recommend. Read below for further details.\n\nPROS\n- Atmosphere: From the very beginning you are sucked into this world. The music and art design blend together wonderfully creating a drive to explore your surroundings.\n\n- Combat: Battles require precision over mashing. The controls felt tight and once you understand what enemies are capable of battles become a dance. You'll battle melee and ranged foes, sometimes at once. Dispaching a room of enemies without taking damage is very satisfying.\n\n- Level design: There are four distinct areas to explore in HLD. There is a minimap but I rarely had to use it. The levels have enough branching paths but not too many that you get lost often. There are NUMEROUS hidden nooks and crannies to find. There are some environmental tells but the visuals are so cohesive that the player really has to look and explore to find extra goodies. This is where the dash movement mechanic really shines as you'll constantly find yourself dsahing across gaps to small ledges in search of secrets. The developers really did setup the environment to syngergize with the core movement mechanic of dashing.\n\n- Boss Battles: While many people feel the battles are too hard, I though the difficulty was well tuned. All of the bosses have a unique visual design and require different strategies to beat. There was never a boss I had to replay more than seven times (including the final boss). You revive right outside the boss room and a recent patch sped up the player death animation so restarting was not frustratingand after every death. The battles are tense and require constant focus but that makes victory that much more satisfying. I was able to beat the entire game without buying any healing upgrades so with healing fully upgraded I feel many players can complete the game if they learn the patterns and stay determined.\n\nCONS\n- Upgrade System: Melee attacks, movement abilities, and the secondary gun can be upgraded along with a few other things. In keeping with zero dialogue or explanatory text the upgrades merely show a quick clip of what they are. This does leave some ambiguity in what new abilities do. Also, as all upgrades can be purchased from the beginning, choosing an upgrade is simply guesswork. All of the abilities are useful (to an extent) but the currency to purchase them has to be found through exploration so new upgrades can only be purchased so quickly. Buy one you won't need for some time and you're out currency and the gameplay doesnt change. I did a decent amount of additional exploration and did not find enough currency to upgrade everything. Not a problem to me personally but then I was happy with what I chose to upgrade.\n\n- Autosave System: I understand why the game has auto-save. It allows the devs to provide difficult sections of the game. The game saves so often I don't think I was never bothered but life does happen so be aware you can't stop playing whenever you want (unless you don't mind replaying a section).\n\n- Length: I was only lost once that I can recall and I didn't waste much time dashing around (for a certain achievement) and I beat the game in six hours. I was hoping for an 8-10 hour experience. There is a new game plus and I didn't get all the collectables but for what I'm calling the main game, it was a tad short.\n\nOverall Impression\n- Hyper Light Drifter was worth the 18 USD (sale price). Some of the best boss fights I've played. Great combat. The story presentation being purely visual challenged me to think about the world and what the Drifter's purpose was. Is the game difficult? At times, but you are given all the tools to overcome. Like many of the best indie games, Hyper Light Drifter provides a unique and focused experience you will not get anywhere else.","April 4","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The visuals are some of the most beautiful I've seen in the pixel art genre, and there are various astonishing sights to see, some of which I would stop to study for a couple minutes. The soundtrack is great too, Disasterpeace does some of the most unique chiptune music I've ever heard.\n\nBefore playing I was a little worried since a lot of people have been saying the game is too hard and frustrating to be fun, but after playing it through I wholeheartedly disagree. The bosses are very hard, that I wont deny anyone, but I found all of them really engaging and never frustrating, even though I died repeatedly on a few of them. Combat in this game is more about being aware of your surroundings and timing your actions than simply mashing buttons. I'm not against the idea of an easier difficulty setting for people who don't play this type of game often, but the experience of finally getting it down and sticking it to a boss is really satisfying. Some of the game's appeal would be lost without it.\n\nI finished the game in about 8 or 9 hours of play time, though I feel like there were a lot of secrets I missed, and there is a new game + mode as well so replay value seems good. Definitely will be playing this more in the future.","April 4","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's Dark-Souls-like in the sense that you're an unamed "drifter" in a post-apocalyptic world, w/ several sweeping vistas, where the lore isn't heavily explained & items are hidden out of the way on corpses (ok maybe it's very Dark-Souls-y).\nThe game is hard, but not impossible. But it's heaps more forgiving than Dark Souls, death just puts you back at the start of a room. Anyway, the pixel art is smexy, the music & environments are moody. The gameplay is very fast-paced. With a host of hidden items, costumes & other secrets Hyper Light Drifter is definitely worth $20 (imo).\n\nEdit 4/12/16:\nSo a bit of a stink has been raised over the game's 30 fps cap. Though I think the issue has been blown out of proportion a bit (the game is still quite playable @ 30 imo), I agree that uping the fps to 60 would significantly improve the game.","April 4","true","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The difficulty bar is set at a moderate height, the game's difficulty is hard enough, but the game itself is generous as it gives you everything you need to not die. The multiple deaths on boss fights can get frustrating, but it doesn't take awy from the game. As for the story, it's only really explained with pictures, which is okay for me, and is quite original.

Gorgeous use of shape and colour, too.\n\nThe audio is an absolute treat.  The game's hazy, SNES-influenced soundscape mixes perfectly with Rich Vreeland's predictably wonderful musical score, that sounds not unlike what would happen if Tangerine Dream and Boards Of Canada did the sweetest damn collab ever.  Moreover, both the sound and music tie in to other aspects of the game on a  deep level.  Sound is often used to highlight enemy attacks and pinpoint hidden secrets, and the music swells and modulates in such a way as to offer punctuation and drama to the visual storytelling on offer.  It really is a treat.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and responsive but challenging, and punishes sloppy play.  Easy to pick up, tough to beat, satisfying to master.  This game wears its Legend Of Zelda and Dark Souls influences on its sleeve, and is all the better for it.  Bosses can occasionally feel cheap, but this is less down to overall unfairness as it is to complex attack patterns and strategies.  You will try, try and try again, slowly learning how best to chink away at its armour, and when you eventually defeat it, the sense of accomplishment is wonderful.\n\nThis game is not for everybody.  I imagine some people will bounce off its offputting initial difficulty curve and that the bosses will cause many a smashed joypad and ragequit.  However, for those willing to be truly challenged in exchange for some of the best audiovisual storytelling and exploration in videogames, then you can't get much better than this.  I've waited since the Kickstarter back in 2013 and I am in no way disappointed.\n\nIt's an absolute masterpiece.","April 1","true","24.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just beat the first boss and it was so fun. This game is full of challange and your character dying over and over again but it never feels repetive and always feels fair when you died. It also has a beautiful pixel art that is very detailed and vibrant and just nice to look at. I did notice some abilities you buy do not seem to not work all the time. Like how I got the dash multiple times ability and im pressing space and sometimes I randomly get 4 jumps and usally just get 1 and I dont really know how to force myself character to do it the only direction im given is press space twice jump twice and I do that and it dosent work hope it will be reworked or fixed. Whenever I try to get multiple I cant it just wont let me. Also it has this wierd prefrence of story of just images to explain maybe dialouge npcs are trying to tell you? But I have not seen a word of dialouge come out of npcs mouthes or your own character. Which dont get me wrong is pretty cool seeing the pictures instead of just words. But im often confused when I cant interpret the pictures and what is happeing and etc. Overall great combat, beautiful, challenging, fair, confusing, and great.

It might be one of the best looking (2D) games I've seen in a very long time. The audio and music are also on point and fit the game very well.\nThe combat is fast, fluid, fun and pretty hard but more on that later. I'd say the combat is a bit like Devil May Cry but in 2D.\nHLD isn't holding your hand either. It drops you straight into the action with basically no explaination whatsoever. This wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the fact that they refuse to explain anything! I for example went to the Northern area first and there were some collectibles there, if I collect one of them a screen would appear with a square and one corner of the square would light up without any context. Maybe I haven't played far enough for it to make sense but as of now it's all a bit too criptic for my taste.\nAnother problem I encountered are the PC controls. The game recommends a controller and I can see why! The mouse and keyboard controls aren't bad per se but in combat the cursor can become your worst enemy making combat way harder than it actually is. The problem is that both attacking and (more importantly) dodging go in the direction the cursor is facing. So say you're moving to the left but and you need to dodge an incoming attack but your cursor is on the right side of the screen you will dodge to the right even though you were moving to the left. It's infuriating and I hope there will be an update that prioritizes the direction you're going to the cursor.\n\nYet even with these complaints I recommend Hyper Light Drifter just make sure you get yourself a controller and that you can handle the vagueness from time to time (although that might disappear later in the game). The combat still is a lot of fun and the atmosphere is just superb!","March 31","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are checkpoints everywhere.  But there's the same emphasis on deadly fights and big, connected maps.) and which aren't apparent from the trailer (both the art and sound design are gorgeous).\n\n1: Holy ♥♥♥♥, the map design.  There are a bajillion nooks and crannies and hidden paths.  Exploration is _very_ much rewarded.  And it's not like some games where it's a matter of pressing the A button or the E key on every single wall.  There are a lot of nice patterns as for figuring out where the hidden panels are, and the game does a nice job of training you to see them.\n\n2: The balance is _perfect_.  You don't have any stats which increase over the course of the game (closest thing to getting more health is getting more capacity for healing potions).  Yet you definitely feel like you're getting stronger as you progress through an area.  The upgrades are great, but they can pretty much only be used to exploit a weakness once you've figured out an enemy's pattern.  This means that even though the game branches out very early on, you don't have to worry about being too OP and tearing through the area you choose last, or getting crushed in the area you choose first.  In any case, enemies are introduced gradually, so you get trained in how to fight them before you see too many of them.  Exception being those charging plant monsters.  ♥♥♥♥ them D:\n\n3: Try to buy the dash chaining upgrade as soon as possible.

This game's idea of difficulty is throwing wave after wave of enemies at you at once, making it essentially more of bullet hell game than anything else. Upgrades exist, but will barely improve your survival chances.\nThe main character is slow, unresponsive (30 fps ahoy) and has a far to large hitbox, making enemies with projectiles a hassle to deal with.\n\nThe game leaves you completely free to choose the order in which you tackle the different area's and their respective bosses, but these regions are definitely not balanced, and 1 of the bosses is a lot harder than all of the others.\n\nTo top it off, the chain dashing mechanic required by the game to obtain currency for upgrades and key for completing the game, essentially locks these items behind a deeply frustrating rythm mechanic for which there's barely any proper cue which is the proper rythm unless you crank the sfx volume way up, what's even worse is that the animations don't sync with this rythm.\n\nThe developers and fans of the game cite a Dark Souls inspiration or even a Zelda one, and try to justify the difficulty of this game in doing so. It seems to me they've clearly never played those games. While Dark Souls may be hard, it's definitely not unfair, this game is. Although the difficulty in Zelda ramps up throughout the game, it never really becomes overly hard, and genereously awards players with more and more equipment and health to take on tougher enemies, don't expect such generosity here however...\n\nAll in all, this could have been a great game, but it has been ruined by the developer's choice that only those with the perseverance and the time to suffer through their random mechanics get to enjoy the game. After dying countless times on yet another impossible path, I simply gave up.","April 3","false","9.9"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","15","32","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zippomatt/recommended/257850/","zippomatt","Dictionary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zippomatt/","314 products in account","Price is incredibly high for a 3 hour game made artificially longer by having to scrape every surface searching for "secrets" that, in a best case scenario, lead you to 1/4th of a largely useless upgrade point. Sometimes, if you look really hard you'll end up finding a costume palette swap or hidden obelisk which contribute nothing coherent to the story. This is by far my biggest complaint, if you don't enjoy running into every single wall of every single room checking for interactable and or destructible points you're not going to 100% this game.\n\nAlso, there are several instances of bugged walls+floors (gaps where there shouldn't be gaps) which will bait you into believing you've found a secret when in reality you're wasting 20 mins in a room with absolutely no reward or significance. There seems to be no obvious logic or consistency in hints towards hidden paths especially in the case of the "clear" platforms which at times only make themselves visible after you've dashed into what appears to be thin air. Everything outside of combat is tiresome and frustrating and even combat becomes so easy it's hardly a positive.\n\nThe upgrade system is hardly relevant after learning the chain dash (a technique which is necessary to complete several of the game's puzzles) since your best combat ability is innately available in the form of animation cancelling. This reduces the difficulty of combat drastically and effectively the entire game. The extra health packs aren't even necessary at the rate they place them throughout the world. Then there's the issue of the shotgun doing entirely too much damage and making all fights subsequent to its discovery ridiculously easy.\n\nNow, if you're looking for a "real" challenge there's New Game+, the mode which simply reduces your health from 5 to 2 and offers nothing else. No thanks.","April 3","false","7.9"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","1"

I have not collected all the secrets or even started NG+.\n\nI will edit this review if I find more to gain from this game.\n\nAs of right now I cannot say that this game is worth the $18 asking price. With the game of just playthrough, no bactracking for secrets, you'll see about a 3-4 hour game time. This doesn't involved the time out of game where you'll try to puzzle what the story actually meant or why your character was meant to do anything at all as the end of the game makes the journey feel almost pointless.\n\nConfusing characters, and limited gameplay options make for an obtuse experience with a great art and music direction. I was so sad to feel let down by this game. After following this game's development I can honestly say that it does not offer what I thought it would.\n\nIn the long run I think there will be more to gain after beating NG+ and collecting all the secrets but for now I cannot recommend this game to someone who is not secret gatherer or someone who doesn't enjoy getting their ♥♥♥ handed to them for multiple rounds with a difficult boss.\n\nEdit:\nI want to add onto this that the game back when I first looked at the kickstarter was a lot more grand in scope and scale. It feels like the game was watered down from that, and it took the part of Zelda games I like the least in regards to secret finding. This is to say, "hopefully you notice that this part of the map is slightly different from the rest!"\n\nEdit 2:\nI promised I'd come back and talk about the game more after I got the secrets. After getting all the monoliths and figuring out the language of the world and putting together the story of what is going on I can tell you now that this game assuredly is not worth your time if you want a story that is interesting and complex while stil being accessible.\n\nThe devs should be ashamed of putitng such a complex story behind strange writing and hard to access areas. They should have taken a leaf out of dark souls' book and realized how to hide a story while still having it be accessible to those who look. Having to translate a bunch of hidden monoliths from a language that was luckily guessed was a nightmare,\n\nI can now promise you that this game is not worth your time for the reasons previously stated and also because of a lack luster story hidden behind a wildly trivial language barrier.\n\nTL:DR\n\nFun gameplay, trival story, and not worth $18.

I wanted to like it, but it quickly just turned into a slog. Can't recommend, though maybe it's better with a controller.\n\nTo go into more depth:\n\nThere's something to be said for games that don't spell it all out for you. Dark Souls, for example, gives you a lot of lore and interesting story, if you care to dig it out. Hyper Light Drifter, on the other hand, feels a lot like someone saw that and decided to ape it in a clumsy attempt at being mysterious and deep, which unfortunately just makes it vague and annoying. All I've gotten out of the story so far is that it's so obtuse that I don't really care about it. I have no desire to puzzle out what the game is trying to tell me, and that's a shame because it's an otherwise interesting world.\n\nMy other complaint is fairly large, though it's mostly on me. I'm using a mouse and keyboard even though the game hints heavily that you should use a controller, mostly because I don't have one I can use. A game like this needs tight controls and it just doesn't have it if you use a mouse and keyboard. Everything is extremely imprecise and floaty. Gun shots veer off from where you aim to the point that you can't be sure how to aim at things, despite how basic it seems. Dashes hurl you off in slightly wrong directions, making mobility during combat a clumsy, frustrating affair. I never once felt like I was getting better, or learning the system. Most fights just felt like a crapshoot instead of an opportunity to get better at the mechanics.\n\nAnother complaint is the camera. It doesn't always follow you. Usually it's in something of a fixed position to display a single "screen" (if you remember Metroid, it's like that), and only shifts when you reach the edge and go into another "screen". There are numerous times where this is just awful, especially in areas where combat occurs. If the controls weren't bad enough, imagine having to blindly dash off-screen because enemies back-flipped out of the screen you're currently in and are now shooting you from somewhere you can't see.\n\nOverall, it wouldn't be a terrible purchase on sale. Just don't expect a lot of depth to the story or the gameplay.","April 4","false","2.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Sure, the graphics and music are awesome, but the difficulty is far from playable, at least for me. I know that since Dark Souls came out, it is considered a good thing that you have to die 100 times before you defeat an enemy, but I cannot agree with that.\n\nThe main problem is the battle system. You can easily hanlde 1, 2, maybe 3 enemies, but after the first hour or so, the game easily throws 10 and more enemies at you, in a tiny, locked up space and they all attack you at once. Some shot you, some quickly charge at you and some do other stuff. But the game doesn't give you anything against that, just a sword and a gun (which you cannot use in the fast paced battles, because aiming takes too much time), no defensive moves except from dashing away, no way to block attacks and you can only take a few hits before you die after 3 seconds of "battle". This looks like a serious balancing issue to me.\n\nThis is not what I consider to be fun and therefore, I asked for a refund, which makes me sad as I was really looking forward to this game after I saw the first videos of it, but nice graphics and music don't make a game fun to play.","April 10","false","1.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebornaleph/recommended/257850/","rebornaleph","Red","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebornaleph/","142 products in account","Hyper Light Drifter is a game built on the shoulders of giants. It wears its inspirations (Legend of Zelda; Dark Souls) on its sleeve and that's not always a bad thing. I'm going to analyse the core design of the game and provide my own opinion on how to fix them bit by bit.\n\nThe obvious and most noticeable benefit the game has is its beautiful pixel art so I'm just going to get that out of the way and say what everybody else has already said: It looks beautiful. No denying that. The most obvious and noticeable drawback is the crippling framerate, which was, as far as I can tell, a conscious decision -- not a limitation of Game Maker: Studio.\n\nPROBLEM: The level design is just not very good. The problem is the clutter and the poor conveyance in regards to fake walls and passageways. It was extremely easy for me to get lost. Having to backtrack over the same area time and again is not an acceptable waste of my time. I rapidly got sick of sniffing walls for secret doors and the genius decision to hide progression-crucial paths behind such gimmicks is incomprehensible. A camera pan that only occurs if the player nonsensically stares into an abyss which does not, in any way, prompt the player to investigate the area; a hidden glitch-like clipping through a few pixel trees; some weird soulless floating object which you have to shoot which is completely out of range of sight until the player approaches the edge of a map, and stands still for a few seconds so the camera interpolation can catch up; these are not secrets and it does not contribute to subtle exploration and world-building. This is wall-sniffing. I was initially unsure on whether the designer intended to do this but it occurs so frequently that I must accept that it was a thing they were going for. Well, as far as I'm concerned, it failed.\n\nSOLUTION: As a designer, you must understand that your level must always subtly funnel the player toward their goal. Remove the weird transitions hidden behind blocks of trees entirely or remove trees that obstruct vision. Reduce the distance between platforms to ensure players can realistically view hidden areas, or create assets which visually guide the player to approach said gaps more often. As it stands, it takes a gigantic leap of logic to even approach the gaps at the start before you even know you should, and after that, the player will be doing that systematically, which removes the joy of exploring and turns it into a meticulous chore.\n\nCombat is very fast paced while also retaining an acceptable degree of strategy and timing. Utilizing a hidden limiter mechanic, the creator made it so that after the regular three-hit combo, there is a punishing delay until the player may attack again.\n\nPROBLEM: Unfortunately, the player can never really upgrade this at any point, as far as I can tell. The addition of a swift dash helps to string combos together and the later addition of an ability that damages enemies while dashing is very useful to this end as well. This may sound good on paper, but the problem arises when attacking enemies with the sword is so suboptimal that you might as well not have the ability to attack at all.\n\nSOLUTION: I realize the amount of work it would be to properly balance new types of weapons and to draw and animate sprites. I feel it would have been the best choice to implement a few other melee weapons which have contrasting benefits and drawbacks as opposed to so many different guns. I'd also like to point out that allowing the player to improve the number of attacks per combo would have gone a long way into making melee combat slightly more bearable and less frustrating.\n\nPROBLEM: You have access to many types of guns which sounds interesting at first. The problem is two-pronged: First, guns are not properly balanced; each pellet from the Shotgun is strong enough that, given proximity, it completely and absolutely deletes any need to use any other gun, ever. Secondly, the only way to regain ammunition is to attack enemies or objects. If you come across a puzzle or a situation where you need bullets and don't have a ready source of regaining, you're going to be forced to backtrack, which is not acceptable.\n\nSOLUTION: Firstly, I don't feel the game really gained anything from having so many gun types and I feel the creator just mostly had trouble to think of rewards to give the player after each boss fight. It's far easier to draw, animate and implement different gun sprites than to implement more meaningful melee weapons, so I guess I can understand. In what concerns the ammunition, adding an ammo regaining mechanic based on time on top of the existing one, whereby it will replenish with time and only outside of combat, could go a long way.\n\nPROBLEM: Healing isn't properly thought out. Being stuck in the same string of challenges with 1 peg of health and no healing kits is ridiculously punishing. This happened to me on more than one occasion. Healing kits can be found throughout the levels but I found myself either starved for kits at the time I needed them most, or being full and having to leave kits behind. It was a smart decision to automatically use a healing kit should the belt be full, but the point is less of an organic resource just like Estus Flasks from Dark Souls, but instead an external benefit that the player has no real agency over -- either use them at 1 health or don't use them at all; it is devoid of real strategy.\n\nSOLUTION: Replenishing the player's health after dying and granting them a single healing item should they have none is a solution that would not contradict the game's design and would help to facilitate the tackling of challenges repeatedly without feeling like an unfair meat-grinder. I get the feeling the designer did not want to replenish the kits at a checkpoint because they didn't want the mechanic to be seen as a straight rip-off from the Souls series and I would bet it was that way sometime during development -- I get this feeling because warp points heal the player anyway, as well as replenish their ammo, but never kits. If it got changed sometime later, the change was unjustifiable partially because the challenges were not balanced around the idea that a player may be completely out of healing at any given point. If it was never that way from the get go, then it's just a bad decision altogether. The Estus Flasks are a very elegant system; if a formula works, there is absolutely no reason to change it, especially if it becomes such a marked step below what it was initially. There is no shame in reappropriating a good idea.\n\nPROBLEM: There is no story. By that, I don't mean that there is absolutely no plot, but the ambiguity and esoteric meaning of everything that occurs both at the start as well as the end was a very poor choice. Humans use words to communicate because it's incredibly difficult to convey complex emotions and ideas without verbal communication. It's easy to sign and emote simple notions, such as simple geometric shapes and basic instinctive desires like hunger or cold. However, once it begins involving themes that imply mysticism, relating to symbols becomes harder and harder.\n\nSOLUTION: For this reason, to retain the wordless theme, going for a simpler, more earthly and relatable plot would do wonders to make the player feel engaged and motivated to partake. I don't care about anything that's happening because I don't understand what's happening at all, and the absense of any compelling side character doesn't help, either. The big themes may remain, but I feel presenting them as secrets and hidden lore would have been the better choice instead of frontloading them.\n\nUnfortunately, I still have many gripes which I would love to address but I'm sure I'm reaching the character limit. For now, I'm going to say: Wait for these problems to be addressed.","April 9","false","13.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The title was slated to include much, much more than actually managed to make it into the game, and it appears as though there will be no attempt to integrate these missing, promised, funded features.\n\nI feel very fortunate as to only have paid $15 for this title, as I'd recommend it for purchase only below the ten dollar mark. While the game initially invoked memories and feelings I'd only be able to draw from older adventure games such as The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages that I had played long ago, these feelings of nostalgia quickly wore thin as I progressed past the first boss for me in the eastern section. The game is highly opaque in its setting and story, which I would appreciate if there existed much of a real setting beneath its extremely polished artsytle, environments, and laudable musical score.\n\nGameplay suffers from the occasional bug of any variety, few of which had much if any impact on what I've played. The combat system enables players to really put themselves into engaging and entertaining situations that may occasionally seriously challenge them. It's unfortunate that the limited number of upgrades, purchasable only with often hidden currency fragments stashed around in both enemies and recessed corners, are rather difficult to fully explore and access. It may well take people multiple playthroughs of the title to try everything out.\n\nWhile environments are novel, I feel as though the game often falls flat as it draws the player into its world, beckoning one in with all of the often inaccessable platforms off to the side and number of fragments in each quadrant. So many of these hidden areas are dependent upon finding nearly pixel-sized gaps in walls or barriers, requiring incessant terrain-hugging to find any of these spaces without resorting to third party information.\n\nI do not plan on finishing this title, as I have yet to recieve the game I backed. Too much promised is completely absent to look upon the title favorably. I will unfortunately remember Hyper Light Drifter as an ultimately lackluster, half-baked Kickstarter game, reasons behind delays and missing content notwithstanding.","April 6","false","5.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

I think it could be a fantastic game, but the controls didn't feel as crisp as I was expecting and the room restart mechanic ended up being a lot more frustrating than I anticipated. Also, part of the uniqueness is no real decent intro to anything it just sends you in the middle of everything with confusing hieroglyphs and unintelligible menus.

Absolute recomendation to pickup full price or at a sale.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a Top down, explorative Action RPG developed by Heart Machine through Kickstarter support a few years back.\n\nThe art, visuals, and controls feel impecable. Slashes have a nice swing to them, the dashes look excellent, the environment it beautiful on first glance, and the ambience music provides a wonderful vibe to the game. The controls feel like your standard twin stick shooter, but only rebindable for Keyboard+Mouse. Options may not be the best for some, and yes, it is locked at 30fps. I had no complaints, other than some sections where lots of flashing lights were present.\n\nThe game throws you in, arms open while you figure out which of the cardinal sections to go and collect some fragments. All of the game's cues are red herrings, as you can basically go any area you want (Except South). Most of the story is told through pictures, and sfx the Npc's make.\n\nThere is a very sudden learning curve, some may not enjoy it. Many have compared HLD to Titan Souls, or the other Souls variety, and you can feel that difficulty. You'll begin dashing around, slashing with guns blazing, but soon develop strategies against tougher bosses or opponents. The town sells skills/upgrades to your base dash, guns, sword, etc through credits you'll find over the world through fights and secrets. They only provide a singluar base upgrade, and most times feel fundamental in several fights, so come back from time to time and buy them.\n\nHyper Light Drifter has ALOT of secrets and thus backtracking/exploration of the levels. Most times, you'll have to take a dash of faith to see what lies off a cliff side, and can feel plain silly at times. The little widget, however, does provide ? cues when near the area, so slow down and mash the char against walls.\n\nThe game took me about 7 hours to complete, and does have a New Game+ mode making the game harder. You'll find yourself backtracking, exploring, and enjoying the minigames around town and the world area. Frustrations will happen. But if you take it methodically, and analyze your actions/enemy moves, the game becomes all the much more fun.\n\nHyper Light Drifter was a wonderful experience, that you truly can't experience again if you've watched other play it. So I recomend you snag it for yourself. It may be difficult at first, but you soon grasp what is happening, and come to ease with the difficulty. The game is well polished enough that you shouldn't run into many issues, and the experience should entertain you as it did me :3\n\n","April 4","true","11.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I have been looking forward to this game since I first saw it on kickstarter forever ago. I hyped all over the floor the second it appeared on steam. Bought it the first chance I had. Go to play it for the first time, the cool banner appears, and... "Application has been blocked from acessing graphics hardware". Game crashes. I have tried every fix in the book. Reinstalling my drivers, messing with my TdrDelay, changing the TdrLevel to 0, and every other thing imaginable. Nothing works. I am using an HP Envy (8G ram, 2G dedi graphics with an intel 4600) and I can run Space Engineers, Transistor, Borderlands 2, you name it, just fine. But i cant even get to the main menu without it crashing? halp\n\nUpdate*\nAfter a few hours of troubleshooting and spelunking through the forums, I found a solution. Turns out there is a config text file in the game directory. After making the necesary changes, it boots up just fine. Let me just take a moment to express how incredibly worth it the process was. The game is incredible. The visuals are striking, and the soundtrack is a perfect fit. I will heavily recomend that you use a controller. I tried playing it with a keyboard/mouse, and it was damn near impossible. Use my Ps4 controller however, and it was smooth sailing. (and by smooth sailing I mean bearably difficult)  A lot of people have been put off by the 30fps limit. It isnt noticable. As a matter of fact, I agree with the decision. This game is VERY timing sensitive. Having the fps a constant 30 makes sense. All in all, huge fan, very pleased with this product.","March 31","true","28.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Well, let's get this thing started.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is something everyone should experience in their lives.\nYou start the game with little direction and a beautiful world. Each path you choose comes with it's own trials and rewards, and at the start you probably won't know where to go. So trust your gut. I went east, because it was the closet place to the house that I assume you stay at. In the beginning you meet a man in red and pink. He's the closest thing to a guide you have in this world. Finding him, he'll mark important locations on your map, if you haven't been to them already.\n\nIt's not an easy road but it's a rewarding one. The challanges the game gives you are fair, it's just up to you how you handle them. I never found a room I couldn't handle, even if it took more than one try. Pick your abilities carefully and be positive about what guns you are using. Buy the bomb early, it helps.\n","April 7","true","14.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Reminds me of Axiom Verge and Zelda.\n\nWhich is good in certain aspects such as excellent retro style art (not just pixel graphics) and it's adherence to theme throughout the expierence. The visuals are really a shining point for this game.\n\nHowever like Axiom Verge this title suffers from some retro game problems that have no place in modern games.\n\nI found the exploration portion of the game (it's a substantial part...like most of it) grew tedious as you pixel hunt each area trying to find extra loot hidden all over the level. The loot itself seems to be either health refills or coinage...and that's it. I mean if I'm searching for something and I stumble upon a seceret it would be nice to have some mystery as to what I was going to find there but some of you may enjoy getting the same christmas presents year after year.\n\nThe combat style is sort of a mish-mash of button mashing and screen dashing that comes off okay. It could defintely be smoother but if you are technically precise and know what you are doing you will be successful. That's easier said than done as mob rushes are common and can be overwhelming.  The fact that you just start over at the begining of the screen is an old and tired mechnic that winds up having the effect of not caring one bit if I roll off a cliff or get KO'ed right before I kill the last bad man on screen.\n\nIf your looking to scratch your Zelda itch and enjoy the aesthics of video games this a pretty solid title. I would say it needs some serious revamping to elevate itself up to Titan Souls or Shovel Knight territory.\n\n6/10 --- Solid Fun mixed with some tedious searching sets this as a slightly above average title in my book. While the price might be a bit too high for the gameplay itself the unique setting and visuals makes up for a bit.","April 1","true","25.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

Hyper Light Drifter is how a pixel game should look like, it is a peice of art that should be in museums. the music is fantasic too, the syth work is reminiscent of a  sci fi 80-esc world. then the paino comes in with grand Debussy runs that shimmer like fine crystal, it is like the art style, just perfect.\n\nPros\n- PERFECT art style\n- Amazing music\n- Cool story\n- Instresting cobat\n\nCons\n- Janky AI\n- No manual saves\n- Very Hard (this might be a con for you, depends)\n- PC cursor is almost invisable\n\nif Hyper Light Drifter is tweeked just a bit, it will win game of the year like 20 times.","March 31","true","10.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beat_mesa/recommended/257850/","beat_mesa","Yosafire!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beat_mesa/","35 products in account","I've been following this game since the Kickstarter. I pre-ordered it, loving the graphics and feel to it (so I even came predispositioned towards the game!) but I really wish there was a "maybe" button, or halfway between yes and no.\n\nI really wanted to recommend this game. The artwork is phenomenal. Absolutely, 100% breathtaking. I can tell the work that was lovingly put into it. That would be the one glowing recommendation I would have for the game. Everything else has flaws that are so irritating or, well, flawed, that I can't get past them.\n\nFor some, the atmosphere of this game will be awesome. It's one of the things I love about it. I understand why the devs decided to have no dialogue - it adds to the overall "loneliness" feeling to the game. It puts that extra touch on the fact that the world is in ruins...and so are its people, due to various circumstances.\n\nWhen this becomes an issue is when you walk into a shop and have no idea what to do. This was one of the biggest dealbreakers for me. The upgrade system is hard to grasp, without any helpful dialogue. Even just a small, initial tutorial would fix this issue.\n\nIt wouldn't be that bad if I could even figure out what the game is trying to tell me. There are diagrams to help - but they just kind of complicate the problem of not knowing what's going on. There's a diamond shaped "plaque" in the middle of the square. I think I'm supposed to complete it, but the diagram showing what it does is so obtuse and hard to figure out what it's saying that I'm not really sure.\n\nThis also makes it difficult to understand where to go. Granted, I do think it's one of those where you can explore and wander and just do things in your own way. I didn't really mind it; I thought the exploration was a positive of the game. But for those who like a linear story and to know what's going on, this will bother you.\n\nThe game is locked at 30 fps. It didn't bother me, but it may bother some.\n\nThere are no options to change your controller configuration. I was using a USB Playstation 3 controller to my computer, and when you go into settings, you can choose between Keyboard & Mouse, Xbox Controller, and PS3. Changing between these two did not help the fact that I literally could not move and my "answer" button was square - and I would've highly preferred it to be X. I wish I could change these controls around.\n\nThere are no tutorials, beyond "e" to interact/"q" to heal, and the rest you find out as you go (more or less). This again didn't bother me that much, but it may bother others.\n\nNot much loot. You don't get anything from breaking open the numerous skeletons that lay about (except maybe recharging your gun, which would be a cool mechanic, if it actually charged it enough...)\n\nLast but not least, a lot of other reviewers mention issues with the combat system. I...would kind of have to agree. There's little use for the gun, because most of the time it either a) misses because it didn't shoot where you were pointing at or b) you're out of bullets, and nothing to slash to recharge it or c) enemies will, most of the time, come running at you in droves, and your sword is just such a far superior option. I didn't waste time with the gun so much because I found it was always out of bullets (though that may just be sucking with rationing them) and the sword was just better. A lot of times I found myself trying to shoot things in the environment to play around and see if it did anything, and there's little wiggle room for that when enemies are sprung upon you and most instantly charge you down.\n\nOverall, I simply cannot recommend this game because of these flaws. I really wanted to enjoy it. I sometimes even did. But the shop is just the thing that bothers me most of all. How am I supposed to understand what I'm doing if the diagrams are super convulted, don't give any helpful information, or enough of it to make sense? This is a thing where a tutorial *should've* been included, at least for the first one.\n\nI really wanted to believe in you, Heart Machine. I'll probably still play out the rest of this game, because I enjoy the graphics...even if it is endlessly frustrating.","April 5","false","2.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Ever since watching the awe inspiring Kickstarter trailer back in 2013 madly throwing money at the screen, pre-ordering the game plus its soundtrack. Now having finished the game in a little over 6 hours I have very mixed feelings about the game.\n\nThe game is at its best when it focuses on gameplay. Combat and level designs are extremely tight and well-crafted with enough nooks and crannies that feature hidden collectibles such as gear bits or modules that are necessary for progress and unlocking the final boss fight. Outside of that there are also collectible outfits and new ranged weapons ranging the starting pistol to a rail gun. Traversing the world and fighting enemies is a lot of fun.\n\nLevels look a bit like those in Super Giant’s Bastion, broken up land of floating islands that you dash between if the distance is not too great. There are cleverly hidden invisible platforms that your little hovering robot companion can make you aware of by having a question mark appear above it. The way Hyper Light Drifter structures its progress is similar to that of Dark Souls (specifically) since you travel towards four different lands to get to a collection of four modules (instead of the lord souls, since collecting four in each area unlocks the final boss fight) then you beat an area boss that unlocks a way to the monolith which lets you progress further in other areas or unlock secrets within the same area letting you collect more upgrade points or gear.\n\nCombat has an enticing rhythm to it, despite the dismal framerate. Each enemy has its own attack pattern with obviously telegraphed attacks that you learn very quickly and counter with you own set of skills. The most important skill is the very basic dashing ability, which lets you chain three dashes together making the player able to evade any attack thrown their way. To inflict damage upon the enemies there is the basic sword for close combat and pistol for ranged combat. While the sword stays pretty much the same throughout the game, the slots for ranged weapons receive several variations over the course of the playthrough. Hyper Light Drifter does a great job having all weapons staying relevant throughout, it all depends on the player and how they want to approach each encounter. For me it was switching between rail gun and shotgun depending on the current enemy line-up or boss’ pattern.\n\nWhen the game tries to tell its story it sharply conflicts with the polish and meticulous design of the gameplay. The story it tries to tell is intriguing at first but the problem is it starts falling apart due to its mishandled vagueness. Hyper Light Drifter again tries to mimic the Souls games, but it doesn’t know how to. It tries to tell a story of a world that while some bits are implied strongly enough that I can put together a basic line what possibly happened, but we do not know our own place within this world, if the journey actually happened, what or who our “Vergil” really is. There are moments where the game attempts to convey information through a short slide-show, which usually tells you short narrative about characters you’ve met or who the area boss is, but there is very little told in relation to your place or role within the world so little that by the end of the game what drove me to finish it was the gameplay and music rather than story.\n\nHyper Light Drifter’s aesthetic is striking and very well realized but it is being held back by its unreasonably low frame-rate. The developer Heart Machine made the strange choice and locked the game at 30FPS, which feels sluggish and slow for what is fast paced, close combat focused action adventure. On the other hand the pixel art is crisp and unique with matching colour scheme that is heavy on purple and shades of blue\green. The enemies’ visual designs are great with animations very distinct that you can clearly predict the enemy’s attack and determine a course of action. Overall outside of the obviously poor technical choice the game is a sight to behold with some of the game vistas being truly breath taking.\n\nThe sound design is a mixed bag, some of the sounds got on my nerves during larger encounters while the ambience and the music are absolutely stunning. Disasterpeace’s soundtrack is amazing giving the game personality that the story sadly couldn’t. Helping to set the mood and telling story of the area. The soundtrack is mostly relying on synths and other electronica specific devices to create very sci-fi sounding tracks, that wouldn’t be lost in the worlds of Shadowrun or Blade Runner. If I have to be brutally honest, soundtrack is easily the part of the game I have enjoyed the most.\n\nWhile the gameplay is great when it comes down to it as a whole the package is very underwhelming and leaves a lot to be desired from narrative and technical standpoints.","April 9","false","6.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

The gorgeous artwork combines with the moody soundtrack to evoke senses ranging from awe-inspiring wonder to suffocating menace.  Hyper Light Drifter displays a masterful sense of atmosphere that few games match, which in addition to the quick and brutal combat, hightens the excitement of fighting your way through desecrated homelands and ancient battlegrounds.  Your repetoire of tools for dealing with the waves of varied enemies in a given encounter is relatively simple; you have your basic three-hit combo of sword atttacks which charge ammunition for your ranged firearms , a purchaseable grenade, and your dash.  Waves of melee enemies will attempt to flush you from cover to give ranged attackers a shot at you, forcing you to dodge back into another group of deadly foes.  You need to quickly identify who, what, and when to attack.  If you make a mistake, you'll likely be punished, and punished severely.  As you die and retry, you'll go from reacting to impending threats to conducting the cadence of battle.  Combat is less about flashy button combinations and manual dexterity than quick wits, careful positioning, target prioritization, and stricking swiftly when you identify the opportunity.  The combat in Hyper Light Drifter is a dangerous and exciting joy.\nHowever, murdering your way through the beautiful environments alternates between being the only enjoyable way to interact with the world and being the ONLY way to interact with the world.  Exploration involves fighting the game's nigh-useless map in order to reach the next combat encounter until you come face to face with an area's boss on the surface.  Delve any deeper, and finding the hidden secrets in the game involves obsessively hugging walls and edges to the point of tedium in the hopes of locating a hidden path or invisible walkway.  These secrets can lead to extra health or currency, indecipherable glyphs, a new color scheme for your character, and, if you're lucky, an exciting new encounter to test your combat skills in.  Never do you find any narrative payoff.\nWhich is both astoundingly dumbfounding and disappointing.  For all the care gone into crafting the world, the game has, literally, NO plot.  The events of the opening cinematic, the events you play through in game, and the events revealed once you vanquish the final combat challenge are never connected or given reference in-game.  Whatever transpires between starting the game and viewing its credits is entirely dependant on your interpretation of how to connect the vague dots on display.  In practice it could mean anything.  In effect, it's meaningless.\nAnd so Hyper Light Drifter is a phenomenally pretty action game.  If you want anything else out of it, be prepared for disappointment.","April 8","false","26.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","1"

I'll happily admit that I suck at twitch shooters, and have no desire for punishingly difficult games. A game difficulty option wouldn't go amiss, but it is sadly lacking. This game appears to be built for hardcore speed runs, and this was not advertised at the outset of the kickstarter.\n\nHaving supported the kickstarter from the very beginning, back in 2014, I can say I'm disappointed by the final product. While it's only $10 down the drain for me financially, it's a whole two years following the development of HLD and being hyped for the release. I've been cheated and mislead, and I don't appreciate that at all.","April 6","false","4.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Most games introduce a technique, allow you to become comfortable with it and then combine it with a different technique. HLD just throws some stuff in your face and expects you to keep up. First time you've seen a rolling plant-monster, you'll have four of them trying to kill you. Where is the RPG part of this game!? No dialogue trees, no NPCs, no levelling up - only some very obtuse upgrades. The 30fps design choice seems a bit eye-swimming at times.\n\nThe Ugly: Boss Fights are on the far end of the difficulty curve, and require patterns to be learned and mastered.

It takes a lot of inspiration from Journey with the storytelling, yet there's a lack of story progression after the prologue that makes you lose interest. I really wanted to see what was next through every step in Journey. I was suprised at how quickly I stopped caring about what was ahead of me in this game. It think it might have had something to do with the immediate use of the "collect so and so thingamagigs to proceed". Guess I just didn't feel like dealing with that trope when so much of this game is riding on it's story and atmosphere.\n\nCombat is serviceable, but uninspired. There's not a lot of variation and it quickly became a chore rather than a fun activity. There may be more to it later in, but I didn't feel like wading through what I had in order to get to it.\n\nOh well.

On my birthday, Oct 12 2013 I decided to back my very first Kickstarter. To this day, this is the only thing I have ever donated/backed to Kickstart. In this world of games available in "alpha" for purchase never to see a release date, I was extremely weary. I was so hopeful for this game and it definitely came through with flying colors.\n\nA few descriptive words : Ominous, atmospheric, clean, responsive, enthralling, wonderous, driven.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is truly a tribute to how far games have come.\n\nPros:\n-The game teaches you without actively directing or spelling it out to you.\n-It's actually challenging.\n-The pixel art was done with such amazing care. Absolutely breathtaking and had to have taken so much time.\n-The music and melodic tones fit and direct the atmosphere flawlessly.\n-The combat is responsive, engaging and requires skill to master.\n-The environments take you to fully unique places with twists and turns. It's fun to learn the levels!\n-Secrets are well hidden, fun to look for and always rewarding (lore and upgrades wee!)\n-The upgrades are done right. You actually feel like you've earned them and they make a huge difference in playstyle.\n-The 'cutscenes' are engaging.\n-The world and lore are very mysterious and new.\n-There is no dialogue. The dialogue is instead replaced very well with pictures or actions.\n\nCons:\n-I don't really have any.\n-I suppose the control scheme of the game doesn't quite work well with the Steam controller as far as I can tell. That's more of an issue with the Steam controller than anything. If it had a 2nd joystick on the right instead of the touchpad everything would be fine. Maybe someone will tinker with the Steam controller config enough to make it feel right, but I gave it a decent shot to no avail.\n\nNext time I see something on Kickstarter that I believe in, as I did Hyper Light Drifter, I'll be sure to support. If you think you might like it even a little, get this game. It will pull you in.\n\nA tip of the hat to Heart Machine for pulling through big time.","March 31","true","9.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Keep you in the dark to some degree. But then there are games that just flat out don't tell you much of anything at all. Hyperlight Drifter is that. It's a solid combat game lacking in depth due to making its surface story impenetrable. Having finished the game, the fights also are incredibly unbalanced. Bosses vary between laughly easy to fairly interesting, with one boss being solidly just a frustration train.\n\nThis game is what I'd call a Gamer's Game. To someone who's never played a video game before, the fact that progression based tokens are hidden behind scenery that you have to guess to go around, invisible platform that take guesses, and lots, and lots of things that involve mastering skills quickly, it plays to those that have played similar games well and does not lend itself well to first time players.\n\nThis game is rage inducingly frustrating. It doesn't help that the final fight provides all the satisification of a wet noodle to the face. I figured New Game+ Might help resolve that, but making the main character have 2 health pips instead of 5 turns something okay, doable, into "I got steam rolled to death instantly, about 15 times" because truckloads of enemies hit for 2 pips. 3 would have been doable, but 2 is just loading up the frustration train and packing it full of coal and water.  Might as well have made it one pip for all it mattered. As for finding the secrets, one discovers after trawling the scenery for secret doorways, that there's scenery doors that can lead you into getting stuck in no where lands. There's scenery doors with no indications. Plus, judging by the game's shoddy story telling, I doubt I'll get much satisifaction from secrets found.","April 5","false","16.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I followed it for months on kickstarter. Aesthetically, the game is wonderful. The art style is fantastic and the animations are very well done. The music, while different, is good. To me, some of the areas didn't really fit the music that was playing, but that's more personal preference than anything. What killed this game for me was the framerate. While I understand the technical limitations of the engine used to build the game, it was just unacceptable. I can deal with a cap of 30fps, as long as it's consistent, and in this game it is anything but. With the level of precision recquired by the fast-paced combat, a drop of 3-5 fps absolutely threw off my timing. I was met with frequent and intense stuttering.

It is beautiful, and has an amazing tone and sense of aesthetic, both aurally, thanks to Distasterpeace (of FEZ fame), and visually. However, the gameplay and level design is horrifically designed. The game clearly takes inspiration from Dark Souls, but the designers clearly did not understand the nuance behind the game design that makes Dark Souls difficult but fair. Boss arenas are cluttered, visually, making it incredibly easy to fall off the area, or to be be blindsided by attacks off-screen. Dodging doesn't grant invincibility frames, healing takes far too long, dodging feels unresponsive and every button input has noticeable lag behind it. Bosses themselves often have plenty of additional enemys, artifically increasing difficulty by forcing combat with multiple opponents.\nIn short, horrifically designed. Moreover, death and respawn animations are obnoxiously long, making death even more frustrating than in Dark Souls.","April 2","false","10.3"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","14","32","0","0"

The utter lack of exposition while neat from a design perspective makes it really hard to figure out if you're going the right way or doing the right thing. Then there's the lack of some kind of outline or something on certain elements of an area, meaning you think it's on your level so you can dash to it. But in reality it's high up in the air and you just fell to your death. I'll get to the last issue in a second but I first want to talk about how great everything else in the game is before I do. The enemies are fun and challenging the music is top notch. The level and area design with hidden little paths and secrets are wonderful. It's a really great game.\nThat is also almost unplayable due to it's FPS cap. The imput lag will cause you to scream your lungs out in anger and want to pull your hair out at every given opportunity. From dodging the bird bosses ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t following attack, that seems to follow where you're trying to hammer to get away to; but can't because of imput lag.

To the developers, kudos, seriously.\n\nThat being said, there are two things that a lover of games like these, just could not get over. It made the game not something I had any interest in continuing to play.\n\n1) Simple enough, the 30FPS lock actually detrimented my experience, the game felt sluggish and jumpy, even though the game is supposed to be extrememly fast paced. On top of that, it might say the game is running at 30, but honestly, the game might have been animated at 24. It feels janky, even for 30.\n\n2) I honestly, truly did not enjoy the combat, it felt like I couldn't get the timing down, not because the game is "Hard but fair" because this coming from someone who beat Titan Souls in under 2 hours my very first run through. The way the enemies attack you, the patterns, how the animations don't line up with the direction of the enemies attacks, such as, them starting the animation to attack you from one side, but then the shot flies out of their back. It makes it not "challenging" but more of a hassle to dodge in time with their strange attack patterns, and attack, espeically when they are in the middle of their "taking damage" animation, and still manage to spit a projectile in your face. It wasn't even frustrating, just... annoying... more than anything.\n\nIt's... ok. But there were just some things I couldn't get past. I was SO excited to play this game.

Sadly, I've got a headache. 30 FPS can work. Not everything needs it. This game, from my experience, is hurt, and definitely hurts, from not having a 60 FPS framerate. The camera has this odd choppy effect that I found strained my eyes to the point of a headache, and has made me nausious. I requested a refund, but would gladly rebuy if the devs take the time to patch in a higher framerate. From what I've read, this probably can't happen.

It looks beautiful, but plays sluggish and incredibly boring. I like that it tried to start out with a 'silent movie' vibe to it, but for the most part, it just doesn't work. The world is too empty to have any impact on a new player. Additionally, when things do get moving in combat, the controls are just BLEH! The dash and all of the enemy attacks give the impression that combat will be fast, fluid, and rewarding. However, the enemies all behave like that and the player just has these awkward pauses that inhibit fluidity in combat.\n\nAll in all, I'd say avoid this game or prepare to refund it through Steam; maybe buy it on sale.

If you have to slap a warning label on it, that just means it isn't designed for other systems. Which is exactly the case. The PC controls are unpleasant. The aiming cursor supplied for the mouse is barely visible, especially in certain environments, and you can't use mouse keys to aim in place of a joystick either. Also there's some kind of bug where the controls keep randomly switching from PC controls to XBox/PS4 controls, sometimes in the middle of combat. I must be playing hardmode.\n\nSome people have been saying the PC version is also locked to 30FPS. It seems that way to me too, because the controls feel very sluggish... Combine that with losing track of where my cursor is due to the fact that the thing is literally transparent, nevermind that I need a magnifying glass to see it in the first place, and basically PC players are playing this game handicapped.\n\nAlso on the note of the terrible controls, the controls aren't explained at all. If I'm not mistaken, this game has no text whatsoever beyond the intro screen and button designations on a few menus. This sounds fine until you actually get into the game and discover that you can't trigger the upgrades you just bought because they're so damn particular about their execution. In fact, even now knowing how to use them, I find them downright unreliable in combat. I think this can be partially attributed to the 30FPS problem.\n\nThe environments have a lot of holes in them, and I don't just mean the intentional ones. I've fallen through the map countless times while searching the trees for hidden areas. This even happens in areas where there are no cliffs. Given the limited (and unexplained) markings on your map as to what the heck you're supposed to be doing, this gets pretty frustrating when trying to merely find the next objective to progress the story.\n\nFurthermore the game's promo talk of, "alternate routes", is flat-out nonsense. This game is incredibly linear.

I've been looking forward to this game since I first saw it on kickstarter; it was the first kickstarter game I ever got excited for...\n\nand I'm getting a refund.\n\nThe core health system of this game is, for lack of a nicer term, inexcusable. Its a zelda style game with something even worse than a megaman health system. I would consider a megaman health system unideal, but workable, for an exploration based game, but this has created something even more abysmal. To explain: In this game, you have a healthbar, and energy tanks you can find randomly on the map, enemies drop no health, and the only way to refill your health is to backtrack to a warp pad, which exists at a rate of maybe one per area. A large, sprawling area in which you need to backtrack to a warp pad any time you get seriously wounded...because you do not recieve full health after death.\n\nUpon death, you are restored with one health, and a constant vibrating heartbeat to remind you you're near dead. There is no way to undo this without backtracking to the starting point to refill your health, or hope you happen across an energy tank, which are few and far between. This is an exploration based game that punishes the player for failure and encourages backtracking every single time you get wounded, because there is no reliable way to recover your health.\nMegaman gave you full energy upon death, Zelda gave you health drops from enemies, these games which definitely seem to inspire Hyper Light Drifter gave you these concessions because they realized the game slowed to a crawl and lost its sense of enjoyment without this enabling of the player to keep trying.\n\nHyper Light Drifter actively punishes and discourages its players from continuing to play it.\n\nThankfully, Alex Preston has stated that he's willing to rethink some of these mechanics if he recieves reasonable arguments indicating why he should change it. Consider this my argument. I would encourage other players to please also submit similar arguments of your own. Until this is changed, I will be refunding my purchase, and I am very willing to rebuy if Mr. Preston is a reasonable enough man to see why this is a core mechanic that needs reworking.","April 3","false","1.6"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","14","33","0","3"

And I cannot get back to the desktop from that crash. Happened twice in my 20 minute run. The game runs at 30 FPS which is really subpar for a quick reaction game like this. With fullscreen panning it seemed like the game was stuttering a lot, which made me feel nausea, might be because I have a 144Hz display and am used to it.\n\nThe art style is quite interesting and the minimalist music and sound effects were fine. The gameplay did not grip me at all. Dodge jumping over holes is glitchy, and I fell multiple times because it seemed like the character got stuck in an invisible edge. The movement and combat seemed a bit laggy or too elastic when compared to enemy speed, and the dodge has no i-frames to help you out. It seems like the game design doesn't know if it wants to be a Platinum game or a Souls game. Ending up a far cry from either one of those.\n\nIf you can get over the gameplay and a stuttering 30FPS with crashes is fine for you, you might want to try it out for the style. Otherwise skip it and play better games in the same genre.\n\nUpdate: Just to be clear, 30FPS itself might not be a problem, but the game judders/stutters especially when scrolling, which makes it a lot worse.

Sometimes they walk around a bit before attacking you, other times they lunge at you twice in quick succession. I can't reliably win fights because I have no clue what my enemy is going to do next.

I was hooked from the very get-go with the pixelated style, the team behind it, the music that played in the background of the teaser. Needless to say my expectations were high.\n\nRight from the off, the art style and music lived up to all expectations. I jumped right in an got acquainted with the controls and thought aiming with the mouse was unorthodox, but okay I'm sure I'll get used to it. Then came the enemies.\n\nIf you're making the Link comparison, based solely on the top-down camera, please stop. Using the mouse to aim AND guide your teleport is cumbersome to be generous. I lost count of how many times I trained my mouse on my next target, moved into position to get the perfect attack, and teleported directly into their projectile. Add to that the enemies ability to chain attacks without any delay, even if you're chewing on their ♥♥♥, and timing gets tossed out the window. Low on health? Well, I wouldn't recommend healing cause with the delayed animation you're bound to be hit from multiple angles. Taking your one health point to full then back down to half (or less) wasting the healing potions that are few and far between. Best to just die and try again (without being reminded of 'Edge of Tomorrow' where you die and respawn a million times before you get the fight just right).\n\nI'm coming off a 30+ death streak (spread over only a small area) and it's frustrating to say the least. I want to move forward in order to see all that the story can offer (and hear the score that accompanies it) but it's hidden behind a brick wall so thick and decked out with spikes that I just can't be bothered. I want to pull out my old controller in the hope that that might improve the gameplay (over that damn mouse aiming) but I'm at the point I just can't be bothered.\n\nI'm sorry to say this about a game I backed and drooled over since the beginning of the campaign, but after punishment this severe, bleeding from the eyes and ears doesn't do the visuals or music any favours.\n\nI'm hoping (and praying) for the controls to be tightened up and/or an easy mode, apparently for life-time gaming noobs like me, in the future.

Both technical and design.\n\nA glaring technical problem:  the frame rate is locked at 30 fps.   This is absolutely unacceptable in 20-freaking-16 on PC.   The screen follows your character as you walk around, constantly scrolling to keep you near the center.  Why does this have to scroll at 30 FPS?  The animations are fine to be 10 fps or whatever, because they are hand drawn and look cool.  But why does the screen have to clunk around at 30 fps?  After 10 seconds it's downright nauseating and it never gets better.  It's annoying every single minute.\n\nThe physics are really bad.  Enemies getting stuck out in empty areas beyond your reach, your character getting stuck on crystals randomly. "Trees" where sometimes you can walk through them and other ones you can't, with no visible difference between them.   There are these crystal spike traps that damage you when you walk on them.  About 20% of the time my character would get stuck in the middle of them while trying to "warp" past them and get damaged or killed instead.   I couldn't figure out if it was something I was doing, so I spent about 5 minutes and 20 lives trying to figure it out. Never could detect a pattern or cause. But I did find that if you walk halfway into them, and then warp, you don't get stuck as much, maybe only 5% of the time.\n\nThere is no consistency to the auto-save. Sometimes it saves each time you enter a screen.  Sometimes it doesn't.  One time I died and I had all the items I had before dying.  One time I died and it went back 20+ minutes and hadn't saved anything.\n\nThe game play is excrutiatingly boring for two reasons:\n\n1)  You start with a sword and quickly get a gun.  There is a grand total of 2 moves:  swing your sword and shoot your gun.   That means after you swing your sword a couple times, then you get to shoot the gun a couple of times.  Oh and then swing your sword some more.\n\n2)  99% of enemies drop nothing, and you gain absolutely nothing by killing. They serve no other purpose than to put a barrier between you and the things you want to do, like explore the game you just bought or fight a cool boss.   The same enemies are in the same place and respawn every time you die. That means you get to enjoy repeating the same fight against the same enemies in the same places over and over again!  Yay!\n\nIf this game was trying to be a 2D Dark Souls, it failed miserably.","April 2","false","0.7"," 17 of 40 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","17","40","2","5"

I'll tell you. Hyper Light Drifter has a damn good first impression, and you know what they say about those. It hits you with multiple jabs in its opening moments - the music, the cinematic, the first moments of venturing out in the world. Brutal beauty mixed with graceful terror. In your first big battle I almost guarantee you will die - you'll dance in and out of range (probably not in the direction you intended at first) until with a triumphant slash you corpsify the last of the dummies that tried to hug you to death.\n\nPlay this game.

I wanted it. I'm happy to have it.\n\nI love the way he looks. I love the colors, i love the level / character design, i love the way things are said with pictures, how you can do the levels in the order that you chose, i love the map, i love the hidden things, i love the money system... If i had to only watch the game, i'd be fully satisfied.\n\nBut the gameplay have some flaws, witch make some fights really hard, especially boss fights.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThree problems to me :\n\n1) No invulnerabily frames : if you're touched, especially by a boss, you're stun, or put down, but you still take damages, and the attacks keep going. So if you're touched one single time, you're probably dead.\n\n2) You're no invulnerable during a dash. You never are. Would make a great fight system, but the dash is just a way to move faster, not a dodging stuff like the rolls we have in Dark Souls. Too bad :(\n\n3) The healing time is reaaaaally too slow. Takes 2 seconds to trigger, and 2 others before your health bar is full and you can move (you will be touched during this time). This is way too long in these super speed boss fights.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nFew little bugs I forgive (also, the save system looks good to me, everybody hates it...).\nPlus these bugs can help you beat the game sometimes, but never blocks or bother you.\n\nI can't reccomend the game as is, because he makes me RAGE so much, i do not wish that rage to anyone. This is too hard. You can think i'm a noob. I think some deaths i had in the game were unfair.\n\nThis is too bad, because the game have so many things to offer...\nIf you love unfair challenge, and if you're not afraid to rage, try it.","April 5","false","28.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I backed this game on KS, so I've been waiting a while for it. I wanted to like the game, but I find myself frustrated rather than feeling any enjoyment.\n\nThe dev's claim they were "up front" about difficulty. They weren't. They talked about the original Zelda and Diablo games. What we got instead incorporated the worst parts of "bullet hell" games, Dark Souls, and MMO raid bosses, all three being things that would have told me it would be better to spend my money elsewhere. Rather than a feeling of wonder and exploration, of finding new things and new ways to fight enemies, I feel like I'm constantly punished for not doing EXACTLY what someone else had in mind for a situation.\n\nAnd I imagine I'm going to get a lot of eye rolls, talking about how I'm not playing the game "right." To those people: grow up. What is comfortably challenging to one person is easy to another and controller-snapping to another. That's what difficulty scaling is for. Things like frequency of drops, number of enemy spawns, damage dealing and soaking of major foes, all are easy enough to adjust.

On top of this I have had frequent game crashes and spent an hour trying to get the game to start then having to look at a steam community bug fix (Which was very useful) 4 hours after purchase to actually get the game running. When I actually got the game running it would slow down randomly (which was not due to hardware as my CPU and GPU were only at 50% load) and this caused the game to be impossible to play. The enemies have no pattern and seem to have completly random spacings between attacks as well as some enemies being invulnerable when attacking, making attacking completely luck based. As for dodging, the dash is useful but the amounts of enemies cause it to have no real effect as you cannot dash frequently even though you need to. The part that annoyed me the most was getting hit as if you are hit by a charging enemy you are knocked down and have to stand back up before moving and that makes sense. However, you can still be attacked when you stand up even though it will not actually let you move or dash.\n\nThis overall creates a frustrating game that I enjoy exploring, but hate combat wise.\nWorld design - 9.5/10 (Extremly fun to explore and look for secrets)\nStory - 8/10 (Though not for everyone)\nCombat ideas - 9/10 (Very interesting and seem cool)\nCombat implementation - 3/10 (For previously stated reasons)","April 2","false","1.4"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

The music is lovely as well, although the synth score by Disasterpiece is too-frequently undermined by a piano piece which makes the film-school tier symbolism at work in the scenes it plays over all the more cringe-inducing. Superficially it has similarities to Another World, both in terms of the pixellated look of the graphics and the minimalism and starkness of the world it takes place in. The primary difference being that Another World was the work of one man, and managed to much more elegantly and affectingly tell the story of the friendship between two characters and how they overcome the odds against them. It also did 'textless' story-telling much better. On the other hand, this game opts for metatextual ♥♥♥♥♥♥y and 'find your own meaning in your struggle' dreck that I would expect of hipsters. And the pixellated graphics in Another World were limitations of the time, rather than the convenient excuse for not doing more complicated things that they're beginning to feel like in modern games.\n\nI understand this is a kickstarter game developed by a small team, but for the asking price and given the simplistic nature of the design, I was expecting a much more substantial and challenging adventure. A few of the bosses held my attention for more than a few minutes, but despite aspirations to From Software games the best strategy to beating the vast majority of them seems to simply be to attack them fast and hard before they can lay down too much damage. By and large, the gameplay was far too repetitive and the 'shop' mechanic would probably have been better if replaced by item pickups that actually altered the core mechanics in any way, as they should in a vaguely Metroidvania game such as this.\n\nAll these problems aside, I could still give the game some sort of qualified recommendation. So let's talk about the really glaring flaw; the multi-platform nature of this release. If you're a PC gamer, you'll quickly pick up those 'multi-platform' cues we all know and loathe. The checkpoint save system is an issue which, now that I've completed the game, I think is keeping me from seeing a few optional parts of it. I don't intend to go through the whole game again just for that. Uncustomizable controls are also a multi-platform standard.\n\nAnd of course, the most compelling reason you shouldn't spend your money on this; the 30fps lock. It's basically inconceivable to lock any game, especially a PC release, at anything less than 60fps, especially one this primitive which can run on any potato you throw at it. Of course, console users are used to it, and I've got a kind of wide open Christian sympathy for that. But it's unacceptable on the PC. For a game 'in the vein of the best 16 bit classics' it certainly is amusing that the developers don't seem to understand that those virtually all ran in a stable 60fps. I'm guessing most of them are actually players of fairly more recent consoles. I'm also not sure what they can be referring to apart from the Mana games or their (in my opinion superior) cousin Secret of Evermore, or possibly the Fushigi no Dungeon games, none of which were really much like HLD.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is basically another 'retro' indie title that defends its shoddiness with 'stylistic choice' deflections. Certain elements of it would make it just excusable enough to recommend at a discount, if it weren't for the fatal flaws that make it almost unbearable on the PC.

Pretentious story "delivery" prevents any sort of coherent story or conclusion. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ input delay because of the 30 fps (that only incompetent developers still do on PC) holds back what is otherwise pretty good combat. Well, except for getting hit by things that look like they're not even touching you, or having the game's violent screen shaking and effects obscure the map so you can't really see. Soundtrack leaves a lot to be desired too, and to top it all off, instead of actual new content for new game+, you are locked at 2 health max, so many mobs will literally 1 shot you at the slightest error, or just the game ♥♥♥♥ing up and not directing the character as you told it because of the glorious 30 fps. This is fine if you're moderately skilled until you fight some bosses, most notably the north boss, who's every attack 1 shots you. This means you have maybe half a second to dash in the correct direction every time there are the exploding tiles near you. If you mess up just ever so slightly or get caught barely on what the game thinks is the edge of the exploding tiles(which is more likely of the two), you die. That and the screen violently shaking literally every time a tile explodes(basically the entire fight) causes an unfun, unfair, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fight. It's objectively ♥♥♥♥.","April 2","false","8.4"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

I've spent so much time in this game not getting anywhere, searching historied corridors that, for all their polish and craftsmanship, end up all looking and feeling the same.\n\nPaths don't look like paths-- I'm not even talking about secret areas, but just "the way to go" is so badly communicated.  There's nothing that clearly delineates "You can walk here" versus "this is an impassable barrier, or "this is a switch" versus "this is a weird lantern we put here for effect."  The camera often makes you think there are walls where there aren't, making things that should be obvious escape your\n\nI suppose the worst thing is that the map is so extremely confusing as to be nigh on useless.  Your player icon does not reflect your actual position in the world. It's placed in the center of the "room" you're in, even on the overworl.  This would be fine, but the map is drawn as if it were an actual place, and there's nothing that tells you where one "room" ends and another begins.  Even when you understand this system, it will be no help in figuring out how to get from one place to another.  Most areas will have an "underworld" section, composed of tunnels and rooms beneath the main area.  There are many doors between the two, but they are not well reflected on the map.  So often, I've checked my map a few times, sure I'd finally found the way to get to some vital tunnel that had the diamond shape I had to collect, activate, or deactivate, only to find my player icon had jumped in the exact opposite direction I wanted to go-- I apparently wasn't anywhere near where I thought I was on the map.\n\nFrom interviews with the developers, it's apparently modeled on games like Legend of Zelda, but I'd suggest they take another look.  Zelda managed to communicate so much more than this game does-- doors look like doors, switches look like switches, and while they often took the freedom to mix things up and do artistic things,  they didn't let it overwhelm their game's visual language.  This game doesn't really have a language, other than the vague red and green highlights, which may or may not indicate something you can interact with.\n\nThe combat is fun from what I've seen of it, and the world and feel of the game are awe-inspiring, but the horrible navigation just spoils it for me.  I've spent enough time retracing and retracing my steps in games since long ago.  Not something I need anymore.\n\nI'm going to have to call it quits, and not recommend this game.  Here's hoping their sophomore effort is better.\n\nEdit:\nAfter looking up video walkthroughs to get me to the *vital game-progression items*, I was missing, it only affirms my negative review.   It's a bunch of pixel-hunting shenanigans, trying every single wall to see if just maybe, this is the one that takes you to what you're looking for on the other side of the map.  This is the kind of stuff I thought game creators learned was bad in the 90s.\n\nI don't dislike clever puzzles, I don't dislike a challenge, I would have actually preferred if it didn't have so many save points, but the one thing I can't forgive a video game for is wasting my time.","May 27","false","14.8"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","2"

This game was so preoccupied with being art, that it forgot to be an actual game.\n\nI've died countless times because an enemy didn't telegraph properly. A slight change to an enemy's sprite, or an audio cue, isn't going to cut it when there are ten or more of them on screen. Enemies and their attacks are far too often indistinguishable from the level itself, due to blatant overuse of colors like pink and turqoise.\n\nThe lush backgrounds and gorgeous scenery are great when exploring by yourself. When in combat, the scenery and set pieces often get in the way, leading to frustrating deaths because of a horribly placed box, or an enemy hiding behind a tree. The scenery shifts colors so drastically, and so often, it feels jarring and uncomfortable. The levels are so cluttered, I've found myself constantly falling to my death, because a set piece wasn't distinguishable from a platform.\n\nThe game also fails at giving any sense of direction, Wanting an "old school, Zelda feel" isn't an excuse for lack of narrative and direction. Expect to get lost a lot, thanks to constant backtracking and a terrible map.\n\nTL;DR: I really tried to like it, but Hyper Light Drifter is art first, game second. The visuals always come before gameplay, and it made itself very clear through every moment of my experience. Can't recommend this to anybody.","May 19","false","5.0"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

It harkens back to some old well animated games on Apple II.  This game is fundamentally crippled in two ways.  It's first step on the learning curve is too high for the average gamers.  I'm sure its fine for your basic 12 year old, but for the rest of us older gamers who got tired of 'no docs, no info' as a 'plot device' in 1985 feel that you could have spent more money in your dev cycle on QA, and player instructions.   While playing I can't help but wonder if I stumbled into some high level area of the game and can't get back.   I would LOVE to play this game more, but it just infuriates me.  This is unacceptable for something I paid money for.  Games at their most basic level are supposed to be fun.   This game fails to have a reasonable learning curve.  I read that this game was 'adjusted' to have an easier play, and than hardcore nutjob asshats complained, and it was 'adjusted' back.    I'll tell you what, how about a little dial, or a slider.  It would be in the settings and it would read 'Fun--------------I'm a masochist.'  And you could set it where-ever you wanted.  Those who like to Lord it over others that they completed some nearly impossible amazing game could be happy with their settings, and those who want a fun playthrough could also be happy.    It also seems like one of those games that had one QA guy, they didn't have any housewives on the QA team, and they didn't have any regular old Joes either.   I definitely enjoyed watching the intro movie.  It was spectacular.  The initial ramp up, and 'game training' seemed fine, and then the first encounter I had turned into me dying for 20-30 minutes.  I know I'm not the best gamer in the world, but... yeah, no sale with me.  I'll give it one more chance maybe next week after I feel less angry about wasted money and time.  We'll see how it plays then.","May 9","false","1.0"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","3","15","0","2"

It looks great, and you'll want to explore it thoroughly. You can't. It doesn't want you to.\n\nWhat it really wants is for you to have better reflexes than you do. Then you need rythym to master timing based moves, without clear tutorials. While you are trying, it wants you to die.\n\nWho are we kidding? All it wants is for you to die. This is a masocore game, pretending to be an action RPG.\n\nWho am I to judge? Well, I backed this thing, once up on a time. I invested in the artistic vision. I had no idea the designers would be so immature or short sighted, however. Here's some specifics, in case they are reading:\n\n1. Controls are fiddly, and there simply isn't performance to match their fantasy of precise gameplay. I'm on a monster system, before you ask.\n\n2. Save system is a betrayal of basic design principles. If you're going to auto-save, you have to offer resource refills conveniently. The current design requires frequent backtracking to trigger auto-saves, and grinding to replenish your health packs. Note that they had patched this in the weekend I started playing: teleport hubs restored health. Then they patched it back out again, because screw the players.\n\n3. Complete failure to acknowledge that many of us aren't twitchy little buggers any more. I've paid my dues, and at this point all I freakin' want is the ability to lower the difficulty after I've been crushed by a boss for an hour.\n\n4. Unrealistic expectations. In-game challenges for the completionist who wants all items are nuts. Like, hit a button with better than a tenth of a second accuracy for ten minutes straight, while doing challenging steering on a control stick. We're talking 800 reps, here. Nuts.\n\n5. Healing, which only us losers need to do, is too slow to actually use in most contexts. It's more or less a three hit kill system most of the time. You can't really fix this unless you have hummingbird reflexes to heal in between bullets.\n\nI'm tired. I won't even keep going on. I'm deleting and moving on with my life.

It's absolutely gorgeous, the sound and music are incredible, the gameplay is solid, but it is very difficult. Twitchy difficult. Like you have to combine luck and perfect execution for bosses difficult. This would be fine if death were well designed. You have a slow death animation, and a slow revive animation, and it uses a checkpoint system; so if you were screwed before getting into a boss fight, you're still screwed.
