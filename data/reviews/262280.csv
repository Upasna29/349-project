"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deathcricket/recommended/262280/","Deathcricket","Deathcricket","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deathcricket/","168 products in account","Edited for after I was able to find the last 2 levels....\n\nTLDR: Get Dwelvers it's $14.99, and in beta has more content than this "completed" $40 game.\n\nI'll start this review with what I did like.\n\n1. It's a faithfull Dungeon Keeper clone. It's fun being a bad guy and fighting the forces of good.\n2. I loved the artwork, graphics, way the characters look, etc.\n3. The story is fun and well written.\n4. It is a fun game overall, at a price point of say $15, I would give it a thumbs up.\n\nNow for what I didn't like.\n\n1. Too much handholding. For example "you are going to be attacked in 3:45 and counting, get ready here they come" on every single level for every enemy. "Here is a big exclamation of where you need to go and what you need to do" and the narator relentlessly pesters you to go there at a rapid pace, or "build these unit because you need them". I would prefer to be surprised when I explore and not have the game lead me through every minor step.\n\n2. Way too easy, with no way to increase the difficulty. Build a trap chest at the end of a 4x6 room, preceeded by a swinging mace, and 2 tar pits.. and you can defeat about 90% of the enemies that enter your dungeon.  There are a couple levels where more enemies come in, oh but they warn you well ahead of time so you just prepare for that. They do have an interesting mechanic where the enemies will send the bard in first to disable your traps, but if you put the trapped chest behind your traps the greedy good guys will bypass this and not wait for the bard because they want to get the treasure first, and they all die, every time. I would much prefer a color system, like a green bard can disable x and y traps, a blue bard can disable y and z traps, and no trapped chest that bypass the bards entirely. That way you would have to actually have an assortment of traps to handle different party configs. But no, the level 1 traps kill everything and there is no reason to even upgrade to the level 2 or 3 traps unless for fun and to just see how they work.\n\nSurface creeps are equally easy, you pretty much just steamroll everything. I think the original concept was you should only bring half your crew and leave the other half in the dungeon to continue working? But you quickly find out that in every encounter, the 1 or 2 of your army that die are resurrected (with zero penalty) inside your dungeon and start working anyway. So anyone playing quickly finds out that you just take your entire army out and the few that do die can get the dungeon in working order for your return. The one exception to this rule and was an interesting surprise, in that your level 2 healers actually STOP healing when they hit level 3 and turn into pure DPS chars. So I did get decimated once and I was unable to ressurect everyone before they decayed and had to rebuild my army from scratch. But I quickly learned my lesson to just leave my healers at level 2 and never upgraded them the rest of the game.\n\n3. Almost zero control over your troops. Example.. So you can make these cool assasins, they can turn invisible and with 2 or 3, pretty much kill a high value target. They get a a high DPS sneak attack when coming out of stealth. So let's say a group of enemies comes into your dungeon and you want to assassinate the bard. Is there any way to do this? Nope sorry! You either sound an alarm bell and watch your troops come in 1 at a time, or you manually pick them up drop them near the enemies and hope for the best. Zero control, they just kinda duke it out and occaisionally use the skills they have. Now the game is simply easy (to the point of trivial) so this is really a small complaint, but if there were any challenge associated with battles, and you wanted to actually kill specific high value targets in any kind of order. Like let's say kill the healers first... You can't. Now on the surface you get a little more control over your troops you can manually click the unit and position it, and use it's special ability. But when you have 12 units in a fight, clicking on each one giving it a command as it's running around is kinda pointless with such short battles. The only micro control you actually do is move the tanks to the front, healrs and dps in the back, and wade into the enemy and it's over very quickly. Ideally you would not have to click on each single unit. I would rather select my entire army, hit tab to select the blood orcs, have them summon wolves, hit tab to select my asassins, have them turn invisible to get a bonus attack from stealth, etc. But combat was seriously overlooked and as a result they just opted for short combats with 6 "good guys" against your 12 "evil" horde. It's simply a steamroll because there is no combat functionality built into the game.\n\n4. Game sounds and narrator. At first when you start out it's very enjoyable. The narrator is a ♥♥♥♥ and yelling at you to do stuff. It's wonderful! But after the 19th time the narrator tells you to "Go make 3 orcs and go to this spot on the map I'm sick of waiting for you" it gets old. This also ties into the handholding. The narrator is better muted so you can explore the game and have fun. instead of constantly yelling at you and telling you exactly where to go and what to build next. The Demon mana generators also make the most annoying noise I have ever heard in any video game in a long long time. Mute, mute mute.. Ahh much better... The game noises are gone and play some Pandora, much much better.\n\n5. Not enough content. If I didn't play through it 2x looking for the last 2 levels (small bug just click on the skeleton icon and it takes you there). I would estimate the game can be completed in 15 hours. For $40, I expect to get between 30-60 hours of gameplay from it for it to be a good value. Compared to their competition, a game named Dwelvers, which runs $15 and I have 30 hours into it on beta, this is not a good value IMO.\n\n6. Spell system. With the exception of "recall to base" troops and the "go here" spell. The remaining 25 spells are useless and the entire system is not even worth bothering with. For example you shoot a fireball and it does virtually no damage. Shoot a metoer storm? Oh yeah area effect virtually no damage also. Again this is a minor complaint since a level 1 exploding chest does 90% damage to most units. But why even put it in there? The only use I could find for the spells is like a would see a fairie with 2 health left limping into my dungeon, and I wanted to shut the narrator up screaming "enemies in your dungeon!" and I could not be bothered to pick up an orc to kill them? Yeah I'll shoot a fireball to do 3 damage and kill that limping fairy who somehow magically managed to survive the 4 level 1 traps who usually dispatch most most enemies. But most of the time you just ignore the fairy, she will run into something and get one shotted soon enough. But yeah, it was nice to just to shut the narrator up and have him stop screaming at you I guess. But magic on the whole is innefective and useless.\n\nClosing thoughts....\n\nIf there was maybe a way to make it more difficult so you don't just blow through it so fast and more of a challenge. It would have a lot going for it, particuarlly the enjoyable art and great dungeon building tools they have in place. I would also like to see an enemy evil guy to compete with, who breaks into your dungeon from a random place, but instead the enemies always come through the main door, 6 every time with zero challenge, run into your traps and die. Also when digging inot a new room full of spiders, have them get mad and charge in to to kill my guys, not just stand sit there until I can get around to farming them for expos. They had some great ideas, just a sad implementation and were probably on a limited schedule for release. It shows.","April 28, 2015","false","25.8"," 352 of 423 people (83%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","83","352","423","15","13"

Not better, though.\n\n\nThe evil (meaning fun)+ Awesome compaign, was really surpised by that. Yes it is pretty easy. But worthwile by general design and feel - AND, most importantly, due to that awesome written and spoken narrator! Huge amount of jokes and references to games, movies and books.\n+ Graphics are not breath taking but still quite atmospheric. As it is somewhat comic-lookie-lookie, I guess it won't feel "old" too fast, which is good in my opinion.\n+ Overworld concept for SP\n+ When "liberating" overworld areas, cool change effects to dark side (sadly no cookies)\n+ Most creatures are useful on their own way, so it can make sense to not all upgrade them to highest variant (although you don't have to care on normal difficulty)\n+ Different races\n+ Gold variants make sense (normal, long lasting, infinite)\n\n\nThe good (meaning not fun)- Music. Pretty boring. Pretty fast boring. I recommend getting the soundtrack from Dungeon Keeper 1+2 (youtube helps) and play that in the background. Ten times better than ingame one.\n- Glitches. There are no game braking bugs at least. But there's a ton of smaller stuff getting on your nerves: hardly being able to click a specific monster during a fight. No real feeling for where you drop one. The bright border effect for where you gonna drop/cast at is sometimes really weird. Can't pick up a specific unconsious monster, as the clickable area is not where it lies. Sometimes clicks on spell icons just do nothing, have to click twice.\n- Performance. Seriously, this games runs slower than Anno 2070 on a huge map as soon as you have 10+ creatures. And weirdly this is CPU limiting here (100% usage on 4x 2,5 GHz), while my GPU (AMD 7950) was bored. Also when dropping couple of creatures in a row and when digging a new area, there's this "stutter" after every action/digged block. Really smells like badly optimized engine.\n- Cannot beat chickens to pulpy messes :/\n\n\nWhen comparing to Dungeon Keeper:- Less stuff to build and do than in DK (i.e. missing prison and torture chamber)\n- More casualized feel, e.g. traps damage (remember that huge boulder which just killed everything?), simplified "who works which room" and missing skeleton/ghost/vampire/... mechanics\n- No VS mode against AI Keeper. Skirmish maps just drop stronger waves of heroes against you.\n- Slower! I do like slower games in general, but sometimes in SP it can get really boring. Mostly due to slow workers (get's better after upgrading them, though)\n- Some atmospheric stuff regarding the creatures is missing: monsters attacking each other (spiders vs. flies) or the wizards getting annoyed of all the commotion in the library\n- No real "feedback" of higher level monsters. They can cast anything right from the start (after researched), so it feels like you do not have to take such care of them. Which is only partly true, as they DO get stronger. Still feels not as good here as when dropping a couple of level 10 wizards+dragons in DK1 onto the enemy :D (also any creature can be revived anyway)\n\n\nFinallyOverall this is a good game. If you like the old Dungeon Keeper 1+2 go ahead and give it a try.\nI had quite fun playing and guess will start again in the future. And of all DK like games, this is in my opinion the best successor so far.\n\nIn direct comparison however, I'd say I still prefer DK1+2 slightly over Dungeons 2.\n(Sadly DK2 is not working on mine and many other rigs I know due to graphic driver issues :/ )","December 8, 2015","true","34.6"," 172 of 213 people (81%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","81","172","213","12","10"

Exploration is quite engaging but combat is all zerg, all the time. This was in line with my expectations, hence listing as neutral.\n\n\nCons:\nThe Narrator is only about half as funny as the developers think he is, and would benefit greatly from an option to turn off his obnoxious nag messages whenever you don't rush headlong to complete every objective. In particular, struggling to complete an objective because it introduced a new mechanic without explaining it properly, while the game literally calls you a lazy dunce every 2 minutes, is not compelling gameplay (I'm looking at you, fighting pits).\nEmbedded advertising is not acceptable in a full-price game and should be removed.\nMouse control is sometimes clumsy. It's not clear where the actual pointer is on the big floaty hand, unlike DK2 where it was always the tip of the index finger. Also the cursor tends to pass behind UI overlay notifications, making them difficult to click\nThere appears to only be three skirmish maps\nOverall, the dungeon gameplay *is* Dungeon Keeper 3, and this is enough to overlook the game's shortcomings and keep you coming back after you turn it off because the narrator annoyed you a bit too much for one day.","April 26, 2015","true","12.9"," 99 of 120 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","99","120","2","4"

Very dissapointed.  I am not saying its bad, and I would like to give a true "rating" instead of a "Positive" vs "Negative" review.\n\nGame mechanics aren't bad.  Could be optimized more.  Larger dungeons lag hard, add that to the fact that both underworld and overworld are on the same screen... can get a bit jumpy.  Its design is still fairly well done.\n\nI think for me, the problem comes from its anti-immersion approach.\n\nThis game goes out of its way not to take itself serious.  Which can be good, especially if its great dark humor... .\n\nHow can it be "Good to be bad" evil Dungeon Lord when the whimsical narrative insults you every 5 minutes (not kidding), and when you finally get a few intense moments of bloody combat where the narrator isn't insulting you, the narrator chimes in reminding you that you are 'just playing' a game.\n\nIt is incredibly hard in this game to feel like a great dungeon lord (picture Vader in pink, where everyone insults him to his face).  Narrator actually tells you, your minions are mocking you, and what do you, the fearsome "ultimate evil"... nothing.\n\nFollowing on this "LIGHT" hearted approach to dark-hearted (HA) genre is the bright cartoony graphics, and the lack of any evil / dark / scary graphics or items.\n\nThis game is so close to being just right in mechanics, and then it goes the other direction in the way it presents it.\n\nNow, if you replace the jabbing "BARD" narrator with intense sinister Hamlin? Replace the Disney Robin Hood graphics with the original (Dugeon Lord 1) darker graphics (maybe add a few heads on spikes and some bones... something, anything sinister), now we are recapturing the genre.","April 24, 2015","false","4.5"," 318 of 448 people (71%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","71","318","448","18","5"

Like in dungeon keeper you rely on mining gold in order to drive the expansion of your dungeon, but where dungeonkeepers imps are efficient little speedfreaks the worker units in Dungeons 2 move more like arthritic old men and very large ammounts of time are spent waiting for them to collect and move gold to your vault so it can be spent. This is further aggravated by a very restrictive population cap that prevents you from keeping more than a handful of workers around without comprimising your army size. It is possible to upgrade your workers to move at a more acceptable pace, but by the time these upgrades become available you have progressed so far that they no longer usefull.\nThe game does not, in fact, have very much content to it, but it is artificially padded by this resource throttling. The campaign is fairly short and skirmish play pretty lackluster. Most of the skirmish maps are taken directly from the campaign and simply stripped off their narative and objectives.\n\nI had some fun with this game, but only after i started cheating to give myself gold and speed up progression to something a little faster than continental drift. I cannot recommend getting this game unless these pacing issues are adressed, which seems unlikely.","December 30, 2015","false","18.4"," 91 of 117 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","91","117","10","0"

In Dungeons 2 you take control of one of two factions on a mission to spread evil and pretty much annihilate anything that could even be vaguely associated with the word good. You are the mighty Dungeon Lord (the name of the Dungeon Lord depends on the faction you play as) and you must build your dungeon up while defending against attackers from the Overworld, but they are not the only ones who can go on the offensive! Using the entrances/exits within your dungeon you can take the fight to the Overworld and spread your evil ways to all corners of the globe mwahahahahaha *ahem* as I was saying, along the way not only will you fight little minions, you will also fight the heroes of the Earth including demigods who will require all of your strength to defeat!\n\nDungeons 2 has a Campaign mode, Single Player Skirmish mode and a Multiplayer Skirmish mode, I think they pretty much explain themselves.\n\nOne thing I'd like to point out is that I've never played a Dungeon Keeper style game before so I'm looking at this game as an outsider.\n\n+Fantastic graphics accompanied by great visual effects\n+Outstanding writing which is well narrated for the most part\n+The Underworld portion of the game provides excellent dungeon building gameplay\n+The game's humour is absolutely outstanding and had me laugh out loud countless times thanks to all of it's pop culture references including: Celebrity references, LotR references, Spacebase DF9 references, Game of Thrones references (this makes me very happy) and many, many more\n+Some rather amusing idle animations, especially for the hand of terror (basically a giant cursor which you use to interact with things in your dungeon), leave it alone for a while and it'll start rocking out\n+Super simple controls and a simple building system\n+A few cool traps which you can research and then use to defend your dungeon\n+All of your workers/units and rooms can be upgraded, upgrades depend on the room or unit in question but generally just make them better at what they do\n+Some nice resource management elements, letting your gold or beer supplies get too low will cause your workers to go on strike\n+As previously mentioned the game has two factions, personally I prefer the default Horde faction\n+The campaign mode is a lot of fun and effectively acts as a tutorial for the Skirmish mode\n+If a unit doesn't have anything set by you to do then it will find something to do by itself thus preventing an overwhelming amount of micro-management\n\n+/-The campaign mode introduces new concepts rather slowly\n+/-Some major review outlets have complained about performance issues but I've had no issues at all running on max settings\n\n-If you take too long to complete an objective the narrator will repeat whatever the last thing he said was which gets very frustrating\n-The Overworld RTS gameplay is a bit too simplistic for my liking and if I'm honest rather boring, it's basically just left click to select a unit and right click to make it attack or move with precious little else\n-A few of the regular animations, such as when your little snots fill in an area, aren't well done and don't look at all like they should\n\nVerdict:\n8.5\n\nAn excellent dungeon building game with fantastic graphics, outstanding writing to accompany the game's great humour and two factions to play as. If you can look past the Overworld portions of the game then I strongly recommend you buy this game, I for one have thoroughly enjoyed playing it.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Publisher for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","April 24, 2015","true","13.7"," 181 of 259 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","181","259","11","12"

Lacking Dungeon Keeper's infinite gem sources near your throne room means that the longer the game goes on, the more spread out your gold is going to get. With frequent paydays, this means that your slower creatures will quite literally walk from their work spot to the far end of the dungeon, get their gold, walk back, then by the time they get back they are hungry/craving worship, a bit bored, by the time their needs are filled it's already payday again, causing them to never actually do any work unless you manually transport gold to a central location.\nThe campaign isn't very long. The demon campaign feels rather hastily tacked on with only two missions, but then again...\nThe demon faction as a whole feels poorly streamlined. Especially the evolution part where you toss a minion into a sacrificial pit and then toss your demon on works very wonky. While the concept is cool, demons tend to get bored/hungry/payday-y while they are evolving and simply wander off. While horde creatures will return to their training after taking care of their needs, demons will refuse to go back, forcing you to toss them in again and start the entire process all-over. This is especially brutal for the third tier creatures, where it can take up to 2 minutes (with improved evolve speed) for them to evolve. I eventually just gave up because they would consistently wander off.\nCertain options in the game feel vastly inferior to others. For example, you can turn gold into mana as a demon. Why you would do this is anybody's guess, as it is incredibly easy to get mana, as opposed to gold. Then there's the guard room, which feels like it was added just because Dungeon Keeper had it, yet where in Dungeon Keeper you had to worry about multiple points of entry and you couldn't be everywhere at once, you see enemies coming from miles away in this game thanks to the overworld map, making it a rare day indeed where you can't simply scoop up a handful of creatures and toss them at the entrance to block their entry.\nOverworld combat feels incredibly clunky. You can only use a few skills like Entrench and Stealth when you have an entire group of creatures selected, but you can't actually 'subselect' inside this group. So you have to deselect the entire thing, then select only the minions with the skill you want to use, then use it. Which is all a lot of effort when basically the best way to deal with overworld combat is to just zerg in with a huge group and not bother with skills at all.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game, but it could use some polish.","April 29, 2015","true","29.9"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","0"

Monster type is very, very limited. And aside from some upgrades you can get for your monsters, it seems to be a pretty simple case of rock-paper-scissors.\n\n2) Limited monsters. For instance, the "horde" get orcs, goblins, trolls, and naga. In the previous game, there were quite a few more options.\n\n3) The game is based purely around defeating the enemy. There doesn't seem to be any focus on making a dungeon worty of heroes, complete with traps and treasure (and a torture room).\n\nAll in all, a pretty fun game, but could be better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalmabeast/recommended/262280/","kalmabeast","Lady Kalma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalmabeast/","2447 products in account","First and foremost, this is like DUNGEON KEEPER and NOT like Dungeons 1!\n\nThat is the one question I most wanted answering before I bought this game. I actually paid no attention to it for months because I assumed it was like the first game, which stole the look of DK and a little of its gameplay, but was basically about setting up a theme park experience for heroes with a fatal end. It... kinda sucked. This game is NOT like that, it is very close to DK. You are picking up and dropping minions, building a lair, and actively responding to kill invaders in a proper dungeon-building sim. Yay!\n\nOne imporant new mechanic though is that every map has both the underground level, and also an overworld level. Heroes come down from the overworld into your dungeon, as you'd expect, but you can pick up your minions and drop them into the portal to send them to the overworld, at which point you get direct RTS-style control over them. It's not any more complicated than any Warcraft 3 clone, but it works well enough, letting you have both your complex dungeonbuilding gameplay AND a more directed linear story as you send your minions topside and run them rampant through the countryside attacking towns and such. Two playable races too, the game focuses on the Horde which is orcs, goblins and trolls etc, but there are also demons you sometimes play as in the campaign (or anytime in Skirmish) who are visually distinct but play sort of like a remix. For example, Horde need to build a brewery to keep minions happy, and a hospital to heal hurt minions. For demons, these are combined into one room, but that room is WAY inefficient so you have to build it *big*.\n\nThe visual design isn't amazing but it does its job. There's something a bit generic about it, it lacks any identity or style, like the monsters could have been dragged and dropped in from any of a thousand other fantasy games about orcs and demons. The narrator is a dry english gent but sounds closer to the Stanley Parable narrator than an evil dungeon guy, which is strangely offputting when the rest of the game wears its influence on its sleeve. The game often tries to emulate DK's british humour and is very hit-or-miss where it succeeds, and of course like any "silly" game nowadays, it has tons of internet references and throwaway meme puns, but they didn't get grating for me. I did enjoy many jabs at other games in the sim genre (DF-9 and Game of Dwarves particularly get speared), though it's never mean.\n\nOne thing I appreciated is that it's pretty polished. I've not hit any bugs yet. Compared to War for the Overworld, which had a placeholder instead of an intro video at launch, that definitely puts it ahead of the pack.\n\nOne big mark in the negative column: waiting. This game likes you to wait around. If ever a game could have used a "speed up time" button, this is it. If you want a game where you're constantly active, move along, there'll be times you're just waiting for your minions to dig out more gold from an infinite-gold block so you can afford what you want, or for your workshop to finish a couple of monster upgrades so you can go attack, and you'll just be twiddling your thumbs. Didn't affect me too much because I tend to put on cheesy horror movies on my second monitor while I play anyway, just be aware there's a lot of downtime in this game and it often feels needless.\n\nOverall, it's a surprise success. If it had more personality, a possession spell, and that unique sense of humour, this could have been -the- spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper. As it is, it's a worthy diversion and in my opinion, the best of its genre since Evil Genius.","November 7, 2015","true","16.0"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","0"

The other mode is an overworld mode which is RTS lite.\n\nAnd the problem is that it does none of them well.  The overworld mode is a point and click affair with little of the RTS intricies one would expect from a modern day RTS.  The fights are against placed enemy units and bases consist of like 3 buildings.  Don't expect to have to do much microing.\n\nThe Dungeon mode has you sending out your minons to carve earth and collect gold to fuel the rest of your base.  You get to zone areas for specialized rooms, like a brewery to make beer that will keep the rest of your army happy.  Or a tinker workshop who create toolkits to use for traps and all your research.\n\nAnd traps.. the game gives the impression you get to build this intricate dungeon full of traps.. and you really don't.  The first trap you get to research, the exploding chest, is about the only thing you need about and 4 of them in a line will finish any parites that go into your party. Unless there is a halfling thief who will just disable all your traps and be immune to them.  The best way is just to throw your military units at the adventurers.\n\nAnd the game is slow, collecting gold is an almost painful endevour, you have to set treasure rooms all over the place or it takes even longer for your goblins to haul it.  It almost seems on purpose because the amount of content is serverly lacking: only 11 missions in total.\n\nOne decently good thing about the game is the narrator, it's the same individual from Stanley's Parable and while there are a number of lines that miss, there are a number that can produce a chuckle.  And while the storyline is about as generic as can be and handled with kid gloves, it is somewhat refreshing to be the 'bad guy' in a game stomping the good guys down.\n\nBut at the current price of the game, I can't recommend it, maybe if you could pick it up on sale for like 10 bucks it might be worth it.","April 26, 2015","false","17.7"," 92 of 137 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","92","137","0","3"

Rather short. The campign is about 10 levels long if I remember correctly. Each level takes a while because of Point 1. However it still feels rather short. A second playeable faction is introduced into the game. But they only get like 2 campaign levels.  which...is just sad :( because they are awsome.\n\n4. No end game. Once you complete the campaign. And beat the 3 (yes...only 3)  skirmish maps. The game is really just DONE. There is no reason to go back once you`ve done every level and every achievement. (if yoùre into that. No replay value.\n\nnow now...DON`t let these issues bring you down. It`s still a wonderful game and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it.\nSo I do recomment.

I picked this up on a steam sale for 20 bucks and enjoyed the hell out of the single player campaign. Will multiplayer or skirmish be as good? Not sure.  I just played the campaign. I just don't know how multiplayer or skirmish will work. There are a lot of things that can be improved upon.\n\nPositive\n+ Wonderful atmosphere and narration. I cracked a smile enough times I was waiting wondering what the narrator would say next.\n+ Good Dungeon Management game play. I feel it could be sped up somehow but overall it was an enjoyable experience.\n+ Graphics are goofy and fit all aspects of the game. I was a little concerned about this part but the more I played it the more I enjoyed the look.\n\nNegatives\n- Unit control was clunky and not a whole lot was explained.  A lot of people compare the overworld part to playing Warcraft 3. It's true to an extent but creating groupings and general control felt very clunky.\n- Room control.  I enjoyed all the additional aspects of the rooms but I feel like they could have better managed how you switch between them.  I was constantly looking for my armory or my tinker shop. Even my hospital was hard to find in a large dungeon. They really needed an extra menu to control these rooms without looking for them.\n- Gameplay pace.  I play a lot of strategy games but the campaign took me forever to complete when it probably should have taken me half the time. Even the narrator told me to speed it up.\n\nOverall 7.0 out of 10.  It's a very good addition to the genre but I have a personal bias for WFTO. If you want a Dungeon Keeper experience, get that game(be aware it's got a lot of issues). If you want something similar and done professionally, get Dungeons 2.  It's far and beyond better than the original.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reliant39/recommended/262280/","Reliant39","Reliant39","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reliant39/","701 products in account","This is a difficult game to recommend. It's an example of a game where instead of simply answering "Yes" or "No" to Steam's question of "Do you recommend this game?" is not so easy. If anything, I'd prefer to answer "It depends". Since that's not an option, I do recommend it, but with some caveats.\n\nIf you're looking for the next Dungeon Keeper, this isn't it. It gets close at times, but it doesn't quite scratch the same itch. For one thing, that's because there's a simple RTS bolted onto it. Whenever you venture into the overworld, you gain direct control over your units and play through a Warcraft III-inspired world. The switch in gameplay continues to feel jarring to me whenever I move units from the dungeon to the overworld. It's two separate games -- a dungeon-building sim and a simplified RTS -- and never do you feel like the two mesh. The developer would have done better to keep the same control scheme throughout, which would have meant abandoning direct control over your units on the overworld.\n\nThe game also suffers from severe pacing problems. It's slow. Painfully slow. Getting through a mission in the singleplayer campaign feels like it takes forever. Matters become worse as units -- even the ones you've taken the time and effort to level up! -- will die fairly quickly. When they die in the dungeon, you can pick them up and move them to the hospital, where they will eventually recover. But if they die in the overworld, they're gone forever. Unfortunately, it takes ages for their corpses to disappear and for the game to remove them from the population count, at which point you can recruit more units to replace them.\n\nTo expand on this, let me give you some further examples as regards the problematic pacing of this game. In some missions, you'll invade an enemy dungeon. You'll need goblins that are of a high enough level to disable enemy traps. But goblins are very fragile and will die in next to no time, so you really need to micromanage your units on the overworld and in enemy dungeons. You'll also have to fight boss enemies in some missions and it will take ages for your troops to whittle down their defences. In one mission, the boss kept walking around from one room to another, where his own minions would spawn. I lost all my troops apart from the trolls (bring plenty of those!) and it took far too long for the mission to end. Really, I had won at least twenty minutes before the game decided I did. That kind of grind is no fun at all.\n\nNevertheless, the game does have a lot of charm and the graphics are great for the game. The dungeon looks exactly like you would expect from a modern version of Dungeon Keeper, even if the pace and RTS-like elements don't fit. As such, I would recommend this if you're looking for a sim/RTS hybrid. If you're hoping for another Dungeon Keeper, though; this isn't it.","September 8, 2015","true","14.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Filled with pop culture references, narrated by the Stanley Parable guy (which alone makes it worth buying), the game had me laughing several times.\n2) It's a good mashup between a Dungeon Keeper/Overlord type game with a healthy splash of RTS. The unit count you end up controlling is low enough to where you don't get overwhelmed, but still great for those that enjoy group unit control.\n3) Great game to stream or record for youtube. People are interested in it, but not a whole lot of coverage.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1) Much more RTS than Dungeon Keeping. If you're just looking to build an automated dungeon, this probably isn't for you. A lot of unit micro-management is needed. This is partly because of my biggest gripe in the game -\n\n2) Bard render your traps completely pointless. Traps are pretty effective if they go off, however probably like 90% of waves of enemies coming to your dungeon will have Bards who are immune to traps, and disable them in an aoe. The rest of the troop hangs back and just waits for the Bard, and then they just romp through like the traps don't matter.\n\nI have had people say oh, just use spells to burst him down, except that's multiple clicks and usually takes 4-5 hits to kill a Bard (and that's if they're not healed). Regardless of how you can finagle to kill him off, here's the bottom line: Traps are not nearly as cost effective in the game as just spending your money on units and unit upgrades to murder your dungeon invaders, and that's about as disappointing as it gets. About halfway through the campaign I stopped researching and creating traps, and then the game really just turned into a full on RTS instead.\n\nStill, game is worth it, especially if you can grab it on a Steam Sale.","April 30, 2015","true","19.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

I have played all of these games so i decided that to compaire them for the people that are deciding between these games:\n\nso lets begin with this games unique feature: the overworld. In this game you can send your minions up to plunder the hometowns of the heroes. Now ofcourse we all agree that this is a remarkebly cool feature but there are also some minor issues with it:\n\nFirst of all the overworld uses RTS style gameplay instead of dungeon management so you can order your units arround. Now this is verry nice for intercepting incomming raiding parties before they enter your dungeon because you can for example actually force your archers to stay behind your melee guys to save them from a horibly painfull death. Now we all agree that this is nice but unfortunetely the AI in the RTS mode does little more then a "me orc... me bash" approach wich makes it necesarry to micromanage every unit. Also some units refuse to cast their spells automatically wich makes battle difficult because you have to micromanage every single unit.\n\nAlso it should be noted that you do not actually gain anything from plundering the overworld. For example in one the campaign missions you have to stop gold convoys. However when you kill off a convoy you do not actually get any gold.\n\nThus far the overworld. Now back to the comparison. In will number my own comments such that you can eassily refer to them should anyone feel the need to post a comment:\n1) In case of grapics, this game is in my opnion better then the old DK series but also better then war for the overworld but it also appears to have slightly higher system requirements. I should note here that i do not state that war for the overworld has bad grapics, i just think that these look beter personally.\n2) In terms of price. This game is by far the most expensive. The old DK games can be found on gog for about 5 euros. War for the overworld costs about 30 euros and this game costs a whopping 45 euros at the time this review was written.\n3) This game has 2 factions: the horde and the demons. each faction has 12 units devided over 4 catagories and 8 rooms. It should also be noted that there is no way to convert heroes into villans in this game whereas you can do as such in the DK series. In my opinion the number of units and rooms in this game is rather low when i compare it to the WFTO and DK. I would prefer a merged version of the 2 factions in which the number of possible rooms increases.\n4) When comparing the dungeon management gameplay to WFTO and DK, i always had a sense of "i have to rush this" in WFTO. So peronally i like the gameplay in dungeons 2 better then WFTO. But your own experience can be diffrent ofcourse.\n5) WFTO has far more skrimish maps in their release version whereas dungeons 2 has only 3. Now i expect that this number will increase at some point in time but i personally fear that they will bring out the "new" skrimish maps as a DLC which would annoy me greatly becasue imo they should present in the base version of the game.\n\nThus far my comparison of these games. If you feel that i missed something please tell me and i will endevour to add a section about that specific topic.\n\nThe only thing left to say would be: Should you buy these games?\nMy personal opionion? YES! but then i feel this way for all Dungeon-keeper-like-games including DK and WFTO.","April 27, 2015","true","23.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

I read somewhere that it has about 20 hours of campaign and I actually thought that it was a glitch when I couldn't continue after the last mission / 10hours of playing. I honestly felt like the game had only just begun. I tried some skirmishing after that, but it felt like playing exactly the same content over and over again.\n\nI wouldn't rate the game as "not recommended" if the price tag was right, maybe something close to 10€, but 45€ is way too much to pay for this short game. It should have had 20 or so more missions with different races and with some sort of storyline between them, Frasierish narrator doesn't make up for all that.","May 5, 2015","false","15.1"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","2"

There is so much goofyness, jokes, jibes, pokes and references to other franchises, that it is insane. And in pure goofy fashion, as a game that does not take itself seriously, you are allowed to make the narrator as angry as possible, so that he starts calling you names or take a commercial break just because - HE DOESNT HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO. Sounds fun? To me it does. Add to this the research system, fun dungeon layouts, tons of barrels of beer and you got yourselves a great visual experience and fun gameplay.\n\nThe good:\n1. Player friendly atmosphere - new and old players will enjoy the goofyness just as much. Like kill your OP hero in a tutorial. LOL. Wait, did I get an achievement for this? Like for realzzz?\n2. The art style is gorgeous and very well executed.\n3. The easter eggs and references will make you ROFL. Like King's Ending "from" Game of Thrones and Peter Relish the Lord Middlefinger(s)... Add to this references to pop stars, LOTR, shows, etc. and you will be enjoying the other side of the game as much as the game itself.\n4. I will repeat myself - angering the narrator has never been more satisfying. Or pleasing him and forcing him to sing your praises.\n5. Microing is good, but refer to Bad 3.\n6. The Narrator - he did a great job in the Stanley parrable - he is back with the goods (or shall I say goofs!) once again.\nAnd most importantly: 6.1. This game does not take itself seriously, people. Dont take it seriously too. Enjoy the commercial breaks, the narrator getting confused, or quoting franchises that are irrelevant to the game (LotR, GoT), etc.\n7. Smiles and laughter. And lots of it :D\n\nThe bad:\n\n1. The narrator does commercial messages. While I find it goofy, people may find it offensive.\n2. The Narrator can be offensive. You you think he is, go play War of the Overworld.\n3. Basic micro wins the game. Like, if you can micro 3 units in starcraft1 or 2, you can win the game.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile the game is on the pricy side now, I would still recommend it. It is a must buy as soon as it goes like 33-66% off. As a great game that loves goofynees, jokes, and fun, you only need to let it in and enjoy it to the fullest. Accept the game for what it is - GOOFY AND FUNNY. I have never had more fun doing the exact OPPOSITE thing that the narrator wants of me just to ♥♥♥♥ him off and get him to call me names. If you are a troll, you will like this game. If you want a relaxing game for fun, you will like this game. If you want a very serious game, better go play WotOverworld. It does look more serious, but also misses out on a ton of fun and laughter.\n\nComment: It is very weird that we get two Dungeon Keeper-esque games one after the other. Could be corporate spying, could be a coincidence. As if I believe in coincidences. No wonder WotOverworld came out first. It is the serious one. You go in, you do you stuff, you win. WotO's narrator is also way more serious. It is the spiritual successor of DK2, even reuses some stuff. On the other side, D2 opts to win you over with goofyness and smiles all around. You choose what you would like best.\n\nGuys play this game. Missions could be mundane at start as if sucked out of the fingers of the creators. Not much ingenuity, but still good fun fun to win. Do not ever doubt that.","April 30, 2015","true","14.5"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","3"

I love the mix between dungeon management and rts styles of gameplay. For those of you who have not played the game yet, you are the "Ultimate Evil" and you build up your perfect dungeon in the underworld and periodly send your troops to the overworld to fight, capture objectives, or free allies. You can spend your time making your dungeon be perfect, while also seeing your effect on the overworld by spreading your evil presence. You are attacked periodly in your dungeon, thus building traps, posting guard rooms, and having a good balance of troops in your dungeons and in the overworld. There are 2 factions that you can play: the horde and the demons. Each faction has 4 or 5 units as far as I can tell, and you can train those units and upgrade them into specialized classes. For example, you can train your weak archer's to be healers, etc.\nThere are 3 game modes as of right now: Campaign, skirmish, and multiplayer. I have not touched multiplayer so I cannot comment on that but I am loving the campaign. I have played 7 of the missions and the narrator's humor is very enjoyable. Sometimes he does get a bit annoying if you take very very long in a mission, by long I mean over an hour. I am waiting to go into skirmish until after the campaign, but there are 3 maps with some customizable options. The most noteable would be the endless mode option.\n\nTo sum up, I am loving this game. I highly reccommend it if your looking for a Dungeon Management game. The art style, comedy, and mechanics are all very well implemented in my opinion.

Evil genius).\nI've been wanting to play a dungeon keeper game for a while but I heard about the EA Games version of dungeon keeper and how they milked the name and turned it into a huge pay to win game.\nSo whenever the occasional dungeon keeper style game pops up I'm fairly wary of developers that might try to follow suit.\n\nSo far of what I've played this game seems to give you everything it sells you. From what I know of dungeon keeper, it's usually limited to the underground area only. This game adds a new interesting aspect by allowing you to travel to the surface.

In the dungeon you have one control scheme, and another on the over world. On the overworld you can select your units in a traditional RTS fashion (drag over them to select everyone). You can't do this in the dungeon however, meaning that if you want to move many units to the overworld, you have to select each on individually, and then drag them each on the dungeon exit. Considering how often you'll want to go back and forth between the dungeon and overworld, all of this micromanagement gets old quite fast.\n\nIn addition, the dungeon can get pretty crowded at times, making it difficult to click on the unit/room you're actually trying to access.\n\nAlso, there are a number of annoying bugs. At one point I had to quit to the main menu and reload my game because one orc stayed in my hand, preventing me from dropping it or doing anything else. Another time an orc on the overworld suddenly woudn't attack, and no enemies would attack it (but his friends could still attack).\n\nThis is a game I really wish was better. If they fixed these irritations it could be quite fun.\n\nEdit: as one commentor pointed out, you can use the group hotkeys you set on the overworld to select units in when they're in the dungeon. This helps a bit, but when you select units in the dungeon, it automatically moves you to the dungeon view, which gets obnoxious if you're trying to send them to the overworld.","June 17, 2015","false","6.1"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","25","41","3","2"

I had heard from a friend that Dungeon Lords Board game was based on a  computer game.  After watching trailers for this game I realized it is either based off an early version of this game or based off a predecessor to this game.  In Dungeon Lords board game you build a dungeon as the evil Dungeon Lord and you have imps to mine gold for you, build tunnels, etc.  The Imps are your snotlings or Minions in Dungeons ii.  You also can build traps in your dungeon and hire monsters like Trolls, Goblins , Dragons, Vampires, Ghosts, etc.  The games are basically the same game almost but in computer format as compared to board game format.\n\nAs a whole I absolutely love Dungeons ii.  I have completed the campaign and every map including the new ones just added.  I have every achievement except king of the hill and a friend is supposed to help me with that one tomorrow or soon since it's multiplayer.  In dungeons ii which is an RTS (I normally don't like RTS games and prefer turn based strategy so this game is really good for me to like an RTS) you hire snotlings if you are the horde or minions if you are the demons to build tunnels and rooms for you and to mine gold, set traps, admire demons, etc.  You can then do research with goblins or Trolls or nagas or the demon equivalent in their respective rooms.  You can upgrade your dungeon, adventure out into the above world to wreak havoc and mayhem.\n\nAfter I played the game a lot I decided to read others reviews to see what they thought of the game and I had the same experiences as many of them.  Treasure chests as one person said and I agree are the best trap and they are the lowest level trap.  The reason for this is because the stupid adventurer's in their mad rush for gold will go right after them and not wait for their bard to disable them.  This is not true of any other trap as they will wait for the bard to disable them before adventuring further.  I do like the Rolling stone trap but I think the develops fixed the fact that it could roll over even bards who are immune to other traps.\n\nThe demons as I agree with other reviewers are not as good as the hordelings and here is the main reason why.\nThe fire demons at the low level are not as good as orcs which are the equivalent.  The other problem is that for the demons the admiration chamber is the same as the hospital and that is where they heal.  With the hordelings you only have to throw beds in a hospital and they will lay down and heal.  However with the demons they have to go to the admiration chamber to heal and it requires a minion to sit there and admire them for them to heal.  Also you have to sacrifice a minion to upgrade the demons while you only have to train the hordes.  So clearly the demons are not as good as the minions must dig for gold, dig tunnels, set traps and do everything else the snotlings have to do but they also have to be a sacrifice to upgrade demons which means you have to spend more gold to replace them and they have to admire demons for demons to heal which means they have more duties than snotlings and slows down their other tasks.  They are clearly inferior to the horde which others have also said.\n\nI also feel it would be nice for the campaign to be longer and more maps available as well.  Also I was very disappointed in the fact that you don't get an undead dungeon.  When you go through the campaign and get the nagas to join you, then the trolls it adds them to your army capabilities and when you meet the demons you get to play the demons.  However when you fight the undead in the campaign I figured that you would get to play the undead and then you would be able to build Skeletons, Ghouls, Ghosts, Zombies and Vampires in your next dungeon but you never get the option to build those types of units.  Maybe an expansion in the future will introduce this? It would be fun to get that 3rd faction.\n\nAll in all I absolutely love this game.  I have heard references to Dungeon Keeper and maybe that is the predecessor to this game and what Dungeon lords is based on but I don't know as I've never played it and didn't see it on steam.  Because of this game I did buy Dungeons i and The dark lord sequel to it but have not had a chance to play them yet but am looking forward to it.\n\nI would love to see a map creator in this game so that everyone could create their own maps to play.\n\n\nAll in all though I have a few complaints about this game I absolutely adore it and it was totally worth the $39.99 I paid for it.  Or who I am kidding the $39.99 x 3 as I bought it for 2 of my other friends as well.","May 22, 2015","true","196.5"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","23","38","5","0"

The company made good on bringing back Dungeon Keep or a clone of it.   Don't read the IGN review, the reviewer didn't play the game or was really really stupid.  It’s nothing like he said in his review.     The best way I can sum it up, is the "underground" part is just like dungeon keeper.  You break out the ground and make rooms, mind gold and later mana and build your army and protect your base with doors and traps while building your army.  Then you send your troops to through the entrance(s) and you attack other army’s or bases above ground.   The game play is very much like Warcraft 3.  You have a small army and they have different abilities etc.   So think of a mix of Warcraft 3 for the above ground and a great clone of dungeon keeper below.   Also as a bonus you get to play the good guys AND the bad,  there is multiplier,  AND skirmish.\n\nI wish the campaign was a little longer (10+ hours and I didn’t rush and had some big army killing setbacks )  but the developer seemed to state that there will be more,  so let’s hope they don’t rip us off for DLC like every greedy ♥♥♥ game company does these days.    The other small grip is you have to keep leveling up multiple times (your dungeon and your “monster” population cap) and it takes time away from doing the other fun parts.   You get 4-5 different “type” of monsters,  and then get to level them up to different versions.   I have mixed feelings about that but it didn’t detract to much of the game, but plays more like an RTS where you ramping up your army before sending them to kill the enemy or get slaughtered.\n\nOverall a GREAT game and if you’re on the fence, just buy it, it IS a lot of fun.\n","May 2, 2015","true","22.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I will try and be short and sweet since reviews that are pages long usually turn me off.\n\nPros:\n\n- is what it should be! classic dungeon keeper like play and really brings the game of old alive with updated graphics and new interactions\n- simple comedy and entertainment throughout the game in many forms absolutely add to the overall game\n- INCREDIBLE support staff; i have never posted on the forums for the game be it a simple question on how best to proceed or technical issues i ran across and not have a dev or other helpful member of the community respond within 24 hours (honestly ive had a response within an hour every time)! for me this turns a great game into an outstanding one.\n\nCons:\n\n- game is admittedly a tad challenging on user interface.  It can be a bit finecky over hot keys and accepting commands.  Ocasionally i go to cast a spell and the spell wont cast on the enemy becuase it thinks i am trying to cast it on the trap the enemy is standing on, this sort of thing.\n- does have some perfomance issues as well.  Get a "mono" error ocasionally that will cause the entire game to kick me out.  Also has some configuration issues with dual monitor setups and though i am a windows user myself have seen multiple issues if you are on linux systems reported.\n- relatively short single player.  I am not much into these types of games for multi player so havnt even attempted multiplayer yet and probably never seriously will.  I am a fairly heavy gamer but also like taking my time with these games i rarely finish a campaign map without having researched literally everything there is to research and having nearly the entire dungeon mapped out, so at the time of writing this it says i have nearly 30 hours on record and im just barely about to beat the campaign.  For me though this is short i completely recognize if i was motivated to do so i would have finished the game easily in half that time.\n\nconclusion?\n\ngreat game, great support game, not more then what i expected.  I would give it a 9/10 mostly becuase of the support staff and doing what its meant to do so well.  All the cons i see in the game are cons that can be improved with time, and from my interaction with the developers i have full confidence in them being handled sooner than later.  They are saying new skirmish maps are about to be released in the next week or two and the game hasnt even been out a full week yet.  While i am sad the campaign isnt longer (maybe it was just becuase i was younger and less skilled but i remember dungeon keeper 2s campaign being WAY way longer) i have no reserves at all on spending money for an expansion/dlc if they release one.","May 4, 2015","true","35.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

However at this point I can thankfully say throughout my whole playthrough I encountered no bugs at all and it was one of the funniest things I had seen in a long time.\n\nSo to kick things of, the game doesn't focus too much on setting up a dungeon, since defending it is easy but by consistently sending troops above to go on missions. That is against the preference of some but I found it to be a satisfying strategy experience. Aside that the resource and upgrade systems are balanced while the units and factions presented(Demons and Horde) feel different, which is good.\n\nFinally I believe the biggest positive aspect of the game is the campaign. Holding a satisfactory length, it is literally decorated by the game narrator(whose name evades me at the moment but you have probably seen him from Stanley's Parable where he was pretty much the star of the game) who offers scathing comments on everything, from the events that happen to reacting when the player does nothing(please do not do nothing for 5 minutes on the first dungeon mission, you will love the response).\n\nAs if that wasn't enough the campaign has tons of popular references concerning the enemies you fight and what they say, most famous ones stemming from Lord of the Rings and Warhammer to other games from the same developers. It even has a specific mission dedicated on referencing the Game of Thrones characters, each one in a unique and hilarious way.\n\nAlso worth noting the achievements are nothing hard and can be achieved by one multiplayer game and through the main campaign. After saying that I definitely believe the game is worth the purchase, now that it works properly you can enjoy the fun it offers to the fullest.\nHeavily Recommended","July 7, 2015","true","14.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

It is let down by a slow paced hand holding main campaign. Shame. It has all the components to make it a very good game. (One i could very well rave about if it had been designed slightly differently)\n\nThe extremely linear scripted campaign does not allow you the freedom to enjoy the experience of building your dungeon or to approach the objectives in anything but the one designed scripted route in the exact sequence scripted. This coupled with the very limited overland (walled routes, effectively just one winding lane) really stifle the experience. No freedom or illusion of freedom.\n\nA limited amount of rooms and a high cost in wages/upgrades for units really lets down the game also making each level a repeating slow slog of completely rebuilding the same handful of rooms then recruiting the same 4 or 5 types of units until you have enough while events trigger or trying to rush it.\n\nThe actual building experience is fine as is the tried and tested formula of controlling the minions. (group assigning is possible) Its also a pretty game with nice animations and humorous commentary, thankfully with a setting to control it. (indeed i turned it to its lowest setting pretty quick as it was non stop)\n\nThere is not much replayability in this game indeed I am struggling atm to complete the main campaign. Bear in mind I have not tried multiplayer but the limited rts mode overland will i think restrict the enjoyment.\n\nThe first game fell far far from the mark. This game falls nearer but its not quite there. Third time may well be the charm. Metacritic (usually a cesspit of despicable untrustworthy paid for reviews) has got the score right 7/10\n\nOverall a good try but not quite a dungeon keeper beater.

From what I've read there are others with the same issue and it started happening after a game update in October 2015.  After posting details of the problem on the bug report thread (along with what I've done to try and fix it myself), a dev quite promptly responded to tell me they think they've identified a fix and it just needs a bit more testing.  I figured hey, last update was just a few weeks ago, I'm sure they'll patch it soon.\n\nAlmost half a year later there have been no patches - fix or otherwise - and now any enquiries regarding fixes for this or other problems get the reply that they're working on the PS4 version of the game and there'll be no updates to the PC version while that's going on.  We'll maybe get a re-port of the PS4 version once it's released, which might fix the issue(s), they think, probably, maybe, but details on any of that are hazy at best.\n\nObviously there's a lot of people playing the game without issue, so it might be worth a look anyway, but I'd definitely keep Steam's no-questions refund criteria in mind and if you do run into problems go that route immediately rather than wait for the problems to be resolved.","May 1","false","1.7"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxiglava/recommended/262280/","maxiglava","TyskeN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxiglava/","258 products in account","Let's start to describe the game, in Dungeons 2 you are an evil overlord who controls his creatures and minions to build a big underworld dungeon and your goal is to take over the surface and wipe out the good guys. In your dungeon you will be building different types of rooms to satisfy the needs of your creatures, do research and improve your spells, weapons, abilities, rooms, traps and a bunch of other stuff to help you defend your dungeon and take over the surface. You can pick up and slap your minions and of course mine through the underground and build rooms to manage your dungeon.\nOnce you get to the surface the game turns into a RTS (real time strategy) game. You will have complete control over your minions and their abilities. Having a good unit composition and formation is key to taking over the surface and wiping out the Alliance (good guys).\n\nThe campaign is fun and introduces you to the game and its mechanics in a nice and steady pace. There are a bunch of campaign maps and they all feel different and fresh enough to keep you interested. What truly makes the campaign shine though is the narrator in my opinion. It's the same narrator from the Stanelys Parable so you might know him. His voice is very clear and he really makes the script looks better than it really is. The humor, jokes and references are all pretty much spot on and got me laughing multiple times during my playthrough, but this will of course be subjective.\n\nOnce you have finished the campaign you can jump into skirmish or multiplayer. Unfortunately I haven't played the multiplayer so I can't comment on that. The skirmish is really fun. You are going to play against one AI who inhabits the surface and sends units down into your dungeon. Note that you CAN'T play against annother dungeon lord in skirmish. You will be able to choose from two different factions, the demons and the horde (orcs). They both are well made factions who play differently and have their own distinct strenghts and weaknesses. All rooms, units and spells are unlocked in skirmish after you have researched them of course.\n\nNow onto some bad parts of the game. The optimization is kind of poor at the moment, once the majority of the map is discovered you will most likely drop frames and changing the graphic options doesn't help. This will of course vary depending on your pc hardware. At the moment the skirmish mode has only three different maps to play which is dissapointing. The developers has told the community that they will release more free maps later down the line though. I have also noticed some people are complaining that the narrator throughout the game advertises other products from Kalypso Media. I personally don't mind it because it happens rarely and it is done in a comical form and there are a lot of jokes and references in the game so I naturaly take it with a pinch of salt.\n\nAll in all Dungeons 2 is a very enjoyable game if you are into strategy and/or management games, and it will only get better once a few patches who will adress the optimization and the small map pool will be released.","May 1, 2015","true","89.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This game is not an ultra challenging RTS or fast paced micromanagement dungeon simulator. It is however an extremely stylish and fairly polished playground with excellent voice acting and fantastic animation. Everything about the dungeon feels alive, with creatures amusingly waving to your evil hand as it passes over them, doing yoga in the gym, and generally delightfully cavorting about. The world even changes as you conquer things from ultra-flowery heroic scenery to brooding and mysterious dark fantasy.\n\nThis is a game I come home to play to enjoy a fun and well crafted experience. The campaign is short and there are only a few skirmish maps, but the entire experience is refined and enjoyable. There is no grind or absurd number of side quests. When I come home from work I don't have 100+ hours to sink into some massively padded RPG or sprawling 4x game. This isn't a game made to strain your strategic skill to the breaking point. And I absolutely love that about it. I can create a beautifully crafted dungeon and simply watch with fascination as it operates.\n\nI was a huge fan of Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 and I've been looking for a similar game for some time. The big question now is, War for the Overworld or Dungeons 2?\nWar for the Overworld was ultimately a buggy disappointment which entirely failed to capture the personality and style of the Dungeon Keeper series. It's focus on very faced paced competitive game play resulted in the grim dark creatures lacking any sort of style or flair. They don't struggle in the air when you grab them, they don't interact with your hand amusingly, they just act like robots. Every bit of the clunky UI is geared towards facilitating a competitive experience. The "sandbox mode" is literally just a giant blank map with no enemies. Your creatures are boring. Your dungeon is boring. The game is boring.\n\nDungeons 2 on the other hand is dripping with style and humor. Your creatures interact in amusing ways, are beautifully animated, and generally give a sense of life to the dungeon you create. The narrator is also genuinely funny. The RTS mechanics are simplistic and I believe that is a plus. They don't distract from the dungeon keeper sim and if anything simply act as an additional neat feature. It feels very much like simplistic Warcraft. You spend time below ground making a big horde then unleash it on the world up top to crush up everything. It' s a jolly good time.\n\nI recommend this game heartily to anyone who enjoys excellent animation, style, and relaxing dungeon simulators.","April 29, 2015","true","26.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Two different Dungeon factions offer low species variety per faction, but a high unit variety with different roles and purposes. There are barely any funny videos, but loads and loads of cheesy commentary from the Stanley Parable announcer. There are less mechanics and rooms (yet?) in terms of the dungeon, like prisons and casinos, but more focus on tech, micromanagement, dungeon control and overworld warfare.\n\nIt is fair to say that Dungeons II orientates itself closer to Dungeon Keeper than before, but instead of copying the formula, they try their own receipe and so far I am very happy with it. If I had to make criticism, then it would be in the amount of non-campaign maps, which is far too low.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artimenius/recommended/262280/","artimenius","Besputha Tomkova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artimenius/","2596 products in account","To be honest I did not really like original game. It was lacking something intangible. I think I know what exactly, now.\nFirst thing that catches your eye is the art. Little minions strolling around, drowning in vivid colors. World of rabbits and unicorns darkening and changing as you, the Ultimate Evil, stroll behind them, casually destroying houses damaging them for 666 or 665 with each hit (the last one just because he became a bit tired and bored). Those little details here and there are just amazing. Even gold reserves are not just gold as in other similar games: they have precious stones, like rubies and emeralds.\nAfter you come out of the shock from the beauty of the game you will dive into another shock: "What is this? RTS?" Do not rush to the conclusions yet. You do start by controlling your alter ego as in RTS, but then due to scenario you are diminished to an ethereal corpse.\nAnd this is when you you become the keeper. There are some significant differences compared to classic dungeon keeper here, inspired by the same RTS genre. 1st of all, you do not "attract" minions, you buy them and there is a limit to how many you can, as in RTS games. 2ndly rooms are clickable. And for a good reason: they need some micro-management, too: you need to build "facilities" in there to help the rooms work properly, and some of them allow you to research stuff like new buildings and upgrade stuff, as well. You do not claim the tiles, too: you just clear the dirt.\nDirt is different here, too. 1st of all you can "raise walls" here. It is required to increase efficiency of the rooms: they need to be surrounded by walls for increase productivity. There are also 2 types of gold tiles: some give you a lot of gold, but get destroyed quickly, while others are virtually eternal and you can dig gold from them for quite some time, but slowly. Although, so far I never experience an urgent need for lots of cash.\nUnlike other keepers minions here should be cherished. As mentioned, you have a limited supply of those due to population limit. Also they do gain levels, which makes them stronger. You can also give them medals, which add some "honorifics" to their names. Yes, they all have NAMES. Makes it more personal. It's also nice how non-worker types smash on walls when bored and there are also those pop-ups, that tell you some thoughts of the minions, like what they are doing at the moment.\nI also like, how traps get restored here. When activated by heroes, they do not vanish freeing the tile, they stay there, waiting for repairs and once repaired, they can work again. If you have enough resources and build the traps wisely, you can generally forget about protection of the entrance, because it will be self-sufficient. And you will require some free time.\nBecause, you see, there are 2 maps here. Map of your dungeon and... Map of the world above the dungeon. You can take a minion, drop him on a certain building and... Her goes out for a walk in the forest. To crash some skulls. Here I am reminded of those old-school solo missions in StarCraft or WarCraft, where you can't build anything, but have a few units, that you need to control precisely in order to finish the objectives. It may even have some stealth elements. And again - these units continue getting level-ups, medals and stuff like that.\nAnd all that is presented by a narrator, who keeps giving jokes close to what we could hear in Overlord game series. With some 4th wall breaking here and there. This is actually what original game was lacking (besides the amazing art-style). It gives the game a "soul", makes it even more alive, even though dungeon keeping still feels slow at times. Although, admittedly, minions here do seem a bit... Well, fat. In need of proper training.\nSo, this is a rally good game. There are lots of minor things, that make it stand out among the others f the genre. These details show, that it was developed with love. Only 2 cons I currently see is that dungeon keeping is quite slow and generally easy and some minor interface annoyances (like sometimes you have to hover over the tutorial or event notification, because otherwise you will click on the tile, not on the actual icon).\nI definitely recommend it. 8/10","April 24, 2015","true","9.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

The gameplay itself is also pretty great as it has you dealing with RTS gameplay on the overworld which you can get to through dungeon portals and dungeon simulation/management within the actual dungeon. The UI provides two maps for this and changing back and forth feels pretty crazy and great! I should also mention the game actually has 2 playable factions right now , one being the Horde and the others being the demons under control of the chaotic evil , the demons are much more magic based and the Horde bring a lot more brawn to the party. Currently you can't play the forces of good which is kindof a shame because they're also pretty fleshed out as far as units go and it would be great to attempt to invade a dungeon from the surface.\n\nAlso forgive my gushing over the game but personally this game captures the bad guy humour I love so much extremely well! To compare it to something similar humour wise and who lightheartedly it pokes at things I'd have to bring up Overlord 1-2 by Guerilla games.\n\nThe game does come with some hiccups here and there which I hope will be resolved with patches. Sometimes you'll encounter frame lag especially once there's a lot going on on screen , a crazy amount of shields on units for example bundled with your troops and especially the rolling boulder trap which will tear your frames apart for a few seconds. But honestly nothing really gamebreaking , the campaign takes you on a fun ride and will throw an absurd amount of references and will poke fun at so many things all with the great narration!\n\nSkirmish I tried aswell and you can flip on Endless mode if you just want to make the most ridiculous and impenetrable dungeon you had in mind , naturally you could also just crush the heroes on the surface and claim victory. Online is also included which I haven't been able to test just yet but you can connect to a random game , you can create/host one yourself and you can ofcourse join games by the use of a Game ID.\n\nTo sum up the rambling for me Dungeons 2 is the Dungeonkeeper like to go this time. The aesthetic is wonderful , the narration well done , the campaign is sure to get some good laughs out of you aswell. The minor hiccups , sometimes you'll encounter frame lag when things get a little bit too much , the pricepoint personally I find a bit too high right now but you will be very happy if you do decide to make the purchase.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_OM1f1HYRI","April 24, 2015","true","14.7"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","27","48","2","0"

This game has the look, but falls frustratingly short in the execution.\nThe developers decided to compensate for inability to design a discoverable UX or write a decent manual by having the narrator yell at the user.  Repeatedly.  For example:\nYou're instructed to build an Arena and drop in a creature.  You do so, it happily flails away, gaining experience points.  On to the next bit of dungeon management...except the narrator is still complaining.  You train the creature again, train another, nothing is good enough.  GET OFF YOUR ♥♥♥♥, YOU ♥♥♥♥!!!\nRepeated.  Every few minutes.\nYou exit the game in annoyance and search.  The Dungeons2 forums are down, and naming a game this generically doesn't help in search results.  Eventually you find a review complaining about the issue and discover that all the narrator's yelling about dropping the creature somehow neglected to mention that you also must deselect and then right-click on the Arena to choose a previously-hidden icon that levels the minion.  Brilliant!\n(For extra fun, you then complete the level and save.  When you return a few days later to give the game a second chance, it has lost your save and has you back in the same level.  With no creature trained yet and the announcer yelling about it again.  Repeatedly.)\nThere are other interface issues, and the overworld play seems to be basically "Build big army, abandon dungeon, steamroller foes."

The gameplay reminds me very much of the old DK series.  I know the comparison has been done to death but there it is.\n\n2.  I love the somewhat cartoonish art style.\n\n3.  As of this writing, the overworld RTS part isn't fully fleshed out control-wise as it's missing some pretty common controls (like subgroup selection).  That's supposed to be patched in soon.  Still, it's nice to not just sit in the dungeon waiting on heroes.  I like taking it to them for once >:).\n\nThere's been some complaints you've no doubt seen in negative reviews.  I will say this.  I like the narrator.  He's funny.  Does he nag me a bit too often sometimes?  Yes.  Do I mind?  Not really, no.  Does he advertise for other Kalypso games?  No.  I've heard that maybe once and it was clearly a joke.  Everything else he says is a joke so why would that be the one thing taken seriously?  Finally, I have had no performance issues thankfully.  I don't have a beast of a computer (low-end core i7, 12 GB RAM, R9 270X 2 GB card) but there's no overworld or dungeon lag for me so far.\n\nAnyway, if you're looking for a fun and funny game that has you building a den of righteous evil from which to strike out against the so-called "good guys" look no further.","May 3, 2015","true","56.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There are a couple points where the narrator gets a little testy when you dont follow the games line of progression, but that's a minor thing.

A quick read of a game review on kotaku prompted me to purchase this game after it mentioned Blizzard's Warcraft RTS series. If you’ve played other real time strategy games such as Warcraft or Starcraft, then the learning curve for Dungeons 2 should not be very steep at all. So far I've only played the single player campaign missions, and while the storyline is neither compelling nor immersive, it is entertaining nonetheless. While I have only played the campaign mode so far, most of that time has been spent designing, building, expanding, and making my dungeons look aesthetically pleasing while remaining efficient instead of going straight for the mission objective. With that being said, I found that both the room/building and the unit diversity to be a bit lacking. For example, there are eight different types of rooms that can be built once the third and final tier is unlocked. A room is either a production facility or what the game calls a “room”. Some “rooms” have multiple structures that can be built, but do not require a research path to unlock different structures. For example, when playing as the horde, a hospital can both restore health to units over time, and revive units that have died in the overworld (outside of the dungeon), but the revival feature is researched at the tinkerer’s cave so no investment into whether the hospital room will act as a recovery unit or revival center is required. Therefore it often feels unnecessary and excessive to have a hospital at two different areas of your dungeon. Similar to my opinion of room diversity, there are only five units to choose from (one of them being a worker unit). The other four units can be upgraded upon reaching the next tier. If you count the upgraded versions of the units as a new unit, then there are actually 13 different units in the game.  With that being said, and despite my criticisms of the game, I’ve still logged 20 hours of gameplay and they have been a fun 20 hours (keep in mind that I have never played a dungeon manager/builder game before) which is why I would recommend this game, especially to someone such as myself who has been eagerly awaiting the next great medieval fantasy RTS, but has never played a dungeon manager game before.","May 4, 2015","true","21.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

On the first view it seems a bit shallow due to only a few different units. But once you are fully into the game you recognize a lot of depth there, especially with the split skills for working and combat. And the specialization by books.\nSame goes for rooms where you have to build the room first but you need to plan properly since most rooms need additional tools for function. Walls have influence on the rooms efficiency as well.\nIn the underworld itself you need to gather resources to prepare for your fight against the heroes in the overworld\n\nOn the overworld the game mechanics are just like a Warcraft "light" you can command your units with special skills in nearly exact the same way. In the overworld you can cripple the enemy heroes by destroying their buildings so they can´t send more troops.\n\nThe narratives and voice acting is quite nice and funny (at least in German language with the Deponia Rufus speaker) but especially the voice acting is a bit too often and too repetitive. A longer timer between the monologues would help.\nA very good thing is the pace of the game. There is most of the time no need to hurry. You can go and explore the world and build a massive dungeon - one of the things I loved at Dungeon Keeper - and in contrast to War For The Overworld. The controls are ok but still need some polishing. It is a bit annoying that you only get information about your units by dragging them up for example.\n\nBeside the campaign there are more game modes like skirmish. Furthermore it has a Multiplayer support. But haven´t tested anything but campaign yet.\n\nThere are still some bugs and glitches but no gamebreakers (yet)\n\nIt is a really great game and worth the price.

I enjoyed playing it overall, enough that I'll pick up the planned DLC when it comes out.  I have no interest in multi-player, so my review is based solely on my single-player experience.  Here are just a few bulleted items that came to mind while I was playing:\n\nLiked\n- Art style: cartoonish like DK, detailed, colorful, and original\n- Voice work and writing: great work on the narrator; he's pithy and verbose, but doesn't become annoying.  Story is simple and about on par w/ the DK games\n- Gameplay: I enjoyed the dual dungeon-digging and overland-conquest idea, I think it worked.  Even though neither was as deep as a game that just focused on one or the other, there was enough there to make a fun game\n- Research and upgrades: there's quite a bit to dig into here as far as upgrading your units; if you're a completionist like me, it can be time-consuming to max everything out.  Even though it's fairly linear progression, there are obvious results in your units' competence from your research\n- Multiple factions: although the second villainous faction doesn't come heavily into play in the campaign, there's great fun to be had playing as both villainous factions in skirmish mode.  I felt like this adds a bit of longevity to the game\n- UI: everything in the game is fairly straight-forward and easy to navigate.  Aside from issues I had assigning spells to hot-keys, I think you'd have to try pretty hard not to grasp how to manipulate the game world here\n- Developer presence on the Community page: this might seem stupid, but it's immensely gratifying to have people involved w/ the development present to field questions.  Many games I've purchased have no dev presence here and it's often incredibly frustrating working w/ other players to figure out game issues.  I had several questions that I posted  here and they always got dev attention eventually\n\n\nCould Use Improvement\n- Adjustable difficulty: much of the game was too easy for my tastes, the campaign needs difficulty options\n- More reward for exploring: this was a big thing in the DK games, digging out out every nook and cranny yielded interesting rewards. Similarly for the overworld. I felt this was lacking a bit here\n- Campaign could be longer and more free-form: there's a tad too much hand-holding as you go through\n- Mission variety: I'm on the fence w/ this one b/c I see where the devs made the attempt.  There are several missions where you make forays into opposing dungeons and a mission where you have to ambush overworlders while they're en route to a meeting; however, I would like to have seen this variety pan out more. I like the fighting between dungeon concept, I wish it had gotten more screen-time and more robust gameplay instead of the simple set-piece scenarios we got.\n\nAs I said, I enjoyed this game enough to keep an eye out for the DLC.  I didn't play the first Dungeons game; I was scared off by the negative press it got.  However, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed DK, despite its flaws.","June 28, 2015","true","30.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

When you are building your "dungeon" you will experience that most items can only be placed in one or two ways, which is the locked angle of the camera, this is especially troublesome because it break any oppotunity you'll have for more complex designs (not that you need it, as said earlier AI is basically abcenst) visuals are good though, but that is the only praise i could ever hope to give it.\n\nSummery:\nEmpty & shallow gaming experience.\nVery restricted building oppotunities.\nAbcent and lazy AI (both enemies and your units)\nObvious DLC mill.\nExtremely repetative.\nTotal lack of strategy.\n\nConclusion: Not recommended.","August 8, 2015","false","18.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

However I would like to see a bit more different attacks and the attack itself needs to be speeded a bit up (attack animation) since it looks a tiny bit weird right now.\nBut overall the graphic is Really good.\n\nSound:\nWell the creatures does not have much going for them, what they do have is good, but they are just silent with a few grunts, I would have liked some voice stuff.\nThe narrator is amazing; it is funny while being informative. Very well done.\nAre there music? If so it was good enough for my brain not to turn it off, but not so good that I can remember it.\nAmbient and weapon/fighting sounds where good all over.\n\nControls:\nI found the controls quite ok for what it is.\nI would like some improvement on the rts part since if we need to micro manage skills I want to be able to do so easily without having to fight the interface to grap ONE creature and use the right skill on the right enemy or friend which can be very hard currently.\n\nIn dungeon mode, I found it a bit hard to catch and drop creatures, hitting them and knowing which one you hit is a bit chunky and could need improvements.\n\nAbility to grab workers from the interface would be very nice, same with creatures. If it is to prevent grabbing them while they are doing important task just make a priority system which always grab creatures idling first.\n\nCamera controls, I want to be fully in control of my camera ty. Please do not limit my rotation, angling and zoom.\nOf Couse there have to be a limit but it should be where I never feel it prohibits me.\n\nInterface stuff:\nI would like to be able to see level of my creatures over their heads. I would also want a way to inspect them easily.\nInformation is a bit hard to get on creatures I think, or not hard but fiddly, should be made more convenient.\n\nThe many maps makes it a bit confusing but nothing you don’t get used too.\nBesides that, I think the interface all over is pretty good.\n\nCreature variety:\nThere is a large variety of creatures and two full races to play with, with different mechanics, tactics etc. that is pretty damn awesome !!\n\nSome more customization in gear for each creature would be nice, or some way of adding the title’s without the books, would be good.\n\nAI and Combat:\nThe combat is properly the games weakest point even though its not bad at all.\nThe AI isn’t very good, while it works very well for what it is, it’s very simple, ranged mobs doesnt avoid melee, succubus healers don’t heal before they get the full benefit of the heal, meaning not healing 80% of the time so stuff dies, most abilities can’t be auto used and due to the “cluster F” of the combat it becomes very annoying.\nI think the ai in combat need a TON of improvement, in a dungeon defender I generally don’t want to have to fight the different systems to micromanage like crazy. No I want to build my army and enjoy it doing its thing with only low interaction from me ^^\nwhen that is said it works so well that i didnt feel frustrated or annoyed by it, i just see all the potential i would like it to do instead :P\n\nWould like to see the ai actually protecting the dungeon on it’s own as well. Guard rooms needs to give xp while creatures are at them or they are essentially just wasting space and time standing there.\n\nThe ability to pre-set “formations”, reaction pattern (flee when low, move back if in melee, protects friendly ranged that is attacked; etc.)\n\nAI in general:\nThe ai is pretty ok at doing what it is suppose to.\nI find it pretty cool how creatures start doing workouts, waving at you and other such stuff making them seem more alive, but at the same time I am missing a LOT more of this.\nI would love creatures to interact more with each other, speak, fight, bully, taunt and have fun.\nThis part is actually one of the most important once for me, I want to be able to sit back when I build my perfect dungeon and just follow the different creatures life and enjoy them like I would with a “tv show” (you can a tiny bit but there is so much more which could be done).\n\nI would like to see the AI advantage on its own accord as well, not sure exactly how this would work, would require something like new spawners popping up in the underground or over ground.\nSomething creatures could go fight by their own will, to make them feel more like they are alive and do stuff they want themselves\n\nGameplay flow and speed:\nI find the general overall speed of the game really good with one exception.\nPaydays and gold gathering: because there is so long from a to b once your dungeon gets a decent size you use the VAST majority of your creatures time walking from a to b instead of doing stuff. There most be a way to fix this.\nAnd having to make gold rooms all over the place because it takes the workers too long if you don’t and workers are taking resources from your army so you can’t just mass them to make up for it, it is a problem which needs to be fixed :)\n\nThe flow of the game seems good; it is a nice mix of build your army and see it destroy stuff.\n\n\nRooms:\nMost of them are awesome! :D feels a bit limited on some though, you need a TON of space to use them for several creatures, not sure if that is good a bad, it is hard to tell because the issue with it is that creature speed is so low that getting paid is really slow and takes forever.\nI would like a feeding room (meat not just beer).\nAnd I would REALLY REALLY! Like an actually efficient training room. As the training room are now it seems really bad for training xp etc.\nThis is due to two things:\n1. Creatures roles are VERY important so taking them of that for the minor benefit the training gives is not very valid.\n2: they never go there to auto train so you manually have to get them to do it, making it a hell to micro manage.\n\nModel size’s:\nThe demons seems to have reasonable sized creature big and small (the torture rooms model is WAY too big though.. and animation for it really need improvement since its “boring”) but the orc’s all are generally around the same size with little difference, goblins should be much smaller, trolls bigger, and orc’s in the middle of it.\n\n\nConclusion:\noverall I had a blast in the game, it is very fun and entertaining ^^\nit feels like a successor to dungeon keeper and it improve on the idea of dungeon keeper while keeping the spirit and awesome feeling of it.\n\nThere is as mentioned a handful of things I would like to see changed, but it is pretty minor and I am VERY much looking forward to expansions, dlc, or the next game you guys created (granted it builds on this one in its concepts and stay within the dungeon manager feel :P  )","April 25, 2015","true","19.2"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","0"

I have played for almost 12 hours, finished 7 missions in the campaign, and still can't get enough.  I do enjoy the game.  That being said, here is what I find that could use some work and/or polish:\n\n1)  Floating hand accuracy is inaccurate - When trying to pick up units in a crowded area, be it tools, beer, or several creatures, it is difficult to grab or highlight the exact creature I want.  The hand "pointer" seems to be around the lower part of the pointer finger close to the palm.  Hard to grab units easily and quickly.\n\n2)  Narrator - While I have found the narrator's humor to be exceptional, there were times I wish he was shut up because he was the one being the "♥♥♥♥".  I like to play out my campaigns over hours, trying to research everything and develop my entire dungeon, and I felt the narrator was trying to keep me on the game's timeline instead of my own.  Also, the advertising for Kalypso games, while funny and original, did get old after the 6th to 7th one.\n\n3)  Unit selection in the dungeon vs. the overworld - I really wish I could select my units in the dungeon as easily as I can in the overworld.  I may be missing a shortcut or other function for selecting in the dungeon, but as of now, having to pick up every unit I want to send to the over world, one by one, is very frustrating.  Especially when I have units set in a guard house that wander over to get beer or pay and I pick them up accidentally and send them to the overworld mission.  It would be nice to be able to shift+double-click on the population count icon to pick up all units of that type into the "hand" and deliver them to the overworld.  Or, let me set the rally banner in the overworld and have the units automatically go to the overworld tunnel from my dungeon.  However Kalypso wants to fix it, I feel it is an issue that should be addressed.\n\n4)  Pay vs. thirst frequency - I found I had no problem keeping up with the thirst demand (experimenting with only 1 dispenser, then 2, and finally 3) and after setting up the 3rd beer producer for a heavily populated dungeon I had excess beer production with no thirst issues, but the pay frequency seems to be, well, too frequent.  I haven't timed it yet but I do know that I was setting up a tinkerer's shop right after a payday hit and it couldn't have been more than 2 or 3 minutes when the next one hit.  With the slow rate of gold acquisition from the "snots", i feel the payday frequency should be lengthened slightly between pay days.\n\n5)  Unit pathing - I noticed when I sent units into combat, more often than not, my orcs at the front of my army would begin moving toward the enemy, come within a few feet of the enemy, then stop for approximately 2 to 3 seconds (while being damaged), then continue foward and engage the enemy.  It has happened on every campaign map I have done and is quite annoying.  I don't know if it's pathing or just a bug, but I feel it could use some attention as it does affect my game play and game enjoyment.  Like I said, it does get frustrating, especially when encountering a large opposing army.\n\nWell, that about sums up what I can remember so far regarding the issues I have found that I feel should be addressed.  Now, on a positive note, I feel the game has been beautifully designed.  I do love the narrator's humor and story telling.  Very unique.  The graphics, though cartoonish, are very visually pleasing and gorgeously done.  The sound is clear and helps me transport myself as if I am really in my dungeon or the overworld area.  Other than the interface issues above, I had no problems adapting to the controls.  I am still working on memorizing the hotkeys for everything (as there are many too remember), but overall the controls are easily learned.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys dungeon builders and RTS type games.  If Kalypso could keep giving this game attention and polish in future patches, I believe this game could be a very reliable and popular sequel to the previous dungeon builders many of us have come to enjoy and value.","April 30, 2015","true","45.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It adds the Strategy components that were necessary to make a new-original-on-its-way Dungeon Keeper.

BUT the main problem that has made me stopped from playing has been the proportional performance drop as your dungeon and creatures grow.

It may not be a full similarity of Dungeon Keepers Franchise but it has its own charm. Despite of 'attracting' units from the portal like in DK, you are hiring them from the world below to come work in your Dungeon. So therefore, DK players would have to get used to the mechanics that this game has and keep playing.\n\nHere below are my thoughts, it may or may not be the same as anyone else. But its worth saying out.\n\nGood Points:\n- You can build your Dungeon however you like. (Refilling on tiles you might have accidentally unearth.)\n- You can make your own specific army.\n- You have different fractions of 'Evil' (Demons/Orcs and etc. That is if I have not uncovered them all yet.)\n- Upgrade / Research System aka The Forge\n\nNeutral Points:\n- Population System/ Evolution Mechnics (Maybe its just me.)\n- Minions/Servants carry so little gold.\n\nBad Points:\n- Game crashes on me. (Randomly after few hours or so.)\n\nIn short, if you are a gamer like me who LOVES to dig up the whole dungeon (despite having the Narrator annoying you from time to tim for dragging the game so long.) to reveal its secrets of 'free units', books and hidden gem steams. Just remember to save your game every 30 mins or so. Otherwise, a whole dungeon's worth of time will be gone. Which happened to me like three times.\n\nOther than that, have fun conquering the Lands of the Goodies and be evil smacking your Minions / Servants to make them work faster.","January 9","true","55.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madkatz/recommended/262280/","madkatz","InfectiousCAT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madkatz/","78 products in account","I regret buying this game for $9.99 discounted, then the song of winter DLC for $15 not discounted.\n\nWhen I saw the 10 dollar temporary pricetag and dungeon manging preview vid (first dungeon managing game mind you) I was sucked into it's style and unit management very quickly. Installing, then playing the game. the campaign though pathetically a day or two long, had some of the most enjoyable voice acting from a narrative voice I've experienced in recent gaming. Not to mention the fun references and pokes to other well known game franchises every 30seconds.\n\nNow why I regretted buying this; it's hollow, and cheap.\nAfter quickly finishing the campaign I grew easily accustomed to the 'horde' race and was eager to try the demon race. Now being a MAN I simply could not continue playing on normal difficulty. So I ramped it hard, beat a few skirmishes, big whoop. Naturally you only want to try for a better challenge, right? So I skipped very hard right into impossible difficulty. And right there, is where it began to show how flawed the game was built. They knew the dungeon managing experience they were setting to make, however the balancing, difficulty, variance in gameplay, that all fell flat on it's face.\n\nFirst of all evert single race operates the EXACT SAME, build treasuries, build relax room (brewery, admiration, F.R.P.), build a mana room, build a trap resources room, build an upgrade room, then smash some camps, get your evil up, and upgrade. Rinse and repeat. Only I could repeat it barely twice per race before becoming numb.\nAND FUSTRATED, because impossible difficulty is well.... IMPOSSIBLE. Literally, I like hard difficulties bordering on the unfair masicism. But it's just not balanced. I couldn't find a single youtube video that showed someone beating this game on impossible. Why? Because impossible is broken. The first half is always fine but as soon as you get swamped with units that disarm your traps, you lose. You, lose. You have no chance fighting 3 times whatever size your army is as a constant stream without your traps.\nLastly let me talk about the races. 'Horde' being probably the most easiest and simple to play as. Demon's being way too ridiculously weak in the beginning to stand any chance above hard difficulty. And then undead which honestly don't add anything new besides the undead theme of rooms and... some units come back when they die?\n\nAnyway.... this game is just so short, vanilla version includes a pitifully short campaign and just two boring races. And when you try to play the game seriously on a difficult that makes you try, it breaks because it wasn't balanced for higher difficulties and maps. It is such an insult when you finish the campaign and open skirmish just to find NO ORIGINAL MAPS. THEY JUST RECYCLE THE CAMPAIGN MAPS.\nIt's fun for the first game you play, but just don't buy it. Play at your unlucky friend's who bought it.\n\nEDIT: Oh I forgot to mention? You better turn on 15min auto save or save yourself every 5minutes. I play on win10 and this game CRASHES EVERY 20minutes guaranteed. It WILL crash on you, and it seems to be a lot more likely to crash the longer you go without saving, ironically.","May 13","false","40.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The only drawback with the game that I have found in my short play time is the lack of creatures in the game. There are only 5 creatures at your disposal (just different skins for Demons and Horde). This is a real disappointment compared to the 12 or so creatures in DK2 as well as the plethora of rooms it had. I love the artwork and sound effects as well as the new item additions for rooms. These were all steps in the right direction, along with the venturing into Hero territory to earn EVILNESS lol. Still though, the game is sorely lacking right now in characters and scenery. These could be very easy additions though so im not giving up hope. An addon, DLC, mods, etc could solve this issue one their own or together. I thuroughly enjoyed my first few hours but once I saw that the 5 creatures and a similar small handful of rooms were all that were at my disposal I was very let down. I quickly jumped into skirmish mode to check that I wasn't worried for no reason, but my suspisions were correct in that I had already seen all that the game had to offer within a few hours. (There are more rooms than creatures but they don't bring more creatures or do anything that much more exciting). There are also only a handful of traps. For a game made 17 years after the last (well this is the one closest to reaching DK2s greatness) there should have been a ridiculous amount of minions, rooms, and traps. More than its predecessor or even approximately the same (within a couple)! But only 5...I really can't repeat that enough. I was having an absolute blast when I hoped in the game a began the path to ABSOLUTE EVIL! It was a big letdown when I saw that it offers maybe a third of DK2s creation content. It's still a lot of fun at first. I can't recommend the game at its current price and with this severe lack of minions and rooms. (Yes the rooms do more...but come on. By todays standards this feels like a smartphone game's worth of content). It is very well done in the amount of things it does, I will say that. The same narrator is back on board and he is hilarious even now. Even with it tapping into that bit of nostalgia perfectly, it was fleeting due to the aformentioned lack of unlocks. This has all the potential in the world but right now I can't recommend it. This really saddens me...feel like I keep repeating myself but 5 minions!? Come on...5!? Wow you can upgrade their armor and weapons and levels. You could do that in 1998. The furniture in the rooms is amazing...but a handful of rooms that half don't unlock anything new? There is really no room for extensive creativity and the lack of MINIONS lol, means that building little plots for rooms is the most eficient way to go. No more sprawling badass dungeons with Black Knights and Bile Demons, Fireflies, Wizrards, Goblins, Imps, Mistresses, Rogues, Salamanders and more!!!!! (Not to mention being able to turn the heros through the torture chamber which was so much fun to collect a few of each of them). Nope, you get an Orc, a Troll, a ...hmmm they aren't very memorable- wait a....NAGA- thats it. A NAGA... and a goblin. Maybe something else. Who gives a ♥♥♥♥. The more I type the more I am saddened that they shortened the most enjoyable aspect of the game for me and many others. Look at any rts/city builder and there are ridiculous amounts of units. Not so here. Kalypso, what were you doing!? You had this beautiful game you created with amazing voice acting and artwork. Wonderful sound effects and a logical, exciting campaign (at first). And then you just kind of stopped. Did you run out of money? 5 more units minimum to make it 10 or so total would have been the bare minimum for any game like this. Any RPG in this day and age has more unit types. Hell even Call of Duty has more unit types. It's because this game is so fantastic with what it has that I am so let down by such a gigantic misstep. A huge non-step? I dunno but they had everything going with this game and then just didn't take it further. They laid all this gorgeous, wonderfully executed groundwork, and then they just stopped. I have got to stop..WTF Kalypso!? You broke my heart! ♥♥♥♥ it, I'll recommend it but get your ♥♥♥♥ together.","April 28, 2015","true","5.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Build your dungeon with all types of different rooms, serving all types of different purposes. There is quite a lot of content in the game, which justifies the steep price for it. It\n's also quite polished and rich. It can get a little boring during the planning stages of the dungeon gameplay part. But nonetheless very amusing.\nWhen youve built an army youll head up to the overworld where good is oh so obviously present. From unicorns to the almost cliché good forces including wood elves, dwarves and knights in shining armor. Visually Dungeons 2 is very satisfying, though it lacks any strategic involvement of you in the RTS style battles. There isnt really any depth in the overworld fighting part. But that doesnt at all weigh out the fun in the dungeons.\nLast, id like to mention the narrator of the game. He also narrates the Stanley Parable. The narration is very funny and often plays a role in the game as big as the gameplay itself. The narrator makes countless references to things like the Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter etc. Also the self conscious humor about fantasy clichés the game uses, and lack of certain mechanics the narrator humorously points out.\n\nIn the end Dungeons 2 is a very amusing game. It isnt at all perfect, but is does what a game should do: show you a nice time. If you like fantasy RTS dungeon managers, this is your game. Dungeons 2 is a very honorable homage to the Dungeon Keeper series.","April 25, 2015","true","7.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Its amusing and it has that generic charm of good vs evil, but its entirely intentional. Second, exploring the overworld while also keeping track of your dungeon adds an interesting dynamic, unfortunatly the gameplay isn't engaging or challenging enough to make it interesting. Just keep orcs in your dungeon and you'll be fine, thats basically the strategy. The game also looks quite good, the design of the dungeon is particularly nice.\n\nUnfortunately for me this is about where the good ends. The sound design leaves a lot to be desired, from the contact hits to the footsteps, to slapping your minions, it all sounds like it was made by a rookie sound team. The rooms aren't varied enough, the enemy and minion design isn't close to varied enough, even in the sandbox mode. I think this game could have been a lot better with more unique minion types and room types.\n\nOverall, I think Dungeons 2 was a nice attempt at a fun Dungeon Keeper cloan, but it falls flat. Even if your a fan of the genre I wouldn't bother picking this up unless it has a serious discount\n\nWorth It In A Bundle or A Deep Discount","February 13","false","1.7"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuntCaseOP/recommended/262280/","FuntCaseOP","Путин","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuntCaseOP/","99 products in account","It's difficult to review a game like this without making reference to the Dungeon Keeper series, since this game is effectively a Dungeon Keeper clone with a twist. It breaks with the classic Dungeon Keeper formula in a few key areas, which is sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worse.\n\nOne aspect of the game I enjoyed the idea of was being able to send your creatures to fight on the overworld, something I always felt was lacking in Dungeon Keeper. In the overworld, the game switches to a more traditional RTS control scheme heavily inspired by Warcraft 3 (a game it makes reference to multiple times; more on this later), but lacking the polish of a proper RTS. This is where I felt the game was lacking - controlling units is clunky, and selecting individual units is difficult (you have to be VERY precise with your mouse clicks and it's hard to tell where your cursor is actually pointed because it's a big fat hand), which is a pain, since most units have active abilities (like Warcraft) which help them and their allies in combat. Overworld combat therefore often degenerated into two blobs of units ramming into each other, with the strongest unit blob emerging victorious.\n\nAnother aspect of the game which I like in principle, but which was flawed in execution, is the ability to choose from two different factions - the Horde (another Warcraft reference) consisting of various green-skinned races, and the Demons (also referred to as 'The Flaming Legion'... yes, they did it again). In terms of mechanics, both factions play quite differently, however, the Demons require more micromanagement, are more difficult to use, and are just not very fun to play with in my opinion, which leaves me coming back to the Horde every time. There have been hints floating around that the devs are planning to bring in the Undead as a third faction. Watch this space.\n\nThe underground aspect of the game plays like a simplified version of Dungeon Keeper. I like that you can now fill in areas of the dungeon you've mined out (so now my obsessive-compulsive tendencies are satisfied by perfectly shaped dungeon rooms and corridors. Researching upgrades is clunky, as you have to go to the appropriate room to do it; research takes places in three different rooms, two of which have multiple sub-menus for research, so it's difficult to tell what's yet to be discovered. Spells are, for the most part, not that interesting or useful.\n\nFor me though, the worst part of the underground game is how easy it is to defeat waves of invaders after around the 15-20 minute mark. The difficulty of the waves doesn't really scale into the late game, and the top tier traps (like the Horde's Red Alert-esque Tesla Coil, and the Demons' giant tentacle) feel a bit redundant. The other thing I dislike about the game is the lack of replay value. Once you've played through the campaign, you've experienced everything the game has to offer. There isn't much strategic choice or flexibility in the game, so once you've figured out a winning formula for building up an epic dungeon from scratch, the game simply consists of following that same formula every time until you have an army big enough to stomp the overworld do-gooders.\n\nIn terms of style, it's clear that the game is made by a German developer, since all rooms have an 'efficiency' rating, and beer is now an important resource that you must ensure a constant supply of, and your breweries are decorated with little Bavarian flags. In contrast to the grim, grainy visuals and dry, dark humour of Dungeon Keeper (hallmarks of its British devs), Dungeons 2 is bright and cartoonish, and its sense of humour is silly in a very Monty Pyhton-eqsue way. Most of the jokes come from the game's narrator, whose voice will be immediately recognisable to anyone who has played The Stanley Parable, which the narrator himself references in one of his many, many, fourth-wall-breaking moments.\n\nThere are also multiple references to many other aspects of nerd popular culture. It's clear the devs are gigantic geeks from the things they make reference to. 80% of the references are related to Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings, I also picked up references to general pop culture (Two of my Nagas were called Kardass'shian and Kanyay'Wst), the Warcraft Universe, Warhammer, Gamergate and The Quinnspiracy, a couple of youtube videos I haven't seen in years (including Trololo and They're Taking the Hobbits to Isengard). I chuckled at a lot of the references, although the relentless Game of Thrones stuff started to get stale.\n\nAll in all, this is a game I would recommend. It certainly brings back feelings of Dungeon Keeper nostalgia and despite being quite formulaic and lacking replay value, you'll get a good couple of dozen hours of fun gameplay out of this game before it starts to get dull. For those who miss the way strategy games used to be, despite all their flaws, Dungeons 2 will fill that gap while it lasts.\n\nNow to move on to War For the Overworld, which I've heard such good things about.","June 22, 2015","true","58.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Must play for Dungeon Keeper fans. Or fans of god mode dungeon play. I recommend waiting for a sale, cause $40 is double what i would play after giving the game a once through.\nPositives:\nSimilar fun to dungeon keeper. Can go outside of your dungeon to wreak havoc against the outside world. Love that addition. 2 different evil groups to play with. multiplayer option. Cool traps. Warcraft like RTS above ground, and classic dungeon keeper underground. Story was amusing. Taken from Game of Thrones with little to some tweaks in storytelling. "Unique" minion/ henchmen naming made me smile. Glad to have had a newer version of dungeon keeper. just with there was more to it.\nNegatives:\nOverpriced IMHO. After finishing the campaign mode of this game, i would probably pay $20 for this game. Added a lot of cool elements to this game, but as far as replay value, I dont think i'd play this game again anytime soon. Not as much enemy interaction as dungeon keeper besides killing. Spell casting is annoying. Cursor calibration is needed. sometimes, the "click box" on something is impossible to get in a second or 2.

This game is actually good.\nAnd it is a huge surprise too, seeing as Dungeons 1 was terrible and expansion only sligthly less so.\nIt is a cool Dungeon Keeper clone, but with it's own ideas and a pretty good execution on those too.\nSurface serves for a more RTS style gameplay (Warcraft 3 comes to mind a lot of times), while dungeons is\na classic building we know from DK and DK2. You can now build rooms of any sizes and fit them with equipment that\nhas various uses, there is research, traps, spells, different creatures - with option to upgrade them to higher tiers.\nOn top of that, there are factions now, which adds to the gameplay. Bored of horde? Go with the daemons.\nThe overall graphic style is ok, nothing too fancy, not as serious as DK (again, Warcraft 3 comes to mind).\nTraps are very effective, but there are classes now that can disarm them to balance them out. Units use their skills automatically in the dungeon, while on the surface you have to use them via icons/shortcuts (again, WC3).\n\nAfter games like Dungeons 1 and Impire, I thought this will be a very bad game, so I was waiting with this game for some time. I think it has a solid 8/10 and is probably the best modern take on the old classics.","January 17","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Similar look and feel to a Dungeon Keeper - it has the similarity of a Dungeon Keeper game, where you carve out your dungeon, and build rooms for your minions, satifying their needs ect. Also I must say that the Graphics nicely detailed, and very colourfull, something that will be very welcome to Dungeon Keeper fans.\n2. Rooms/Units can be upgraded/improved - When yoou build a room, it doesn't just place everything you need, no.... it lets you crate your own room layout, you can reserch new rooms, traps, magic etc, which is really a nice addition, also certain rooms can be used to upgrade and inprove your units, which again is very good, something new and slightly different from Dungeon Keeper.\n3. Animation are very good - The animations on the units and buildings are very good, when you see your imps/servants breaking down the wall's you actuallt see them hit the wall and it looks like they are actually hitting it, the movement animations are also very good, each creature has a distinct animation when it comes to movement, idle, attack etc.\n4. Humour is spot on - I can say enough for the Humour in this game, it's spot on, with silly references, and you can't help but either smile, or laugh, just the right amout of comedy without going to far.\n5. Invading the Human world - What we were promised when we saw the end of Dungeon Keeper 2, the hope that we can send out minions to the human world and invade comes true here, and it is brilliant, you actually see the upperworld morph from a bright colour area into a dark decrepid place, when you take it over, it's awesome to see.\n\nCons....\n1. WAY TO SLOW!!!! - I can say enough about this, it's is a very slow game, unit movement is very slow, and your basic imps/servants that carve out the tunnels, take a long time to break down the wall, the pacinf just feels a little but too slow if you ask me.\n2. Not enough creature variations, when you build your dungeon, you expect loads of different creatures to live in it, and work together.....Nope each dungeon faction gets 5 creaturs each. That's it.... Come on guys, you could only think of that? utterly dissapointed\n3. No Dungeon Vs Dungeon - WHAT??? I can go against another dungeon?? Skirmish is basicly endless mode where you build up your dungeon and take over the Human world Map, and that's it. Huge potential missed for some fantastic online VS mode\n\nIf i have to give a review score it will be a 7/10\n\nAre there more possitives than negatives....yeah there is but there's something about this game that, just misses out on getting a Higher score, sure the good things are Brilliant, and well recieved. But the Negatives do hit it hard. They're important issues that need to be addressed if they want to continue with this, and make more.\n\nI would say if you are a true Dungeon Keeper fan, then you'll enjoy this, but feel like it's missing what it was to be a Dungeon Keeper. A great attempt, but not there just yet.\n\nIf you haven't bought this yet, I would say it's worth it, but only when it is on sale, and not full price. Keep it on your wishlist, and any sales hit this and you're happy to pay for it, go for it, just don't expect Dungeon Keeper 3 just yet. Maybe Dungeons 3 will be what we're looking and hoping for in the future.","January 24","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls may take a bit of getting used to at first but they are easy to master once the player gets the hang of using them. As well as doing missions to conqeur the overworld. You will have to defend and ward off attacks when the overworld good guys try to invade your dungeon. The missions are variable as they get challenging later on in the game as the enemies get stronger. So plan ahead and use tactics will make these missions much easier. The game is great fun to play and the narrator is quite hilarious at times because if you get stuck in the game. He will say some lines to drum up the player to work harder.

I wanted to like it, I really did... but it's just not happening for me.\nNice graphics? Check.\nSnarky moderator? Check.\nDungeon management? Meh...not so much.\n\nThe overworld is a nice touch, but gameplay is painfully slow. It takes forever to build up enough gold to do anything, and even then you're severely limited as to what you can do. Very few rooms, and even fewer minions to be had. And no real freedom. Sure you can turtle-up and take your time building a dungeon, but it's such a slog that you could literally walk away and do something else while waiting on it to happen. Plus, your minions will likely die from sheer boredom.\n\nGranted, I've only spent a few hours in-game, but I can't seem to force myself to play more. That's a bad sign since I still enjoy the playing original DK and DK2.

This game would suck without all this content so thank god there is a good hunk of it here to dig into! It's defiantly the highlight of the whole game. There are two factions to enjoy here and both are unique and have their own speed of progression, play style, unit and room appearances, upgrades and god powers. Each faction has three tiers to go up from starting at tier one with the basics going up to tier three with the most powerful upgrades and units you can get, requiring to do some kind of super evil act to tier up like killing lots of unicorns so it's not just something you can do and toss away you have to earn it, making the tiers feels special and important. Alot of work went into making all this content and it's easy to appreciate since it makes the game last ages if your and upgrade hog like me and simply have to get everything before steam rolling the enemy, it feels great.\n+ Fun gameplay. The game doesn’t expect too much from you most of time, giving you plenty of time to get started and dig in each mission before heroes start attacking your lovely dungeon and distracting you. The over world is a great new feature to this genre, the added RTS is a great distraction and makes the game last way longer then it would without it and makes it truly feel like you’re fighting back and eliminating those nuisance heroes once and for all.\n+ Polished experience. You want a bug free dungeon game that runs fine, hardly crashes, goes pretty smoothly and doesn’t really ever let you down or block its own progress? Then look no further, I could never find a single bug in this game that ever effected gameplay, progression or caused frustration. The only thing it does is start up slowly, that's about it.\n\n\nWhat's not that enjoyable at all:\n- The RTS combat has to be the first thing, as original as it is added to a dungeon builder game it's clear these devs just don't know how to make satisfying RTS gameplay, which is a shame but you can't expect them to when they make dungeon games. The combat is way too simple to be fun or engaging for long, after your first few fights your already over it, then it just becomes a necessity not something you really want to do more of. Unit abilities and the 'god powers' you have to select from generally make a fight quicker by only afew seconds and it's easier to just not use them all, making them kinda irrelevant but it's nice they are there anyway. It's like they are there almost to distract you from the fact the combat is so super bland.\n- Annoying narrator, yea I did put him in the plus section for being quirky but hes also really overdone. Anyone that plays this game will either ignore how naggy he is, not like him for it or just flat out hate him, there is no true in between here he is just that naggy and hand holding your just like, ugh, please just stop nagging me and let me do my thang. I guess if the devs paid for him they are going to use the crap out of him aren't they? And that they did.\n- Ugly graphics choices. Although the graphics style looks great it could have done so much better with another graphics engine that really let all their hard work shine like it should do. The unity engine they are running it on must be freaken old cas the AA options are abysmal, only FXAA as an option should never be a thing, it's not even well done FXAA as it blurs the game to the point all detail and fidelity is lost, it's better without it on but then you have to put up with insane jagged edges everywhere on everything. It will drive you insane if graphics matter to you at all, seriously, it's a real shame.\n- Awful performance. Yep I’m gonna say it, this game runs like ♥♥♥♥, totally and complete ♥♥♥♥. It runs fine at the start where your dungeon is simply a throne room and nothing else but as you inevitably expand, more effects show up on screen, more units, more models, more stuff in general it runs worse and worse to the point where you can barely get over 20-30fps. Anyone that says under 60fps doesn’t effect gameplay doesn’t know what they are talking about or are blind cas under the 50fps mark and a game becomes less responsive and fluid, directly effecting how much you can interact with the game and thus effecting experience, it's that easy. You think turning all the graphics down to low will help too? Pff good luck, it will probably give you another 20 frames max but that’s it, if it runs like crap to begin with it will still run like crap. I have an average computer that most people will have if you’re wondering.\n- Way too easy. The game is abit tricky at first when your units are low levelled, not upgraded and you have few of them, but then when you build a big army and beef them up the game is a total breeze. At mid game there is no longer any intensity or worry your throne room is gonna get destroyed because you can easily call back all your units with one simple spell and stop the enemies anyway. After the start there is no challenge or depth to this game, the enemy waves stay the same as they started and never get hard or frequent enough to give you any concern, even then some well placed traps will kill most of them. A simple difficulty setting for the campaign would have easily fixed this but oh well I guess.\n- Hard to manage your dungeon. It's silly but sometimes you forget where your rooms are and have to keep looking for them... the god powers are binded to really weird keys like k-7, and k-1, what the hell does that even mean? You never know what your workers are actually doing, if they are mining gold for you or not, how much income they are actually making, how to make them bring it in faster, no way to make them prioritize tasks, no way to set different minions to different tasks so they are more effective, nothing. If you want management there is none in this game, you just build a pretty dungeon, build units to run it and watch, yep that’s what you do. Occasionally you'll send combat units out to fight then boom you win. The game is so simple sometimes you swear it was made for kids...\n- Very linear gameplay and  storyline. Your evil, you got killed by heroes, you want revenge... yep that's it. If your looking for storyline then wow you are so in the wrong place, lol. Each missions is pretty straight forward, do the usual, build up your dungeon, steam roll enemies along a super linear path all the way to enemy base and destroy it, boom done, go to next mission, rinse repeat. It's about as interesting to read as it is to play.\n- The game doesn’t take itself, or the fact you are supposed to be evil, seriously at all. This... makes it feel like a kids game most of the time and I’m not a kid so yea. It's pretty clear dungeon games where you being an evil sadistic a-hole ruining what’s supposed to be a happy, perfect world should never a kids game, it should take the evil thing more seriously and make you feel truly evil not like you’re kind of just acting like you are. I think the devs probably got this now... maybe.\n- Multiplayer. What multiplayer?! If you got this game for playing with friends you made a bad buy my friend, the multiplayer is simple and sucky, just play the single player.\n\n\nOverall this is a 6.7 out of 10 for me. I can't recommend it because of all the badly executed mechanics, graphics options and the sheer amount of negatives this game has that are so bad they are easy to point out and explain. Get it on sale, give it a try.","July 1, 2015","false","32.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

It's like they are there almost to distract you from the fact the combat is so super bland.\n- Annoying narrator, yea I did put him in the plus section for being quirky but hes also really overdone. Anyone that plays this game will either ignore how naggy he is, not like him for it or just flat out hate him, there is no true in between here he is just that naggy and hand holding your just like, ugh, please just stop nagging me and let me do my thang. I guess if the devs paid for him they are going to use the crap out of him aren't they? And that they did.\n- Ugly graphics choices. Although the graphics style looks great it could have done so much better with another graphics engine that really let all their hard work shine like it should do. The unity engine they are running it on must be freaken old cas the AA options are abysmal, only FXAA as an option should never be a thing, it's not even well done FXAA as it blurs the game to the point all detail and fidelity is lost, it's better without it on but then you have to put up with insane jagged edges everywhere on everything. It will drive you insane if graphics matter to you at all, seriously, it's a real shame.\n- Awful performance. Yep I’m gonna say it, this game runs like ♥♥♥♥, totally and complete ♥♥♥♥. It runs fine at the start where your dungeon is simply a throne room and nothing else but as you inevitably expand, more effects show up on screen, more units, more models, more stuff in general it runs worse and worse to the point where you can barely get over 20-30fps. Anyone that says under 60fps doesn’t effect gameplay doesn’t know what they are talking about or are blind cas under the 50fps mark and a game becomes less responsive and fluid, directly effecting how much you can interact with the game and thus effecting experience, it's that easy. You think turning all the graphics down to low will help too? Pff good luck, it will probably give you another 20 frames max but that’s it, if it runs like crap to begin with it will still run like crap. I have an average computer that most people will have if you’re wondering.\n- Way too easy. The game is abit tricky at first when your units are low levelled, not upgraded and you have few of them, but then when you build a big army and beef them up the game is a total breeze. At mid game there is no longer any intensity or worry your throne room is gonna get destroyed because you can easily call back all your units with one simple spell and stop the enemies anyway. After the start there is no challenge or depth to this game, the enemy waves stay the same as they started and never get hard or frequent enough to give you any concern, even then some well placed traps will kill most of them. A simple difficulty setting for the campaign would have easily fixed this but oh well I guess.\n- Hard to manage your dungeon. It's silly but sometimes you forget where your rooms are and have to keep looking for them... the god powers are binded to really weird keys like k-7, and k-1, what the hell does that even mean? You never know what your workers are actually doing, if they are mining gold for you or not, how much income they are actually making, how to make them bring it in faster, no way to make them prioritize tasks, no way to set different minions to different tasks so they are more effective, nothing. If you want management there is none in this game, you just build a pretty dungeon, build units to run it and watch, yep that’s what you do. Occasionally you'll send combat units out to fight then boom you win. The game is so simple sometimes you swear it was made for kids...\n- Very linear gameplay and  storyline. Your evil, you got killed by heroes, you want revenge... yep that's it. If your looking for storyline then wow you are so in the wrong place, lol. Each missions is pretty straight forward, do the usual, build up your dungeon, steam roll enemies along a super linear path all the way to enemy base and destroy it, boom done, go to next mission, rinse repeat. It's about as interesting to read as it is to play.\n- The game doesn’t take itself, or the fact you are supposed to be evil, seriously at all. This... makes it feel like a kids game most of the time and I’m not a kid so yea. It's pretty clear dungeon games where you being an evil sadistic a-hole ruining what’s supposed to be a happy, perfect world should never a kids game, it should take the evil thing more seriously and make you feel truly evil not like you’re kind of just acting like you are. I think the devs probably got this now... maybe.\n- Multiplayer. What multiplayer?! If you got this game for playing with friends you made a bad buy my friend, the multiplayer is simple and sucky, just play the single player.\n\n\nOverall this is a 6.7 out of 10 for me. I can't recommend it because of all the badly executed mechanics, graphics options and the sheer amount of negatives this game has that are so bad they are easy to point out and explain. Get it on sale, give it a try.","July 1, 2015","false","32.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

Even better, while the game pays homage to DK, it is not a clone and brings new ideas to the table -- namely, separate RTS gameplay on overworld maps above your dungeon.  Contrary to other reviews are saying, it's not simply a matter of building up your dungeon then zerging the overworld -- you have juggle managing your dungeon whilst simultaneously dealing with overworld objectives.  The slower pace Dungeons 2 provides is welcome when you are herding your cats in two realms at once, trust me.\n\n+ Actually finished, playtested, and polished by designers with the chops to carry it off\n+ Servicable graphics\n+ Tried and true DK gameplay combined with a decent (if simplistic) overland RTS engine\n+ New ideas brought to the DK formula; not just new units and rooms that you wouldn't use anyway.\n+ Challenging scenario design\n\n- UI quibbles, particularly the fact that you have to manually pick up creatures one by one; shifts between interacting between the world (ex. tagging tiles) and clicking on UI elements is trickier than it needs to be\n- "Less is more" design sometimes packs too much functionality into a single room type resulting in having to keypress/click and search through nested selections.  Creature types are similarly overloaded.\n- Some annoying design decisions.  Remember how, in DK1, if creatures wandered in a library the warlocks would blast them, and how evil creatures fought amongst themselves?  Annoying, so Bullfrog removed both in DK2.  In Dungeons 2, "bored" creatures will pick on your imps.\n- A little micro heavy for me, YMMV.\n\n8/10\n","April 25, 2015","true","12.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I played a lot in the original DK/DK2, but not in the new reincarnations, hence my opinion can look biased.\n\nIt's DK, but somehow worse in almost every aspect.\n\nControls.\nThe controls are very inaccurate and not intuitive.\nRemember how you could pick up creatures clicking on their images in the menu? You can not here. Remember how you can select an individual member of a group by clicking theyr icon in almost all RTS? Guess what, you can not in D2. Remember how you can see the level of creatures? Here to see the stats of creature you must pick up it.\nUPD: Player can select a member of group by double-clicking on the icon. Thanks Salz.\n\nThere also few graphical issues: the cursor-hand is too big and inaccurate, the click happens not in the index (which will be logical) but somewhere in the center of the palm.\n\nGameplay.\nThe digging and movement speed of the imps are annoyingly low. It makes the first small tutorial maps very boring. I like the idea that idle creatures decorate dungeon, but It is kind of fun to observe. However the control region if the dungeon heart was removed, you can pick up and drop your creatures everywhere -- it will probably break the balance in skirmish, to test.\nThe limit on the number of creatures is harsh: 15 (probably it will be increased later with some chambers) imps included, that makes me feel undermanned.\nI will not comment the variety of rooms or creatures - I've seen only few, which is expected in the tutorial.\n\nGraphics.\nThe visuals are Warcraft 3 style. Personally I prefer the original dark, depressive of DK,  but it the matter of taste. Images are so generic that I can't really say something, good or bad. The cinematics are better situated for a flesh game, they are not (probably yet) as goofy as in the DK2, but not epic as the  Blizzard ones. They try to be funny, but they overdo, not annoying but close.\n\nScenario and humor.\nUntil now the scenario is the classic DK2/Overlord -- goody destroys evil, evil starts to rebuild conquering the kingdoms.\nBut humor... Humor is just a bunch of references, and it never shuts up. In the second mission, which takes 10-15 minutes I got the diabolical laugh, DK reference, DK mobile reference and few WTF lines.\n\nIn the conclusion, it is not a bad game but it worse than the originals. If you haven't played DK and DK2 than do not take this one. Take the classics, understand why it is great game, and than try this one. If you know the originals almost by heart, than you can try D2.","April 24, 2015","true","19.9"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","1"

I had to re-pickup the Orc and place the hand over the room in a few different directions because i couldn't tell exactly where he would drop, this was more of an annoyance than an issue i suppose.\n\nIssue #2: I really enjoy the narrator-theme-humor, but some objectives are not as easily completed which causes the narrator to constantly repeat the same line over and over again, becomes a bit annoying - specially when the narrator is semi-insulting me for taking my time, again its more of an annoyance than an issue.\n\nIssue #3: The population cap in the first few missions during the campaign really hindered me when it came to progressing my dungeon - I had to sacrifice workers just to build Orcs to defend my dungeon, and then during the naga mission (which i am currently on) I had to go back several times to either sacrifice workers to build more soldiers, or i had to sacrifice soldiers to build more workers, it was a little hindering on progressing, but nonetheless i got through it.\n\nThese so far are my only issues, overall excellent game, I'm a big fan of dungeon management games (I've been playing them since the first dungeonkeeper came out before 2003), I'm very happy about this installment to continue the dungeon-like series, the best part is that it combines RTS with dungeon management.\n\nEDIT: The developers are currently working on all of the issues I've listed here, so props to them and appreciate the hard work they're doing. I sure wish other game developers cared this much about their games.\n\nTL;DR\n\nFrom an avid RTS and Dungeon/resource management gamers point of view, 9.5/10 highly recommended","May 20, 2015","true","3.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","1"

However, keep in mind this is not a AAA title and has an indie feel to it. It feels like Dungeon Keeper 2 with respect to building a lot of traps and the "heroes" invading your dungeon. But, on the same hand it feels like WarCraft III with respect to adventuring to the overworld.\n\nDungeons II has a lot going for it. The Narrator keeps things interesting poking fun at the player and the heroes alike.  The story is a rather generic because the heroes did x to you, you are going to wipe them out. Game mechanics are quite servicable and generally work as expected. Upgrade trees and processes provide enough tool tips to know what you are supposed to be doing the first play through. The creatures are entertaining to watch in battle and roaming around the dungeon as we. Traps work as indicated. Enemies are designed for a casual experience (excellent if you like to enjoy a bit of a challenge with a story).\n\nAs for some of the cons, the game was far too short (in terms of number of missions. There could have been many more missions.

However, keep in mind this is not a AAA title and has an indie feel to it. It feels like Dungeon Keeper 2 with respect to building a lot of traps and the "heroes" invading your dungeon. But, on the same hand it feels like WarCraft III with respect to adventuring to the overworld.\n\nDungeons II has a lot going for it. The Narrator keeps things interesting poking fun at the player and the heroes alike.  The story is a rather generic because the heroes did x to you, you are going to wipe them out. Game mechanics are quite servicable and generally work as expected. Upgrade trees and processes provide enough tool tips to know what you are supposed to be doing the first play through. The creatures are entertaining to watch in battle and roaming around the dungeon as we. Traps work as indicated. Enemies are designed for a casual experience (excellent if you like to enjoy a bit of a challenge with a story).\n\nAs for some of the cons, the game was far too short (in terms of number of missions. There could have been many more missions. I felt that the game was artificially longer due to the way that you get higher level rooms/creatures (upgrading your throne room, then researching rooms, and then having to upgrade your population limit which caps if your throne room is not a high enough level).\n\nAll in all, Dungeons II is an entertaining narrative to play through regardless of its short comings.

Now you might be saying to yourself, "why buy a game that's a copy of an older game," and normally I would be saying that to myself too, but try playing the old game on a current pc. The reality is that, when Dungeons came out, everone started comparing it to the old masterpieces, and mostly unfavorably. Kalipso seems to have taken the hint, swallowed some pride, and went all out to bring the fun of Dungeon Keeper back to life with a full slate of new and challenging features into the bargain. They had big shoes to fill; we look back at the old games of the good old days, and they seem to have a golden sheen. I believe they actually had to move to a bigger size for this one. The humor is just as good, factoring in the slight nod they've given to a somewhat younger crowd (16 vs. 18 or 21, depending on how prudish you may be), and the style is familiar without being exactly the same. Fighting across different maps makes it challanging and new. They involve the world in the gameplay in ways that DK never could have, and the cute vs. darkish tension makes me laugh, and maybe you too. I look forward to DLC and see hours of playing this in the future. It's just a good time.","June 10, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However once you get to the mission that unlocks the poulation cap increases it becomes much more managable.\n\nThe outdoors portion brings a refreshing feature to the game. In most missions you have the ability to stop the adventurers before they even reach your dungeon. However it also brings more risk because you can unlock more enterances into your dungeon from outdoors and expanding underground. For those who played Impire the outdoor portion of this game is way beyond watching a timer.\n\nThe narrator can be both funny and annoying. Having a narrator tell your story as you progress is an interesting new twist. However it quickly becomes annoying if you are not progressing on your mission fast enough.\n\nHave not played multiplayer or a skirmish yet, but from what I have seen those features should bring more replayability to the game. Campaign replayability not so much those first four campaign missions are a pain enough to not want to replay them.\n","April 24, 2015","true","53.0"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","0"

The UI is not intuitive at all.  The maximum zoom seems like it is designed for a 640x480 screen.  It should be much further out.  Regarding the maps, the game provides 2 maps, one for overworld and one for underworld (which is great).  However, then there are alternate maps that must be frequently interacted with that do not have a "map" that can be quickly cliked on.  Add in a regrowing fog of war, and its too much to handle.  I played a short time, but it was a short, frustrating time, and games certainly should not be frustrating.\n\nNote, this review was when the game and DLC was 75% off.

I decided to take the plunge and I can honestly say it is well worth the money.\n\nThis game comes across as a well polished title overall and despite some people having performance problems, for me I can report that it runs very smooth and have yet to experience a lockup or crash with graphics maxed out. This on an i7-920;  HD7970; 12 GB RAM running Windows 7 64 bit.\n\nGraphics while they come across as cartoonish, World of Warcraft comes to mind, are very detailed especially when zoomed in, however you will probably be playing the majority of the game zoomed all the way out. When zoomed in your floating hand (cursor) practically fills up the majority of the viewing space anyway. However at any level watching your little minions go about their tasks setting up traps, mining gold, brewing beer, researching tech and especially those who when left idle will take it upon themselves to sure-up and improve the walls in your dungeon, is quite enjoyable and well done.\n\nGameplay is fun overall and building your dungeon and setting traps for any would be hero who decides to try and steal your gold is done quite well. The top side RTS type of game is not very in depth however you still have units with special abilities etc. and overall had the surface content not been implemented this game would definitely feel as if it was lacking something.\n\nThe humor displayed by the narrator is great and while it may break immersion at times this game is meant to be fun and if you're without a sense of humor perhaps this isn't the right game for you. I do agree with some people in that it can be a bit "too" cheerful and I would like to see more decorations befitting a true evil dungeon (skulls, chains, head on a stick etc.). Also the addition of an auto-save function would definitely be something that needs to be implemented. Despite being bug free for me had I had a crash or lockup I could have lost 2+ hours of a game by the time I realized I had been playing for so long (a positive sign lol) and decided to save on my own. There does not appear to be a map editor and skirmish play is limited to maps that shipped with the game. No randomly generated ones.\n\nIn conclusion despite my limited play time I can say I already have no regrets in making this purchase and as a complete noob to this genre I couldn't be happier. Highly recommend this one to anyone on the fence about making the purchase. That goes for fans and newcomers alike.","April 25, 2015","true","28.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

However, like many of the other reviews, i'm disappointed in the lack of content for the price of this game. After you play through the campaign of a RTS game, what do you do? Usually head over to multiplayer. This is what I did with a friend, only to find out that there is no AI support so we have to play against eachother. Other than finding two other random people, there is no way for us to be in the same team and start a game. It's so disappointing that AI has not been added in and that has pretty much ruined the game for my friend and I.\n\nThe gameplay is great and I love the idea of having two "worlds" to control - your base back underground, and the battlefield in the overground. Being able to create your own rooms and populate them with workers creates a great sense of customization within your base.\n\nIf you enjoy single-player RTS-like games then I would recommend it, however the campaign is not gigantic and as others have stated it takes only between 15-20 hours to complete, then you're stuck for choice on how to carry on.\n\nIf you and a friend are looking to play this together, do not purchase this game.","May 12, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There is very little replay value, and the single player campaign takes maybe 5 hours to complete.  While it looks like I have 24 hours played now, 15 of those hours are setting at the "Match Making" screen waiting for the non-existent multiplayer aspect to kick in.  The single player campaign has a neat narrator, but again, it's very, very short.\n\nMultiplayer is plagued by terrible design.  There's no lobby selection.  If you want to "Join a Game" you have to somehow magically know the "Game ID."  It doesn't show a list of available lobbies.  It's like match-making circa 1996 when you needed a third party application like GameSpy to connect to anything.  There is "QuickMatch" and by "quick" they make 5-miutes to 10+ hours.  I literally sat in a "quick match" queue for over 10-hours once.\n\nSo basically, they game is 5 hours long, and there is no viable multiplayer.  I've managed to play 3 games, and one of them I spent about 40 minutes building before I invaded his dungeon and realized the other player was AFK the whole time.  Likely because he had fallen asleep after being in "Quick Match" queue for some long.\n\nShort story:  Needs more single player content.  Needs match making technology from this millenium.  Matchmaking technology equivalent to cutting edge 1990s games, might as well support IPX for LAN play.","May 12, 2015","false","44.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But the real reason this isn't getting a recommendation is because the normal faction isn't much better. Your minions are so slow and so needy that by the time they go and grab their pay they're thirsty and so then they go get a drink and then they slowly make their way back to work where then it is once again payday and the cycle begins anew.

If you are a fan of the Dungeon Keeper series and are in the mood for something a bit more light-hearted, this might be the game to try.\n\nThere are two main aspects to this game: dungeon management and RTS. The RTS element is a welcome addition, although it is somewhat simplistic.\n\nWhat this game lacks in depth, it makes up for in style and charm. The art style is delightful. The narrator practically bombards you with amusing pop culture references.\n\nThe single player campaign will last you around 15 hours. With that in mind, I'm not sure it's worth the full asking price, but definitely consider this game if you see it on sale with a decent discount.\n\nPlease note that this recommendation does not extend to this game's predecessor - Kalypso's Dungeons.

You are not allowed to take your time building your dungeon without the anrrator commenting on it in a really annoying way.\n\nSo all in all - at first glance, the game brings some great new elements to the genre, but those element are not enough to make up for an otherwise throughoutly annoying game.","December 1, 2015","false","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was wondering why this only had an average score of 7 but not anymore.\n\nAfter the campaign dries up the skirmish mode that is left is really lackluster.  So lackluster that it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth and after another failed attempt made me salty enough to write this review.\n\nyou expect a sandbox-like mode that lets you tinker around and build a dungeon but unfortunately you never get the chance to build with the overzealous waves of ever-hardening enemies that plague your dungeon every 5 minutes.  Ive played 6 skirmishes now and havent made it 45 minutes on normal difficulty (the lowest) after having zero problems with the campaign.  There is no way to lower difficulty further or to decrease wave spawns (in fact some skirmish maps start spawning from 2 bases if you eliminate one to try to give yourself some breathing room.)  Unfortunately again, there is no steam workshop for this so no user-created tweaks and google searches havent provided any mods or tweaks for the game either.  Im a casual gamer.  I dont play to get stressed out or feel rushed or anything like that and I wish there were a lower difficulty for people like me that just want to blow some time and build a dungeon.\n\ncampaign mode is a good 8.5/10, Ill probably end up buying the campaign expansion if I ever see it around 5 bucks.  the skirmish mode (which would provide many more hours of entertainment than the campaign if done right) is a soft 5/10.   The fact that it doesnt have workshop or modding support is dumb as well and I wont recommend a game that doesnt encourage user content.","January 24","false","26.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My only annoyance with this game is that it's zoomed in too close without the ability to pan out.

I enjoyed every moment of this game as even though it is more simplistic than Dungeon Keeper 2, the mechanics work well and with two seporate campaigns it's quite interesting, but the annoying this is that there aren't that many. There are still MANY hours you can replay the missions. I felt it was a little short, however it was still very enjoyable with the same narrator from the Stanley Parable doing his thing and the many different comical references like the "Bloody Wedding" mission with so much Game of Thrones references as well as several other moments, including the Narrator making fun of the heroes dying, you when you fail a mission and even himself at times.\n\nI'd highly recommend this to anyone who's a Dungeon Keeper 2 as they do some new things, but it's a lot more fun. Sadly you can't capture heroes to toture or turn to your side or use their bodies to create new units like vampires, but it's a awful lot of fun.\n\nOne of the major issues is that unlike DK2 or War for the Overworld, the animations are very slow. Especially when digging without upgrades (though you can speed them up with a slap. However, unlike the aformentioned games, you don't have to claim squares to start building and can do so immediately. You can also buy the production items to place into the room so they need to be larger for more items so it doesn't matter what shape the room is, as long as it's big enough for the items in question.","July 8, 2015","true","26.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

The "campaign" is a long ♥♥♥ tutorial that ends when the cheesy story ends. The graphics and dialouge cannot decide if it wants to be campy, funny, dark, or terrible for the sake of being terrible. It is for sure immersion breaking. When you accomplish a task it doesn't feel like you did because the narrator has berated you to finish it and the rewards you get are more tutorials.\n\nBesides the campaign being god awful, the dungeon management is terrible. Digging is the only thing that can be done with ease. Managing you minion pool requires picking them up and dragging them around with the bulky "cursor". The 45th time you accidentally grab a barrel of beer instead of a minion or click on a room you'll curse so loud your neighbor will pound on the wall. There is no list of your minions and everything about managing them is clumsy. Picking them up  or giving them books, to upgrade them, is enraging as they hustle about. There is no pause function to easily grab anything or to take a closer look at any dangers.\n\nThe 3 traps make for a terrible tower defense aspect of the dungeon management genre. The rooms allow you to stockpile whatever you want with ease and with no challenge. Upgrading random aspects of your minions is of no consequence and unlocking useless spell after spell is pointless as (that work only half the time and only in specific places btw) you have to cast them with the clumsy cursor. It doesn't require any strategy here, you can complete any mission by ammassing gold and mana and sending a horde of minions to roll over everything. Make a couple trap rooms filled with explosive treasure chests and you're safe as well!\n\nThis brings us to the overworld where it turns into a terrible RTS game instead of a dungeon management game. There is no way to select your minions by type or any other way than a click and drag box group or by singularly clicking them, making their skills useless as trying to click them (with the clumsy cursor) in the heat of battle is more trouble than it's worth. Send a bunch of minions up by taking 5 minutes to grab and drag them to the exit (which is a fun and engaging game mechanic), selecting them all and sending them on their way to pummel everything in sight is how this part works.\n\nThere is no reason for this game to cost 40$, if the publisher says anything about how they'll handle this game there will be many tiny DLC released with single units or missions that might flesh it out but I won't pay a single more red cent for this abomination.\n\nHow this got good reviews anywhere was either by pay offs or them not paying any attention to what they were playing. Do not get this game, it is the kind of game you'd get in a bundle, not something worth this price tag.","May 5, 2015","false","14.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I liked the old dungeon keeper-like gameplay, such as building rooms, making traps and looking after minions. However, there are a lot of problems with the game, chief among which are the bugs- this game CTD's like no other I've played. Every ten minutes or so in the campaign, it would crash, to the point where I almost gave up altogether.\n\nThere are more problems. The campaign itself is too short, the time taken to mine  anything	 is tedious to the point of ridiculousness, you only get 5 types of minions per faction (which admittedly can be specialised into 2 further types, but I would have liked more), and the overworld RTS is basic and awkward to get through. The most annoying part of this game, however, is the humour- dated, obnoxious, groanworthy, and all personified in the intrusive and completely irritating commentator.\n\nThere are some nice ideas, but they do seem ill-thought out and underdeveloped.

The theme and graphics are what you'd expect.  Unfortunately, that's where my good experience stops.\n\nSo many issues . . .\n\nFirst off, I was able to beat the entire campaign in 25 hours, and that was with a lot of dithering around and trying to figure out some elements of the interface.  I would not be at all surprised if folks finished up in 12 hours.  For a game like this, I certainly expect a lot more than 20 hours of gameplay in the campaign.\n\nThe interface.  Don't get me wrong, the interface itself is fairly easy to come to grips with, but mechanically, the interface doesn't do a good job at all of communicating what it is happening.  For instance, your minions can get upset with you and go on strike . . . ok, fine, it's not a new mechanic in this genre.  But . . . why are they on strike?  I can't click on them, they just stand there.  Just one example.  Upgrading units is another real trial.\n\nThe challenge level is the worst offender however.  The game is just dead easy.  I remember having to really rush to keep up in Dungeon Keeper.  I always felt like I was just on the verge on falling behind and being run over.  Not an issue here.  Take all the time you like, and when you feel like the entire deck is stacked in your favor, attack.  Attack falls apart?  No problem.  Just revive your troops and try again.\n\nThere are so many problems with this game, a game I really, really, really want to like.  The game has the appearance on the surface of being exactly what folks would want in a game like this.  It just doesn't deliver.  Had I spent $5.00 on it, yea, ok, I'd be like, cool.

Upgrade your dungeon and units and conquer the overworld. The mechanics and atmosphere are great.

Also, there's a ton of input lag and the cursor is very unresponsive and hard to use. Unfortunately these flaws make the game as a whole not fun to play.

The game itself is enjoyable, but is it $40 enjoyable when there are at least 2 other games similar on Steam with more content and a cheaper price point that are just as fun.\n\nThe price point is already steep, and now they are coming out with DLCs you have to pay for, and the DLCS include very basic things like new maps, and maybe a new enemy or two. $3.99 per DLC, on top of the $40 price tag of the original game? Seriously? The primary game lacks so much that I could understand if it was $15, but $40....way overpriced and lack of content.\n\nEnjoyable game although the narrator gets annoying after awhile as you start hearing him repeat the same things over and over. The game itself is a bit easy, but can be challenging at times as waves of mobs come in from 3 different directions. They have traps to help defeat the waves of enemies, and unfortunately from a players persepctive the traps most of the time if setup properly will defeat any wave that comes in after you. This without even having to upgrade the traps to level 2 or 3, just another point on why this game is a little to easy.\n\n15.7 Hours on record and I basically beat the game, most of that time I was dragging it out by seeing I could mine every mineable rock, etc. The game just seems to be lacking that few extra little things to make it go from an ok fun game to a great fantastic game. I don't know if its more characters needed, more depth of what you can do, less hand holding or what...but its missing something.\n\nI'd recommend getting this game when its on sale.

Put it simply this is Dungeon Keeper for dummies. The makers basically removed everything that would make this a Rate-R game and replaced it by prepubescent humor to keep their PG-13 rating. The narrator is as annoying as a preschool teacher. His daddy jokes and incessant picking is a big minus.\n\nAside from the presentation, there are many game issues. First the units are as dumb as a bag of hammers. You can't have units that exclusively mine or produce beer in Dungeons 2, if you place a number of traps or doors they all drop their tools and all rush to place them. There is no control whatsoever on what they do other than not lining up the tasks for them. Slapping units is completely useless and just another tasteless prop as it yields no reaction. That would just be bad for the game's rating.\n\nSpeaking of props, I could have played this without the most annoying hand cursor I've ever seen in a game. It's impossible to grab or drop anything with precision with it. It's a shiny bath toy. Second, you can't actually rotate the camera in Dungeons 2!!! Guess that wasn't a good feature enough for them to concentrate on.\n\nThey had to focus on an absolutely corny campaign which is lifted straight from World of Warcraft down to the race's names and present it as if it was any original. It is not. A few hours into this game and I already feel like I've wasted enough by brain cells.\n\nOne positive, they mashed the RTS genre with the game decently, however crowd control is nearly impossible. You'll never handle more than ~4 units at the same time. It's a challenge to  have a healer heal the unit closest to death. No worries however, the game will never allow you to have much more units than that. Max population seems to be fixed to avoid further technical failures.\n\nOnce more all units are as dumb as they could be and this game is one of the dumbest I have in my library.","May 3","false","7.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

When I first saw a trailer of Dungeons 2 I thought "Oh, this could be good!" It seemed like Orcs Must Die, with it's dungeon defense, trap building, and mildly entertaining meta-dialogue, but with an RTS aspect as well. As an idea it had a lot of potential but I feel that the developers missed the mark in almost every way. The disconnection between dungeon and the overworld, the control scheme and not being sure where the evil hand is pointing, the confusing and badly designed minion organization in dungeon, with underwhelming overworld combat in comparison, and the limited variety of minions and rooms took a lot out of the game for me. It's been months since it was released and they've had a few updates which have only helped a little. In all, Dungeons 2 was a real dissapointment to me and it doesn't seem to be getting any better any time soon.","December 30, 2015","false","21.2"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

Not worth over 5$.\n\nAlright to start off I have played Dungeons 1 and the special steam eddition one.\nI should have known after the special edition that it would not be a good game but I tried to believe\nin Kalypso. Yeah that didn't work too well.\n\nSo let's talk graphics. They are pretty decent. The landscape changes as you take certain areas in the overworld and that can seem cool for most people. However, if you do not have a good computer it will be terribly laggy when things like this happen.\n\nMinions. The minions are.. alright? I can't find the exact words to use to describe them. They need more diversity. In the original Dungeon they had quite a few interesting minions that actually had decent consepts that simply needed to be refined and expanded. There is an enchantment system where you can give a buff to your minions but the buff tends to rarely be worth anything. Even if it is worth a little something there is no heavy effect on gameplay that would make you want to search for them.\n\nConcept. The concept of sending your minons to the surface is an interesting idea but VERY poorly executed. The positioning of the characters is terrible. There is very little you can do to organize your minions and organize them for battle. You are more or less throwing them at the enemies hoping for the best.\n\nComparison. We can compare this to a lot of Dungeon Keeper similar games but let's compare it to the ones that stand out the most. The Original Dungeon. This was what got me so into the game series. Retaking your throne from your crazy girlfriend and having tons of challenges and boss fights up to that point? It was quite a few hours of fun and while the replay value wasn't much it had a lot that could be polished. It got me looking forward to the sequals. Dungeons 2 is nothing like Dungeons. It feels more aimed at children with its very cartoonish feel. It is less dark than Dungeons 1. The Overlord or main character from Dungeons 1 is.. well gone. It may have something to do with the steam special which admitibly I didn't finish because it made me cringe with all its Lord of the Rings references and terrible gameplay. However, it is just not the sequal you'd expect at all. It feels like a new choppy game.\nDungeon Keeper. The god of dungeon games. A lot of people think most games can't hold a damned candle to it and they would be right in my opinion but you have to give other games a chance. The style for most of these games was obviously taken from this then pardon my language but it is as though someone took a big steaming ♥♥♥♥ on it. I have yet to see a decent revamped version of it and Dungeons 2 is no acception.\n\nBut I'm rambling! Overall, the point of this is that the gameplay is not even close to worth 10$ on sale MUCH LESS 40$. You'd have to have very poor taste to enjoy this game.","December 28, 2015","false","7.4"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

You'll be curiously interrupted mid-stride by the narrator, your head held high, streaming shadows from every pore in your skin, all stoic-like, your orcs' axes about to swing the felling blow...to hear that you should buy another game that isn't this one, the one you're playing right now, the one you pre-ordered, the one in which you are right now wreaking havoc and recording over goodie's mix tapes whilst incorrectly pressing their pantaloons.\n\nIt says buy more kalypso games...if that's not an advertizement, I don't know what is...\n\nExhibit A: Searching ad images online, you get:\n\n"Beat the system. Buy a Volvo."\n"Buy the Wall Street Journal"\n"Buy insurance and keep calm" (GEICO gecko image, brand recognition)\n[Insert lots of company names] Buy now." (These are ads not images for buttons, by the way.)\n\nEtc.\n\nThat's right, I bought your game, gave you my hard-earned coinage, so don't come bursting through my 4th wall like the Kool-aid man; no matter how passively you do your in-game advertizing, no matter how "just right," - it will be inevitably wrong.\n\nEdit: Developers worked with me in terms of feedback and asking what the middleground was. I'm still not pleased with it being there but - to their great credit - they did do the work to not just mute the entire narrator but to pull certain forms of cheeky bits and nuisances as well. I like all those bits...just not this one piece, so I have to lose to gain.\n\n2) Now, this next one is relatively excusable, however frustrating, given the game just released. It's this "Lost connection to server" error which drops the game and anything between now and the last save. Last ~3 hours of gameplay saw this happen 3 times with ~45 minutes of gameplay lost, at least. So, there's your caveat if you're not bothered by this other smeg.\n\nEdit: July 4th, 2015 - Still an issue. Seems to be tangibly correlated to wealth acquisition which the engine simply can't handle when coupled with all the miscellaneous bits being produced in the brewery and workshop when combined with large treasure troves. Yes I could simply not do any buildup and charge the enemy but that seems to make that little pleasure of aggrandizement a moot one, yes?\n\n\n3) Sign in/up screen every time you start the game. See store page for "Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Kalypso Launcher (Account registration optional)"\n\nYeah, you can click to skip because it is supposedly optional, but why should I have to click to skip, each and every time? Yes you can skip it, but I just want to play the game; beam me up scotty - don't make me WALK up a light beam to the Enterprise.\n\nI mean, without an option to make the optional screen optional, then it seems I'm out of options, aren't I? Hmph.(mindblown)\n\n\nAnalysis:\nIf you don't mind being pulled out of immersion to be advertized to in that "Satire being what it satirizes is no longer satire but reality." kind of way, if you don't mind random losses of gameplay, and if you don't mind a not-so-optional-because-it-lacks-an-option-to-be-optional optional sign in/up screen, then grab a fistful of legal tender and drop it in their Treasure hole to get this party started.\n\nOtherwise, step back, and give them some time to swat some snots and drop the patches out to get rid of commercial time and the reminiscent-of-my-little-brother-being-a-jackass-in-the-pool splash screen, leaving me with a similar, but metaphorical, searing chlorine eye sheen.\n\nDone.\n\nNow then, if you remove said splash screen and in-game advertizing from the narrator, then I will happily spin me right round - like a record baby - and give this review the shoe, turning my philosophical frown upside down and recommending it straight away.\n\nEdit: And I have, as promised :) It's a reasonable go between, at least.\n\nI'll recommend it with the above caveats, that is. If you aren't bothered, then the rest is a pleasant and comedic game that is aware of the industry within which it resides.","April 24, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","78"

Tier I-II-III. I was happy to see that its not just a stat boost and each upgrade makes a different unit. For example, the horde has the naga unit. At tier I its an archer, at tier II its a healer, and at tier III it has a stunning magic attack. Worth noting that if you upgrade a tier II naga to a tier III one, it will loses its healing role. So over all, both factions has 12 units total + imps\n+Just as many hero types for the enemy\n+Unit cap is pretty good over all so you dont have to be afraid of not be able to have enough monsters.\n+Your units can have titles to get different stat boosts\n+big enough maps\n+units lvl up\n+good graphics\n-no random map generator\n-no dark hero unit like the horned demon was in DK2\n-game on normal is really easy\n-only 2 factions.

I'm looking forward for another DLC or if it happens an expansion!\nSome minor performance issues I encountered was the FPS dropping on late stages of the game but so far it's playable it could be better though. When FPS  drops to a minimum. Clicking/Picking up units to defend can be hard because of the FPS dropping when panning.\n\nSome life improvements I would love to see is the AI improvements  for the alarm horn. If youre troops are weak they can be decimated because they can be unorganized. They usually attack from different angles and different time depending on where they are. Although It may seem like the alarm horn is for late game where your units are high level.\n\nI definitely recommend this game if you like playing Dungeon/RTS games.

But given that it is now on sale I might as well get my first thoughts out as I disagree with some of the negative ratings received by the game.\n\nThis is a *little* and *charming* game. From what I have seen so far, worth the $20 I payed for it. I never played Dungeon Keeper so I don't have that point of reference but I played the Majesty 2 game so I felt right at home with setting tasks to the units rather than directly teling them what to do (as you would in a game like Starcraft). Here you point to a location and indicate you want to mine its gold and the game engine will assign workers to mine the gold. If you want units to fight a monster you pick them up and drop them near the monster. Once they recover from the fall they will attack nearby enemies. So the units are sort of autonomous and you have indirect control. You concentrate on improving your economy, hire units, discover locations (by sending workers to mine rocks), place traps, drop units near enemies.\n\nThe game holds your hand by having a narrator telling what to do. It is not particularly funny but I don't think it is intended to be funny. It is intended to hammer the message set when you see the intro movie: the game doesn't take itself too seriously. You will not be pulling your hair trying to figure out what to do next here. The narrator tells you. I like that sort of game.\n\nWould the game be worth $40? I do not know. When I finish the campaing and when/if I get around to update the review, I will tell you. For now I can say that  for $20 it is totally worth it.","August 15, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which wilst being a bit of nusance is worth tolerating for that game itself.\n\nI picked it up on offer and it was worth every penny. The instability would have iurked greatly if I had payed full price, however this could be something specific with my system as it doesnt seem a common problem, but it is worth a mention.\n\nVerdict:\nDK gameplay with a healthy dose of RTS style pixie bashing, a sarcastic and entertaining narrator and a lot of rampaging evil goodness!\n\nIt has room to grow, or in other words feels like it needs some DLC to add extra rooms and some other features that were found in DK (and hopefully some more new ideas, as the originality shown here has great promise).","January 8","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would NOT suggest paying any more than that for it though. It just isn't worth the $40 pricepoint of an A class game.\n\nI intend to exercise my rights to a steam refund on this one even though it was only $10.

Tier I-II-III. I was happy to see that its not just a stat boost and each upgrade makes a different unit. For example, the horde has the naga unit. At tier I its an archer, at tier II its a healer, and at tier III it has a stunning magic attack. Worth noting that if you upgrade a tier II naga to a tier III one, it will loses its healing role. So over all, both factions has 12 units total + imps\n+Just as many hero types for the enemy\n+Unit cap is pretty good over all so you dont have to be afraid of not be able to have enough monsters.\n+Your units can have titles to get different stat boosts\n+big enough maps\n+units lvl up\n+good graphics\n-no random map generator\n-no dark hero unit like the horned demon was in DK2\n-game on normal is really easy\n-only 2 factions.

When FPS  drops to a minimum. Clicking/Picking up units to defend can be hard because of the FPS dropping when panning.\n\nSome life improvements I would love to see is the AI improvements  for the alarm horn. If youre troops are weak they can be decimated because they can be unorganized. They usually attack from different angles and different time depending on where they are.

More control over dungeon baddies and a rudimentary RTS mode on the surface added a new look to a solid game that gave a solid 20 hours of gameplay.\n\nIt was short lived, however, as the game lacks staying power. There are no difficulty settings and a lack of Custom Gameplay left me feeling a little "Meh" at the end of an otherwise enjoyable gaming experience. It felt like right when I started to enjoy the game, it was all over, leaving the game itself to feel like a 20 hour tutorial rahter than a full game.\n\nA solid bargain for $10 or less, and worth bumping up to $20 for all the DLC, but like so many other games, this game is enjoyable and almost reaches a level of perfection to make it really noteworthy, but falls just short by not having those finishes touches after End Game.\n\nReminiscent of an old classic called "DragonShard" wih the Dungeons feel they established in the last 2 renditions.\n\nThe shameless reference to other RPGs as a vehicle to patch up a bare bones story didn't win it any style points, but if they put the time and effort into developing this basic structure into a more sophisticated and well-rounded game with more diversified long-term options and a few more play modes, Dungeons III could be a really solid game.\n\nBut not with the writing they have employed, and definitely not without more hours of game play incorporated into the experience.","February 16","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the times is much better just to move your units to where the invaders are comming; or just build 1 or 2 trap rooms with lvl 1 traps, and thas enough to kill massive invader hords (using spider nests, for instance)\n+ The interface could be improved, for instace, when you have to select 30 units in your dung; you gotta pick them one by one and drop them one by one, that is boring sometimes...\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf the game is at last with 25% discount it is worth!

While not as elegant as a mainstream, big name RTS, it is more than serviceable and provides a nice addition to the game, as well as additional tactical situations.\n\nThere are two factions you can select from- a familiar, wacky feeling pile of goblins, orcs and the like, or a darker pack of demons.  While playing somewhat similar in a broad sense, they differ in enough ways to impact dungeon planning and creature selection.\n\nThis is a very solid, enjoyable game, and worth every penny.","June 23, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've had the game crash once, but I was able to just relauch it and it was fine. You just have to let it load fully before you click anything.\n\nAs for it not being fun, I disagree completely. The people who say it isn't fun don't like a slow-paced rts, which is what this is. You have to manage your resources, slowly build up your defences and army, and then go on the offensive. It will probably take a few offensive attacks to win the mission, but you'll get there. It's very chill and pretty laid back once you get the hang of it, and they have a funny narrator that says pretty funny references to other popular games and books of the same human vs orc theme.\n\nIn the end, if you're looking for a slow-paced game that will take A LOT of time but is very enjoyable and relaxed with a funny joke here and there, this is a great game for you.\n\nThen only bad thing I'd have to say is without the DLC, there is a lack of content. I might have 13+ hours played, but that's just on a 8 or so mission campaign and i'm on the last mission.

Go buy dungeon keeper 2. This is not dungeon keeper 2 but this is a very fun game to play.\n\n\nSo the pro's.\nThe game is genuinly fun i had a blast playing it. Yes there is a campaign and the narrator willkeep informing you about that if you daddle around too long but you can take all the time you want to build up your dungeon and troops and place some defences if you desire so,\nI personally like the narrator's humor. The closer you get to the end the more insulting he gets.\nI also like the style of graphics, yes it is cartoonish but i like that style.\n\nThere are however a few things that are a bit annoying at times.\nMostly the loading times. It takes ages to start a new level.\nAnd maybe this was just me but in the later levels for some strange reason sometimes units just get stuck in one place while they are in the overworld. For some reason they do not understand that they can walk around a tree or a fox or whatever it is that is in theyre way but they just stand there and do nothing.\nNeither of these con's are so bad that they break the game in my opinion.\n\nIn conclusion i give this game a big thumbs up and do hope that the guys and girls that worked on this game are planning to make another one cuz i really enjoyed myself it was a blast. So a big thank you to the developers of this game en keep up the good work.\n\n\n\n","June 22, 2015","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
