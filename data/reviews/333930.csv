Angry Joe's Argument #1: You need a get a high-end loadout card to do good.\nCounterpoint: The cards you get aren't game breaking at all. They simply offer sidegrades to the default weapons. I've never lost a gunfight because the other person had a better card than my lead (lowest grade) Skyhammer card!\n\n2. Angry Joe's Argument #2: To get the best cards, you need to spend $55.\nCounterpoint: I'm just gonna quote TotalBiscuit's counterargument: "You can buy any loadout [card] in the game for ingame credits no problem." Not to mention Angry Joe's friend who was present during the video told him not to spend the $55. It was entirely unnecessary. The game never pressures you to spend a dime. The only way I'd feel pressured to spend real money is if they put in a skin that gives the overly masculine Skyhammer a super cute pink ballerina outfit (please!).\n\n3. Angry Joe's Argument #3: To get the best cards, if you don't want to spend $55, you have to grind for hours to get enough to buy the card.\nCounterpoint: Again, quoting TotalBiscuit: "Grind? You play the game, thats the point of games right, to play them? Progression is something that happens as you play, its not the goal, the goal is to win."\n\n4. Angry Joe's Argument #4: The card system is based on RNG and it's a terrible system.\nCounterpoint: So basically the card system is that you get cards from cases (that you get from winning games or using 2 games worth of in game currency to buy -- and no, they don't require $2.49 to open like CS:GO cases! <3) that determines your mercenaries' weapons, camo outfit, and perks. The card you get is completely random, and the weapons are usually just preference since they're all on par with the default weapons. Angry Joe's anger stemmed from the fact that he opened a ton of these cases and got, in his mind, horrible cards. I personally think it's a great thing that someone can put $55 into this game and NOT get the most perfect card ever (even though there isn't "best" card for any merc).\n\nI hope I could clear things up for you Angry Joe fans who are looking to get into Dirty Bomb.","June 22, 2015","true","153.0"," 3,969 of 4,557 people (87%) found this review helpful 378 people found this review funny","87","969","4","378","166"

If you were to personally ask me what P2W is, I'd say, "Games with weapons or unlockables (Generally ones that give you an advantage or are just overpowered) not obtainable through playing the game for free, instead using real world money to unlock it."\n\nTL;DR: Everything above Bronze in loadouts is cosmetic. Characters rotate to play for free every week.\n\nHow this game works is entirely different, you get loadout cards, now while you might think, "Oh, well that must mean that everything Silver and Gold is better than things that are Bronze." This is not correct, every card above Bronze simply works as a form of cosmetic.\nOn the other hand you have people that would say, "Getting a Bronze card would mean you have way too many advantages over players that don't." This is also not true, as the bronze cards simply give you perks on the side that give you small boosts, no gun damage, health (Except for one perk that gives you up to 30 health for dying multiple times) or other character attributes altered with cards.\n\nNow with these loadout cards, you also get different weapons. These weapons on the loadout cards will change how you play your character. By default you have good loadouts, you can destroy anybody with the basic loadouts so long as you can aim, your guns make you, not your perks. You can get a different gun for every rarity of loadout, even the worst rarities come with guns that can change how you play by alot, but for the most part all the guns are reletively balanced.\n\nNext comes the whole RNG thing that people get very angry at because they can't find good things in cases. 1000 ingame credits = 1 case, this case grants you 1 random loadout card in the game, with the higher tier rarities being lower chances of obtaining, but still possible. if you really want to go all out, you can spend 5 dollars in real world money for some random cases that are primarily used for the higher chance at getting Gold and Cobalt loadouts, but still guarenteed a Silver loadout.\n\nThe crafting system is next and it's pretty simple, put in cards you don't like of the same rarity and get the next loadout rarity up, you also select any of the characters that you want a loadout specifically for. Essentially trade up contracts in CS:GO. Pretty easy to understand, gives you another chance at randomizing and it's a way of letting you get loadouts that are Silver and higher without the RNG chance, however the weapons and perks are randomized each time.\nWith that being said, if you find that you can't be bothered to open up cases for 1000 ingame credits, you can simply save up enough to just buy a bronze loadout that you like.\n\nNext comes characters. Here's where people have whined most about the game. "6-10 Dollars for a single character in this game? What a ripoff!" And here's where I come in and say "You don't need to spend money, blah blah blah, you can play the game normally and get every character you just need to save up a bit."\nOn top of this, there is a free character rotation every week. Just like in League of Legends, every week three characters become unlocked for the week's duration as playable characters, afterwards you need to purchase them to keep them permanently.\n\nTo end this I'm simply going to put it. The game is fun, not Pay 2 Win, and it's starting to take up time I would spend playing Tf2.","June 26, 2015","true","170.1"," 756 of 941 people (80%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","80","756","941","51","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119784402/recommended/333930/","76561198119784402","Meerkat","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119784402/","5 products in account","Once upon a time, I got my FPS kicks primarily through Unreal Tournament and other arena FPS games.  Then Unreal stopped being a thing, and I switched to the Call of Dutys and Battlefields; never could get into the Counterstrikes.  And you know, I had fun and everything, but all those easy kills made me complacent.  Then Dirty Bomb comes along kicks my teeth in.  In the good way, of course.  A proper return to form, with longer time to kills and purist FPS mechanics.  You don’t know how much you miss something until it’s been taken away from you, and then one day, many years later, you get it back.  I didn’t know it, but I actually needed Dirty Bomb.\n\nSo, what is Dirty Bomb?  Dirty Bomb is Splash Damage’s latest team-based, run and gun shooter where small teams race to complete objectives.  Dirty Bomb offers old school gameplay with an emphasis on mastering mechanics like movement, speed and mechanical skill, placing a rare premium on tracking and headshots, skillsets no longer really required in today’s glut of instant kill FPS games.  These elements are then given a modern coat of paint, with real world analogs like M4 carbines in place of link rifles.\n\nMatches occur on large, multi-tiered maps with multiple, sequential objectives.  Brink-esque, light parkour elements offer additional mobility options for clever players to get into tricky spots or eek out moment to moment advantages over their foes.  So far, so Splash Damage.  Dirty Bomb also borrows from Team Fortress 2, with distinct classes catering to various playstyles and roles, all complementing one another.  While execution mode takes many cues from Counterstrike, Dirty Bomb’s Brink-style game modes, objective and stopwatch, is where Dirty Bomb shines.\n\nPlayers step into the shoes of mercenaries, pre-selected before a match, “customized” via a loadout card with up to three augments.  Mercenaries are divided into light, medium and heavy mercs with light mercs being faster but less durable than their heavier counterparts.  Additionally, each merc is assigned a speciality or role.  Medics heal and revive.  Support rifleman provide ammo and call in various forms of artillery.  Engineers complete objectives faster and often rely on sneaky alternatives to direct combat.  The usual suspects.\n\nA quick note for those of you who have seen Angry Joe's criminally bad "review."  While loadouts with three augments are more powerful than loadouts with fewer augments, these augments will rarely determine the outcome of individual firefights.  Additionally, players can purchase any three augment loadout they want in bronze quality relatively cheaply, and higher quality loadouts ( silver, gold, cobalt ) only offer different colour palettes.  Dirty Bomb is in no way pay to win.\n\nWhile good ability usage can determine matches, all abilities are linked to sometimes long cooldown timers, and players will end up relying on their firearms, a lot.  As earlier mentioned, due to longer time to kills, single burst kills are rare and firearm prowess becomes very important.  Hipfire reigns, and with a very healthy 2.0x damage multiplier on headshots, Dirty Bomb emphasizes an almost duelist approach to combat with both combatants attempting to connect as many rounds as possible while juking and strafing out of incoming fire.  Without vehicles and killstreaks getting in the way on top of excellent netcode, combat is returned to glorious infantry, el mano, el mano basics.\n\nThis represents Dirty Bomb’s greatest strength and also, it’s predominant weakness.  Due to Splash Damage shirking modern design principles designed to minimize skill gap, Dirty Bomb is not a game most players will be able to simply drop into and expect reasonable results.  However, with some player investment, Dirty Bomb opens up and offers dedicated players huge room to grow through challenging matches, with thrilling engagements, in ways its streamlined competition cannot.\n\nDirty Bomb, however, has many faults, but for players seeking Dirty Bomb’s frenetic gameplay, there aren’t many modern options.  But let’s go through Dirty Bomb’s numerous issues:\n\nThe competitive scene is not healthy, and overall, Dirty Bomb likely doesn’t have what it takes to enter the mainstream.  Part of the reason is that Dirty Bomb is difficult.  Without proper matchmaking ensuring players get evenly matched against similarly skilled players, new and lesser skilled players are often subject to routine stomps.\n\nThe balance isn’t perfect; explosives are too effective, and while the various mercs are fairly well balanced, a handful do stand tall over their competition.  The same goes for loadout augments; some augments are clearly better, making certain loadouts clearly better.\n\nOutside of the game itself, the loadout system is terrible and in serious need of an overhaul.  Furthermore, with skins randomly assigned to loadouts, even if a player is lucky enough to receive a great loadout card, they may not get the skin they want.  Worse yet, with skins tied to loadouts, Splash Damage can’t even sell skins.  This also leads to the odd situation where while unlocking a merc isn't particularly difficult ( about 19 - 26 hours ), getting the loadout you want as a gold or cobalt may as well be impossible.\n\nThe events are horribly organized with event loot offered at a pithy 0.3% drop rate.  That’s right, a third of one percent.  The idea is probably to force players to the cash shop, but due to the terrible loadout system and inability to trade inventory items, the cash shop feels horribly overpriced.  Oh, and the new trinkets, being mostly invisible to other players, are overpriced ♥♥♥♥.\n\nWhile some of this may seem like nitpicking, I believe this does indicate a longstanding, fundamental disconnect between either Splash Damage or Nexon and the real world.  What I'm trying to say is that a lot of this is very stupid and nobody wins.\n\nLastly, we finally talk about Dirty Bomb’s aesthetic.  Don’t know how this ended up last, but if you hadn’t noticed Dirty Bomb’s many similarities with it’s predecessor, Brink, the aesthetics are a definite giveaway.  While Dirty Bomb’s version of near-future London is a bit less dark and gloomy, the mercs have a similar, distinctive style and swagger.  Best of all, the mercs are hilariously chatty ( mount an emplaced machine gun, and your merc will yell, “pew pew pew!” ) with interesting backstories.  Certain individuals may be discouraged by the slightly cartoony aesthetic, but personally, I celebrate almost any move away from generic, military realism.\n\nSo there you go; an exquisitely well crafted blend of old school mechanics and modern sensibilities.  You can’t win all your fights, but Dirty Bomb does alright.  In many ways, a Brink 2.0; if only everything else about Dirty Bomb was as well honed as it’s gameplay.  If you're not entirely convinced yet, but want to sharpen your FPS skills or try something new, well, let the price tag speak for itself:  Free.","January 5","true","679.2"," 306 of 363 people (84%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","84","306","363","33","12"

I say "one of" because a lot of people enjoy TF2. I'll be making quite a big list of reasons on why you should try it. Not 100% objective and possible slight bias since I do enjoy this game.\n\nIt's free. Just try it.\nCompetitive. There is a ranked mode like CS:GO, queue times can be quite high because of a small playerbase.\nOld school. It's not exactly Quake or Unreal Tournament arena style, but it maintains a bit of that old school vibe mixed in with new elements such as:\nshooting a lot of bullets very accurately\nthe above, but while moving and strafing at all times\nalways aim for the head whenever possible, just do it.\nyou can use your ironsights but you really don't need to.\nObjective-based gamemodes. Some enjoy Team Deathmatch and whatever but I believe objectives are essential. Why?\nTeamwork is required to complete the objectives and, essentially, win the game. Each and every person in the team is important. But how?\nClasses. You NEED a medic for health, a field ops for ammo, an engineer to complete objectives, a soldier for damage and a recon for long range damage. Some are more important than others but it's the combination that makes it work.\nEven if you only manage to get a handful of kills, as long as you fulfill your role (heal/give ammo/etc) and/or complete the objective, you will probably be at the top of the scoreboard. The game rewards you a lot more for teamwork and objectives than for camping and killing.\nVariety in characters. There are quite a bit of characters in the roster and they are all somewhat similar but still very unique. You'll like some and hate some.\nNo ♥♥♥♥♥♥ free-to-play model. It is F2P but it's not as crappy as other ones out there where you can hire a gun for a week and then lose it. To buy a mercenary, you do need quite a bit of playtime, but not an unreasonable amount.\nLoadout cards are fairly interesting. There are several tiers such as Lead, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Cobalt. Lead has 1 perk, Iron has 2 perks, Bronze and everything above it has 3 perks. This means that Silver, Gold and Cobalt have no advantage apart from looking good. Bronze is quite easy to acquire so you'll be on par with people playing for years loadout-wise.\nCommunity isn't very toxic. Sure, there's a rotten apple here and there, but overall the people are nice enough.\nIt's like Wolfenstein Enemy Territory but with advanced classes.\nYou can't "buy" good stuff. It's not pay to win. You could buy bronze loadouts but that's a bit of a waste and easy for non-paying players to acquire anyway. Anything else is purely cosmetic.\nHigh skill ceiling. Trust me when I say some people in this game are crazy good. Don't be discouraged too quickly and try to learn. It's a bit of a challenge and high learning curve because the game is really fast. If you can't kill 'em, make yourself useful and provide for the team as I've said before.\nGood variety of maps. It's still a bit limited but there's enough to keep me busy for a few hundred hours very likely.\nGood variety of gamemodes.\nObjective = complete series of objectives to win.\nStopwatch = same as objective BUT you need to do the objectives as fast as possible and to make it fair there's a teamswitch. This is the most competitive and official ranked gamemode.\nExecution = basically Counter-Strike. 2 pylons you have to bomb, 7v7, no respawns until next round.\nI enjoy the game a lot. The teamwork part is REALLY important and the level of teamwork is quite a bit higher than other games. A single medic can save the game by reviving 4 people in a row instead of trying to gun down the enemies.\n\nSome tips to get you started:\nAim for the head when possible\nDo your job. Heal, drop ammo, repair objectives, kill, etc.\nComplete the objective. Everyone can do it but engineers do it faster.\nOn defence, destroy the objective. If it's an EV, throw airstrikes on it.\nBalance the team. Couple of medics, an engineer, a field ops and a guy with a big gun.\nOnly one person can arm/disarm or repair objectives. Whatever character does it the quickest, will do it. If it says "teammate repairing objective", immediately stop and cover his butt.\nKeep moving, always. Strafe from left to right and back to confuse enemies. Also, abuse the walljumps in small corridors to gain the advantage.\nyou are NOT required to use your ironsights! Your gun is really accurate from the hip, even while moving and jumping. Only use these in very long range encounters as they will slow you down significantly. Keep moving, soldier!\nIf you want to add anything to this list, feel free to leave a comment. Anything else (complaints, questions, suggestions) go there too. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do. If you don't, that's fine too ;-)","May 15","true","154.9"," 142 of 159 people (89%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","89","142","159","13","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adi33/recommended/333930/","adi33","adi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adi33/","207 products in account","I've decided to remove my old review for this game and rewrite it, since my last one was rather very “enthusiastic” .\n\nDirty Bomb is a team objective based online first-person shooter, developed by Splash Damage, known for titles like Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, or Brink. It’s gameplay is in many ways similar to previously mentioned Enemy Territory. One team has to make their way through the map, while completing certain objectives to clear obstacles on their way to the final objective, while the other team tries their best to stop them from doing so. The game has many “mercs” to play, each serving a certain purpose in the team – Medics, Engineers, Recons, Ammo suppliers / Fire supporters, and Combat mercs.\n\nOne of Dirty Bomb’s main premises is  “No hand holding” – and it shows in gameplay. With the game’s rather old school mechanics, veteran FPS players should feel right at home, as in gunfights, the winner isn’t determinated by pure randomness. A good player, using his movement, aiming, game sense and knowledge can be victorious over others, even if he’s outmatched by the opponent's health pool, or weaponry.  Team play is also important, as while experienced lone wolfs can easily stomp a public match where everyone is running about randomly without any purpose, it becomes nearly impossible to do so versus opponents with good cooperation.\n\nThe game is Free-To-Play, but fear not, there’s no any Pay-To-Win involved. Indeed, there are micro transactions, but they are more of a “Pay-To-Skip” thing. A dedicated player can get every gameplay changing elements in the game unlocked just by putting some time into the game. It might be slightly off putting for new players, who would want to advance though the game quickly, and it might also make them  think that they are at a disadvantage because they don’t own some stuff other players do. This is, to a certain point, not true, since 2 really great mercs are available from the start (Many very high level players play them often – just because they are available from the start, doesn’t mean they are worse, and that applies to other mercs in many ways – just because it’s a more support oriented merc, doesn’t mean he can’t do well at combat. All mercs are powerful, and you aren’t really at an disadvantage because you don’t own some of them), and there’s a 3 merc rotation that changes every 2 weeks or so. There's also the Loadout Card system, which is basically a weapon set for your merc. The cards have many qualities, and while it might be slightly confusing for new players, in reality, there are only 3 qualities that matter - Lead, Iron, and Bronze. Lead and Iron cards are the most common, but Bronze aren't really hard to get. The cards give you a certain set of perks, which give you very slight bonuses, none of them being bonuses related to your primary or secondary weapons, or your merc stats in general, excluding one perk which is pretty much useless. Lead cards have only 1 perk, and Iron has 2, while Bronze holds the maximum 3. Qualities above Bronze (Silver, Gold, Cobalt and Special Edition) are purely COSMETIC and work exactly like a Bronze card. This is a very important fact, since I've seen some people spread a misconception that Cobalt/Gold cards are pay to win.\n\nThe game isn’t perfect, though. Splash Damage is a fairly small development team, and the development speed is quite slow. The game has monthly updates, and while they do carry many important bug fixes and minor changes that affect the game in a good way, they usually don’t have much content (resulting in a fairly small map pool). Also, Splash Damage prefers to take their time when it comes to balance changes – a few mercs are considered fairly underpowered, and while the devs said they have plans to rework/buff them, it might take some time.  The game is also in a Open Beta state, which means you might expect bugs, slight performance problems (mostly if you have bad PC specs or you want to go for 100+ fps), but the game is otherwise fully playable.\n\nSome people might be also wondering if the game has a cheater problem, and if the game is dead. To both of these questions, the answer is No. The cheating problem was basically solved when the new anti cheat came out for the game, and I haven’t met any cheaters ever since. Many players might have been mistaken for cheaters by inexperienced players though, but it’s not uncommon to see people falsely accuse players of cheating in any FPS game. About the playerbase, it might not be the biggest, but you will always find a public server to play on, and you might even easily find a ranked match in about 5-10 minutes if you play the game in peak hours! (Sad information for our American friends though, since as far as I know, ranked in America is pretty much dead.)\n\nPersonally, I think the bad sides of the game can be easily overlooked, since the game is free, and you don’t need to spend a single penny on it. The game is extremely fun, and many fans of shooter games will probably enjoy it as much as I do. I really recommend trying it out, but watch out, since you might get your ♥♥♥ kicked the first time you play it. Don't get discouraged though! Practice makes perfect, and with some trial and error, you will gradually improve over time.","April 29","true","585.0"," 126 of 146 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","126","146","9","15"

I like the game and I'd hate to see it fail because of people spreading false information about it.\n\n\n\ntl:dr version:\nFast paced objective based game. Keep your legs moving and track heads if you want to win. Don't touch iron sights unless at extreme distances.\n\n\n\nNow for the not so short version.\n\nWhat is Dirty Bomb? It is fast paced, multi objective team based shooter that is often compared to CS:GO and TF2. That isn't true. It is Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory with a sprinkle of Brink on top of it. You may ask what is multi objective? Think of Battlefield's Rush mode. You have to defend point A from being destroyed, but if your enemy beats you there you're pushed back further into the map and now you have to defend site B from the same fate.\n\nCharacters have different movement speeds and amount of health. Going faster means you sacrifice durability but being fast allows you to get away from (or into) danger much more quickly. Everyone has the ability to jump from walls and combine multiple wall jumps together allowing for some great jumps that will take your opponents by surprise.\nThe most often heard complaint is how weak the weapons are. This is another point that is not true. AIM FOR THE HEAD, THIS ISN'T CALL OF DUTY WHERE EVERYTHING DIES WHEN YOU GAZE IN THEIR GENERAL DIRECTION. Guns shoot where you point them and have very little spread so you can go ham with full auto at most ranges. Map selection is lacking so I can understand if some get bored of this faster.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance:\nThis has to be touched early. It's runs quite badly. On the highest settings I was getting drops to 40s and was forced to drop the settings to the lowest to get playable fps.\nMy specs:\ni5-3570k@stock (lmao stock clocks)\n16GB RAM\nGTX980\nGame was installed on WD Black 7200rpm HDD.\n\n\n\nPayment model:\nIt is free to play with League of Legends style of character unlocking. You have 2 free characters to start with, Aura and Skyhammer. Both of them are top tier characters. There are also three free mercs on two week rotation for you to try out which always includes one engineer. All characters are either 30k or 50k credits.\n\nWhen you first enter the game you might think that this is pay to win as there are so many locked mercs. All mercs offer a different playstyle but none of them are Tolkien's eagles. If you're bad, then you're bad.  No merc can save you from it, only practice can. Lack of knowledge and skill isn't a valid reason to call the game pay2win.\n\nAfter each game you get certain amount of credits which is 12 per minute. I feel this should be increased to prevent people who play less thinking about how you have to spend money in order to win.You also get credits from doing missions and daily missions. Daily bonuses are 500 for first win and 500 for first match of the day for each game mode. Missions refresh every three hours and give you 500, 750 or 1000 credits and you have three missions active at the same time. On average it should only take you about an hour to complete them.\n\nNow I do agree with that the prices are too expensive for real money. 30k mercs are 7 euros and 50k are 10 euros and a single bronze loadout card is 3.5 euros. YOU GET 30K BONUS ON YOUR FIRST 5 LEVELS, DO NOT SPEND IT ON CRATES AND WASTE IT LIKE A DUMBASS AS YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT KIND OF MONEY AGAIN. NEVER SPEND CREDITS ON CRATES, IT IS WASTE.\n\nYou also have the option to buy elite crates and credit boosters. Boosters double your match credits (12 per minute to 24 per minute) but disappointingly it doesn't affect missions. If you ever want to use boosters buy them during double cred weekends. Elite cases give you either silver, gold or cobalt card.. Do not purchase elite cases or boosters unless you're willing to throw your money away to support the game, they're simply not worth it.\n\n\n\nLoadout cards:\nEach character has 9 cards with three cards for each primary with varying secondaries and perks. For example, 3 cards for rifle A, 3 cards for rifle B and 3 cards for rifle C . They are how you choose what you take with you into the match. The are multiple different levels of cards. Default, lead, iron, bronze, silver, gold and cobalt. Default has none, lead has 1 perk, iron 2 and bronze 3. Anything beyond bronze is pure bling. This may sound like obvious advantage over others who don't have as high level cards as others but that isn't the case. Guns > perks. The perks only help enhance what there already is, they're not like "stopping power" from Call of Duty. They're only minor increases but not necessary at all for succeeding. Everyone else but medics and one assault class are totally fine with default cards.\nThe cards can be found from cases you get from playing, buying elite cases (don't do it) or you can get the card of your choice from the store for either real money or 17.5k credits.\n\n\n\nThis review was a gift for you, no charge.\n\nOh wait,\n\nEXPLOSIVE CHARGE.","July 31, 2015","true","533.3"," 234 of 311 people (75%) found this review helpful 70 people found this review funny","75","234","311","70","7"

Pitting 8v8/5v5 attacking teams and a defending teams against eachother in large sprawled out maps set in London. The attacking team has to attack (duh) a series of objectives to win, the defending team has to stop those guys, simple enough right? While in battle you can choose between 3 characters you own to switch between at any time, so say being a sniper isnt working out, switch over to medic and help your team in a pinch. In addition to that, each character has two unique special abilities (Like yknow, League of legends) you can also use in a pinch. For example one character can throw an airstrike beacon that shreds everything within range if they dont GET OUT OF THERE and he can also give ammo packs to his teammates, get it now? Every character is like that, and it's pretty cool. There arent exactly a ton of maps just yet, but the ones the game already offers are pretty fun, they gotta be just big enough to contain all those players and objectives, just not TOO big. Anyway the last thing i'd comment on is the "loadout" system. Which essentially replaces character customization for different loadouts in the form of trading cards. Each character has a variety of different loadouts you can buy which contain different weapons/gadgets for the character depending on the card you have. It's an interesting idea, but also kind of confusing.\n\n... Or TL;DR in a nutshell, amirite?\n\nTHE GOOD\n+ Gameplay is fast and furious (Not like the movie)\n+ Character designs are unique and interesting\n+ Game and has good flow and energetic attitude\n+ Varied character playstyles keep things fresh\n+ E-Sports support, yay!\n\nTHE BAD\n- Might be a bit TOO FAST for some people\n- Loadout system might be disappointing to some\n- Feels like theres some balancing issues to iron out\n- Community is filled with toxic "COD kids" rushing to their deaths\n- Virtually no character customization or personalization. (But i wanted to put fragger in a dress!)\n- Not exactly a smooth launch, a bunch of people having issues getting into the game.\n(wtf can't i see it in game activity?)\n\n\nTHE UGLY\nMorons on Kotaku ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the tutorial being "too offensive"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKuVsA3Mjko\nJesus Christ, really people? Really? Tutorials hurt your feelings now?\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nhttps://youtu.be/LNeWnTag8nE\nIt's fast, it's fun, it's free. If you like your Team Fortress 2 with a little sprinkle of Call of duty, give Dirty Bomb a try. I particularly enjoy it's sarcastic attitude and the way the game encourages teamwork to win. Now if only people would actually WORK TOGETHER. Take notes because running and gunning gets you nowhere, and it's not exactly pay to win, yet. Don't ♥♥♥♥ this up Nexon! Please?

A few tweaks here and there, a few modifications, and you got yourself a hot pile of awesome for dinner!\n\nBut there's one glaring issue.\n\nNexon has a hand in it.\n\nNexon... how do I put this.\nThink of it like this.\nImagine a Cash Shop as a person.\nHe's nice, he'll give you those awesome rocket pops for a dollar that you love. You know, the ones with the bubble gum ball in the middle. Great stuff!\nNow take that, then slap Nexon on his nametag.\nHe will then ruin your hair, slam you against a wall instead, and tell you to fix that hair he'll give you a hat. It's a moderatly priced hat, but in 30 days he'll come back and take that hat back and you'll have to buy another one.\nUnless you dish out three to four times the normal amount... then you can keep that hat!\nCourse next week there will be even MORE hats to choose from.\nOr he'll show you a gun. Now this gun is the same gun you can get in game. But this gun does more damage. And the only way to get that gun with more damage, is to buy this version of it.\n\nIn a nutshell.\nThe game has a Cash Shop.\nNexon is involved.\n\nThat cash shop is going to get bad. Very, very bad.\n\nSo if you want to play the game. Play it NOW. Play it RIGHT NOW! Play it till you're sick of it. Play it till you dream of the day you can play that tile placing game carcassonne just to not be playing this game anymore. Play it till you're considered addicted, and then claim you're not addicted but relize you're rivaling Skyrim in hours played!!!\n\nBecause eventually... down the game's road... it's lifespan... there will be that time when the game "dips" in popularity. And when it does.... Nexon will be there.\nWith arms filled with items you can buy to, keep you interested in the game, or make it easier, or make it more... fun.\n\nHappened in Maple Story\nHappened in Audition Online\nHappened in Combat Arms\nAnd I still weep for Vindictus...\n\n\nEdit\nOne thing I want to point out is the game Combat Arms. Combat Arms is a game by Nexon. On their website, you can see it there by Dirty Bomb.\nCombat Arms, like Dirty Bomb, was a First Person Shooter objective based military style game. It was great, and you could honestly say it was like a Free-To-Play Call of Duty.\nBesides some small balancing issues (Shotguns could snipe), the game was fun, and they even had a PVE mode that was rather challenging. And they even had a Zombies mode!!!\n\nThen it started small in the cash shop... reskins... new cosmetic equipment... then it got bigger.\n\nWeapon Packs.\nArmor Packs.\nEquipment Packs.\n\nThen It got worst! Entire characters you can play as who are only available from the cash shop.\nThen two characters.\nThen four characters.\nThen entire pages of equipment and weapons that only these characters could use!\nSo in order to use these new weapons, you had to get those new characters!\nAnd they weren't just reskin characters, or had small changes.\nThese Cash Shop Characters had HUGE differences! Abilities none of the regular characters even had! Like motion sensors! And trip mines!\nTHEN MORE WEAPON PACKS!\nTHEN NEW BOOSTERS!!!\nTHEN EVEN MORE FREGIN WEAPON PACKS!!!\nMORE BOOSTERS! SO MANY BOOSTERS!\nHealth Boosters, Damage Boosters, Defense Boosters!!!\n\nWhen I left the game... it was no longer a game with rifles, shotguns, tactics.\nIt was a crap ton of Handcannons that 1-2 shot people they got from WEAPON PACKS, and using Recon crap from that one cash shop only character who was basically a walking UAV....\nAnd there were the sniper rifles from the pack that could 1-shot you regardless of where it hit. Even if it shot your middle toe.. DEAD.","June 10, 2015","false","1.9"," 515 of 750 people (69%) found this review helpful 132 people found this review funny","69","515","750","132","52"

This is one of the best shooters I've played in a VERY long time. I couldn't name for you the last time I had this much fun with a shooter. The gun-play is crisp and responsive, the level design is beautiful and intelligent and the refreshing return of objective based and team-play oriented combat gives every action you perform and kill you execute out feel meaningful to the overall outcome of the game. However...\n\nI cannot recommend this game in it's current form. This is almost entirely due to the business model of the game, for those unaware of it who don't want a long winded explanation I shall attempt to keep it brief. So you have 2 main aspects to the game's business model, cards/crates and mercs. The mercs are on a weekly rotation of 3 and week as of writing this review (this is already too little to have on rotation). The mercs all have differing play styles and unique personality however I believe that individual mercs are FAR too expensive. they can to anywhere from $10 to $15 at one point which is almost as much as you would have paid to get into the closed beta testing! The other aspect being the cards/cases is also rather unfair. Each case contains a guaranteed card and costs 1,000 in-game cash. This is already pretty expensive. The credits are quite hard to earn and the cases will almost never yield a worthwhile card. Something is to be said for the unavailability of credits as a real-money purchase (as of writing this review) but I would bet my bottom dollar that this is only temporary. It is also extremely expensive to trade up merc cards both in lower tier cards and in credits, making it an in-viable option by certain points in the game.\n\nNow I love Splash Damage and I believe they are an extremely tallented developer who put their hearts into projects. I loved Enemy Territory to bits, I thought Brink was an extremely underrated game and I found the Batman: Arkham Origins multiplier rather enjoyable (if a bit rushed) however consumers can not excuse a game of unfair business models with the defense of its game-play. The saddest thing about this is that I do not believe this is entirely Splash Damage's fault. Instead I point a hesitant finger at Nexon, the publishers of the title. Do not forget, readers, that they might have a larger hand in this issue than you might think.\n\nSo in summary? Fix your business model, then we'll talk.","June 7, 2015","false","52.8"," 534 of 788 people (68%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","68","534","788","39","45"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ninjadeer/recommended/333930/","Ninjadeer","Ninjadeer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ninjadeer/","127 products in account","Back in 2003, Splash Damage released a standalone freeware game known as Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.  It combined the speed and movement of Quake and the hitscan and aiming mechanics of Counter-Strike into a objective-based game.  The focus on team-oriented objectives created a very popular fps game that sadly had a community die off and move on.\n\nSplash Damage attempted to revive the series with with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but was largely unsucessful.\n\nWelcome to Dirty Bomb, the newest reincarnation of the gameplay.  It feels and plays like the first legitemate sucessor to Enemy Territory.  With similar team-based classes, and a much more noob-friendly interface than ET could ever muster, this game could possibly be the first game that is a legitemate competitor to CSGO in terms of competitive FPS games... as long as Nexon doesn't ♥♥♥♥ everything up and make the game p2w.\n\nThe shooting mechanics combine that of quake and counter-strike.  Players are tanky and can take 2 or 3 headshots to kill.  However, similar to CS, aiming for the head is highly rewarding as most guns will kill in 8 to 10 shots (generally it takes a little less than 2 seconds to kill a player with body shots).  Additionally, you're highly accurate while moving, which makes strafe shooting a viable and effective strategy.\n\nDon't let the cartoonish atmosphere fool you, however.  Despite its simplistic nature, there is a lot of depth to the game in taking fights, healing with medics, and even intentionally suiciding to respawn with full ammo or to defend an objective.\n\nIf you like playing competitive FPS games, give this one a fair shot.  The gameplay is quite unforgiving for new players, but highly rewarding if you stick with it.","February 21, 2015","true","121.1"," 122 of 162 people (75%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","75","122","162","13","6"

After several recent patchs wherein Splash Damage inevitably introduced or changed the wrong things at the wrong time, several players have began leaving the game.\n\nA recent influx of hackers due to public hacks being distributed (and nothing being done about it because Xigncode3 is awful awful awful) and the lack of demo supports results in smarter players subtly using hacks to "improve" their skills with knowledge and aim they shouldn't have.\n\nThe recent closure of the DirtyCups League has also not helped situations, as the long awaited competitive league with a $3,000 prize pool was suspended until further notice.\n\nNEW VERDICT: 3/10 Splash Damage has no idea what they're doing, and they haven't since Enemy Territory.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nLooking for Brink 2.0? Then keep looking! Splash Damage may have run into some hard (and necessary) critique for Brink and Arkham Origins MP, but with constant tweaking and reworks of the game, Dirty Bomb (Formerly Extraction until they changed the name back) is looking to be a great game.\n\nMECHANICS:\nIt's like the child of Wolf:ET and Brink. You have the art style and design like Brink, but the core gameplay is that of Wolf:ET. The exclusion of "parkour" and instead, the inclusion of the ability to jump off walls to gain height/cross terrain makes for much faster gameplay as you're always on the move with your gun out instead of waiting for an animation to finish before shooting.\n\nAside from the basic FPS stuff, every mercenary has a distinct skill ranging from medkits and ammo bags to air strikes and molotovs. Each mercenary has a unique and distinct style to them, unlike Brink's "customization". Each mercenary has a distinct default loadout, and in the future will also have alternate loadouts received from, I assume, the cash shop though a system similar to CS:GO's cases and keys.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nDon't like iron sights or aiming down them? THEN DON'T! Other than sniper rifles, every gun can be hipfired with the accuracy as if you're shooting while ADS'ing in other FPS games! In Brink you'd have a penalty on hipfiring, whereas in Wolf:ET you'd have a small penalty for shooting while moving. In DB, Splash Damage decided to include both a VERY small penalty to accuracy while shooting while moving (it's absolutely unnoticeable) and an ADS function that is useful for getting a zoom on targets further across the map.\n\nAnother note is that Time To Kill ranges depending on how amazing you are at aiming and which mercenary you have selected. (Side note: You're allowed to bring into combat 3 mercenaries an you're able to switch between them when you die, almost as if you're selecting a loadout in other FPS games.) Every mercenary has distinct stats from movement, health, and hitbox.\n\nMAP DESIGN:\nI have to be honest, some of the maps are pretty dang awful. A few maps are just straight corridors with chokepoints that are tough as nails to get through as the Attackers. Other maps however, have a multitude of ways to reach the objective (Terminal, Dome) and are a blast to play.\n\nVERDICT: 8/10 will play until SD becomes corrupted by Nexon.","January 6, 2015","true","412.9"," 146 of 200 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","146","200","10","2"

On one hand, the graphics are appealing to the eye, and yet arent super high end. The sound work is fine, and the gun play is what you would expect from the makers of enemy territory and brink. So what about the gameplay?\n\nThere are a few areas where the game is a lot of fun. Mostly as I mentioned already, the gun play. Shooting, jumping, dodging, stabbing... it all flows very smooth and is very fast paced. I enjoy not having to ALWAYS use iron sights to shoot, allowing quicker from the hip shooting. The objective based maps are great too. I like how you arent always on the same part of the map, as they require you to move through the map as the teams do the objectives.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? Sadly, no. Not right now. There are some pretty big issues, none of which are bug or programming related, that keep this game from being really fun and replayable for me.\n\n(take note, NONE of these issues have anything to do with the games real money payment system. I havent spent a dime on the game, and I dont feel like its hindered me in any way short of not having access to all the classes)\n\n1. The deck system is horrid as it stands right now. The total randomness of what perks you get and what weapons you get are just TOO random. As much of a pain as it is to unlock an actual class, having to massively farm for the deck you want for that class is something that will take AGES. The concept of "let me play with what I enjoy now, dont make me play months with something i dont just to unlock it" is kinda BS. Aside from the randomness, the biggest issue I have is how weapons and perks are on the same card.\n\nMy suggestion solution: Make cards for perks AND cards for weapons. That way you can at least find a weapon you like and keep it, regardless of the perks you have. It would also give the game a more customizable feel to it.\n\n2. Progression is the slowest of any game Ive every played. You get to level 5 fast, and then it drops to a crawl\n\n3. Which leads to: Leveling up seems pointless. Progression for that matter is seemingly non existent. In the day and age of being able to unlock all kinds of things the more you play, the better you do, and the achievements you accomplish, this game seems to have NONE of that. The only actual way to get things, is through the randomness of the deck/card system, which is entirely at the mercy of the random number generator. In my 14 or so hours playing, ive gotten a total of about 6 cards. Only 2 of which were for characters I owned.\n\n4. This is the most group unfriendly team game Ive played in awhile. Not only is it a total pain to group up with friends, but the game will choose to seperate you at random at the start of a match if you arent quick enough to lock in. Why would it randomly switch you? well... because of the next thing below...\n\n5. Ive never seen a game where over half of the people playing LEAVE the game after ONE match. Even a GOOD match (not one where one side slaughters the other). Its very frustating because 4 out of 5 games require you to go back to the server browser to find another game to join. Stop Watch mode at least lets you sometimes get a "Second round" in before this happens. Something at its core is wrong with the game if players arent desiring to continue playing it for more than one game.\n\n6. Despite being a "Team" game focused on objectives, a majority of the players seem to fall under that "Im just playing to get on the top of the scoreboard" mentality. No one playing medics that often. People playing classes that drop ammo, never dropping ammo. Etc etc. There are games where players are an exception to this, however the majority of the time matches are just about getting to the top of the score board. The devs seem ok with this mentality though, having just release a solo oriented stealthing class that only emphasizes this sorta gameplay (and no, I dont think the stealthing class has ANY reason to be in this game, it just doesnt fit with the theme and setting - and no, i dont get killed by them that often, its just a silly out of place mechanic. Something better would have been a Riot Shield class, that could slowly push forward while behind the cover of his riot shield. This would allow for team oriented strategic pushes, not some glory monger trying to sneak around just killing for a high kill score)\n\n7. Despite me saying the gun play was fun, this game has a qwerky aspect to it that I just cant put my finger on. You will often find yourself going head to head with someone, each of you shooting at the other, each of you getting hit (audio and visual queues confirming this), and when one person dies, the other barely has any life missing. Its that "im lagged" feeling when it happens, only, you check your ping and its 25. Ive done it to other players too, where they die, and im barely damage, despite seeing my screen flash as I was getting hit over and over again. Its just an oddity that makes the game feel inconsistant in how it handles damage and getting hit, but is at the very bottom of my dislikes about the game, by far.\n\nAnd then there are things like this:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485409241\n\n(edit: new)\n\n8. Locked classes. I dont care if you have to pay real money, or in game currency, keeping most of the classes locked to players until they spend TONS of time trying to unlock them, really screws with gameplay balance. How so? Here is why:\n\n- Many classes (locked ones) gain bonsues for dealing with map objectives. Such as repairing, disabling, disarming, etc. A team with a class like this is going to have an easier time than a team without.\n\n- Some classes bring a totally new gameplay into a match. Such as Rhino or Phantom. Giving the team with classes like this a distinct edge and optional strategies vs those without them\n\nIts very noticeable when one team has a wider selection of classes on their side vs a team that doesnt. It makes the game very lopsided. I get that the devs want to make money on selling them, but they should take note from games like TF2 and Enemy Territory, and make all classes available to everyone. Its the only BALANCED solution. If they want to make money, or give players something to earn, stick to Perk cards and player skins\n\n9. The game is too easily confined to having the exact same number on each side. Being even ONE man down 9 out of 10 times means you will lose. Often times it results in the team with fewer players getting spawn camped. A game shouldnt be so heavily reliant on having exactly the same number of players as this game is. Being one man down should feel like a handicap, but not like someone put you in a coma.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, despite the decent gun play and the appealing visuals, the game just feels "off". It runs great, looks great, feels great, but it doenst make me want to keep playing very much. Its free, try it out, but dont expect it to be the next big replacement for whatever shooter you may have played in the past. I also think the whole deck system will make the game get stale and dull really fast for most people.","July 19, 2015","false","36.6"," 267 of 397 people (67%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","67","267","397","14","0"

You battle from 5vs5 to 8vs8 games on various maps and gamemodes. You can always bring three of your favorite mercs in game - and change the active merc during respawn.\n\n\nLoadoutsYou can customize these mercs with different type of loadout cards that determine your weapon loadouts and character bonuses.\n\nFor example, one loadout card might change your primary weapon from SMG into shotgun and add/remove some augments (No fall damage, reload weapon while sprinting etc.) or new skills (quickly toss enemy's grenade back) to your character.\n\nThere's 6 levels of loadout cards from Lead to Cobalt and they all have different skins and augments that have an impact to your character behavior and skills. Starter loadout cards have only different weapons, while the best loadout cards can include 3 augments too. There's roughly 10(?) different type of loadout cards per level for a character. This might sound complex at first, but it's a really nice, simple system.\n\nYou get new loadout cards as rewards from matches and once you have enough unlocked, you can get rid off the 'poor' ones by crafting them into better, higher level cards.\n\nThe great thing here is that a skilled player with a stock loadout card can still easily kill a group of flashy mercs with "the best" loadouts and nothing makes you superior compared to other players. Only skills and group tactics matter.\n\nThe MercsThe mercs have different roles. They are categorized in healing, support and assault units. As I'm writing this there's currently 16 different mercs to choose from. There's few free mercs to try out every month and you can easily use these to get comfortable with the game and see what kind of play style fits you perfectly.\n\nEveryone's personal squad is built from snipers, artillery callers, big guys with miniguns, fast&agile chicks with mines, cloaky ninjas, combat medics, engineers with turrets  etc. and it adds a lot of variety in games, when you can call in another merc according to the battlefield situation.\n\nYou can buy new mercs by collecting reward money from missions that change hourly. If you don't feel like grinding the required money for your new favorite merc, you can take a shortcut and use real money too. The in game store also let's you buy new random loadout cards with in-game currency or real money, whatever is more convenient for you.\n\n\nAs there is no advantage gained with real money purchases compared to in-game grinding, I can happily point out this is a F2P game with no pay-to-win button included.\n","October 26, 2015","true","67.2"," 112 of 154 people (73%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","73","112","154","14","4"

Built around specialized characters and a unique card loadout system, it offers an enjoyable team experience. However, the in-game currency reward system is severely lacking.\n\nWarning: If you play first-person shooters enitrely for team deathmatch or to go for kills, you will likely not enjoy this game; all game modes and most incentives are objective-oriented, and the intentional absence of a team deathmatch mode makes that point clear.\n\nProsFast-paced gameplay\nGraphics are modern and unique\nVarious specialized characters w/ unique abilities\nMaps are well-designed & balanced\nObjective-oriented game modes\nDedicated servers\nFree-to-play without pay-to-winConsCompetitive mode matchmaking isn't balanced yet\nLimited map selection (only five)\nIn-game currency reward rates are frustratingly too slow\nOccasional minor rendering issues\nCan't create a party w/ friends to join a server together\nI've played the game since the first closed beta came out, and it's only gotten better since. It's fast-paced without simply becoming a visceral blur like many titles become, and offers highly competitive gameplay in a friendly environment. Playing with friends is very enjoyable thanks to multiple complimentary roles and loadouts, even though joining a server than can accomodate 2+ without filling up before they can join is sometimes a challenge. Everything about the objective-oriented gameplay satisfies my competitive thirst, but the game's currency reward system (CR) is TERRIBLE, just as others have mentioned. I purchased the Ultimate Starter Pack as well as an 18-hour credit booster, and it's still mediocre. I can be the MVP, get a higher score than the entire enemy team combined, and still get a meager 1000CR (AFTER the boost) for 20 minutes of play; with individual characters costing 50,000CR and individual loadouts costing around 17,000CR each, you'd have to spend hundreds of hours (or hundreds of dollars) to get all the characters and just decent cards. The missions given simply aren't enough, and even the buyable credit boosts don't help nearly enough to justify their cost. In the end, the game is wonderful and fun and oh-so-addicting yet sadly doesn't excel to a more prominent position in the larger gaming community due to a lackluster and unsatisfying reward system too heavily bent on forcing you to spend real money to get new content.","June 17, 2015","true","182.8"," 94 of 130 people (72%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","72","94","130","12","1"

Superiour teamwork and overall player skill will grant you many wins.\n\nThe game is in by no means a pay-2-win game. If you've seen any review which says it is, they're GREATLY MISINFORMED!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edmfgk7F3PM\n\nA lot of people complain that the credit gain is too slow, but they just don't know what to do. You can easily make over 5000+ Credits a day, spending less than 2 hours playing. New "quests" every 2.5 Hours help to your credit gain. First game/win of the day is also a small boost. The speed of which you gain credits, right now, is perfectly fine.\n\nLeveling means little, other than a larger ePenis and play time. Hopefully something gets added to give leveling some form of meaning. There are some max and min level servers which helps new and vet players not mix up and make the game unbalanced.\n\nA decent selection of Mercs to choose from. Each Merc is part of a group, E.g "Support" "Assult" "Medic" ect. Each Merc inside of the group does their role slightly different.\nFor example, "Aura" is a fast paced, low Health Medic who can place down a Healing device which emites a Healing Aura (Hence the name). She also has Defibs to revive downed but not gibbed players.\nWhere-as "Sparks", has the same speed and health, she does not have this healing device. Insteal she throws down "Mini-healthpacks" which give an instant heal. Instead of defibs, she has her trademark "Revive Gun". This allows her to revive from an infinite range (Cross map revives!) after a brief charge up. This revive gun can also hurt enemies. At max charge, she will either revive a downed player to full life or if she headshots someone, she will insta-kill them. She's awesome.\n\nThe maps are in a "battefield" type map where the map progresses depending on if objectives are taken. The maps are full of specific angles and sightlines for players to hold or play around. Every map feels unique and enjoyable.\n\nHowever, right now, the game is struggling from a small Hacker problem. Hacks for this game are relatively rare, but they're slowly becoming more of a problem. If the devs have any sense, the next big purchase for Dirty Bomb is some decent anti-hack. Right now, i've only faced 2 hackers, at different times, both of which where in Competitive Matchmaking. The community are amazing though, in these instances the other team decided not to fight us anymore but to screw over the hackers so they couldn't win.\n\nAlso, due to this game being teamplay heavy, i'd suggest playing with friends. Some players are just hellbent on being a fragger without actually playing the merc "Fragger" who's only goal is to kill. They're playing Medic classes and they completely ignore you if you're low health or downed on the floor. Be a team player, please please please. If you play a medic, help the team, not yourself. Same goes for every other role.\n\nFinally, I would rate this game a solid 8/10. A must play if you're into shooters.","June 21, 2015","true","129.2"," 105 of 153 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","105","153","7","4"

Dirty Bomb is a class-driven first-person shooter developed by Splash Damage centered around player-versus-player skirmishes. There are multiple game modes to compete in, as well as various stages to strategize and characters to either unlock or purchase. As a disclaimer towards this game and review, I do not purchase downloadable content packages for free-to-play titles because I believe that such games require enough composition to deter from said acquisitions. I also must say that, though it does take time, nearly everything this title has to offer can be unlocked without using its transaction-based in-game currency.\nHere are just a few reasons to give Dirty Bomb a go (other than it being free, of course):\n\nGameplay - Dirty Bomb holds a very interesting strategic aspect unlike many first person shooters: five varying ability styles consisting of Fire Support, Medic, Engineer, Assault, and Recon actions. This title holds similar characteristics to MOBAs in the sense that each featured character has their own unique statistics block and special abilities, with improved features depending on the rarity of the selected loadout. For instance, Proxy is generally a close-ranged shotgunner with proximity mines, a quickened interaction speed with given objectives, and an enhanced walking and sprinting speed; Skyhammer, on the other hand, throws ammunition packs which can be used by both the dispensing player and their teammates, and an air strike attack that can be used after each cooldown period. The controls in this title are similar to those of other first person shooters, with the addition of the Q key acting as the Ability button.\n\nGame Modes - In the debut game mode, Execution, one side must plant and retain a bomb at one of several points of interest while the second team either prevents this occurrence or disarms the bomb; picture, if you will, the Counter-Strike game series while deliberating on this concept. This game mode consists of ten rounds, each lasting a maximum of three minutes. The attackers and defenders swap sides after the midpoint of six rounds in each game, and the winners are decided when one team accumulates the majority of wins within ten rounds or by earning seven victories before the opponents.\n///  Objective Mode is relatable to Execution Mode in that the teams are split between attackers and defenders, but holds its own uniqueness, entailing completing multiple tasks within the given time of fifteen minutes. This mode requires a great amount of coordination with teammates, as every moment could alter the course of each game. This mode can be quite hectic yet enjoyable with the sequenced events.\n///  Stopwatch Mode is unlocked after a given player level, and is comparative to Objective Mode in that the two teams are separated into attackers and defenders, swapping roles after fifteen minutes or the completion of the primary objective; this signifies that each game concludes after thirty minutes. If both teams reach the same amount of objectives within the given time of thirty minutes, the game goes into overtime mode to decide the victorious team. I find this mode to be very amusing, even with my own dislike for time-based competition.\n\nTL:DR - I must admit that I had not experienced the same hacker problem as many of the other individuals that reviewed this game, though I will not omit that the problem may, indeed, exist in the community. Dirty Bomb’s community-as I have experienced-and relatable content is enough to entice the player to return to the arena. I recommend this title to those interested in class-drive first person shooters and skirmish-oriented matches. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madlumi/recommended/333930/","madlumi","Lumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madlumi/","300 products in account","So after 360 odd hours on this game I'm ready to give my honest opinion on it. I'll provide a short and an extended version.\n\nShort:\n\nPros:\n-True free to play model, i.e. no pay to win\n-Decent in-game progression rate (250h on average to unlock every single mercenary with in-game currency)\n-Many different mercs with very different abilities\n-Team based: medic, recon, engineer, assault, fire support (ammo provider)\n-Nice skins for your mercs\n\nCons:\n-Bugs, bugs and more bugs. Old ones stay, new content brings more of them.\n-Can't maintain constant fps even on medium settings on my rig (GTX 980 4GB, i7 3.6GHz, 16GB ram, 1Tb HDD)\n-All matchmaking/balancing tools are horrible. (I'll go into detail as to why in the extended section)\n-Poor content: 6 maps for one game mode, second mode being one half of the first one. 2 maps for the third mode.\n-Server issues: connection lost, lag spikes, teleports, frequent deaths behind the wall (even with only 24ping)\n-High knowledge required from new players for an effective game\n-Spit in the face attitude towards the long standing community\n\nextended version:\n\nThe game has a big variety of mercenaries, but only two are available at start. There are ammo providers with area denial abilities and the pure assault mercenaries, with either grenades or miniguns. There are health point variations between mercs making 1vs1 interesting. There are also a few snipers with no sway on their weapons (you do with this information what you want). Some neat medics with different health providing abilities and finally the engineers with tools to defend a certain point, planting, repairing and defusing faster than others.\n\nThe in-game credits can be gained pretty fast, given one plays regularly and does the different proposed missions each 3 hours. And unfortunately everything gets unlocked in under 300h. You have then still the loadout system to spend credits in. Basically, each merc has a set of 9 loadout cards which represents a unique combination of primary, secondary and melee weapon. A combination of three variants of each specific for each merc but sharing some weapons with others. Loadout come with different rarity levels. The bronze level is the base level with three augments or perks attached to each loadout. Rarer loadouts have exactly the same equipment and perks, but with a different skin. Lower than bronze loadouts, lose one perk at each level, making them worse. You start with a clean basic loadout and have to get better loadouts to reach at least bronze and be at the same level as everyone else. You can either get a case drop at the end of games, or pay 1000 in-game credits for one case.\n\nThe case system is based on randomness and you may get one random loadout of random rarity for a random merc (even one you do not have access to). You can pay for elite cases with real money this time. Elite cases contain silver as the lowest rarity you can get (it is one level of rarity above bronze). It's a money pit for people wanting a specific loadout in a specific color and rarity, but it doesn't affect the game in a pay 2 win fashion whatsoever so I don't mind.\n\nUnfortunately what affects the game alot is the numerous bugs that keep getting introduced and bug smashing seems to not be the developpers strength. They've even once removed a type of missions since they couldn't fix what was wrong with it. Althought their official statement was the removal due to the community's request. Ehem.. sure. Bugs are plentyful and come in many colors: dissapearing abilities, throwables that don't get thrown or get thrown twice, reviving that actually kills your ally, hit detection on certain deployable models is bad, getting kicked from the game by the anti-cheat because the anti-cheat engine isn't stable and keeps crashing, etc. The list is so long by now and they keep adding more bugs at each update. There is alot of frustration involved in running into theses bugs repeatedly. Especially the horrible looping sound bugs that have been around since closed beta.\n\nThe new and recent execution mode has also brought tons of bugs with it. Overall the mode containing two maps are not enough and the copying of the counter strike mode is a failure due to the game being set in an invariable 7vs7 setting and the ability to revive people. There is little strategy involved other than moving in a pack of 7...\n\nFinally the biggest issue of this game is the balancing/matchmaking. The competitive mode has a tendency to match you with strangers when you're playing alone and then makes you five strangers face a full pre-made team of 5 players. There's no fair matchmaking there I guarantee you. On top of that, balancing feels like its made by mokeys banging rocks together. The public matches are just the same. One game in 50 ends up being magically balanced. There is no real logic as to how players are matched with each other although the devs assure there's a hidden system. Unfortunately when you see people who are not even level 7 on one team paired up against people in the high 20's 30's it just doesn't make sense.\n\nThere is a vote shuffle function but as the system doesn't include non voters as a vote for the majority, people not wanting to vote or not noticing the vote being passed are not taken into account. This leads to many votes failing to pass, especially when a few players of the community vote "no" as for once they're in the overpowered team. Repeated stomping due to imbalanced games will do that to you.\n\nOn a final note, there is no incentive, nor forcing you to do the tutorial and many people skip it as they think it's just another shooter game. Countless times have I needed to tell people that you can revive downed allies as a medic or that as one specific merc you can provide ammo to yourself and others. There is no telling how much damage the newcomers  do to the health of a game. They lack all knowledge and there is nothing forcing them to stay in their max level 5 servers. Worse! The new way the quick join functionality works is that it only allows newcomers to play execution mode where there are no level limitations, then it gives you access to the other two modes, but there is no restriction (EDIT: has been changed for the time being). Furthermore, quick join works horribly bad, sending 8 people or more from europe to an american server to fill it (although one had specified EU region) instead of opening up a new server.\n\nAll in all the game can be fun, but too many shortcoming including the total lack of listening and communication with the comunity drives me nuts regarding this game. For the latest major update (the containment war (CW) update) they gave away a merc and for those who had him already they gave two elite cases and a unique rare loadout for said merc. Once the update was live, they launched for one month containment war cases, with a 0.3% chance of getting a CW limited loadout for regular cases, elite cases got 10%. To get a guaranteed CW limited loadouts, the only way of getting one was by buying a 10 pack of CW elite cases for 35 euros. It's not really an event if only highly paying people can get it. Most dissapointing was the fact that they wanted to reward long time players by giving out those gifts, yet warned everyone two weeks before it was actually going to happen. Worse, after all the player complaints about the low drop rates and promises of change, we got a repeat of the event for Christmas with the exact same drop rates. If that isn't a spit in the face of the community, I don't know what is...\n\nThe Dirty Bomb developers don't care about their actual community unless it is the paying one and they will do everything they can to bring in new blood rather than tend to long time players. So I don't recommend playing this in its current state and especially don't recommend spending any money on it.","November 4, 2015","false","449.2"," 111 of 169 people (66%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","66","111","169","11","48"

I'm a sucker for any urban maps, and thank goodness there's  a lot of them.\n+ Side objectives in the match which switches up tactics REAL quick.\n+ Case drops are so often (well for me) you'll get your 3 perk loadout in no time without spending your pocket change. You'll only use about 1,500 credits, which in the end is only 2 challenges.\n+ Challenges promote different game types to be played, which in the end thrive people to play not just Stopwatch, or Objective.\nEDIT: + Did you like Battlefield 3? Did you love Rush, and more importantly Operation Metro? Look no further, I get a major battlefield vibe from this game, and the map 'Underground' reminds me of the old Operation Metro.\n\nCons:\n- GRIND FEST - It's gonna take you A LOT of time for you to get that class you really want, or to get that 'rare' loadout color. Some classes cost 50,000 credits. Yes 50k. That's either 20+ hours of playing (given you're completing every challenge in the 3 hour rotation period, as well as starting out at 0 credits.) or buying to get the classes. I'd DEFINITELY recommend finding one class you love, buy it ASAP, and be happy with what you have!\n- Abilities are WAY TOO QUICK on cooldown. Do you like orbital strikes, or carpet bombs? Look no further you'll get spammed 24/7 with these abilities.\n- Cases = CS:GO cases. No no no, not just a gun skin, but everything in your loadout. No selection if you just want to get a card for Kira, or SawBonez, all by chance. No selction in skin you would like, perks, or the weapon type itself.\n- Medics overpowered. Yea let me jump off the walls up to 2 times with my perk so you can't shot me and blast you at point blank in the face with the shotgun. Hope you don't mind.\n- Like gambling? Save yourself money and don't play this game. You'll only throw your stuff just like Cro_ from CS:GO\n- No customization on your weapons. What if I don't want my sight on my gun? What if I want a red dot sight, or I want a blue camo, or maybe I want a silencer on my weapon!\nEDIT: - The voice chat is very bad quality; as in it sounds like the $20 mics that kids have on Xbox back in like 2008. If the mic qaulity was better, as if it was comparable to what the voice chat quality on CS:GO, I'd have no such issue.\n\nI did this review on June 8th 2015, just to let everyone know!\n\nOverall: 6.5/10 - I'll play it, but I don't know if I'd put hundreds of hours into it.","June 8, 2015","true","26.2"," 76 of 111 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","76","111","9","4"

So I'll make it simple and easy for them.\n\nPros-\n- Game runs well.\n- Game looks good. Very familiar feel for Brink players.\n- Gameplay is Fast and fun\n- Controls are tight and fluid.\n\nCons-\n- Mercs just cost too much, considering what you get.\n- Get ready to grind for ages for little reward if you F2P.\n- Balance issues. (Especially proximity mines and shotguns)\n- Loadout card system is awkward and rigid.\n- No real customization.\n- Hackers/Cheaters are becoming a problem.\n\n\nNow don't get all bent out of shape and mad because I'm not recommending a game you like folks. The game has a lot of potential and it can and will be good once they fix some things, in particular do a bit of balancing.\nI'd like to see more customization as well, as right now it's all dependant on the cards, literally.\n\nMy main argument against right now is just the balancing. I've seen too many rounds where as many people as possible switch to Aura just to use her shotgun. Also the proxy mines don't have an activation time, like they claim to. People are lobbing them as "stealth" grenades and they blow up on impact.\n\nMy secondary reason against recommending the game is the absurdly high price of the game.\nLet's do some math, shall we?\n\nYou get on average between 100c-150c per game.\nOne single loadout card costs 1000c.\nSo therefore you'll be playing 7-10 matches roughly, to earn one single loadout card. (Unless you're lucky enough to get a crate drop.)\nThat could easily be a couple of hours of play or more.\nNow open that card up to see what you get. Surprise! You got a lead card, because they have an 80% drop rate.\nNow let's take the average F2P player who didn't fork out money for mercs. They'll have 2 starter mercs, with 3 more to choose from the free rotation. 5 total. Out of 12.\nThis means you only have a 42% chance of that card being for a character you can even play.\nFortunately the game has an upgrading system, otherwise it would be a train wreck, so you'll need three lead cards to get to random one iron card for a merc of your choice.\n\nSo, you'll be looking at easily between 3-6 hours or more on average to get a SINGLE iron card for a merc you can use, and that's still going to be a random card, so you don't get to choose the loadout or what gun you want.\nAlso, that used all your credits, so you don't have the 30,000-50,000c needed to get another merc. So get cozy with the free rotation.\n\nYes, it's a F2P game, and yes the devs need to make their money, but there are a lot of better ways they could go about rather than force extremely long grinds on people to try to push them into buying something. That's simply a bad business model.\n\nDear devs, give me something I want to buy, for a game I can enjoy, and I will happily spend money. Don't punish me and push me for not buying into the game just to play without rigid restrictions. I will just find another game.\n\nOverall, I like the game though it can be frustrating at times, but I can't really recommend it to my friends because the cons will simply put them off.\n\nPossibly once some of these things are fixed/adjusted.","June 10, 2015","false","24.0"," 124 of 193 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","124","193","5","45"

You have probably already read a bunch of information on the game, so I won't go into details on gameplay aspects, but rather reflect on some things that come with a bit of playtime. Overall, I have found the game is shaping up well in many respects and the core product itself is addicting and satisfying.\n\nI think one of the important things to clarify is the loadout system and accusations of p2w elements. One thing that many people don't realise is that there is no gameplay impact/benefit for having silver and gold tier loadout cards over bronze. Bronze tier cards are fairly easily craftable and obviously are less rare when opening cases. I have bronze cards for all the classes I play and in some cases multiple. It does not take long to get hold of them, and even the benefits/perks they do give are in most cases trivial and not game-breaking anyway. Gold cards, for the moment, only grant a different skin. So in that sense, there isn't a huge advantage for people who have playtime on the game and have had time to acquire more loadout cards. As far as the competitive community goes, there are hopes that the loadout system might be revised in some way to promote more balanced and competitive play so that one team on a particular map isn't benefited in anyway because of a particular gun/perk on a loadout that the other team doesn't have access to, which I think only makes sense if the game has a desire to be a competitive FPS.\n\nThe other p2w accusation comes from the way mercs (classes) are acquired and introduced and also their relative strength to the other classes. As far as I know, in theory and in design no class should be "better" than another. Confusion comes however when certain classes are in their current state not completely balanced and they are off rotation. This creates a scenario where a class that is strong in the current balance of the game (which is far from finalised) but that isn't accessible to a starting player is viewed as a p2w element of the game. Essentially though this is not by design, but rather by virtue of the nature of balancing computer games. So, in short this game is not a p2w title by design, but because of the ever evolving question of balance, these accusations are being tossed around probably to get the attention of developers.\n\nI do however want to set realistic expectations with regard to how quickly you can unlock classes. To unlock classes through grinding out in-game credits takes a rather absurd amount of time, but is not impossible. For a lot of players that like the basic gameplay and want to try out classes quicker, the only real option is to pay money. I have no problems paying for games and rewarding developers for their hard work, however many would argue that the current price to unlock a single class is a bit high and I would agree with them. Personally, I think $6 is fine, but $10 is really pushing it with regard to what most players would see as reasonable to ask. It would be a real shame if people were deterred from playing the game simply because unlocking new classes is just two inaccessible.\n\nPlease try this game for yourself and don't be put off by people who have had a negative experience with it after 30 minutes of game time. I have already spent > 100 hours on this game playing with friends who also enjoy it and don't regret it, and I think if you give it a fair go neither will you. Taking up a new game is generally not easy, especially if the game is worthwhile.","April 16, 2015","true","533.0"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","36","46","2","0"

The game has five overall "classes", Medic, Support, Assault, Engineer and Recon. Now, back to the loadouts I was talking about earlier. Loadouts come from cases (they have RNG chance to drop after any match or you can buy them from their in-game store for 1000 credits, trust me, it's not that much), maxing out at bronze (actually it's Cobalt but anything above Bronze is purely cosmetic) with 3 perks that can "help" your merc, imo 90% of them are useless apart from the Chopper perk (which is the only perk that actually adds damage, to your melee, except for that, no other damage perks for any other weapons), moving on, loadouts come with 3 different weapons, Primary (Rifle, SMG, Sniper, whatever you get the idea), Secondary (Pistol or weaker SMG for some classes) and melee obviously.\n\nNow this is the part that made the game for me stale:\n\nOverall loadouts come with a lot of different perks, but roughly the same 3 or 4 primary, secondary or melee weapons. For example:\n\nA Recon merc will always have a sniper (unless we're counting Phantom, the spooky invisible ghost, that has SMGs as primaries), a Medic will always have either a shotgun or that one rifle, okay everything seems fine and dandy right? Well what if I told you that Engineers use exactly the same weapons as the medics, almost all Support classes use some Assault rifle, see AK47 and M4 from CS, or a burst rifle that fires 3 shots per click (not interchangeable with full auto-fire). Some Support mercs don't even have an assault rifle at all and just burst rifles (which makes you keep a distance and really focus on your aim on a game that's based around movement.\n\nAnyway, I presume that you can now tell how the game got stale for me after so much playtime, using the same weapons on multiple mercs, having the same damage, it's easy to get bored of playing the "same" thing, the only difference sometimes only being the special skills on the merc, for example some repair objectives or plant C4's faster, some give out ammo, some heal, etc. But that's it.\n\nI think, to conclude, the game is good, apart from some bugs here and there, totally worth a try or 7, I mean, I was addicted to it at some point, so like any review, take what I'm saying with a grain of salt, mainly because I have friends that are still playing the game a lot. I am still playing the game now and then for an hour or two, but overall there's just not enough variety for me, anymore.","May 13","true","564.4"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","33","41","6","2"

Some classes performed stronger than others naturally, but that was prettymuch always a matter of people's playstyles matching to that classes' strengthes.\n3) The maps are well built, guiding players to objectives without feeling too strongly corridor based. They're all rather gorgeous too, with the design hinting strongly at an interesting "Just what the hell happened here" type of story. The way access to multiple paths are controlled by sub-objectives was a fun mechanic as well.\n4) Kinda an extension of #3, but it bears note: The map designs and gamemodes encouraged teamplay rather strongly. It was genuinely rare for people to not work together to some degree, because you simply couldn't success lone-wolfing, and your teammates tended to gather around objectives alongside you anyways, thanks to the various mechanics at work.\n\nThe F2P elements of it looked a little funny initially, but earning enough to keep unlocking wasn't much of a problem previously, and there wasn't ever any indications of pay to win (They even gave out money to unlock 'premium' characters at one point, and none of them were ever "Play this character to win", just more interesting playstyles and options).

It isn't an A+ but I'd give it about B+, it is fun, easy to pick up and since it's free there really isn't much to lose.\nIf you enjoy FPS with a fast pace, then download this game.\n\nDid I mention it's free?\n\nAnd since people seem to need specification. I mean that it feels like playing the multiplayer of CoD; simple action, running & gunning with quick death, characters who look similar and mostly it's the number of people shouting or typing the word 'noob'\nYes, the game has objectives like CS:GO, Red & Blue teams like TF2 but the combat reminds me of CoD more than either of those two.","June 2, 2015","true","5.6"," 63 of 94 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","63","94","7","4"

Like Enemy Territory before it, Dirty Bomb is a fast-paced, team oriented game where offense has to escort, capture, or destroy a series of objectives in order to win a map. Movement speed is fast and weapon spread very low, resulting in very frantic gameplay.\n\nSplash Damage has made the same game basically four times now in different packages, so the game has built on the qualities of prior games (and learned from failures, not to mention any names...). This particular iteration has turned out really good. A lot of the issues with prior games by Splash Damage I felt have been the maps more than anything else. Balance on asymmetrical maps is a very, very hard thing to do but this game manages to do it well. The number of times a game will come down right to the wire is truly amazing. Win or lose, unless the teams are completely and utterly stacked, there are fun moments to be had.\n\nAs far as how the game is monetized... you get two free characters, Skyhammer and Aura, and two heroes on random rotation. You can unlock more characters permanently by accumulating enough of the ingame currency through playing. Additionally, loadouts come on cards. You get the cards in cases which are random drops, or you can buy them with in-game or real money. If you want a specific loadout you can buy them, but it costs more. There are higher tier cards too, but these cards are cosmetic only. Is it pay to win? Not really. They should probably let you have an objective specialist type character to start since it's such an important role, but there isn't one. There's a bit of a grind, but it's probably the most fair way to do everything. For free to play it's rather nonintrusive.\n\nFree to Play just keeps getting better and better, and Dirty Bomb is just the latest example of it. Whether you're a skeptic or not, the game's worth trying. There's nothing to lose after all, and the game is a total of 3GB. If you're a fan of fast paced FPS this is definitely worth a look.","June 12, 2015","true","146.7"," 47 of 68 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","47","68","0","0"

The card loadout system feels contra-productive. Your whole experience will have its roots on RNG, it's up to you how you feel about that. I fore one, think it is misplaced in a fps game.\nThere is a complete lack of customisation, you can't change your characters loadout unless you have another card for him, which you will only receive via crates you get by leveling up your account or purchasing them in the store.\nIt should be noted that those are completely RNG based as well, meaning you can't choose for which character you want a crate.\nThe merc prices are just ridiculous, it goes up to 50.000 credits for a merc to unlock.\nTo put this in perspective, a crate costs 1000, you will receive around 100 per match. Meaning if you want to unlock e.g. Fragger, you have to save 50.000 credits and you will have to play the whole time with the exact same loadout with the few characters you got.\nThe grind in this game is unreal, furthermore it is not rewarding nor is there any 'wow' factor, since higher cards only offer more passive skills for your character which in case of a fps game, they are rather marginal and not noteworthy.\n\nAt it's current state I don't see how this game could possibly spark my interest to the point where this could become an evening game for me. There is no progression, no customisation, un-innovative classes and skills.\n\nDirty Bomb tries to hard to copy existing games, while failing to develope it's own character and charm.","March 29, 2015","false","10.8"," 196 of 327 people (60%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","60","196","327","11","10"

I don't really pay attention to f2p games, but this one reminded me of the game called BRINK, sadly it was both broken & dead as soon as it came out.\nThe in game shop isn't the best but neither the worst. You get coins after every match you've completed successfully. Is it easy to gather coins? Well, to be honest it takes time to progress, but you will get those bloody coins sooner or later. The new characters cost 50,000 coins, the older ones are at 30,000 each. If you buy the Starter pack you get the first 5 and an additional 50k coins you can spend either on cases or on mercenaries.\nIf you do not want to play days just to obtain enough coin to buy your most wanted merc, you can purchase it for real money, but as in every single f2p game, it has its own price, which isn't that cheap. The character system is something like in LoL, there are free rotations, which allows you to try out the chosen mercenaries and buy them if they convinced you.\nThe game is a mix of CS GO and TF2, theres parkour and different kind of mercenaries along with sniper, demo, medic, support , heavy and so on.\nThere is both Public matchmaking and Competetive matchmaking, the second one unlocks after lv5, currently there are two game modes, objective and stopwatch + execution is around the corner.\n\nI can't really say anything bad for it at the moment, It definitely worths a try.","July 12, 2015","true","657.5"," 47 of 70 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","47","70","3","6"

Their Sodium Chloride tears will be so tasty that you will keep playing the objective and end up on top of each scoreboard.\n\nFAST PACED GAMEPLAY. If you're used to slow paced shooters, boy will you have a hard time. Things can go so fast, you can be aiming at a Proxy (a super fast eningeer and really annoying but super loveable) and in 2 seconds she is behind you and knifes you. And to put the cherry on the cake, she WILL T-bag you and you WILL rage/tilt all over the place.\n\nWall jumps! Yes there are wall jumps in this game! And this allows for some tricky routes to backdoor your opponents!\n\nRoles: There are Engineers, Fire Supporters (airstrike, laserbeams,...), medics, recons, and who knows what more in the future. The engineer for example can fix certain objectives faster than non-eningeers, medics can revive dead Mercs, etc.\n\nUnique Mercs: "Shotgun! I call Shotgun! Because I have a...Shotgun!" That's one of Proxy's (the super fast eningeer) sarcastic taunts. All mercs are unique, have a backstory and some amazing (bad) puns, jokes, philosophies and observations.\n\nDeveloppers who interact with the community. Yes this game is published by Nexon, NO this game is NOT p2w. Spalsh damage (the devs, also known from Wolfenstein E.T. and Brink) are fantastic when it comes to interaction with the community. Even though their dev team is relatively small and updates are taking a while, they put their hart and thought in each update and LISTEN to the community, which is one of the most important aspects of a F2P game\n\nAs I said, this game is NOT p2W. Let's get that clear! Everything is unlockable in-game, with in-game credits. You get a free 25k credits when you reach level 4, which will allow you to buy a 30k lerc, or save furhter to buy a 50k merc\nYou can pay with real money. But this is reserved for Credit boosters, Elite cases ( which contain Silver, Gold and Cobalt loadouts, more on that later) and bundles. But nothing of these gives a certain p2w feel to this game\n\nCustomization based on Loadout cards: This one is huuuuuuge. Each Merc has their own set of loadout cards. These loadout cards have certain augments. The loadoutcards are ranked based on their rarity.\n\nLeadIronBronzeSilverGoldCobalt\nAs you can see, there are 6 rarities (there are also occasional rairities like Obsidian, which is for Closed beta fighter, and special loadout cards for specific events). Lead, Iron and Bronze are the most important ones. Silver, Gold and Cobalt are practically the "shiny" versions of loadout cards. But these cards do not give you a stronger advantage over other opponents.\n\nNow these loadoutcards have these things called Augments. Lead has 1 augment, Iron has 2 and Bronze has 3, which is the max amount of augments you can have). These augements can aid you in-game. For example: the Augment Chopper gives\nyou 15% increased melee damage. Each loadout card has a mix of augments which can alter your playstyle. Check out the guide section for more explanation. There are offensive, defensive and balanced loadoutcards, so pick one that fits your playstyle!\nI can go on and on with this review, but I'll keep it wiithin limits, I'll probably just write a guide about this game heh.\n\nWhat I can say though: This game is not perfect, it's still in beta, there are bugs which are sometimes frustrating. But that doesn't mean that we, as a community can help this game grow bigger and better. Trust me when I say that this is potentially one of the best f2p shooters on the market and with proper support and proper fans, this game will be one of the best ever remembered.\n\nBut hey, go check it out and decide for your self!","April 3","true","84.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","20","23","3","2"

You might remember that company from titles such as: "Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory", "Enemy Territory: Quake Wars" and "Brink".\n\nThe main goal of this game is to complete multi-staged objectives as a team. I've noticed that if a team just goes around doing what they desire to do, you'll probably fail on even capturing/completing the first objective. That said, to have these multi-stage objectives you need big maps. And big doesn't always mean good, but Splash Damage have tried their upmost on most of these maps & have succeeded in many of them. Hats off to them.\n\nSo this game is a class-based fps where the players are divided into 2 teams: 'Attackers' & 'Defenders'. This means that the 'Attackers' have to complete a series of objectives in a certain amount of time. While the 'Defenders' must stop the 'Attackers' from doing so.\nFrom what I've played I can tell that your team needs to consist of a certain amount of 'mercs' (these are the different classes) to be able to push & capture/complete an objective.\n\nFor example there are a few mercs that have a special ability called: 'Objective Specialist'. This means that those mercs will capture/complete an objective far quicker than a normal merc would.\nBasically each merc has their unique capabilities to thelp their team complete the objectives.\n* The Fragger pushes with grenades & takes out the enemy & their defences.\n* The Medic supports their team by reviving the players & giving out health.\n* The Skyhammer clears out huge areas by air-striking them\n& so on\n\nOn to the gamemodes\n- Objective\nI already explained this one a few paragraphs above.\n\n- Stopwatch\nThis gamemode is very similar to the Objective game mode, but 2 games are played. In the 2nd game the Attackers & Defenders switch sides & try to complete the objectives in a faster time than the previous team.\n\n- Competetive\nThere is a also a competetive gamemode where you & 4 friends/random players will queue up against 5 other players. A Stopwatch game will be played on a randomly chosen map and after a few competetive matches you will get a 'rank'. This rank will tell you what skill level you are and it will match you up with players of the same skill.\n\nOn the the business model\nThere are 15 mercs available in game & you start of with 2 free ones. Skyhammer & Aura. There is also a weekly rotation of 2 to 3 mercs. That means that for an entire week you can play These 3 mercs for free and after that week those mercs are exchanged for 3 others.\n\nBut what if you want to play a certain merc for more than a week? Well you can buy that merc for real money or ingame currency. You can earn this currency by playing matches in any of the game modes. Each day you also get a couple missions that you can complete by playing the game, after every complete mission you get a certain amount of currency. Once you have purchased a merc (prices are 30 & 50 thousand ingame currency) you own it for good.\n\nBut wait there is more. Each merc has a large number or loadout cards that change the primary, secondary & melee weapon as well as a few extra added 'augments' (these are certain skills that will help your merc in some things like giving out extra ammo packs or having more healing power on the med packs).\nThe loadout cards come in different qualities.\n\n* Default: every merc starts with a default card & have 0 augments\n* Lead: 1 augments & desert camo\n* Iron: 2 augments & khaki camo\n* Bronze: 3 augments & forest green camo\n* Silver: 3 augments & carbon fiber camos\n* Gold: 3 augments & gold camo\n* Cobalt: 3 augments & blue camo\n* Obsidian: Obtainable via a promotion only & 3 augments\n\nYou can get these cards by opening cases. There are 2 kinds of cases, an equiment case & an elite case.\n- The equipment case can give you any card (except for the Obsidian one) & can be acquired by just playing the game or you can buy them for 1000 ingame currency.\n- The elite case gives you a silver, gold or cobalt card & can be purchased for ingame money.\n\nIn conclusion: Dirty Bomb is a innovative game in the fps type of games. It adds a few new & funky things to a otherwise normal & dull Call of Duty Modern Warfare 68. The gameplay is solid & polished, a few lag spikes and connection issues here and there (but that is normal for any game). The graphics are in a sort of cartoon style which makes the game more easy to look at (for me at least). It's a good game in it's category with a smart business model & nice gameplay.\n\nMuffs\n\nEdit 1: As you can probably read I only have about 30 hours in the game. This however isn't totally true because I've played about 150 hours in the closed beta of the game!\nPlease keep this in mind when judging my review.

Now don't let the fact that its f2p put you off, because even though its kinda grindy(around 20hrs to permanently unlock most characters if you're a skilled player) it's absolutely not p2w in any way, because free players get the exact same treatment as premium with an assortment of unique characters all of which you'll eventually get to try out on rotation sooner or later before buying them. The character cards' bonus stats are fairly well balanced in the sense that you can still do good with a default build because it always seems to come down to skill in my experience. These character cards are obtained through cases which you get simply for playing the game or by trading up your previously obtained cards with in-game gold for your desired characters. IMO whats really cool about this game is how ALL the characters are OP if they're played to their strengths, they're all unique with their special perks/abilities and TF2 style appearances. The maps' design is top notch and the game modes are designed to encourage objective play. Also the movement feels really tight with the ability to perform wall jumps and bunnyhops. So if you're in the market for a fun team based fps this is it!\n\nSome of my gameplay as Sparks, a sniper medic...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510941983","October 28, 2015","true","651.9"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","28","40","0","4"

The game seems to be either a hit or a miss depending on what side you are on. It takes lving to lv 6 to get a new character and trying to get another is going to take more time. You get 600 for each daily ( 3 a day) plus 50-120 per fight. It would take a 2-3 weeks of causal play to get another unit. The game just isnt that fun to grind that much. Wait til full release and hope they listen.\n\n==========================================================\nUpdate review 6/6/15 open beta\n\nSo as promised here is an updated review.\n\nThe good\n-Gold is alot easier to get\n-New characters\n-Solid gun play\n-Good selection of guns and abilities\n\nThe Bad\n-Although each character is unique, they don't feel unique. ( i have a machine gun aura that plays alot like the other medic).\n-I still find that I either get rolled or do the rolling, balance still needs work\n-Maps get old fast\n-I am not sure why but I find thise game boring ( mileage may vary)\n-Needs new modes as two of the modes are basically the same thing.\n\nThe Meh\n-You have to double ready for the game, not a bad point but not a good one either\n-Why does the game feel the need to remind me of the objective everytime i play. There is no need.\n-Not sure why but spawn time vary greatly. Insta died just out of spawn and it took 20secs to respawn, other times is like 2-5 secs.\n\n\nWhile I won't be playing the game myself, I can say that it is worth a try to see if its up your alley. At this point, I still can't recommend this game unless you really need a shooter. I'd wait until at least full release to try, as at that point there should be more maps and better balance.\n\n===================================================================\nUpdated review 2/6/2016\n\nI want so bad to like this game but still cant recommend it. Money has been fixed and alot of the bugs but the one thing that is still horrible is the balancing. There are some nights i can only play 2 games because it is just that bad. Once they fix the balancing then I can recommend it but until they play at your own risk.","March 29, 2015","false","75.6"," 138 of 238 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","138","238","8","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrmayge/recommended/333930/","mrmayge","Defib Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrmayge/","130 products in account","I downloaded Dirty Bomb expecting another soulless free-to-play FPS game that I could put a couple hours into whenever I felt like mindlessly shooting things.\nIn that regard, I was dissapointed. My expectations were exceeded a thousand-fold.\nThis game is exactly what games under the free-to-play model should strive for; a solid experience for all players that the dedicated will gladly hand over cash for. Its pricing model reminds me of MOBA giant League of Legends- you have a few characters unlocked from the get-go, and get to sample a few extras every week, and you can unlock your favorites slowly with free currency, or unlock them instantly for cash.\nBut Dirty Bomb's respect for its players and their wallets are of course not the only reason for my reccomendation. The game is unique, balanced and, most importantly, fun!\nPlayers start each match by selecting three of the "mercs" that they have unlocked. Each merc has strengths and weaknesses that will determine the player's role on the field. Skyhammer, the first character the player meets in the tutorial, is a basic fighter/assault character with a fairly high HP and a rifle with decent mid-range capabilities. He can supply his teammates with ammo packs and call in airstrikes. This latter ability is Skyhammer's "unique" power. Every character has a distinct ability as well as one shared by other, similar characters.\nMy personal favorite, Sparks, is a quick healer character armed with an SMG and a unique ability that allows her to revive teammates from range. She is easily dispatched, but if you work with a team full of assaults that know their roles, she can be extremely effective on the field despite her squishiness.\nOnce your squad is selected, you are dropped into a game and tasked with either completing a list of objectives or delaying the enemy team from doing so. Depending on the map, your team will either be rushing to move a cart or plant and defend a bomb or carry batteries or drugs...the game is very dynamic in this regard.\nAdding to this dynamic nature is map-specific side-objectives that can turn the tide for one team or another. Running along the side of a map to the objective as Sparks, I noticed a platform indicating possible interaction. I pressed the action button and built a bridge to another section of the map that was previously only accesible by the enemy team. My team then rushed up the new bridge and dispatched the sniper that had been giving everyone trouble the whole game.\n\nThis game is currently in beta but it is already a fantastic experience, and if you're on the fence about downloading, I'd say it is 100% worth a try.","April 20","true","20.4"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","26","37","2","2"

I anticipate putting in a bit of time, and I'm definitely hoping there's a competitive league or set of tournaments of sorts. I mean, I'm starting out at the Gold 5 rank. Why let that go to waste? Well, let me list off my list of pros, cons, and maybe hope a dev might see some of my grievances, and maybe we can learn about some of their choices in the game. I'd love to see this game thrive.\n\nPROS The game plays fast. Very, VERY fast. Skill in tracking is a requirement, not an option.\nA wide variety of mercs with individual skillsets, and all in all you can play your own way...I stuck to Sawbonz right off the bat.\nThe community's fairly good. Few rotten apples, but that's in every community.\nThe ranked matchmaking is very fun. Not quite finished yet, but hey, it's beta.\nMovement is very fluid. It's FUN to go from point A to point B. Remember to run with your knife out!\nHeavily skill-based (aside from a few classes...)\nEasy to run, even on a lower end PC.\nLoadout cards to give your character a nice loadout, each with its own weapons and abilities.\nDevs seem to like to interact with the community.\nAnd best of all? IT'S FREE!\n\nCONS (kind of, more or less minor gripes) Some major balancing issues, namely with Aura and Nader. They're both a little bit OP. Aura's default shotgun is way too powerful, and Nader's ability to just spam to no end is worse than demos who only use stickies in TF2. What's worse is those grenades insta-kill most of the time.\nThe game clearly isn't the most stable yet. I've had a few chugs here on a GTX 970/i5-4590 @ 3.30GHz. It isn't common, though, and for what it stands here in beta, the game runs very well.\nMicrotransactions can be a thing, or you can grind FOREVER to get the merc you want. It gives the illusion of pay to win. Luckily, this is semi-subverted by the fact that by level 5 in EXP, you can have the one merc you wanted, and it'll keep you happy for a long while. Also, there are some mercs who get put into rotation for free every couple weeks, and it always keeps things fresh for gameplay. I intend on maining Sawbonz for a while, especially if I go into a league, support medic seems to be my thing!\nThe unboxing reminds me too much of CS:GO. Stop giving me Lead Fletchers please ;-;\n\nThe Final Verdict! Dirty Bomb is quite possibly one of the best F2P shooters I've played in a long time. I used to love TF2 to death, but now...I don't know. The fast-paced gameplay combined with the skill required to aim, the coordination in matchmaking that me and my friends can pull off is just something that I can't define. It's easy to get sucked in, and that's the type of game I like. I'm considering dropping a little cash on it to support the devs, I mean, it's a free game, and it's really the only way they can make money without putting ads into the game. I'd like to know if and or when we'll be getting the ability to put up our own servers, and who knows, maybe a league can take off from there! But for now, I'd like to see the game exit beta safely. The game has a lot of potential as it stands, and while a few characters require nerfs (*cough* Aura and Nader, Aura needs her shotgun to be weakened, Nader needs a longer skill cooldown *coughcough*), the game is very balanced, and very enjoyable on that note for what it is. This is a game I'd HIGHLY recommend to anybody who is a fan of FPS games, and who knows, if the devs keep it up we could have an amazing game, with an amazing competitive side.\n\nJust whatever you do, Splash Damage, do NOT rush this game, please. This game's too good, and I do not want it to die.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Get this game. It's fun, fast-paced, and enjoyable. It has micro transactions and a couple of imbalances, but it still calls for a good time.","June 11, 2015","true","78.4"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","25","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deynarian/recommended/333930/","deynarian","Deynarian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deynarian/","204 products in account","This is a free to play, (pay to progress - but only to speed up progress) fast paced and highly competitive first person shooter. Dirty Bomb features mercenaries tasked with retrieving or destroying objectives in return for credits in a London devastated by a - you guessed it - dirty bomb. There are currently five maps in rotation with several more in development & testing, but they all provide a fairly balanced and fun layout to play with, and the new maps look to be getting even larger - which will be good hopefully!\n\nThere are three gamemodes currently; Stopwatch, Objective and the newly added / still in testing Execution game mode - Stopwatch revolves around both teams trying to complete the objectives for the chosen map faster than their opponent, after which they switch sides (attackers to defenders) and the winner is decided on the faster team.\n\nObjective mode is simply stopwatch without the team switch, and as such one team defends the objective, the other attacks it until time runs out or all objectives are complete.\n\nExecution mode is relatively new, and consists of 10 rounds where the teams attempt to win more rounds than the other, by playing the objective or killing all the enemies on the map. This mode has the added rule that when you die, and are 'gibbed' (stabbed so that a medic cannot revive you), you will need to wait til the next round begins to continue playing. Medics can revive provided you are not executed, alá the game mode title.\n\nEnough about the modes, you probably understand the only thing you need to: objective - uhb-jek-tiv, play that and you win. Simple!\n\nOnto the characters, or mercs. There are currently 14 mercs available for play, with the newest being Phantom - a stealthy melee oriented class who has caused some controversy as to what the game is aiming for. The mercs each have a subcategory which are as follows:\n\n- [Fire] Support classes:\n* Arty, whom can call down artillery with his targeting designator from afar and provide his team with ammo via ammo packs.\n* Kira, who loves to light up the sky with her orbital laser strike, which she can guide around using the laser tool to cause maximum precision chaos from safety. She also deploys ammo stations to keep teammates well stocked throughout the fight.\n* Skyhammer, one of the free mercs you get right off the bat, who has the ability to throw an airstrike marker to gib and demolish his foes, and also damage certain objectives such as generators and the EV when defending (Kira and Arty can also damage these objectives). Skyhammer will oft throw ammo packs like his fellow support class Arty.\n\n- Recon classes:\n* Vassili, the sniper-est sniper there ever was, Vassili was the first of the recon classes added to open play, and can be devastating to enemy pushes if he can aim and position well. His heartbeat sensor can be vital to knowing enemy movements.\n* Phantom, the all-American hero in his own mind, this backstabber is aimed at executing medics and other squishy vital classes. His ability is a cloak that makes him fairly invisible. The cloak can be removed with Vassili's heartbeat sensor if the two come in close proximity.\n\n- Medic classes:\n* Aura, the shotgun wielding, heal station hero, who keeps the team healed and happy, alive, not dead. Her main ability is a healing station she can place nigh almost anywhere on the map which heals in a small radius, and can almost outheal all damage sources if placed right. She can also revive fallen teammates with the defib paddles. Aura, along with Skyhammer is one of the mercs you get for free!\n* Sawbonez, the ex-military CQC SMG-specialist who throws large healing packs, potent enough to bring even the most deathly ill back to the land of the living, and doing it with style. Sawbonez - with a Z! - also holds the key to close range life and death with his defib paddles.\n* Sparks, the super fast gal with a hundred names, and a wonderful piece of reviving and sniping technology. Sparks can reanimate people from afar with her REVIVR gun, which when charged is equally as good at reviving teammates as it is at killing enemies. Sparks has far less potent healing packs in contrast to Sawbonez, but they are no less helpful in a pinch.\n\n- Engineer classes:\n* Proxy, the savvy and snappy Brit who loves to sap the lives of her foes via proximity mines strewn across the map, Proxy is also an objective specialist who has a 50% boost to completing objectives (such as repairing generators).\nThe objective specialist is present on all engineer classes.\n* Fletcher, who is the best. That's why he costs more! No but seriously, Fletcher is an engineer with an explosive surprise: sticky bombs! Create traps alá Proxy style, cover objectives or doorways that are important, or else use them as renewable grenades!\n* Bushwacker, the man with the extra gun. Bushwacker comes equipped with a turret buddy who can be placed almost anywhere needed, but for best results, try placing them on flank routes or behind where you will be fighting, and get a nice crossfire going. The turret is fairly weak healthwise, but can pack a good punch with its firepower if placed right.\n\n- Assault classes:\n* Nader, the business lawyer turned merc who has a renewable (don't ask me how) grenade launcher which can spit little eggs of death! Or was that dess? I'm not bilingual I'm afraid. Nader can shut down areas of defense and offense if her nades are utilised correctly, and even if she dies, she comes back post mortem with an explosive surprise called matyrdom, where she detontates herself and any nearby enemies!\n* Fragger, the traffic cop, uh no, sorry; the man with the second biggest gun! His parking tickets - no wrong again! His frag grenades will cause chaos and death if cooked for long enough, and his LMG does nothing to ease the enemy's pain (except perhaps a quick death?). Many soon find out why Fragger is called what he is.\n* Rhino, now for the man with the biggest gun, Rhino is a monster of a man who can hold entire areas if paired with a medic such as Aura with his minigun, which doesn't run dry on ammo, and instead can overheat quickly if used wrongly. Rhino is the merc with the most health, and as such, should not be taken lightly.\n\n\nDidn't realise how much I had written up until now, so TL;DR if you want it!\n\nTL;DR: Dirty Bomb is a crazy fun F2P FPS, which has an alright business model where you can pay to progress faster (unlock characters quicker) and it provides a decently balanced game for the most part, where each character feels powerful, and matches that are all objective focused feel tense right down to the last second. Also, to mention one last thing - there is a certain movement to the game where walljumping is possible, which adds a layer or two to fighting. Thought it was worth a mention.\n\nGreat game, hope it does well in the future!\n\nEDIT: Changed phantom's description due to patch fixes.","July 18, 2015","true","113.2"," 60 of 100 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","60","100","6","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/42_/recommended/333930/","42_","Mango","http://steamcommunity.com/id/42_/","905 products in account","Dirty Bomb is quite an anomaly in the F2P arena. It has solid mechanics and base gameplay. Everything is accessible to everyone. You do have to have to buy new characters to use and loadouts (which vary up the weapon selection and minor perks), but the time it takes seems fair. There are plenty of missions that rotate every three hours and daily bonuses that allow you to rack up 1000s of credits every day in addition to receiving credits for just playing. A new merc will take you about 1-2 weeks to unlock if you time your missions right.  If you don't want to use in-game credits for this, there is the option to spend real world money. This does seem a bit high for what you get though and I recommend getting the bundle when it goes on sale. You're not at a loss for choice though at the start. You get Aura (a medic) and Skyhammer (a fire support class / jack of all trades type) permanently for free in addition to three rotating mercs that are freely available and change up every few weeks.\n\nThe feel of the game is quite smooth. There are plenty of trickjumps and shortcuts to find on the various maps. Just about every weapon is hitscan. This means that damage is dealt directly to whatever it is you click on. You can generally take several shots before dying and with a medic nearby to revive you, you're never too long removed from the action. It's similar in several ways to Enemy Territory, another free game released a decade ago by the same team, that was hugely popular as well as TF2. There are similar classes that you can choose from. Medics revive and heal. Assault dishes out damage as well as taking it. Fire support provides your team with ammo and helps destroy objectives and whole teams from afar. Engineers repair much faster as well as planting/defusing bombs. And Recon helps your team with map awareness and picking off enemies from a distance. Lots of basic functionality is shared across the classes and there's plenty of combinations to choose from if you're looking for something that'll fit your playstyle.\n\nFinally, the community itself is fairly laid-back and welcoming. Especially compared with other FPSes I've played. And I've been playing since the 90s. This is likely a result of how small it is. There's something like 3-4k players on typically. Just enough to have a decent selection of servers across multiple maps and game modes. In addition to there being pick-up games you can find being formed across the many community voice servers if you're looking for more of a challenge.\n\nThere is some hitching with certain combinations of hardware and software. It's recommended that you get a CPU that is very powerful on one core at least. The latest quad-core from Intel overclocked a decent amount should allow consistent 144 fps and up. A mid-range GPU should suffice. I can personally run this at 1440p @ 144hz on a 4930k @ 4.3ghz and a 7970 ghz Edition @ 1165 Core / 1575 Memory. I generally get up to 200fps with this setup and the GPU runs at about 40-60% usage.\n\nThis is probably among the better deals in not only F2P games, but more expensive ones as well. TF2 players will love it for the similarly fast paced action and the different classes provided. CS:GO players will enjoy the small teams and similar weaponry that they are already used to. Not to mention the greatly reduced recoil.

Like with a lot of F2P games, new players will be shephered into noobie friendly (and enjoyable) areas and eventually released into the cold brutal reality that is the larger playerbase.\n\nThe art style is nice, with good graphics and interesting maps with lots of alternate routes and side objectives.\n\nPerks and loadouts are determined by random drops.  Most of them are minor but there are a few significant perks that make a big difference in the way you can play, and its completely random whether you get them or not.\n\nThere is a distinct lack of teamplay in the rounds I played in.  Most of the game is centered around TDM rather than the actual objectives. This is pretty par for the course for modern games though.\n\nThe guns feel same-y, which is to say, not very strong.  Headshots are king, as they do not suffer from damage fall off. Therefore, weapons with the fastest firing rate and lowest recoil are the ones players gravitate towards.\n\nOverall I enjoyed myself while I was learning the ropes but quickly stopped enjoying myself once I realized what was going on.","May 20, 2015","false","5.1"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","2"

But I like the majority have never had a problem with it. You have to consider the fact that the Anti-cheat system has changed. Those reviews was back when it was still in closed beta mode. And in one of its latest updates the developers did know that this was a problem and even told us that they identified as a problem and that they are trying to fix it. So yes they did update the anti-cheat and it's fine\n\nThis game is very enjoyable and a big adictive. The graphics mechanics in movements of the mercs are well done. Yes this is a point a shot game, like with nearly all FPS games. This games is a multiplayer game only with 3 modes as of now. Execution, where you only get one life per round as you play attacker or defender in which case the attacker arms the C4 where as the defenders try and stop them from disarming the C4 or defusing it. The Objective mode where the attackers will have to do the objective and defenders stop the attackers from doing it, and stopwatch where it's a timed match of which team can a set of objectives or just one depending the fastest\n\nThere are many mercs in this game, each with their abilities. At the moment there are 18 mercs. But i think they will add\nmore as this is still in development. Each merc is catagorized in different classes. Slayer, which are mercs used soley to kill the enemy. Support, mercs that help their team with their perks or abilites such as giving ammo. Medics, mercs that help your team by giving them health or reviving them. And lastly the Engineers, these are the mercs that are specifically desgined to do the objective or the goal of the match. Unlike the rest of the mercs engineers or objective specialists can arm the C4, defuse the C4, repair the EV (a vehicle which looks like a tank) etc. much quicker.\n\nEach merc has their own set of different abilites that they can use. For example Thunder can throw concussio grande, Vasili who is a sniper can use his heart beat sensor to locat enemies within a range and Fletcher can use his ability to throw stick bombs and defuse them. Just to name a few! These mercs also come with loadout cards which change the type of weapon they have, what they wear, for example the special edition cards form the latest update which you get from cases for the trinket update give your merc a christmas winter look!\n\nSo if your a player who likes shooting with variety of special options in this fast pased game (don't worry it's normal once you play) than you will love this game. This game is very fun and enjoyable!

There is a lot of variety in most maps and the dynamic objectives are really fun.\n\nThere is progression in the game that can give slight advantages to players, but it's not game breaking. I can not say any of those slight advantages ever felt like I lost a fire-fight because of them, and more because I messed up.\n\nWith that said, the game is highly skill based and we have a lot of guys who have extremely good aim and will down you very quickly. Working as a team is the best way to win because of the dynamic objectives spread out through them map.\n\nUsing your classes strengths to their maximum potential will really highlight what team compositions counter other compositions. Some classes are run and gun and are extremely mobile and will flank  to destroy back line defenses (turrets, mines, health/ammo stations, defibbers). Other classes are slower but have clear power to roll through people who are caught in their fire.\n\nThe buddy system isn't implemented yet, well at least not an in-game buddy system. You have to search through Steam's terrible database of all players, and you're lucky if your friends on DB have a unique name. If not, you'll be searching thousands of players on steam, or having to ask them to change their name to something stupid so that you can find them.\n\nPutting money into the game just helps unlock classes and class variations. You can unlock everything with in-game currency so no worries. Putting money does make it easier to unlock the class variation that you want rather than having to spend in-game currency on lock boxes (think CoD chests). Honestly, putting in 5 bucks for your favorite class is an awesome way to support the devs in this incredible game!\n\nWhy did I spend so much time typing this -__-","June 2, 2015","true","25.0"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","23","36","0","0"

Sorry. My nostalgic trip was to highlight all the interesting and creative things I could do in ET. When I compare that to Dirty Bomb I'm just not finding the same scope of gameplay. Obviously Dirty Bomb is a different game but   I find it lacks depth and could be so much more. Splash Damage just makes these types of games so the comparison is always going to be made in my eyes.\n\n\nI'm a huge ET fan. It's the one game I look back the most fondly. As another review said this is what BRINK should have been and I totally agree. However it just doesn't quite capture the magic of ET. Perhaps I'm wearing rose coloured glasses... But it's the yard stick I measure ALL Splash Damage games with.\n\nI only played Covert Op (enemy in disguise) back in the day and I miss the little things I could do as that class. This is why the magic is missing for ME -> I can't be as creative as I used to be.\n\n- Capture the forward spawn at just the right time\n- Deny the enemy information by blowing up the command post at strategic times\n- Secondary means of completing the objective - Fuel Dump ;)\n- Satchel charge on a group of gunners\n- Run through the spawn to get to the objective in an unexpected manner\n- Open the back door and sneak key team members in (multiple vectors to complete a mission)\n- Fireteam chat (only communicate to key team memebers)\n- Spotting hidden mines\n- Mind games with the enemy, constantly blowing up the command post and hiding, blocking the doorway when rushing to defuse, pretend to defend an objective for a long period of time\n- Hiding in the bushes, spotting mines waiting to pounce\n- Smoke grenades (so useful)\n\nThis and so much more I could do that I felt made a huge impact on the course of a round. Brutally hard to pull off but so satisfying. It appealed to my lone wolf introverted nature.\n\nIn saying that... I'm going to stick with this game, hoping the new mercs bring something new to the table. Red eye and that invisible one look promising.\n\nCurrently the game is fast and fun. Some rounds your team are a bunch of muppets and other times they're God's gift to gaming. Mostly it's a fairly balanced game of tug-o-war.

I spent most of my time as the Medic. (I'm actually not the “healing” type of gamer, but I've always scored best being able to keep myself and others alive, and I also have a good track record of rezzing people in the clutch.) As a Medic you can drop an AoE (Area of Effect) Heal for your team mates, and provide almost instant resurrections. (As is getting increasingly popular in games; you're first “downed” and then “dead” after a few seconds being downed... or being finished off before that timer)\n\nThere are several different types of maps you play in Dirty Bomb, Capture the flag, Base Defense, cart ride... but with a twist. Sometimes you need to defend a tank that also operates as mobile turret, other times you're trying to disarm key strategic choke holds that keep changing before the game is won or lost, trying to disarm a bomb, and more.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497802359\n\nAchievements: At this point there are no steam achievements for Dirty Bomb, however there are daily challenges you can go for to earn extra in-game currency, and there's an experience reward system that will help make sure you're facing people with familiar-skill-levels, but also providing a sense of progression.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=502991679\n\nPrice: Dirty Bomb is Free to Play, many people will object to any type of “spend real money” model in a Free to Play business model – I guess we'll need to agree to disagree on the semantics, if the game is free and don't shake me down for money, I don't think of it as “pay to win” unless paying will make it impossible for me to play the game(I'm looking at you ...facebook app games...!). The game does let you earn in-game currency to unlock the various features instead of just spending real money on these items, but I didn't find myself cursing someone because they were using a Merc I didn't have unlocked.\n\nConclusion: All in all, I enjoyed playing Dirty Bomb. It's very similar to other FPS we all know and love...ish, like Team Fortress 2, or Counter Strike. However it stands on it's own and is a fun change of pace from the aforementioned. Since it's free it's an easy pick-up and then put-down. I recommend Dirty Bomb to FPS junkies.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497802376","October 2, 2015","true","3.5"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

The fact that you can't oneshot an enemy with most weapons lays a foundation to some quick, nerve racking firefights, making each kill a really satisfying to pull of.\n-The classes appear to be pretty balanced, each one of them occupying a unique place and, above all, they all fit usefull purpose inside the game. Not surprising since they all tend to fit the overall classic FPS archtypes of classes.\n-The business model is fair and the in-game rewards such as cases and in-game currency come at a really steady and generous pace, with quests refreshing really often, offering players a great incentive to keep on playing.\n\nBut the game is not without it's flaws, I shall explain those too:\n-The weapon variety could be way larger and the futuristing setting can lead to some creative liberty while designing them, so a little more inovation in this field could improve the game much, much more.\n-The sound design, while good, could use some improvement too. As some weapons clearly sound powerfull, others sound weak and tend to lack that meaty, satisfying *THUMP* that firing a weapon should always carry.\n\nOne can't help but grade Dirty Bomb as a really great, innovative and above all, a really, really fun First Person Shooter that bring a breath of fresh air to a genre that clearly needs it. I can't stop recommend it enough. Play it! Get Dirty! And remember, Don't be a D*ck!","July 22, 2015","true","30.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

Dirty Bomb is gearing up to be another great option for the gamer that doesn’t like to spend too much money. With its FTP option and an increasing amount of characters, levels and modes, the people over at Splash Damage look like they are trying their darnedest to create a solid and full game when it finally leaves Beta status.\n\nThe level design is what stands out to me the most about Dirty Bomb. Each level has a great amount of detail put into it with little touches here and there to make each alley, room and building different from the last. They also have a few places that make good use of the ability to use your double or triple wall-jump ability. (I’m getting a good hang of the double jump, the triple is a little beyond me at the moment.) So far the levels have a good enough build quality that stops people from getting into places that one should not… but we’ll see how that goes when it gets released to the masses.\n\nYou may be wondering how Dirty Bomb is drawing you and when the PTW trap is going to spring into action. Well, so far it looks like that issue isn’t going to rear its ugly head. There is a bit of an exp grind, but so far the only useful thing leveling up gets you is the ability to group up with your buddies and jump into Stopwatch Mode together. What can you buy then? Well for now you can get a few characters and 35k credits for $20 ($40 on release I believe). You can also buy cases that give a chance at random quality character cards which give you different weapon loadouts, special qualities and aesthetics, but that's with in-game money so nevermind. (Thank you Rune for pointing out my blunder!)\n\nHere’s where a small issues comes up for me. I like that cases can be bought or received from drops in-game after the match is over, the randomness is kind of wonky. You don’t get a choice of every single card in the game. When you open the case you get a random assortment of cards and only one gold card that comes around twice (most likely to end before or just eek by before the spinning stops). So if you dig Nadder, you may not come across a gold Nadder card very often. Then again… it’s random, but the game has no problem giving you the same card for the same character over and over again. (What kills me is if the character bonuses are what I want, but it’s with a gun I hate.) Luckily you can trade up your cards for another random card (for some in-game money of course) for the character of your choosing. So while it may not have the guns or stats you want… it will at least be a character you wanted. It’s a neat way to implement differences in playstyle for yourself (everyone else still seems to run around and kill you so I don’t notice it much in others).\n\nMy main issue in the game is the match-making/team balancing and the cheating. Match making doesn’t seem to be implemented at this point too much, but even if it is, you can still swap sides before a match and create what may be an unbalanced team. That goes without saying and there’s not much the devs can do about that other than drop the feature, which would be goofy. I like playing with my buds and I’m sure the rest of you do as well. However, if a match is too one-sided and people leave there is not auto-balance feature either. If three people peace out during a match then you’re just out of luck because you can’t switch teams in the middle of a match. People can join, but I don’t notice that very often. Most joining happens at the beginning of the match and if you’re down three halfway, then you’re probably down for the rest of the match and that can suck a lot.\n\nThe cheating is something I haven’t fully experienced until more recently. If it was going on before a few weeks ago, I hadn’t come across it (and I miss those times). Recently there have been a noticeable number of people who just can’t help but get head-shots. There is no reporting someone in this game and I bet there will be no perma-bans by the devs. What’s worse is that the players (on some level) may be OK with it. Now, it could just be that when it’s being done to you, it’s more obvious and you want it to stop. That makes sense. When it’s your team that has the cheater, you may not notice until the complaints happen in the chat window (if you can play a frenetic FPS and read everything in chat that is…). Only the team with the cheater can vote to kick someone and sometimes people will vote no because they either want an easy win, think it’s funny or simply don’t notice the small vote window in the top-left corner. In one round I played a day ago we tried to boot someone and it failed five or six times. I just left, I didn’t want to win like that. Someone said that since this is a Nexxon game that there will be an issue with cheating and now that it’s reared its ugly head I guess we’ll see if the devs take it seriously enough. I want to believe they will since some of the players don’t seem to, which is very lame.\n\nThis is coming off as rather negative, but I’ve had a fun 32 hours in the game so far and I do intend to play it a bit longer, but I am curious on how they will proceed from here…\n\nPS: Pick a server with low ping, it seriously helps a lot. I’ve managed in other shooters to play in servers with 300-400 ping, but while this game looks smooth with high ping the bullets and other sorts of things do not work like they should. I know that sounds like common sense, but like I said, I’ve played other shooters back in the day with higher ping and didn’t have a problem. Dirty Bomb doesn’t do well with high ping. It’s a good thing there is always another server open!\n\nScore: Support This Title!\n\nWith great gun-play, level design and characters with different loadouts, Dirty Bomb is looking great. It’s a load of fun and neat to see that a team of healers can be a pain in the butt again. The randomness with the cards can suck a lot, but seeing as how you don’t need to have a gold card to do awesome, it’s not too bad. Just keep upgrading those bronze ones mates! Depending on how they handle the cheating will strongly determine the fate of Dirty Bomb. Let’s hope they have some huge fix and or plan to implement that will encourage people to play better with each other. This is a FTP game and that normally does bring in a certain type, but if you can get in free Dirty Bomb is well worth it. Right now you can buy in for $20 and I can think of a lot of other games I’ve spent less on and didn’t have as much fun. At $20, Dirty Bomb is still worth a try.","May 21, 2015","true","33.8"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","17","26","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlatinumClient/recommended/333930/","PlatinumClient","PlatinumClient","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlatinumClient/","106 products in account","Dirty Bomb is F2P game developed by Splash Damage, the studio behind Enemy Territory, and is published by  Nexon America. The game itself is full of action and is set at an incredibly fast pace. It pits 2 teams of 6-8 players against one another, one attacking and the other defending and each player must use a Merc who has varying weapons, skills and augments.\n\nSounds like Team Fortress 2 almost doesn't it? Well it's not,because we don't have a million weapons and hats ruining our steam inventory and meta game balancing. As good as the F2P market is locked down by TF2 and DOTA, Dirty Bomb IMO is a good competitor as it has the action, the easy to grasp controls, its quick and easy to get into the game, easy to learn hard master, as is the motif with character skill based games. But i can also understand why it's not as popular as it could be, mostly with balancing issues, an illusion of P2W and sometimes really bad matchmaking.\n\nGameplay\nLike I have said before, the gameplay is set at a very fast paced, but it's balanced in a way that can make it slow. It's normal to see people jumping off and over walls to get to better positions, or to increase their speed to get objectives faster. But as often you see that, you will see long corridors of death that defenders are trying to hold for the win, bringing the game down to a slow crawl until you overcome it. It all depends on one team's skill to quickly get into the perfect positions faster than the other team can take advantage of.\n\nWhen it comes down to pure player skill, it's another thing. You can take things slow, but you will have to learn to pick up the pace, getting into ideal position is important, especially when it comes to setting positions to take on the other team's position. Gunfights at range are very fickle things because of this, grinding through a defenders well fortified position is tough unless the attacker are well skilled, prepared and fast. Fighting them at range is the most promising, but many of the weapons have little damage at range, especially with the damage fall off and aiming down sight doesn't help much against small targets because of the recoil. In fact most the time firing from the hip is your best option. Tracking player movement with your weapons learning their recoil and weapon spread can help, get those headshot right.\n\nMercenaries\nthere are close to 20 different mercenaries to choose from, who are split into different categories which are slayer, support, engineer and medic. Each type obviously has different roles to play, slayers only job is to be on the front lines killing everything in their path, engineers go in behind them and complete the game's objectives. Some characters can fill a second role quite easily, Fletcher is an engineer but with his weapons and skills, he quite a capable slayer character too. The characters themselves look incredibly well designed,  heavy hitting mercs are usually large, carrying immense amount of armour and equipment on their backs or body's, smaller mercs are light carrying very little and will zip around the level.\n\nI would be lying when they saying how good many of the mercs, obviously there will be the absolutely best top tier characters who shine anywhere, then there would be the ones who are good at times, then the very situational ones. A top tier example is Fragger, he is a combat power house, 150 health armed with two of the strongest assault rifles in the game and he chucks a very powerful grenade to kill multiple mercs instantly. He just shines no matter what player has him, or what situation, he will will get the job done.\n\nYou won't be able to change much about a merc, except maybe their loadout card. This card will have different weapons and augments which can slightly change the style of play the merc can do. There are 9 of them in total, none of them are really OP, there is one that obviously the perfect embodiment of their playstyle, where others tend to make the more aggressive and some just so situational and useless. Obviously the augments are the cause of the change of style, and they are regarded by the community as useless, what actually makes the character good is their skills and the weapons you are most proficient in.\n\nMercs however are locked, and you must have enough in game credits to unlock them. This is where people become idiots and fail to seek out information which they can get by playing. Credit generation most of the time is slow, I will admit that, you will get at most 150 to 200 per 15 min game, double that on stopwatch, and even more on ranked. Mercs however cost 30k-50k credits, so you can see why people get a bit mad. But Splash does do many things that help settle these woes. Every two weeks they offer 3 mercs on rotation to try for free, they added the ability to earn credits by accomplishing missions, which you get by normal play or by doing specific things, and these refill every few hours and can reward 500-1000 credits per mission. Finally once a day you can claim the first match of the day and first win of the for each of the games which give you 500 credits each.\n\nGame modes\nThere are 3 Game Modes, objective, stopwatch and execution. There is also the ranked mode but that only has stopwatch games for the moment, and it is unclear if the other modes will be added for future seasons. Objective mode is simple, complete your objective first. Attackers have a multi stage set of objectives which they must complete under a time limit, these being destroy, escort and repair. On the other side, defenders have to stop the attackers accomplishing their objective until the timer runs out.\n\nStopwatch is the exact same as objective mode with one twist, the attacks have 15min to complete all of their objectives. After which the teams will swap and the once defender now have to beat the attacking team's time, or get further than them if they failed to complete all of the objectives, You can also draw if both teams fail at the same point progress. Execution is the search and destroy of Dirty Bomb, nothing new except for the games mechanics allowing people to be rived and use character and what not.\n\nThe maps that you play each have their own charm, as well as their own grind of death point. For some maps this can be the start like in bridge’s funneled corridors in order to get to the ev, or Dome’s pit of death delivery point. Other times it's halfway through the map like church's long street or even train’s blocker carriage. Regardless of attitude you will come across certain of objectives on each map that are just a pain to do. The EV escorts are most hated, largely because their ease of being destroyed by almost everyone with an explosives weapon, which is the vast amount of merc on the roster btw. Still I suppose it's a skill in itself to quickly repair it with an engineer, but it's annoying for the defenders to get a cheap win because they can stack explosive skilled characters.\n\n\nConclusion\nSo what do we have? A well made F2P game, that is still currently in its beta phase, so it's continually adding more mercs and maps, balancing and improving them. It has albeit small but a very dedicated community, its own competitive mode and ranks and the game is very easy to get into and enjoy. But yet we do have a potentially rage inducing game because it doesn't follow the current motif of many shooter games on the market, as well many of the issues i have already stated. In the end its a free game, you lose nothing but time and potentially happiness or boredom by playing, and you could always remove it if you really hate it.\n\nHave a good day :3","March 17","true","124.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","2"

Secondly, the map flow is HORRIFIC, there are maps that cater to defense and some that cater to attack, like attacking on Trainyard, UGH, it consists of a Sniper in the back of the second attack point or someone on turret, and people dropping skyhammers every 5 seconds.

(remeber this is a beta game)\n2.) some people are way to competative and take the game to seriously. they insult their team members and throw temper tantrums. (thats also just part of this being a multiplayer game)\n3.) i personally find the support/forums can be helpful but sometimes they aren't. its getting better though.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1.) the anti-cheat has some work to do and needs to improve (they are trying though) also not every match you play will have a hacker. sometimes the anti-cheat trips out over something and you can't play.\n2.) some glitches affect gameplay, like being slowed down on certian patches of ground or getting stuck in corners.\n3.) sometimes you disconnect from servers or the game crashes for some reason (again its a beta game)\n\n\nwould i recomend this game? YES and i have its awesome and very fun :D\n\n\ntips:\n\n1.) if your game lags turn down the graphics settings. i believe this game begins with high graphics quality. for my system i needed it on medium.\n2.) move when you shoot, if you stand there your easy pickings.\n3.) you can change the crosshair color in the ingame options menu.\n4.) fiddle around with your mouse sensitivinty, gamma settings, and fov in the settings/options menu.\n5.) don't hack or be a cheater. and DON"t spawn camp, it might be tempting but its really a ♥♥♥♥ move and youll get much less credits for it at the end of the match. you could also be banned perminatly for hacking and cheating.\n6.) do your missions :) they refill every 3 hours or so and you can get tones of money with them.\n\nHave fun everyone :D\n","August 23, 2015","true","993.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrapmusket/recommended/333930/","scrapmusket","ScrapMusket","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrapmusket/","119 products in account","Dirty Bomb is a free-to-play class-based multiplayer First Person Shooter from Splash Damage.  The premise of the game is that two teams complete over a series of sequential objectives within a certain time frame.  Players can choose three characters to bring into a match, each of which has a particular pair of abilities that are suited to different battlefield roles.  Each character has a default loadout, and alternative loadouts can be obtained through play time or by purchasing them from the in-game store.  There are three different modes: two, Objective and Stopwatch, are based around maps in which one team attacks 2-3 targets in a certain order while another defends, while the third, Execution, is a Counter-Strike-like mode in which one team tries to destroy one of two bomb sites or kill all members of the enemy team to win.\n\nDirty Bomb has gotten a bad rap over it's relatively brief lifetime, much of which is undeserved.  One of the main complaints from those who have not actually spent much time playing is that it is pay-to-win.  This is, however, basically untrue.  All characters and loadouts can be permanently unlocked through play time, and at any given time five of the mercs will be available for free: three rotation mercs, and the two defaults, Skyhammer and Aura, both of which are entirely viable against their more expensive counterparts.  Nor does it take a particularly long time to reach the required number of in-game credits for a new merc or loadout unlock.  To date, the only money I've spent on the game is for trinkets, in-game cosmetics that have no affect on the actual game, and I have more loadouts than I know what to do with.\n\nThe game's main mode is Stopwatch.  Two teams, 2-3 objectives, switch sides after the attackers finish or 15 minutes elapse.  The faster team at the end is the winner.  Each of the six maps is quite distinctive: some are long and winding (Dome), others are short and compact (Underground); some involve constant pressure on a moving target (Chapel), others demand just one breakthrough on the part of the attacking team to completely change the pace of the match (Trainyard).  And for those who find themselves wanting just a little CSGO with their DB, there's Execution mode, a pair of 12-round, no-respawn bomb plant maps.  It's a nice change of pace that somehow manages to make the same characters work according to radically different rules (though some might disagree about that).\n\nThe characters are colorful, quite distinctive, and manage to be unique without being overpowered.  Each has 1-2 abilities: Skyhammer throws ammo packs and drops an exploding airstrike marker, Aura plants a healing station, Phantom goes invisible, Rhino has a minigun, Fletcher throws remote detonated sticky bombs.  While certain mercs are specialized for combat (e.g. the aptly-named Fragger), everyone can fight and make plays happen outside their main area of expertise.  This isn't Overwatch or TF2; there's a pool of very effective guns and each merc gets two of them, a primary (shotguns, machine guns, SMGs, rifles of various fire rates) and a secondary (pistols of various shapes and sizes), each of which can easily put down the tankiest of opponents with good aim and positioning.  If it all sounds a bit overwhelming, new players can always stick with Skyhammer; he's a versatile merc who can have an impact on any map and at any objective, which makes him perfect for those still unsure what role they prefer.\n\nThe biggest issue that DB has is its underdeveloped competitive matchmaker.  While it's improved by leaps and bounds since its introduction, and queue times have gotten shorter (at least during peak hours), games tend to suffer from poor balancing due to the sheer number of unranked players in matches.  I still find it fun, but not everyone will agree.  Even so, those who are liable to get frustrated can have plenty of fun on the standard servers.\n\nIn terms of developer support, DB gets pretty regular updates, the most recent of which upped the ante with a competition over which merc would get a special new loadout skin.  They also do a Twitch stream Monday/Wednesday/Friday, which is nice.\n\nAll in all, a good game to try for anyone who likes FPS games.\n\nProsActually free\nSatisfying abilities and gunplay with generally good balance\nPlenty of variation in characters and maps keeps things fresh and entertaining\nThe loadout system gives you a meaningful sense of progress without forcing you to pay money\n\nCons\nCompetitive matchmaking is hit-or-miss, especially if you're easily frustrated\nCharacters sometimes get stuck momentarily on corners due to some weird hitbox issues\nExecution mode is a bit lean\nFinal Thoughts\n\nGet it if you like running around in FPS games, racing the clock, and snarky quotes.\n\nRating (Out of 10): 9\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","January 11","true","490.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirvemahl/recommended/333930/","kirvemahl","kirvemahl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirvemahl/","68 products in account","So far it has been enjoyable and has potential to fill the shoes ET/RTCW left behind in the competitive FPS games. The overall gameplay, the fast and smooth movement, fine hitreg, classes and objective play comes together nicely balanced.\n\nIn the map design direction, one can feel strong similarities with ET/RTCW! Some areas feel as if they were taken from classic goldrush, supplydepot, oasis, et_ice, etc maps and just re-skinned, while others follow the level design direction what made ET and RTCW the games they were! Multiple paths to primary objectives, sub-objectives, well balanced for both attack and defending teams, many possibilities for defending positions, crossfires and as many strategies much for countering them in the attacks. Truely nice challange for competitive fps players as it's not only about the aimskill but\ntakes into account all the positioning, moving, predicting, timing and different other mechanics that were equally important in ET & RTCW.\n\nOverall art direction is a bit generic but still nicely done. Simply follows the currently trending modern-styled shooters. The classes all have their own quirks and character and can be told apart from eachother well. Everything looks refined and worked though!\n\nThe classes are based largely on ET but with some changes - hard to say yet how good or bad they are. As a key difference you no longer need a specific class (mostly it was the engineer or covert ops in ET/RTCW) to complete the objective. Every class can now repair the tank or plant a bomb. I guess this is the reason why the engineer class has been completly removed, split up and partly replaced by a new class Proxy. She has very fast movement speed and her main ability is planting mines. Can be used in both defending and attacking and maybe even brings the mine-play into more focus than it was in ET.\n\nMedic in general sense is pretty much the same, although there are two of them - one with an area healing item and another one with medpacks. The area healing item seems like a nice change and addition to the gameplay.\n\nAs the only use for soldier class was panzerfaust in ET/RTCW, here they've remade it by giving it alot more HP than the other classes have and leaving it as the only class who can use grenades (+also making it a bit slower - each class has slightly different movement speeds). Overall a good change, it can be a fairly strong combination with a medic and already seems to have big use in public games. Covert-ops is replaced by a usual, somewhat useless sniper and has some detection skills instead of stealing of enemy uniform. And the classic fieldop with the airstrikes is pretty much the same old goodness!\n\nRegarding the "public matches", the loadout cards system and unlockable characters/rotations sucks balls! In a competitive skill-based game like this you should not have to waste your time on grinding to unlock characters and weapon loadouts. There are way too many loadouts and most of them are totally useless. Also the grinding for them is really time-consuming and in a public mode you don't feel that theres any sense of progression in that area. So makes you question that why the ♥♥♥♥ are they even there? They should be only decorative like in dota or cs for example. The different loadouts are atleast somewhat balanced, so even in a pay-2-win scenario an experienced played with default items will not be destroyed by a beginner with the best items. In the future in real team matches, there should most likely come some mods or rules regarding which loadouts/guns/classses availiable to play with as theres a big need for that.\n\nTL;DR - Dirty bomb used ET/RTCW values to make itself a strong backbone -> has potential to become a next big competitive teamplay fps .","March 30, 2015","true","13.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/333930/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This game feels like Counter Strike met with Brink then had a baby that was the cousin of Team Fortress 2. For a free game, this is definitely worth a look.\n\nThing is this baby has an attitude and swag of it's own. Dirty Bomb resembles Counter Strike but moves at a completely different speed and pace. This change in pace is immensely welcomed as I didn't foresee myself becoming immersed in this game. All the basic movements are in the game (minus being able to prone but I don't see why you would need it) and the player is even able to double-triple jump on walls given you go something to rebound off of. If you're going down a hallway that has a lots of overhead room, the player can literally jump wall to wall while dodging and shooting simultaneously. I didn't figure out the game had a feature until I saw another player jumping off the walls (literally)! All the movements are actually quite smooth and of course there is a sprinting and crouch feature.\n\nIn addition to great gameplay, Dirty Bomb offers a number of ways to go about your mission. You are given character cards to choose but can only use 3 in a game. My preferred card is a mercenary that uses an automatic weapon. Every character has unique abilities as well. My mercenary can throw a marker to initiate an airstrike. There is a cool-down period but I feel it is has completely appropriate recharge time. Additionally, he can throw ammo to keep your troops in tip top shape. Other classes include sniper that has the ability  to throw a heart beat sensor (to see where enemies are), a medic class that can heal himself in death, heal others in real-time within the vicinity or use his defibrillator on downed allies. The last class I was able to explore (as you have to acquire/unlock/buy other classes) was the shotgun class. This lady has the ability to throw down proximity mines and really ♥♥♥♥ people off. Mines suck only when your the guy walking into them. Some cards have certain upgrades available (through unlocks) and I haven't mentioned the other classes I have no access.\n\nThere are a few game modes to choose from. Objective is my personal favorite. Missions are to be completed in three segments. There is always a defending team and an attacking team trying to sabotage something (or steal something). Careful as there is a time limit that needs to be met. Upon dying, you can sometimes re-spawn right away but often times you will have to wait a bit and jump in when the game allows for reinforcements. Stop watch mode allows both teams to attack and defend. Upon successfully attacking, the attacking team will now have to defend their own objective. This game mode is a nice break from objective if you don't like being stuck on defense all the time. Careful! You will have to beat the other teams time! Finally, execution mode consists of 10 rounds of killing off enemies on the opposing team. Alternatively, you can plant a bomb and try to win this way but most cases involve teams killing each other off.\n\nThe visuals are very appealing in this game and looking down the iron-sights is one of my favorite properties. The game I feel graphically was well done. Effects from gunshots to explosions were all designed with care. Sounds are neat and definitely suit the game. The narrator in game (updating you on the objective) has an English accent and can be prone to swearing if you're screwing your mission up. Gun shots, explosions and arming C4 are all appropriate and do a good job making the player feel like they are in a battle field.\n\nOverall, a great game and one I would recommend everyone to try. It is FREE, so why not give it a shot!\n\nRATING : 7.4/10\n\nScreenShots :\nThis is what an air strike looks like in this game\n\nDirt and blood with pop up on your HUD\n\nVery peculiar way to arm C4\n\nAnd the building goes boooooom","March 15","true","8.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randommcgee/recommended/333930/","randommcgee","Burger Betty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randommcgee/","23 products in account","A return to the fast paced FPS action of the late 90s and early 2000s. Movement is fluid and fast, reminiscent of games like Quake and Unreal Tournament. The guns are effective and satisfying to use. The classes are pretty good, though since the game is still beta, many haven't been released yet and the ones that are released will probably be tweaked. There are only a handful of maps right now, but they're all fairly well designed.\n\nIt's a bit grindy to earn credits for mercs and their loadouts, but everything can be earned through gameplay instead of having to pay real money. Can't really complain too much for a free game.

So far I have had more fun in this game than I had in CC: GO, Overwatch, Paladins, BF4, Titanfall, or any other FPS game I have tried in at least the past 5 years.\n\nThe weapons work the way they should, the objectives make sense and are fun to do. The action is fast and frantic. The multiple classes are done really well. Each merc feels different and having these "classes" makes the game stand out compared to plain FPS games. However, they are not overdone like in Overwatch where its too over the top crazy action for my liking. TF2 also was too cartoony and frantic for me. This game has realistic weapons and powers.\n\nMap design is great, good hiding places, peaking places, ways to sneak behind the enemy and so on. Everything you want and need in a FPS game.\n\nIts a mix of the realistic FPS game with special abilities, but IMO its done the right way, Humble Bundle just had a bundle up with unlocks for the game which allows you to unlock soem stuff quicker, get it now and enjoy the game!","February 18","true","22.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bushkalle/recommended/333930/","bushkalle","OMbK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bushkalle/","126 products in account","Making a new Review of the game since it's been release, had a preview from the beta but since that one is out of date alot I thought I'd make a new one.\n\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. Absolutely. No doubt. I'd rate it 8/10 at this point, probobly one of the best F2P games today and ever released. Pretty much what BRINK should have been but with a bit less parkour then in that game. With time it might get to be a 9/10+ game.\n\nWhy? Well since I did play in the late Alpha and earlie Beta stage I have seen how much this game has grown. I dont know how often the interface/menu system has been changed but for now I really think it works better then ever. The classes have been tunned alot since Alpha to make them more balanced.\n\nNow some might wonder why I dont have more hours to the game then I have, well I dont know to be honest... played it alot when it came to steam (most of the hours) then I kinda stoped when I started playing D3. Comming back to the game I really dont know why I stoped.. the game is great, runs well even if it could do with some more optimization when listening to some friends who have a worse comp then me. Running 2500k i5 @ 4.5ghz, R9 280X and 16gb ram at the moment, and for me it's running flawlessly.\n\nBiggest thing I didnt like before about Dirty Bomb was the fact that it took ages to get Credit's in the game since you barely got any from finishing the matches and you had only 3 daily quests a day pretty much. Now when I've come back the match Credit's are pretty much the same but the daily quests have changed to having 3 quests ever 2 hour cycle. Now this is great since now you can get like 10k credit's a day if you want litteraly, with booster it would be even more.\n\nSo feeling like you have to pay for the game to be able to get a class now is completely gone and it is well made at the moment since you dont get that "pay2win" feeling when it would have taken a month before to get just one class. Prices from real money I guess aint much to talk about considering the game is free and to support the game development and future updates we'll have to pay something!\n\n\nHow is the gameplay then? Very fun in my opinion, you got Objectives, Stopwatch and Execution. Objectives is when you play a map once, if you are on attack you just attack for one round and then it changes map (by vote in the lobby for the next map), Stopwatch is the same but you play two rounds on the same map once as defender and once as attacker.\nExecution is more a CS type of gameplay which got only two maps at the moment but more will be added for sure, one team plants the bomb and one team defends for best out of 12 rounds (you switch side after 6 rounds).\n\nClasses in the game feels very balanced at the moment even the new classes like Stoker and Phoenix. I know Phoenix feelt a tad strong in the earlier stages of the beta and alot of classes have had some tuning from the open beta to now. I just feelt it myself now when I went on Skyhammer to play with my rapid burst rifle (which might have been a bit strong in 1v1 fights) and it's burst speed had been decreased, tho the sound change was a nice supprice to the better!\n\nAt the start when you start the game you'll get to play as 2 classes:\n\n-Aura- who's a healer with a medstation that she can deploy on a spot and heal people around it, she's very quick and with the loadout cards she can have a shotgun or SMG.\n\n-Skyhammer- who is a very good and allround balanced class imo, has an artillery strike which he can throw out and take down the payload cart very easy and even kill a large pack of people if not avoided (used as a normal grenade indoors). Also gives ammo packs to people which is a good way to get points. His loadout cards will let you have either a automatic rifle or a burst one.\n\nWhats all this with loadout cards you talk about? Well it's as it sounds a loadout card, this is what defies what and how your character is equipped. At the start you'll have no perks at all, with a "Lead" card you'll have one perk but instead of a automatic rifle you'll have a burst one for exampel, and the perk might be all from reducing mounted MG heat by 50% (when it goes to hot you cant fire it anymore) to increasing melee damage by 15% and alot more.\nYou can have max 3 perks on a card, but then they will variate as said and have different weapons to balance them out, as well as the higher card you get your apperance will change slightly in color.\n\nTo read more about the classes I'll link you: http://dirtybomb.wikia.com/wiki/Playable_Characters_(Mercs)\n\nJust be aware that Aimee and Thunder arent implemented to the game yeat, but will come shortly I'd assume.\n\nAnd a bit more about the loadout cards:\nhttp://dirtybomb.gamepedia.com/Cards\n\n\nMan it got to be longer then I was planing, thought I'd do some short review but I ♥♥♥♥ed up completely haha. Might have spelled some stuff wrong but you'll have to live with it! Anyway hopefully you found it usefull and I'll see you in-game while carrying that dirty bomb.","November 2, 2015","true","141.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/333930/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","EDIT: A developer has commented on this review, stating that several of the problems I describe have been addressed. While this review remains an accurate description of my experience with Dirty Bomb up to August 2015, I intend to re-install Dirty Bomb and play it again in the near future. After that happens, I will update this review with additional thoughts and impressions.\n\nDirty Bomb is a lot of fun to play, with great weapons and versatile character classes. But it is sorely lacking in several departments.\n\n+ Guns & mercs. Plenty of variety. Each merc is a unique way to play.\n+ Stable. Game has never once crashed on me\n+ Colorful. Still uses DX9, but graphics look great.\n+ Level design is great. Lots of different ways to attack a given position.\n+ Gameplay is quick. Completing a mission with a good team is very satisfying.\n\n- Only five maps and two modes.\n- Missions are linear. The stages never change.\n- The rumor about Dirty Bomb is that it is pay to win. It is not. HOWEVER: if you want to play with more than the three default mercenaries, and the merc you want is not in "free rotation" (playable for free for a limited time), you have to "hire" the merc with in-game credits. Farming credits takes forever. It is easier to just purchase the mercs you want to play. So, no, the game is not pay-to-win.\n- There is no real attempt to police hackers - and there are more hackers every day. Yes, there's anti-hacking software that is included with the game, but it doesn't seem to work too well. This is not me being salty; after almost 10 hours, I've had quite a few good matches where I felt I contributed in a positive way. But getting head-shotted by a shotgun from the other side of the map? No thanks.\n- Only one spawn point at a time. As the objective moves forward, the spawn point does as well, but there is only one place to spawn at a time. Aggressive enemy teams will camp the spawn, putting up turrets and throwing grenades for an endless kill streak. Ridiculous.\n\nMight be worth playing, since it is free, but don't invest in it. Expect to tire of Dirty Bomb quickly. More maps, VAC implementation, and bigger credit drops would enormously improve the experience.","August 7, 2015","false","17.8"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Splozy/recommended/333930/","Splozy","unsolicited bovril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Splozy/","525 products in account","I can't reccomend this game.\n\nIt's just another FPS that's pushed as being competitive or a prospective esport and yet the developers seemed to miss the point completely.\n\nOk, the shooting, movement and overall gunplay seems to actually be okay. There's not really as much of a skill ceilling as W:ET in regards to the movement but there is something interesting going on. I couldn't really put my finger on it though, there's some nifty things you can do with walljumps but it's certainly not intended.\n\nWhat kills this game from the get go is the business model. It's free to play. Sadly, there's some cool abilities, guns and tools but they are spread over so many classes and there just isn't any reason to play many of them. It's also pretty ridiculous that they expect the game to ever have a thriving competitive scene when they expect you to either pay up or grind for almost every single class.\n\nI played the game a lot before it came to steam when everything was unlocked for everybody and the loadouts didn't exist. It was much better then but it still suffered from almost all the classes being useless. Bushwacker was so OP, it was insane. Speaking to other players, apperently Pyro was too. They made the other classes feel like wet paper, simply because of the guns. Whether this is still true, I am not sure, I only got to play a couple of the classes but the limitations on classes and loadouts hurts this game so badly that it's not even worth talking about anything else.\n\nIf you are looking for another competitive FPS game to play, you won't find it here. There's loads of potential for a really good game but as long as it continues to have content locked out from players then a scene will never grow. Could have been good, but it isn't.\n\nEDIT: So I continued to play to inform myself more and perhaps highlight some of the other issues with the game.\n\nThe guns are so badly balanced it makes my eyes water. ADS is practically useless on pretty much everything, due to the fact that the animations for recoil will block your vision of the already bad iron sights.\n\nRifles seem to suffer the most due to the recoil they have. You can easily outgun someone with the proxy secondary, an SMG, at long ranges. The same goes for the smaller pistols too. The recoil spread is so tight and the classes move so fast that you can actually outgun people using rifles at long ranges.\n\nThe developers also don't beat around the bush in being open about the fact that loadouts for your classes are simply better than others. Using a tier list that ranges from iron to gold (+obsidian), the better the tier the more "augments" the loadout will have. Meaning someone using a gold load out vs a default one will be at a significant advantage one way or another.\n\nThe whole game is designed to be a F2P time sink.","March 27, 2015","false","45.5"," 39 of 70 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","39","70","2","1"

This game is a WAY better replacement for TF2. It is highly addictive and really fun when you have an assortment of weapons, mercs, perks, and much more ability depending on how YOU want to play.  I would definitely recommend people for this game because it has a lot of things that I want in a video. Especially the Merc Rotation System when you can play as a certain character to see if you want to buy him/her or not. I am also glad they have females and males working for hired gun instead of all males and it being a sausage party. I really love the objective and stopwatch gameplay because it is endless fun and makes me feel like there are tons and tons of diffrent ways you can stop the EV, many ways you can protect the objective, and the endless merc abilities within cards you can buy.

It has around 12 classes (some must be bought), that all have their own weapons, leveling up systems (card-based), and skills. This game is amazing. It has a lot of strategy incorporated to make it an all around team-based game. Whether playing alone, or with a couple of friends, Dirty Bomb delivers on the FPS market that has lost its spark. For only $22 you can get the starter pack, which unlocks five permanent Mercs (classes) and grants you around 50,000 credits (which are normally pretty difficult to get), so if you have the money, make sure to get that as well, if not, enjoy the game anyway! It's a lot of fun, and they switch up temporary Mercs that are unlocked so you always have someone or something new to play with. Leveling up cards from bronze to gold or higher is addicting, and takes time, but is satisfying when done after hard work. Dirty Bomb also has daily challenges to help get credits and XP, sometimes with double XP events.

FPS games that are all carbon copies of each other and "controller friendly" is the order of the day these days.  But not this game.  If you attempt to pull the three shots to the nuts that people pull in Call of Duty, Battlefiled and the other copy/paste war games you will do quite horribly in this game.  This game is very much like Return to Castle Wolfenstein/Enemey Territory (and made by the company who created ET) with character unlocks that works similar to League of Legends.  So far it's been quite good for a beta and I've dropped almost 40 hours into it over two different weekends when the beta was live.\n\nYou will enjoy this game if you like:\n1.  A game where aim matters and shooting for heads is required to excel\n2.  A game built with mouse/keyboard in mind and doesn't have a "press this button to do a cool animation"\n3.  A game where movement is just as important as aim.  You can jump off walls to reach new areas.  Yup, it's awesome\n4.  Class based team combat with "Mercs" to unlock LoL-style\n5.  Multiple objectives per map to complete on offense before you then switch to defense and hold those objectives\n6.  5v5 ranked system at launch\n\nYou will hate this game if you:\n1.  Enjoy proning.  Seriously, F every single one of you guys\n2.  Enjoy unloading a magazine in 1.5 seconds and hitting a guy in the nuts with 3 of those sprayed bullets across the map with your SMG for the kill\n3.  Enjoy only shooting people and dislike objectives beyond shooting people\n4.  Do not like jumping in videogames\n5.  Hate skillful movement beyond "running lanes".  If you want to only press forward to move then this is not the game for you\n\nSo far I would recommend it.  It's going to be free to play when it's released and as long as the devs avoid any of the more notorious free to play strategies then I'll support it.\n\nThe next beta will be soon :)","March 19, 2015","true","738.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"

The concept is good, and the gameplay is alright, but thats it. The characters arent balanced at all, the game has a brutal paywall, and an evil RNG system.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nThis is the only part of the game that is currently decent, and may be enough for some people to continue playing this game. The mechanics are like a combination of Team Fortress 2 and Call of Duty. There are several different classes which all have special abilities such as calling in airstrikes, reviving teammates, and throwing grenades.\n\nThe movement is very fast, there is some level of parkour, and this game could definitely become competitive at some point. Using hipfire rather than aiming down sights is generally more effective.\n\nThe teamwork area of this game is currently entirely lacking. Though that cant be fixed, certain mechanics can reinforce it a bit more.\n\nCharacter Balance:\n\nThere is no real change in playstyle from character to character..\nWhich is to say that it is near meaningless to play one class over another, and thats not balance, thats lack of development.\nThe new Phantom character is ridiculously overpowered, and can easily kill someone without them having any chance to retaliate, even from directly in front of them, as has happened to me.\n\nThe Paywall:\n\nThis game screams for you to waste your money. To get new characters you need to save up from 30-50 thousand credits, and then you have to get a card to use him anyway which will be a minimum of 1000 credits, if you happen to get him in the first spin, which is unlikely considering the wealth of hardly different characters.\n\nOf course, you can directly buy these characters for 7-10 dollars, which is ridiculously expensive for a single character, and even then you still need another card as a loadout to use the character.\n\nAnd of course, there is a way to double the amount of credits you earn, which costs even more money. The average game after daily bonuses will give you around 600 on a win and 180 on a loss, from my experience.\n\nAnd then the RNG:\n\nThis. Is the worst thing that exists in any game. This is how you get loadout cards for your characters, and the odds are stupidly low to obtain anything worthwhile. So steep that you have an 85% chance to get the lowest tier card! But of course this is solved by selling 'elite cases' which guarantee you a higher tier card.\n\nAll these systems combine to make an extremely Pay to Win game which, though the gameplay can be enjoyable, is thoroughly flawed.\n\nAnd if you think its not pay to win, just remember that they made it such a grind so that you would be pressured to pay. Why else?\n\n\nGive it a try, dont waste your money.","July 14, 2015","false","7.8"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","25","44","0","0"

Power creep is a massive issue in this game and it's still extremely young.\n\nIgnoring all of the claims to P2W, I would still hesitate to pick this game up as although <lvl5 lobbies are good for new players, normal servers are a cluster♥♥♥♥ of being steamrolled by those who have played the game for a significant time and hence have access to a wider range of classes. As such the more experienced players can change their tactics to suit the way the game is playing out i.e enemy team is camping -> explosive classes, enemy team is rushing -> defensive classes; whereas newer players are stuck to a handful of classes (which are dictated by the weekly rotation).\n\nIf you want a mindless CS/TF2/BF crossover shooter and don't care about winning or KDA, this game is extremely fun. However from a competetive standpoint the maps, weapons and classes are extremely imbalanced (and the devs have made no progress to show this will ever change).","July 12, 2015","false","12.0"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

This is my first written review of a game on steam because I believe this game deserves your attention. I have missed the feeling of twitched based arena shooters such as Quake 3 arena and team arena. There have been some games who have tried to recapture that feeling but nothing so far has been able to hook me until Dirty Bomb.\n\nThere are some glaring problems such as a bad anti cheat. Hackers will come in waves and they will infest the competitive match making scene making it difficult to recommend trying that mode to new players. Bugs are present that have been around for a long time and it seems each new patch breaks something else and you wont see a fix for it for several weeks. I feel as if the developers don't value the customers as much as some other companies do, for example Grinding Gear Games.\n\nIf you enjoy really fast paced twitch shooters with plenty of competition then you can't go wrong with Dirty Bomb.","June 28, 2015","true","094.4"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","13","21","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MilitaryMutt/recommended/333930/","MilitaryMutt","Roody","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MilitaryMutt/","68 products in account","So Dirty Bomb...how can I sum this game up into words...\n\nFirst off, this game is fun. It truelly is. The gameplay is probably one of the best aspects about DB. When you have a good team, you can get some pretty interesting matches. There isn't many objective based FPS games anymore so its a nice change from the norm right now. HOWEVER, this game has a LOT of issues that can't be simply ignored.\n\nProblem 1: The payment system for this game is a real downer. Seriously, I'm all for grinding to unlock characters and its ment to make you keep playing. I understand this and I'm okay with games doing that if you dont wanna spend real money. Dirty Bomb takes it to far, each game you earn around 200-500 in game credits. Not bad you'd think but characters cost around 30k to 50k to unlock. Thats a LOT of games to just unlock one character and it'd most likely get a little tedious and boring after so long. However, if you truely want a character you can skip all that grinding to purchase a character with real money! For around 10.99. Thats right, 10.99 for just one person.\n\nProblem 2: There is a pretty clean unblanace of classes in this game. Some of you may argue, "Naw man, you just suck. Try harder newb." Maybe thats true but I've played enough to know that if a shotgun to the face at point blank doesn't kill you then there is something wrong. If you wanna dominate a game, pick an engineer class like Bushwack (I recommend unlocking him first), Medics or phantom. The first two classes have AMAZING SMGs that are pin point and do a lot of damage per second. They are even better than assault rifles at medium ranges. For this reason, they dominate all other classes and phantom is just a invisible slasher that runs around and kills like its nothing. So if you wanna play, pick those three cause shotguns are useless and everyone else doesn't do enough damage.\n\nProblem 3: This game relies heavily on team base tactics and gameplay so you need good people. If you have friends that will play and are good at team games then you'll find yourself enjoying this. If you dont have friends or you do but they dont wanna play then..well..dont start this game. Sure you might get in a game with people that are decent but then you'll get in a game with some dumb SoBs. More often than not, you'll be with dumb people that just run and gun, not play objectives. Due to that, It will leave you frustrated and annoyed more than anything else.\n\nProblem 4: So going back to 1 and 2, you need to unlock someone to play them. So why not just change their main gun to an SMG? Well, it doesn't quite work that way in this game. In Dirty Bomb, you have to unlock cases that hold layout cards. What are layout cards? They are cards that hold either different buffs, looks, guns and other effects for characters. The cards are picks by a RNG system, so you can't just pick a card when unlocking a case and each case costs around 1000 in game currency. You CAN use other cards to trade in to make one card or purchase a card of one character, which costs around 17k. It's very expensive and a grind itself.\n\nSo yeah, this game is a huge grind fest. Its fun but due to how long it takes to earn the money to unlock someone, it quickly becomes more of a chore than a game. If you wanna try it, go ahead but I don't recommend playing it for long.","July 19, 2015","false","37.5"," 39 of 71 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","39","71","3","0"

Don't bother with it for now. Stick to TF2.\n\nI tried to appreciate this game after getting an invite to the closed beta, I really did. But after 2 hours, I gave up. I saw everything I needed to see.\n\nHere is a nice list of what I saw as broken in this game : a few limited maps with 2 modes only (they were still testing maps), 65% of servers empty (wasted resources) and half of those with players are in the EU (at the time of writing this : 70 servers, 24 with players and 15 of those are from the EU).\n\nHalf the "classes" (mercs) are behind a paywall. Saw 8 mercs total (for now), 2 mercs are on free rotation and 2 are provided at the start thus limiting replayability quickly (compared to 9 free classes on tf2 and none locked). I did see on the wiki that there are more out there... I can presume they are limiting the amount of available mercs for the closed beta. You can buy the other mecs with real cash or ingame credits. You gain credits by playing matches (smallish amount) or through the quests system. Do this x amount of times and get y creds.  An excellent idea overall but playing a long time to unlock a single character priced at around 50k or paying 7 to 12$ makes it obvious where the deal is.\n\nNo incensitives to play as a team. All the big rewards are in the k/d ratio... So what is the point of objectives if killing the enemy team is worth more than destroying or defending the objectives? Helping your teammates gives out little exp but fatally feeding slugs to your opponent gives you more? That is the complete opposite of a team-based system. As a side note, I noticed that the deathmatch or team deathmatch modes are curiously absent. With the current system, that mode would be quite popular.\n\nNow the kicker : unbalanced classes. This game uses a card system where your merc will have special abilities based upon what is on the card : from lead to obsidian. Lead is a basic card while higher cards with increased value gain augments to increase that specific merc's abilities. Thus a player using a merc with a gold card has x3 more advantages over a player with a lead card. And guess what do you have at the start? Ouch!\n\nTo remedy this, I did notice that there are servers that are for players underneath a certain level threshold. This would, in theory, give new players a chance to get to know the game properly while fighting players of equal skills. Unfortunaltely, instead of pushing those new players on those servers (which were all empty at the time I checked), they move them on regular servers with players that managed to gain higher cards. A simple fix would be an automated system to push the new players in those appropriate servers and having them filled with bots if the player base is too low. Even playing vs bots is better than being destroyed (thus leading to salty rage quits) unfairly.\n\nFinally, I did get a good laugh at times. For example a message saying I just gained 1xp for being in a group would sporadically apprear. YES I am validated to play in a team! Also the tutorial mentionned a Rule #3 for the game : Don't be a ♥♥♥♥. Wish there was a way to force players to go back to the training level so they can review that rule again and again. Should do them plenty of good!\n\nAll in all, stick to the GOOD team based / class oriented game (TF2)  for now. This game does have a potential to be quite the excellent game but it's not there yet. Leave it to cook a bit longer.\n\nPS: A beta release isn't a free get-out-of-the-sh*thole card for the devs to excuse themselves when pointing out massive balancing flaws while they still charge money for unlocks. Also, NO I will not post in forums. Have a bug reporter ingame. Forums always breed the worst of any player base.","April 18, 2015","false","6.8"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","2"

First let me start by saying it's a game with potential. The gameplay is fast paced as you would expect from a pvp shooter like Brink, or team fortress. The characters are unique in their own way. My personal favorite is Kira, "Because Lasers". Also the idea of collecting loadout cards is a cool idea. Getting the same character loadout but with better weapons and stats/augments.  The problem, for one the maps are one sided. You will go to maps where the defense always wins, or the offense always wins. So there is no balance.  Which brings my next point, this is one of those pay to win games. Which I don't agree with. For someone who can't afford to drop $100.00 on game content just to enjoy it, it doesn't appeal to me. It was fun for the first 45 minutes of gameplay. But I could see slowly that unless I was willing to drop large amounts of cash to hope I got lucky on getting a booster or case with my favorite characters loadout... to have fun, I'd rather go play a card game like MTG.  This game has the right idea. They are just going about it all wrong. Luckily it is only free to play, but even with it being free you are limited to your options. They almost force you to have to buy content to keep playing.","June 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 70 of 131 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","70","131","4","8"

This game is still in beta, so this review is in no way complete. I will try to make this review as unbiased as I can.\n\nA lot of the Nay-sayers either think it is pay2win (NEWSFLASH: It's not...), or they left because of hackers (every damn game has hackers. Nexon and Splash Damage have significantly fixed their anti cheat system. Hackers are few and far between), or they haven't gotten good at the game (get good scrubs), or haven't played enough (you need at least 15 hours to be allowed to review. Steam should have this rule in place)\n\nPros:\n- Fast Paced, Action packed Gameplay\n- Many Characters (Mercs) to Choose from\n- Free rotation of paid characters\n- Objective-based gameplay (Execution coming-soon)\n- Harsh gameplay (if you die... too bad for you)\n- Teamwork oriented (You can't run off and be a "Hero")\n- Unique abilities for every Merc\n- Forces you to take advantage of the game mechanics (Hip firing is key... unless you are sniping)\n- Gives you an incentive to keep playing  (Dialy missions)\n- Skill-based (in no way Pay to Win)\n\nCons:\n- Expensive Mercs ($5.99 - $9.99), however all characters are unlockable with ingame money (30,000 c - 50,000 c) which takes time to collect\n- Hackers (***EDIT: They have improved the Anti-Cheat System a lot since I wrote this review.) you find them quite a bit and they are a pain in the ♥♥♥, although you could switch servers.\n- Balancing. Many times I have found myself overpowered by a team of level 35+ players when my team is full of sub level 10's\n\nSuggestions:\n- Add more variety to daily missions (Defuse 10 C4s, Kill 50 opponents, Call 20 Airstrikes as Skyhammer, Get 15 headshots, etc.) The same missions over and over again gets boring really fast.\n- Improve game balance.\n\nThis Game has a lot of potential. It is still in Beta, so the cons could well be fixed by the full version.\n\nTL;DR: Really Good Game. Needs some fixing. You should play.

I like to think of it as TF2 meets Quake3 in London with wall-jumping...\n\nMuch has been made - and misunderstood - about how the game monetises itself (it's F2P afterall). I'm happy to say the game allows you to compete on a level playing field with people investing money - there's certainly no special ammo or pay-only weapons or things like that.\n\nIf you do intend to pay for most of your progress with in-game-earned Credits try to maximise the Missions you are set - they can be worth significant amounts to you.\n\nI’m a fan of their art and general style too – it’s British without being hackneyed or irritating, and there are some lovely touches of quintessentially dry humour. What’s more the character design is great. There are both male and female characters but none pander to the dull, well-trodden path of buxom ladies and rippling torso’d men. The design feels more cohesive, solid and more believeable as a result. I find it great.\n\nI'm not going to say the game is perfect - I'm sure the developers would be the first to agree - but they are very open with their work and stream 4 times a week across 2 twitch channels. They take questions and answer them in a manner that's honestly refreshing compared to many other devs.\n\nIf I had to criticize - I’d say the real-money cost of many of the items seems too high. Especially the Mercs (characters / hereos / etc.) - this honestly pushes me towards the F2P route to unlock them.\n\nSumming up :: This is my go-to game at the moment and I'm having a lot of fun. If you like a fast FPS experience I can certainly recommend you give it a try.\n\n(If you want to know more - I have YT videos in my profile with more detailed looks into the monetisation system of Dirty Bomb, Tips & Tricks for new players, etc.)","July 9, 2015","true","633.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I soon gave up though only to return now and see how it evolved over the months. Always keep in mind that it is still in Beta. This is my opinion and it doesn't mean it is objective.\n\nAlso, it is a bit unfair to compare it with W:ET + ETpro which optimised the gameplay even more.\n\nDirty bomb is and feels a hybrid between Brink and W:ET:\n\nGraphics: The game is kind of demanding if you want to play it on high settings. The art design is similar to brink. I won't say a lot about it since you can watch streams and videos to see how it looks.\n\nI will focus on the fact that the classes (mercs) are not very distinguishable while I prersonally feel they are a bit dark. E.g.: im not always sure who is the medic (there are 3 types of them). The menus, hud etc are clean and neat, while it has alot of graphics customization.\n\nMap design is interesting, but nowhere near rtcw_beach or goldrush. All in all, I would prefer cleaner graphics and easier to the eye with less "bells".\n\nGameplay:\nDifferences:\n\n-The game has 15 classes of which you choose the 3 you want to "carry" to the server. Each class can be customised a bit more. Also, each class has 2-3 unique abilities (just like in ET, medic has medpacks, eng has mines etc.).\n\n-Some classes run faster than other and the sprint is faster than this of ET and RTCW. There is no sprint bar. What I miss is that you cannot Sprint + A or D, so you can't make the crazy jukes from ET to the same extend.\n\n- There is self heal after a certain amount of time you take no damage.\n- Medic packs: You take one and that's it, you start regenerating fast.\n- Forget leaning left right.\n- Iron sights\n- Forget bunny-hopping\n- As of now, max fov is 100\n\nSimilarities:\n- Gunfights are exciting and you are very bullet spongy (even for headshots).\n- Voice chat remains almost intact. V57\n- Objectives and gametypes are similar to RTCW and ET\n\nAudio:\nVoice commands and gunsounds have to be improved. Unfortunately there is no oomph in the sounds of the guns.\n\nConclusion: It is worth giving it a shot when it comes out. While there is plenty of room for improvement I have a feeling that it will offer something new to the FPS scene. Will it take off? No one really knows. It really depends if they will make it pay-2-win when it hits the market.\n\nLet's hope it will get to be the next W:ET :).","January 7, 2015","true","23.2"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","4"

I have never been a huge fan of shooters like CS:GO, but this game is really unique and makes the experience better imho.\n\nOne of the main differences is you get characters, When you play games you earn coins based on level badges you get (such as double kill etc) and wins. These coins go towards unlocking new characters. We have been introduced to a handful in beta (Ranging from assaults who can call in air strikes, give team mates ammo when they run out.) medics who heal and have instant revives, snipers, or drop some bad ♥♥♥ proximity mines and blow your enemies to pieces.)\n\nThe objectives and maps seem so much fresher and entertaining then similar games. The cyber punkesque graphics and feel to the "Post Apocalyptic" world is also really fun.\n\nThe similarity to CS GO also comes in crates, but from what i've seen now.. they're not p2w crates. You can randomly get dropped crates in games you play, and they gave us a starting of 100 keys to open. I don't know if this will change on release, but I love it in it's current build.. In these crates are card loadouts for the different characters. They include different guns and knives and perk abilities. These are sorted by rarity the same way a cs go weapon would be found in crates.\n\nIf they give us the chance to customize character outfits, oh god, this would be a masterpiece. Really excited for the next stress test and to see some new characters and game modes!\n\nThis is going to be one of the best F2P games to hit steam in a long time.","March 11, 2015","true","14.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

However, in its current form the game seems to focus more on needing the same 1-2 classes in order to win consistently. Character classes (mercs) are currently poorly balanced and a look through the discussion forums indicates the company developing Dirty Bombs doesn't have balancing classes out as a top priority. That's pretty arrogant and foolish if this is indeed true. Recently I played 3 rounds where the opposing team played one class and easily demolished the opposing team due to overpowered abilities. Also, all 3 of those rounds were on different servers with different players. The fun of the game quickly dissipated (although the first couple days I had it before the recent patch update it was a fairly enjoyable experience) and many of us who downloaded and spent money on perks are already looking to move away from this and onto something else.\n\nThere's a lot of complaints of Dirty Bombs being a 'pay to win game' and currently there seems to be some validation to those complaints. Now as I write this Dirty Bombs is in Beta Testing and therefore could be better balanced by the time it is completed, but then I would STRONGLY recommend waiting for this to be a finished product before jumping into it.\n\nOverall Dirty Bombs has the right heart in what it wants to be, but overpowering issues, weak level design, a growing 'pay to win' reputation, and just isn't fun with the latest merc updates.

There are higher tiers, but they change nothing.\n\nWith the business model complaints out of the way, I'll say this: Dirty Bomb is one of my favorite competitive games as of right now.\nWith blazing movement speed; simple to use, but hard to master parkour; and characters that are all varied and have different pros and cons, despite some similarity; this game is more addictive than crack cocaine. If you've ever played Brink (which, incidentally, was made by the same people), then it is similar to that, but with much more clarity for telling who is on who's team and much more of a competitive focus. The guns feel good to fire, the melee is an entirely viable combat tactic, and working with your team makes you virtually unstoppable. While there are certainly a few issues with balance, and there aren't many maps, what is there is insanely fun to play and makes for a wonderful team game to play.\n\nTL;DR It's basically if Team Fortress 2 ♥♥♥♥ed Counter-Strike in the ♥♥♥ with a syringe filled with steroids. Play it now.","September 2, 2015","true","89.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akanto/recommended/333930/","Akanto","Akanto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akanto/","149 products in account","TL;DR: I recommend, great game overall pretty good balanced with a few hiccups. Tremendously fair F2P model, 0 P2W at all. Explosionspammy at times. Very few competitve players (yet)\n\n\n\n\nDirty Bomb is a FPS focused around teamwork and playing the role of your merc (playable character). If you keep that in mind, all classes are balanced, while some perform a bit underwhelming.  Medics get lower HP the better they can heal, Damagedealer have high HP and explosives yet no utility, supporter/engineers have a mix between low and medium HP, while being overall versatile.\n\nGUNS\nThe guns in the game all have there respective range in which they shine. Shotguns and sniperrifles being the hardest to use due to the high movementspeed of most characters. Models itself are nice. Have some neat details. Sound of the guns is okay, could feel a bit more powerful for some weapons. Just the arsenal of firearms itself is mediocre. Shotguns all feel pretty much the same, same for sniper rifles. SMGs and Assault rifles are very shooter standard.\n\nMOVEMENT\nMovement. This is DBs biggest distinctive mark to stand out of the mass of shooters. First of all the gameplay is pretty fast, hipfire accuracy is very good. Time to kill overall decently high. That results in exciting firefights where good aiming gets rewarded a lot. On top of that the game has so called double jumps that make you bounce of any wall. Results are a lot more movement options, and shortcuts on the maps. Some jumps are quite tricky, giving you a higher skillceiling. (The maps have different spots made on purpose for doublejumps, while some other spots seem to be found by the community)\n\nMERCS\nCharacters all have a distinct look and role. Every character has one or two special abilities, like a turret, medkits, a healing station, mines or a much faster repairtool. Nothing we never saw before, but the choice is big (21 mercs currently) and you have to nail it down to 3 per match. Most mercs are locked, with 3 being free for everyone in a 2weekly rotation. New ones can be bought with either ingamecredits (1-2 weeks playing per char when playing 1-2 hours daily. Can be shorter if you time your playtime with the missions for more credits) or for real munies. (Which is a lot, and I wouldnt do, unless you want to support the devs) Callouts from each merc are by a different voiceactor, with different phrase. I like it a lot.\nSome mercs are more powerful then others, but currently no merc is ridiculous  better then the rest of its class. Some feel a bit weak, but its early access, and many weak spots got touched already.\nGuns for mercs cant be simply choosen, you rather euqip loadout cards that define primary, secondary and minor skills. Loadoutcards come in different varations and colors, while ALL gameplay affecting loadout options are buyable for credits, only COSMETIC stuff is available at a siginifcantly higher chance for real money.\nWhat I heavily dislike is the amount of explosionspam going on in public matches. Way to many nades, bombs and mines of all sort and size...\n\nMAPS+gamemodes\nMaps get designed for exactly one (in theory 2) gamemodes. The main is a Rush alike with different stages and objectives to reach. Either only one round, or each site per team. The 2nd is a CS defuse clone. 1 bomb. 2 bombspots. no respawns. 2 minutes time.\nThat results in different well designed maps with a few really difficult chokepoints, that heavily put defenders in a advantage. Overall appearance of each map is okay. Many yellow tubes and yellow colored parts defining the dirty bomb look, while overall each map has a different and fitting colorstyle. Not as colorful as CoD though.\n\nPerformance and Menu:\nMenus are clunky and sometimes dont react, I would like it more snappy there. Setting options are enough to make the game work on most PCs. Overall performance ingame is really smooth. No laggs and only rare spikes on my end. (Which was a lot worse in the beginning)\n++++the game has russian servers. If youre EU player and you ever played CS, you know why thats great. WAY less language barriers ingame.","January 28","true","140.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dohbreh/recommended/333930/","dohbreh","Dr. Gnaw Mangus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dohbreh/","65 products in account","I started playing this game with little to no expectation, strangely I found myself quite addicted to it. I'll try to be fair as possible but still of course, it's biased as it's personal opinion afterall.\n\n\nFew reasons I suppose I'll list as Pros.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fast paced and fun FPS with interesting mechanics; give some reminecent and nostalgia to the older FPS of the 90s yet still have a bit of a modern fps feel.\n- FREE TO PLAY, I spent zero $ to get anything I need and no reason you shouldn't either if you so choose so. If you like the game you'll eventually get in the game currency to buy your mercs and create card/load outs naturally as you just simply play the game because you enjoy it. There is no reason one should complain about how slow one unlocks content or how expensive some things are, those are ultra first world problems should be completely omitted.\n- Most of the mercenaries I've played so far provide some good fun individually and can all exploit different gameplay or map mechanics to a general level or even specific specialized map/character mechanic/behavior.\n- A good number of differently load out/guns/combination of cards per individual merc.\n- Good games are quite rewarding, a good game in my opinion is everyone under stands their roles and play them well or even as just intended regardless win or lose.  Everything and every mercenary can make a difference if played well/accordingly.  Following points below ------v\n*KDR means something: Some mercs are better than others are killing/denying enemy of objectives and zoning\n*Objectives means something: Some mercs are better than others are getting the objective done while those who are denying/killing/zoning are doing their jobs to keep these objective mercs safe\n*Dying means something: You can time your deaths to cause disruption to the enemy team if you're skilled enough and die right when the counter is ready to spawn you. Other than that, if you are dead, you provide no purpose while counting down to revive and spending extra time running across the map.\n*In the end, the game is meant to be a team oriented piece.\n*You can massacre people but no one doing objectives will do no good. People doing objectives but everyone dying will also do no good. Balance of both is key but will only happen in a "good" game or if you got a solid team of friends with you willing to progress further/learn.\n- There so far isn't exactly a "useless" mercenary or "OP" those would all be opinions only no factual evidence. Every merc does well at somethings and bad at others.\n- Easy to pick up with even more skill set to gain with gameplay\n\nCons:\n\n- A decent quantity of toxic players and no way to mute chat (you can mute mic but not chat) (can be quite prevalent and really really bad depending on individual basis and "rng") with all the same type of personality; especially certain pub nub scrub demographics. That's not to say there are also decent-good people types playing this game but those salt and sour players energy vampires really get irritating if it's happening continuously.  The toxic levels seem a bit more prevalent than other f2p games for some reason but thus the internet in general...\n- You may say, why not just stick with comp?\n*Long game searches\n*If you do run into a hacker in one, game is officially ruined.\n*Quite possible to get people on your team who quit prematurely and ruin the game. Even when it says "safe to leave" I don't think it is and still penalizes you...\n*Can turn out imbalanced as hell somewhat often, reason I'm guessing is lack of player base there.\nActual reason, I do not know. For example: you can be on a team total of level 3x whereas the other team can be 6x. If theoretically all 10 players are the same skill level, those on the higher side should have map and mechanical knowledge at their disposal more so than the lower level team. So many factors\n- A few hackers here and there but it's only really bad if you end up with them in a competitive match since you can just leave a regular pub any time. This can tie into the above mention as it's easy to blame players for hacks regardless of skill level or if they are or not if someone deems some (impossible chit is happening so they must be hacking).\n- Some load outs may seem useless, you can gamble unwanted cards from lead-cobalt but there is no way to downgrade if you'd want to do so.\n- Anti hack seems buggy at times but it's supposedly being addressed\n\nAs for PC optimization, I think this game can run on most systems easily. I run the game maxed out and even when test recording with overwolf or fraps barely drops fps.\n\nThis is what I have in my PC.\n\ni5 quad\n8gb ram\nnvidia 970 gtx\n\n\n7.5/10 Realistically if gameplay alone I'd rate it to 8.5-9/10\n\n-2.5 for impotent raging lunatics hell bent on bringing you down with them because of who you play, how you play, after you own them too much for their liking, and for those few games the hackers and premature quiters/leavers end up in for your competitive matches if you're into those. Simply with a chat mute much like some games have implemented in conjunction with mic mute will bring the game up a full point alone. A block function could also work, but not sure how it can be established with the way this game sets up the lobby/room/server which ever you want to call it.\n\nRegardless of my fat cons list, the gameplay itself is great and provides solid quick FPS gameplay with minimal downtime (If you die at the full 20-25 respawn timer it can be irritating but it's still fast). Best of all, it's absolutely F2P. If you're waiting for other titles and wanting to try out some new different form of FPS give this game a shot.\n\nSorry for the long review for those who don't care they won't make it down to the end anyways.","September 7, 2015","true","261.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","4"

For a F2P game, it's one of the best out there. It's fast, competartive, and fairly intuative. I'm not too wordy, so I'll just list my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Fun game play\n- Short matches\n- Unique characters and classes\n- Interesting load out mechanic that is extreemly unique\n- Doesn't appear to be too many trolls, which is nice for a F2P shooter\n\nCons:\n- Matches are nearly impossible to join with friends. Servers are always saying that they are full when they aren't, or aren't full when they are.\n- Guns feel like airsoft guns. With the exception of the mounted machine guns, they all sound weak and pitiful. Even the not!Deagle sounds like something that would barely cause welts.\n- As it stands, the game isnt terribly balanced. Shotguns are too powerful at close ranges (even for shotguns), rifles are too weak, and medics can heal themselves way too well, making them the best people for a firefight, which is kind of silly.\n\nAll in all, a very solid F2P game.","June 4, 2015","true","8.0"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","14","24","4","0"

Now the cons:\n-♥♥♥♥, this community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ salty\n-People don't know the definition of, "I'm better than you" for the most part\n-The amount you earn and how much classes are is stupidly expensive\n-Getting kicked for supposedly breaking security violations somehow on multiple occasions (I know I'm not the only one, and some people have had it worse)\n-Hackers everywhere, and they don't get punished\n-The way ranking works for competitive is stupid (Based on what people are saying)\n-Sometimes you may end up constantly getting disconnected from the same match for no good reason\n-The obvious fact that the security for this game is garbage\n\nOverall, I have a guilty pleasure for this game, but I can't deny that this game is ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal in almost every way except the gameplay and the pay to play aspect of this game (To a point).  The company behind Dirty Bomb needs to get their head out of their ♥♥♥ and make a huge change to this game, or else we may just see this die just like every other crappy free-to-play game out there\n\nPS: I like Angry Joe, but man he was wrong about this game being pay-to-play.

Knifes do more damage than rifles for some odd reasons and the objectives feel lackluster.\n\nSo, lets see the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n-Fun\n-Something different\n-Lot's of mercs/classes\n-Good style of graphics (They really look pretty)\n\nCons:\n-Gunplay feels stupid and random\n-Matches feel too one-sided with no chance of one player making a difference or even having the power\n-Extremely low skill cap\n-Mercs are overly expensive meaning you either buy them or play for 20-30 hours for one cheap merc and about 50-60 hours for the most expensive ones\n-Guns barely do any damage (not even joking, you need at least 10 body shots with an ak to kill someone), and knifes do twice the damage for some reason\n\nNow, here's the thing, this isn't a bad game at all.. It's genuinely a decent game, doesn't feel p2w.. But you'll need to spend money in order to enjoy the game in the long run.\n\nBut i can't forgive an fps that has invisible mercs with melee weapons that do more damage than a gun for some odd reason.. Like i said, skill is very important aspect in a fps and this game lacks that in a big way.\n\nIf you wanna compare this game, compare it to TF2, but TF2 is way better anyway.. This game already only has at the most 10k active players and is a f2p on steam.. I hope im wrong, but i don't see a big future for this game unless some big changes are made.\n\n(And to clarify, i know its a team based fps, i played a lot of TF2 and Battlefield, but my point stands)","July 11, 2015","false","15.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Seems like an ok amount at first. But wait, to get new loadouts, you need to open up boxes that cost 1,000 credits, and the boxes equate to CSGO or TF2 crates of you getting 1/10 chance to get something you may like. Oh, but wait. You can trade up crap loadouts you get to get the next tier of loadout. Oh, and when you trade up you dont choose the next level loadout you get so you may or may not get something you like.\n\nDo you want to try a new merc? There are a bunch to choose from with there own special things about them. And you can play them all right out of the gate! Right? Riiight? WRONG. Unless you pay 20$ (way to much for what the game is in my opinion) you need to buy them with real money or credits. Oh but wait! Do you love weekly free rotations? I know I don't! Well, its there, and you can play as 2 new mercs a week! Wow! What a great system! Alright, fine. You want me to unlock new mercs by playing? Fine, lets see how many credits it will cost me. 30,000 to 50,000 credits. How many credits do you get per game? About 150 to 200. Oh but there are daily missions you can do to get bonus credits! Lets take an example here: (Real in game excerpt)\n\nObjective Monkey - Earn 10,780 Game Mode XP\n\nHow much is that really? Well you get about 100 XP every time you do something in a match.\nDo the math.\n\nIts a shame because the gun-play is really solid here. There is a cool system of secondary objectives where if the offending team does something it may give them a flank or new option to help with the main objective in game.\n\nBut I will never get used to Mobile Free-to-Play system in games that I play in my home on my computer.\n\nI will give it a thumbs up because I love the gunplay so much, but hopefully this system of credits and paying really money to play as more mercs and get better gear goes away when the game gets its full release.\n\nTL-DR:\n-The gameplay is awesome. Gunplay feels fast paced and solid.\n-Weekly rotation to play as different mercs without paying real cash is annoying since grinding enough credits to buy them is a real drag and takes forever.\n-Annoying FTP mechanics to get gear thats half decent.\n-More mercs being made, Nexon expects you to pay for them before they balance it.\n-Anti Cheat is extremely flawed, Nexon also has access to your RAM cache while the game is installed.\n\nEDIT: With more mercs on the way, its becoming more and more apparent that the devs expect you to pay for the class now, and balance them later. Yes some new classes perfectly counter each other, but in order for you to play as that counter you have to pay money or credits. Think of it as an Engie build a sentry in a really good spot in TF2 and you need a spy to sap it. Well the thing is you need to pay 10 dollars or 50,000 credits in order to pick the spy class. Or an Engie getting harrased by Spys, and the only way to play pyro to counter them is buy paying cash or credits. Its stupid.\n\nOh and its hacker central. Also the games "anti cheat" has access to you RAM cache while you have the game installed. This sh*t is illegal in the EU and I dont really feel comfortable with Nexon having that kind of access on my system.\n\nIs it worth it?: When the day comes that you can play as all classes for free I can reccomend this game. But untill that day, I hope you enjoy spending cash or getting ♥♥♥♥♥ by Naders and Phantoms.\nAlso, wait untill they get there anti cheat sorted out, if they ever do.","May 27, 2015","false","34.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One of my favorites was "Blacklight Retribution" and I witnessed get bought out and made super pay to win.  Alot of people told me to play this.  I am a big FPS fan.  I love games like "Counter Strike", "Insurgency", and "TF2".  This is basically TF2/COD/Battlefield/CS.  It isn't anything brand new or genre defining, however the combat is tight and rewards accuracy.  Also, in it's current state you need to pay absolutely nothing to progress in game.  I have only played 8 hours (at the time of this review) and I have 2 mercs unlocked with in game XP.  There are three free mercs on rotation every two weeks.  The system of the market is really strange.  There are loadout "cards" you get for each class you unlock with unique passive abilities.  There is more to it than that, but it's a little confusing.  All in all it's a great title made by "Splash Damage" veterans of the classic "Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory".  I highly recommend you jump in and give it a shot :)\n\nEDIT:  I really, really, really, really, really, really, REALLY LOVE this game.  However, as it stands having the classes behind pay/grind walls will be egregious and hurt the game in the long run.\n\nThis is NOT pay to win.  I repeat, NOT pay to win!\n\nIf you think it is go play some of the absolutely atrocious f2p games out there.  However, it just isn't inviting to a new player when you can only choose from 3 free classes a week.  I think they should have all classes be free, there is enough incentive already to buy loadouts and skins.  What sucks is "Nexon" (I can only assume it is them in charge of the business model) is treating this like every other crappy f2p game they made a few bucks off of and drove into the ground.  This isn't another "TF2 Clone" (in alot of ways it is BETTER and that's coming from a BIG TF2 fan).  They need to compete with upcoming games like "Overwatch" and "Battleborne".  The game is fantastic but I fear for its future.  I want this game to succeed so badly, so I bought some mercs to support the developers but they are way too expensive now (10 bucks a pop).  The combat, slight freerunning ability, and overall movement are just so fluid and tight it's remarkable.  This CAN be the next big competitive game.  I really hope when it releases out of beta they take these words into account.  "Splash Damage" are some of the best FPS devs out there, I want to see them hit it big again :)","June 30, 2015","true","150.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","6"

But it has solid gunplay, fun movement mechanics, nice class design, and solid writing. All the ingame dialogue is very funny and reasonably well voiced.\n\nIt isn't p2w, either. People may claim it is, but people are dumb. You pay to skip the grind. The grind isn't even that painful. Games like Warframe or most any moba can only bow their head in shame. A merc costs 50k credits, and I can earn 15k in a day pretty easily thanks to the revamped mission system. Basicaly; do the missions (play using this merc/play this game type/perform this role), and you'll get credits. Missions refresh every 3 hours, and any completed missions will be replaced with new ones.\n\nFor a beta, it's a very solid product. And it has amazing potential.

It IS in Beta so there are bugs and some mercs need to be balanced a little better but overal the devs have done a great job of keeping things fare. As for P2W factor, it is non-existant. There is absolutly no way you can say that this game is P2W. It is a true F2P game. This game is fun to solo on the public servers and even better when you can grab some friends and join a competitive match and put your skills to the test. Over all a very well done game for being in beta. I look forward to the future of DB as I belive it will be a bright one. I give it a rating of 9/10 due to bugs and optimization but I am going easy because DB is in Beta. If DB was a full release the rating would be lower.

Well here's why:\n\nThis game is lack of Heroes/Mercenaries Rosters, you only get to choose 5 Hero/Mercenaries Rotation weekly, the system is very similar to MOBA games like League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, etc. Each hero is cost like $9 to absolutely $19 Dollars. I know it's crazy right? Since this game is sort of a soft launch and it's already OUT of beta. I'm sorry to say, this game is still needs an improvement.\n\nThe very ANNOYING part about this game is Cheap Recoil mechanics. Obviously THIS GAME doesn't have ANY Recoil specific gameplay. You just Point and Shoot. Annoying Part? ALMOST ALL WEAPONS IS SHOOTED STRAIGHT FOWARD WITH NO BULLET DROP. Yes, this like idk....... Casual FPS? Some Heroes/Mercenaries are still Overpowered AND Extremelly annoying escape mechanism. Medic specific Heroes is obviously broken due to their High healing abilities AND CHEAP HIGH DAMAGE SHOTGUN.\n\nAnd please, do not make this game as Pay 2 Win process. This game has already an extremely broken Grind 2 Win Process such as Daily Quest and hard achievement to gain Reward.\n\nFurther or more, this game is not worth of my time, BUT this game is very good.","July 16, 2015","false","6.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

Look to youtube, the forums, or to more experienced players in order to learn all of the mechanics.

If you liked Brink you will be right at home with DB as it is similar and made by the same company, SplashDammage. Some say it is also like TF2 mixed with CS:GO but either way, it is a great game. It IS in Beta so there are bugs and some mercs need to be balanced a little better but overal the devs have done a great job of keeping things fare. As for P2W factor, it is non-existant. There is absolutly no way you can say that this game is P2W. It is a true F2P game. This game is fun to solo on the public servers and even better when you can grab some friends and join a competitive match and put your skills to the test. Over all a very well done game for being in beta. I look forward to the future of DB as I belive it will be a bright one. I give it a rating of 9/10 due to bugs and optimization but I am going easy because DB is in Beta. If DB was a full release the rating would be lower. Definitly a good game and I highly recomend you download it and try it out for yourself. Good luck and have fun guys.","September 14, 2015","true","819.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/honeytoken/recommended/333930/","honeytoken","honey.token","http://steamcommunity.com/id/honeytoken/","24 products in account","A seemingly big issue with DB is that with the persistent bugs, SD has been unable to keep people actually playing this game so even though you as a player are constantly gaining levels your teammates are almost always in the 7 to 15 range which seems to be the drop off point for most people.  Creating actual new content that isn't cosmetic seems to be the biggest hurdle for Splash Damage at this point because even though they have created this amazing atmophere for the game, the events and loadouts are absolutely crippled by poorly communicated RNG elements which seems to be EVERYONES biggest gripe with this game, new or old.  Unless you like trinkets that you add to your gun that only you can see, then you're out of luck because theres literally nothing else to buy that is worth your money which is kinda silly once you realize this game is soley dependant of monetization and the lack thereof is sealing the games fate.\n\nSomething that has always personally bothered me about the developement of DirtyBomb is that they over the past year staggered the release of content that was seen in the closed beta only to be released in a untouched state and then completely redone and nerfed in the the preceeding patch/hotfix.  So once the broken characters have sat on the back burner for a couple months the devs respond by making tweaks that literally nobody has asked for (EMP Phantom, seriously???) and nerfing characters that belong to the in-game meta, because ♥♥♥♥, why not? The competitive scene is deader than nu-metal.  Instead of making broken mercs play well, they nerf nicely working characters to sit more in line with the broken ones and the same thing goes for card augments.  Most changes we have seen this year to the game have been focused entirely on those casual low level players that quit the game @ level 15 which doesn't  seem to paint a positive future for DB at all.\n\nI'm writing this review just a few days after the game hits its 1 year anniversary into open beta and frankly the game is not in a good place.   Ranked is currently disabled due to a bug in SD's flagship gamemode "Stopwatch" causing teams to draw even though there was a clear winner.  Public matches are a unbalanced mess and are usually stomps/obliterations. The game will often stack all the high levels against the low levels for seemingly no reason. The amount of crazy crap going on in game now is amplified, and down right unfun if you're facing  the likes of Thunder, Nader, Phantom  or the snipers (or any combination of these.)  SD has always expressed the importance of the speed factor in DirtyBomb, but characters like Thunder and Phantom directly go against that philosophy.  Don't like being flashed and your entire screen going white every 16 seconds?  Don't like being killed by some dude that is legit invisible? Well Dirty Bomb is def not the game for you\n\n\nExecution mode is an absolute joke. If SD wants to think of when things started to go downhill, its with the release of this game mode that nearly everyone hates.  Execution is nothing more than a glorified deathmatch with a bomb shoehorned in. It is a complete waste of developmenet resources. Go into a match of Execution and 2/3rds of the people there will tell you they're only there to complete their dailies. On paper 'Execution' doesn't work, in practice 'Execution" doesn't work.  The individual abilities and mercs strengths & weaknesses simply do not work in this gamemode.\n\nIncredibly sluggish user interface that eats up an immense amount of CPU\n\nNexon Game Security:  The 'anti-cheat' kicks more legitimate players than it does ones that are actually cheating. I'm not going to blame SD on this one because I'm sure they are contractually obligated to use Nexon's anti cheat but this thing is a heaping pile of garbage.  During the ReV event I had to restart my computer before playing DB everytime or I'd get kicked for a game security violation in my first match.  Think of how many legitimate players DB has turned away because they couldn't stop getting kicked for not actually cheating?  The last dev stream I watched even they got kicked for Game Security Violation on their own game!  Oh and if NGS crashes, so will your game\n\nEvents crippled by miscommunicated RNG elements\n\nSee-Saw effect of balancing: Changes are made to certain mercs/augments/cards with seemingly no consideration as to how they will affect other characters in the game. For example; Fletcher is completely check-mated by phantom in the current build. There isn't a single character in the game that is as countered as Fletcher is by Phantom which means there is very little reason to play Fletch (my favourite merc) over Bush which is currently superior in every single way.  The same thing goes for guns/augments. Certain guns/augments will be in such a bad state for such a long time that you trade out all your cards featuing the weapons/augments only for them to eventually add some balance months down the line but its too late because you've already traded.\n\nGen 2 cards:  There are still mostly only 3/9 usuable cards for any given merc\n\nDevaluing limited edition items:   With the release of gen2 cards, a large percentage of Gen1 (event/cobalt/gold) cards are now worth pennies.  "Coalsplitter" trinket, a free trinket that is the combination of two LIMITED EDITION (one cost $5) items given away for free? Seriously?\n\nRanked has never recovered from the hacker spree of Summer 2015 and no matter what SD does to revitalize it, it hasn't worked yet.\n\n"Open Beta" :  You can't just excuse the stuff I've mentioned above by stating "The game is still in beta!"  --  it really isn't, Name one other beta game that has $40 RNG DLC (cards) and has been around as long as DB. The store functions better than any other aspect of the game and in my opinion as soon as you start monetizing your game, you're no longer in beta\nDirty Bomb is my favourite game, I still play it nearly everyday but I can not in good concious recommend it to you in its current state.","June 5","false","164.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

And we all know how much I ♥♥♥♥ing love Brink.\nBrink was the masterpiece of all FPS', surpassing popular FPS games such as Halo, Counter Strike, Call of Duty, and Battlefield all in one go. Repetitive objective, bullet sponge player characters, parkour, and stupidly good AI TRULY set this masterpiece a part from the shovelware FPS's of its era. In addition, its story WAS the multiplayer, so we could all get engaged with the cardboard characters of the story, and the plot that noone cares about. Truly a goldmine of gaming.\n\nNow can Splash Damage follow up with another good game, and free us from the mountain of ♥♥♥♥ FPS's such as Battlefield Hardline, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, and Titanfall?\n\nShort Answer? No. If thats all you came for, then please leave as I go and do an IN-DEPTH analysis of everything about this game.\n\nStory:\nThis game follows in Brink’s fabulous footsteps. Do you have a ♥♥♥♥ing clue whats going on? No. Its in London I guess. Two factions are duking it out all throughout London, blowing up buildings with EMP’s somehow, Capturing datacores by driving trains through buildings, and many more crazy missions. For what you may ask?\nI HAVE NO ♥♥♥♥ING IDEA, AND NEITHER WILL YOU.\nIn addition, these two factions use clone technology rather excessively, as you have a choice of a handful of mercs, and everyone who plays them looks the exact ♥♥♥♥ing same. We have no idea why these few were chosen to be heavily cloned, so it leaves much for the player to decide with this story. I love stories that I HAVE to come up with to make sense of things. In this aspect, Dirty Bomb gets it right. Vague storylines are the way to go.\n\nGraphics:\nThis game follows Brink’s classic art style, except this time I’m getting constantly good frames, which sucks. I much rather my graphics lag all to ♥♥♥♥. Now this may be my elite rig doing all the work with its 256KB of RAM, and its Appian J Pro graphics card, but I think they honestly tried to improve the graphics to run smoothly, which really takes away from the atmosphere of the Brink series. So for this reason, I’m going to list graphics as a con. The low framerates really made the Brink environment more believable.\n\nGameplay:\nNow for the important bit. The gameplay. As we all know, the gameplay from this game’s predecessor, Brink, was the very peak of the gaming experience not too long ago. It brought small, repetitive map design, incredibly simple objectives, parkour, and many other things.\nThe first on Splash’s chopping block was the parkour. You can no longer wall run, and only wall jump, making Parkour that much harder to pull off.  This makes the very FEW parkour obstacles harder to pull off, and as we all know, parkour is VERY easy to pull off in real life. This makes this game incredibly unrealistic. Its limited parkour is a con for this game.\n\nNow for the map design. The map design is pretty non-repetitive, making this game stupidly hard, as I know have to remember all these hot spots and map configurations, where I could simply remember one map and do just fine in Brink. Having the player juggle all these maps together is artificial difficulty, and for that reason, the map design is a con.\n\nThere are about 10-ish classes right now, as opposed to Brink’s four. However Brink had four VERY unique classes, where this game has some classes that have similar if not the same abilities and weapons. Why have more classes if you are not going to take the time to make them all unique?\n\nNow I wanna go more into this, but thinking of all its features that Brink did so well that were destroyed by this game makes me want to cringe. So I’ll move on.\n\nMusic:\nThis game has music?\n\nAs you can see, Splash Damage tries to improve a flawless game, and instead only creates flaws that diminish Brink's great story and atmosphere. Splash Damage could have handed me a literal copy of brink and wrote a 2 beside "Brink" on the cover with permanent marker, and I would have much rather bought that instead. This game's price tag is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous for what this game is.","June 30, 2015","false","21.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","10","17","4","0"

I mean, it has a great movement system and nice classes that would have been so cool in a different game with bigger maps and more open ended battle than a bunch of corners in which campers utilize to avoid using said movement system and for said classes to place proximity mines behind.\n\nOn a good game you will get 200-500 credits per 15 or so minute match, and most classes require 30k to 50k, and even then their good loadouts cost 17k or so a pop. I'm not playing this game that long with the low amount of maps on offer here and the unbalanced gameplay. You will seldom have a game where one team doesn't steamroll the other one. There's a loadout crafting feature in place to make the grind feel like less of a grind, but cases seem to only come like once in a blue moon, almost always land on loadouts for classes you don't have yet, and you need 3 of them to make a new loadout for a class you DO have.\n\nIt also, without fail, will always seem to cocktease you with a super rare loadout, but then pick the one directly next to it. 9/10 times there was a rare loadout right next to the one RNG picks from the case. To the point where I'm convinced that's an intentional "♥♥♥♥ you".\n\nIt feels like every game is won by who can camp the best and in the largest numbers within the tightest spaces. I initially started doing what the game seemed like what it was designed for, which is walljumping and essentially playing it like battlefield 2 meets quake 3, running around and fragging people left and right but then I tried playing it like a camper would in call of duty just to see if the problem was with my own skill and I saw my KD/R increase by a disgusting margin.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone except the CoD crowd.","June 7, 2015","false","5.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

For those of you that don't, you will have very big issues when playing with people who have severe latency differences.\n\nCheats Everywhere, the game has no reliable anti-cheat system, and the one it does have is laughable. Even in the competative scene, which would be called ranked for most other games, cheaters are everywhere. So it's a joke to take it seriously at this time.\n\nCompletely imbalanced and toxic community. Getting Spawn Killed, prepare to be told to git gud, some player wants to go around and talk about how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are, kicking them basically requires the entire team to vote. There is no Base ♥♥♥♥ Protocol, in lay mans terms a part of the game that prevents people from sieging the spawn point to prevent the enemies from even participating in the game. This happens all the time, players will enter the spawn when no one is there and sit back and kill you after you spawn.\n\nNo balancing system, when you join a match you are able to decide what side you want to be on Attacker or Defender, however the game does not balance players in the match so you could have 8v2 and the game will do nothing to balance until the match is over. Additionally the game attempts no balance based on skill, so a team of level 8+ could fight a team of level 1's and 2's and the game does nothing to balance this out. Which is very hostile to new players.\n\nThis game says it is in Open Beta, but receives microtransactions, which means they are confident enough their game is able to make money. So to me that game is fully released, as such it should be held to the same standards as other released games.\n\nIn terms of fun it can be 10/10 or it could be 1/10 it depends solely on the random people you get placed with and against.\n\nIn terms of balance 1/10 it has no real way to stop cheaters, botters, hackers at all. So if you get one on the enemie team, well your ♥♥♥♥ out of luck, either leave the server or die over and over. But this happens oftern so be prepared to shift servers 3-4 times before you get one that isn't bad.\n\nIn player base, out of the hundred of people I played with and against, most stayed quiet, a few dozen decided to be openly hostile and a few were nice.\n\nDo I recommend this game, no, I don't it's looking like a cash grab at the moment as it has some serious problems with how it is managed. If those get fixed, sure I'll recommend it, otherwise, stay away unless you enjoy torture.","July 1, 2015","false","13.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Sometimes you will be forced to play with a bunch of Lvl 3 people, other times with a bunch of Lvl 25 and, in a worst scenario, in a 8v3 situation, and guess what? There's NO autobalance in this game, it tries to "balance" in the lobby but most of the times It doesn't help at all\n-They could implement some character limit restriction so you won't be playing in a team full of "useful" Vasilis\n-Hackers, It's not that common nowadays but there are a few of them\n-Poor balance overall, weapons/character-wise\n-Bad voice acting and awful character lines (Fletcher lines are utter garbage, Phantom is great though)\n-Good drops from boxes are extremely low and the money you get from matches don't pay enough since you will be trying to get better loadouts/characters. There's not a efficient way to get money other than playing "Missions"\n-Few maps\n\nGame has a lot of potential as I said but the lack of balance in the matches, and no way to prevent teams to stack is really frustrating.

This was done just by playing, so the whole paying cash for the rare cases/mercs thing isn't worth it really.\n\nIn-game currency is easily obtainable, characters are somewhat balanced, and team play is really good, since everyone's spawned in waves. Every team needs an ammo guy, a healer, and objective specialist to be successful, and I really like that. One person can't make or break a team, you always need to work together.\n\nThe hacking problem aside, this game is a ton of fun for me. Only thing I wish could be implemented would be trading loadout cards and reverse crafting (e.g. 1 gold = 3 random silvers)\n\nWould recommend.","July 15, 2015","true","435.9"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jewce/recommended/333930/","jewce","nax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jewce/","146 products in account","A good start, but needs improvement.  I'll start with what the game does well, and then move on to what needs work.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThis game is *FAST*.  I'm sick of slow shooters and Dirty Bomb just feels great.  Movement speed is nice, damage is high but not CSGO / CoD high, there's wall jumping (albeit not extremely useful)\n\nThis game's gunplay is right on point.  Meaty explosions, nice powerful sounding weapons... the feedback is excellent.  Splash Damage, as usual, delivers strong shooty bits.\n\nThe netcode is good.  Anything below 120 feels very playable without extremely annoying hitbox problems.  I've played many FPS's that were ruined in part by poor netcode.  This isn't one of them.\n\nThis game is updated frequently and developers communicate frequently with the playerbase.  Problems aside, they atleast listen and update us frequently on changes.\n\nStuff that needs work:\n\nFirstly, you don't get all the mercs in one go.  You can't even pay for a total merc unlock in any reasonable $ amount.  Mercs are 30k to 50k, and be prepared to grind weeks out just to get a single merc unless you can play several hours every day.  The prices need a SERIOUS adjustment.  Cutting credit costs in half would do wonders.\n\nNext, the microtransactions are a waste.  Credit boosters do not mathematically make any sense.  30k mercs cost $7, while 50k mercs cost $10.  The packages you can buy also are poorly thought out, as if you already have mercs in any of the packages you actually lose out on value.  Example:  the starter pack has Vasilli and Sawbonez in it.  I have already unlocked both of these mercs, so if I buy the starter pack, I lose out on a hefty amount of value.  At this point, I have atleast one merc in every single bundle - basically, I lose out no matter what bundle I'd like which ensures that there's no way I'll pay for it.  You can also buy elite cases with real money which is a waste because they are overpriced and there's no garauntee you'll even get something worthwhile.\n\nNEEDS MORE MAPS!\n\nFinally, due to this game's freegame nature - cheating is absolutely rampant.  Check the Steam forums / nexon forums to see why.  Since this isn't a paid game, cheaters do not worry about being banned as they just re-register a new account.  The game's anticheat is XIGN which is infamous at slow updates.  There is also no way of reporting many cheaters who use unknown characters.\n\nIn it's present state, I'll give it a 6/10.  I'll address this later as more classes, balance, and maps are added.  But, as it is in Beta and is Free-To-Play, I recommend it for all you FPS fans.","June 24, 2015","true","63.5"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","14","25","0","0"

Which means that you need your teammates to help you play the objs and hold down an area. You are more likely to win if you are denfending in the match. The game is not a rush and shoot people type of game, but this doesn't mean that there is no action. You will be getting into a lot of gun fights, but you won't be able to always get the kills. It take a few rounds to get someone down and a few more to kill them, so basically a clip per 2 kill if you miss a decent amount. The game it self is hard to master and get good, but it's easy to jump in and not get lost. You just need some time to get the hang of the support perks like the airstrike (Not op like it sounds) and health packs. The good thing is that when you are down you can ask a teammate to help you up and you'll get up or get a medic to shock you and you'll get up faster with more health. This being said you have to confrim your kills so he doesn't get back up and kill you.","February 21, 2015","true","150.8"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","21","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chosen_none/recommended/333930/","chosen_none","xzez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chosen_none/","82 products in account","DB is a free2play fast paced FPS, and generally doesn't disappoint in that regard, but it falls down in so many others.\n\n--- The very, very basics ---It's a class based FPS where you attack/protect/deliver/retrieve objectives. You can have max 3 mercs/classes of 15 (at the time of writing) in your "squad" per game. Each loadout has a primay, secondary, and melee weapon, along with up to 3 augments (perks).\n\n--- Classes/Loadouts ---It's a horrible system designed to dig as much money as possible from your wallet. The mercs (classes) are pretty straight forward to acquire, you can use in game currency or real money to acquire them. The loadouts are based on a lottery system that is possibly the worst I've encountered. Loadouts are pre-set (ie. no customization) on cards and are awarded randomly via slot-machine style. The come in rarity ranging from lead, iron, bronze, silver, gold, and cobalt. From bronze up there is no difference aside from cosmetic. Want a specific combination of weapons and augments (perks)? Too bad, you'll have to live with only what they've included. Bronze cards can be bought outright, but if you want a specific loadout card in a higher rarity... well... good luck with that one.\n\n--- Gameplay/Balance ---It's a decent twitch shooter that is generally responsive, and has some double jumping thrown in for good measure. The balance is adaquate at best. Weapon balance feels all over the place: so many things will kill faster than primary weapons. Shotguns dominate in CQB more than they should, and can easily one-shot lower health classes. The healing mechanics in many instances are severely over powered - fighting a player in a healing field is futile. The revive mechanics are equally as broken: often having instances where you can't "finish" a player before they'll be revived to full health from across the map. The list of issues is lengthy and beyong full description herein, and all the changes in the "fine-tuning updates" typically move balance issues elsewhere, instead of actually correcting them.\n\n--- Maps/Gamemodes ---There are two game modes, but really more like 1.5 as they're the same mode with different timer setups. There are five maps, and with the way the game modes are setup, are played in sections. The problem with the maps is that some sections will be easy to complete, and then some others will be dramatically more difficult; it's not consistent.\n\n--- Monetization scheme ---First off, the game has a full cash shop and still purports itself as being in beta. IMO if you have a full cash shop you no longer retain such a luxury. Devs need to stop hiding behind "beta" for bugs and bad design.\nThe real deal is that almost nothing in the cash shop is worth it, the prices are so high there is virtually no value. The lottery based loadout system means half of the items are equivilent to dumping money into a slot-machine. The starter pack and some of the merc packs are the only things worth getting... maybe. I've encountered no one who disagrees with this outside of those who are rich, stupid, or both.\n\n--- Future ---I started playing this game in open beta; at the time it had a solid play base, but in the many weeks since has been hemorrhaging players, and it down to half of when I started playing. There's nothing being done to really retain or attract players. Every few weeks a new merc will come out, but never anything dramatically different. The kicker of it is that these mercs were all around in closed beta, they disabled them and then are slowly re-releasing them for open beta (cash grab anyone?).\nThere has been no new maps, and I have heard nothing of new ones. The same five maps get boring and repetitive.\n\n--- Other ---Yeah, this game has hackers, but it's not as bad as it was under the xigncode anticheat. The new Nexon Game Security anticheat seems to have killed a significant portion of the obvious hackers, but we'll see how long that lasts. The new anti-cheat seems to love false positives and crashing. Everyone I know has been kicked under false positive, and, the anticheat will randomly crash which results in being kicked for security violations as well. There is no in-game system for reporting hackers, and requires people to collect info and report hackers externally. The F2P nature of the game removes any wall for hackers to re-enter the game anyway.\n\n--- Follow up ---So I'm back after about a month and a half.\nNo new maps, no meaningful changes, no useful balance fixes. The only thing that has been added are things they can monitize, and only one merc at that. Keeping an eye on the steam charts, this game is bleeding players steadily. There aren't many regulars in this game - the game is filled with people who play this game for a week and dump it as is evident by servers being mostly filled with level <10.","September 6, 2015","false","260.9"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","23","43","0","5"

Each character has their own kooky personality, traits, and accents, differentiating each other effectively. And I can’t think of a good Segway, so I’m just calling it out: The developers, Splash Damage, once worked on another title with similar gameplay. You may have heard of it, it was called Brink. Now Brink was a little bit of a broken, messy disaster when it first came out. It didn’t help itself by immediately calling itself a rival to Team Fortress 2, which went as well as the new weedy kid at school challenging the biggest guy in the playground to a fight, in a misguided attempt to assert his dominance. Splash Damage seem to have learned from their past mistakes and have worked to make Dirty Bomb a pretty fun game.\n\nAs stated before, Dirty Bomb splits players up into two teams. One team defends the objectives, the other team has to attack the objectives. These can range from blowing up a generator to blowing up a wall, blowing up a set of controls, or blowing up an entire building. In fact, there isn’t much variety there. Whether it’s the first, second or sometimes third objective, players will be detonating something. The most fun objective to attack and defend are the EV trucks. Attackers must escort it by walking alongside or mounting the turret while defenders need to disable it. Once it’s disabled, the defenders need to keep it disabled while attackers have to repair it. It’s strangely satisfying to call in a tactical nuke to blow the repairers away, especially with the fact that they get a warning before the explosion.\n\n\nI surely would recommend this game to anyone. 9/10","July 13, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It rewards teamwork, communication, good aim, movement, persistence, awareness and map- and merc knowledge. If you are into that stuff, you will spend hundreds of hours on it. The mechanics and mercs are very balanced, yet refreshingly asymmetric. Focus from the developers is on competition and good and diverse gameplay, all free to play (via rotation,) with no microtransactions and no P2W, as the most versatile mercs are the cheapest and are included in the Starter Pack, or easily grinded. Within your first hour of play, you will permanently have unlocked three mercs, two of the most allrounded support mercs and a merc of your choosing. Obviously the grind picks up a bit from there.The monetization model follows that of HOTS.\nThe learning curve is like the game of chess: easy to pick up, hard to learn and impossible to master. This does not mean it's not a game for casuals though, it is, just of a more mature audience or one that enjoys complexity.\nSystem requirements are low: most stationary personal computers from the past four years with a dedicated graphics card will be able to run it decently with medium to low graphics, yet it still looks great! Besides a dedicated graphics card (similar to Nvidia GTX260, or better) I'd recommend at least a dual-core processor.

Fun gameplay and lots of teamwork, along with a few bugs. I have not beena  big fan of many free to play games, but this one has been one of the few I have enjoyed.\n\nOnly played 3-4 hours so far but def keep an eye out for this game when it comes out this summer for everyone to try free.    If you liked Brink, Enemy Territories or Quake Wars from Splash Damage in the past or liked TF2, check this out. Gumbo of a online shooter filled with a bit of good ole Splash Damage gameplay with some aspects that will remind you of Team Fortress 2 in a few ways.\n\nLike Turrets? Like Teamwork gameplay for an online shooter? Liked past Splash Damage games? Like classes that are quite different? If so give this a try.","April 28, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I first heard of Dirty Bomb from the Youtuber MrMuselk.\n\nMy overall description:\nDirty Bomb is one of the most refreashing titles I have played in ages, it breathes new life into the co-opretive team based genre of shooters (some examples of these: Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike Series). The pure adreneline constantly coming from this game is overwhelming at points, every charachter moves at a very fast speed in this game, so reaction time is required. The games main objectives for every map made up to this point is basically a form of the Attack/Defense mode from TF2, mixed with the stress of the bomb defusal mode in the Counter-Strike series. This mix of gamemodes works extremely well, and I have yet to find a dull moment in this game because of this mix.\n\nPros:\nITS FREE, Really fair and easy to progress F2P model, in the sense that you cannot purchase in game currency with real money, ITS FREE, runs pretty well on most decent rigs, ITS FREE. Also, its still in beta, so the game can only improve from here on out, and its already one of my favorite MMO's in a long time.\n\nCons:\nSome of the Brink devs had a role in this, so take that as you wish. Sometimes finding a US East server can be challenging, it shouldnt affect most of you though. 2 charachters are extremely unbalanced currently, but the devs have agknowladged this, so it should be fixed soon.\n\nClosing:\nJust play it, its a fast download, and free, the only purpose of this review is to give you the first impression of it not sucking. Have fun!!!\n~Lost","June 7, 2015","true","382.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Can't stress how much I like it when a game runs well on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop.\n+  Large variety of classes providing diverse skillsets and gameplay, and you actually recieve 2 from the start and there is a free rotation.... and you can buy with currency earned through gameplay.\n\nCons:\n-  (NOTE: PROBABLY WILL CHANGE AS I PROGRESS IN-GAME, NOT DEFINITE) the "objective" mode and its variant are the only gameplay modes available at the start. Also, these modes have an "attacking" and "defending" side, which can be rather unbalanced in terms of teams, either that or I'm just being salty. People will quit or there will be one side completely dominating all match.\n\n\nAll that being said, give the game a shot first. It's actually pretty decent/great. I can see myself playing this for a long time to come.\n\nMay as well point out that any time spent inbetween unlocks for classes and the sort is not too unlike the unlock system in CoD games and the sort; it really is generous, possibly too generous.","July 10, 2015","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You can permanently unlock Mercs with either ingame credits, or cash.\nThis certainly isn't pay2win, because if you buy a merc, other people may be able to use it in a few weeks.\nIt only takes about 6-10 hours of playtime to be able to afford a merc with ingame cash anyway.\n\nYou can aim down sights, but it is not reccomended as there is nearly no (extreme) recoil, and it slows you down.\nTime to kill in this game is considerably long if you go for body shots, which is why headshots are always reccommended, as it's only 2-3 shots with an AR.\n\nPros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n-Attractive visuals\n-F2P, but buying things with cash does not give an unfair advantage\n-Accessible game with a high skill ceiling, easy to learn but hard to master\n-Free rotation mixes up gameplay\n-The game has "under level 5" servers for people new to the game\n-You're able to walljump twice and keep momentum, making awesome trick jumps and skill based movement possible\n-Gun play is great\n-Hitboxes seem fine\n\nNegatives:\n-Some maps and classes need tweaking, ie: longer cooldown for airstrikes\n-Lack of gamemodes and maps\n-The game requires a lot of communication and team work for your team to be successful.\n","July 9, 2015","true","53.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

What makes the game so unique and fun, is it's simple yet well designed gamemodes and maps. The gamemodes are easy to understand and reinforce the team-based nature of the game as well as making the game exciting and tactical. The use of the merc/class system in the game also allows people to perform particular roles in order for their team to win. The loadout system in the game is a little wierd, but its NOT pay to win. You can get lead,iron and bronze loadouts very easily without spending anything.Although there are silver,gold,cobalt and exclusive cards available, they give no advantage over the bronze ones whatsoever except the aesthetics! There are boosts available too for real money but these provide no advantage in a battle situation. Overall, I would highly recommend you try out this game if you enjoy team-based shooters and like a challenge!","March 4","true","96.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would not recommend playing this for a prolong period of time, you might either get carpell tunnel or become mlg god mode. Loadout cards are a new concept and is pretty good. Hope they add new loadouts and the abilelty to trade loadout cards. For this game being in Beta now, its very well put together, sure its not balaneced but really...is life? every merc can kill every merc, some have a advantage but really its up to 2 things, who aims better and whos gun shoots the fastest.","January 4","true","438.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sure there are some broken balancing, but what game doesn't?\nNetcode, hitreg, map designs and character designs are great. Unless you purposely join a server with over 100 ping, you'll almost never experience rubberbanding, getting hit when you've reached cover long ago or hits not registering because you died before the latency catched up.\n\nDirty Bomb operates smoothly, the game mechanics are fun and that's what's important in multiplayer first-person shooters.\n\nThe F2P aspect of this game is of no concern either. You can buy the mercs with money, but it takes only 1-3 of playing to get enough in-game credits to buy a new merc. Loadouts can be bought with the same credits and they're even acquired randomly when playing the game. You can increase the chances of getting a high rarity card which is purely cosmetic by buying a different case.

You can fire from hip with a fairly reliable accuracy allowing you to both avoid damage and deal it.  So it's a fire from the hip based game.\n\n-The concept of support class aka medics was executed as good as possible, it's fun to play support mercs in this game.\n\n-A lot of voice commands and taunts for every merc.\n\n-Frequent events, give aways and updates.\n\n-Wall jumps, each merc can do 2 wall jumps in a row, it's a small touch of agility that allows you to reach more places and dodge more easily, yet it's fairly hard to master.\n\n-Long jumps, another interesting movement addition, remember the jumping module from half life? (if you played it)\nWorks exactly the same, to perform one you must sprint crouch and jump at the same time, takes time to get used to.\n\nOVERALL RATING OF THE GAME: 8.9/10\nIt's defianetly worth your time.\n\n","April 5","true","667.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinnveyr/recommended/333930/","sinnveyr","Sinnveyr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinnveyr/","129 products in account","Here's a shooter that's fast, fun, competitive and doesn't have too many crutches for low skill players.\nUnlike a lot of popular shooters, you rarely see people calling out people use certain weapons for being too overpowered. Sure there are some broken balancing, but what game doesn't?\nNetcode, hitreg, map designs and character designs are great. Unless you purposely join a server with over 100 ping, you'll almost never experience rubberbanding, getting hit when you've reached cover long ago or hits not registering because you died before the latency catched up.\n\nDirty Bomb operates smoothly, the game mechanics are fun and that's what's important in multiplayer first-person shooters.\n\nThe F2P aspect of this game is of no concern either. You can buy the mercs with money, but it takes only 1-3 of playing to get enough in-game credits to buy a new merc. Loadouts can be bought with the same credits and they're even acquired randomly when playing the game. You can increase the chances of getting a high rarity card which is purely cosmetic by buying a different case. There is no P2W in Dirty Bomb.","April 5","true","038.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can fire from hip with a fairly reliable accuracy allowing you to both avoid damage and deal it.  So it's a fire from the hip based game.\n\n-The concept of support class aka medics was executed as good as possible, it's fun to play support mercs in this game.\n\n-A lot of voice commands and taunts for every merc.\n\n-Frequent events, give aways and updates.\n\n-Wall jumps, each merc can do 2 wall jumps in a row, it's a small touch of agility that allows you to reach more places and dodge more easily, yet it's fairly hard to master.\n\n-Long jumps, another interesting movement addition, remember the jumping module from half life? (if you played it)\nWorks exactly the same, to perform one you must sprint crouch and jump at the same time, takes time to get used to.\n\nOVERALL RATING OF THE GAME: 8.9/10\nIt's defianetly worth your time.\n\n","April 5","true","667.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a blast. Download this now, and just play a match or two. It's better with friends, but y'know, you do you. I don't neccessarily "main" this game. My icon is of my pride and joy TF2 hat for pete's sake. That said this game is very fun to just hop in and play for a while. I keep finding myself wondering what to do and ending up playing a quick round or two.\n\nThe first concern you'll probably end up with is "Wait, there's all these extra loadouts and mercs, but are they locked in cases and behind paywalls?" No, but you can take that route if you want. You can buy basic cases for 1,000 ingame credits for a chance at a nice loadout, or just wait for some cases to drop. You can save up credits to buy more mercs and loadouts. Everything in the store except special cases has an option to be bought with those little credits you earn ingame. It could take a while, but just do some research as to what you want to unlock, and you should be happy most of the time.\n\nWhat about graphics performance? Well... my first moment was a black screen. Having every graphics effect turned on by default didn't work out for my little integrated graphics card. I promptly turned it all to low, and now I get good FPS. The game is playable, and for my standards still nice enough to look at. A higher texture setting works wonders.\n\nControls? Some controls are a bit odd, but that's due to getting used to the game. You can remap some stuff if it just doesn't work out. Then again I haven't found myself struggling too much with the buttons, and just the timings of pressing buttons.\n\nActual gameplay? Well, the aiming is simple enough. Keep moving as much as you can, but hit those heads. Snipers can easily punish you walking in front of them at long ranges. There's a variance of what each class can do, but they all fill a few certain roles. Whether you're on the front lines or support you'll have options via the classes and loadouts about how you want to play. Movement is huge, and I've seen people do some pretty cool things. In some cases movement during combat has let people outplay me easily. You can hop over small walls, gaps, onto things, into things, etc and if you practiced and explored maps I'm sure you'd be able to surprise lots of people.\n\nOverall I recommend this game fully as it's free, and you can just back out of this at any time with no impact on your wallet.","February 17","true","642.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Turns out, #WorthIt. However, even though I meet the requirements to play the game normally, I had to put everything on "low" and change my resolution to 4:3 (800x600). But that didn't stop me from having a great time in the game. It was pretty fun, and I like that the game is not a pay to win, or a cash grabbing operation. Sure you can buy cases, but you dont need keys, and the game is not ever forcing you to buy them! I dislike the phantom a lot though. This class has destroyed the fun in the game, and those who had credits to buy it, are way OP, therefore, you can't do much, as it has cloak, armor that blocks any damage during, cloak, one hit kill melee, and a very good SMG. Therefore, I won't recommend this game until the they balance this class.        8.5/10","July 13, 2015","false","14.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Yo DON'T need to spend a dime, you can play as it is and have tons of fun. Everything can be purchased with ingame money that you can ear pretty easy by just playing.\n\nCould it have a little more content? maybe, but it's free, and totally worth your time. I look forward for this game to keep moving forward.

I should preface the rest of the review with how I really enjoy this game when both teams are fighting hard and somewhat ethically.  I know that seems strange to say, but this game isn't fun otherwise because it's extremely easy to spawncamp.  There aren't any random spawns... you pretty much spawn on top of the corpse they just killed while spawn camping.  Super frustrating.\n\nSo with that in mind, I really don't know what to think of this game.  There's lots of potential and it seems fairly polished and most characters are reasonably balanced.  It's just unfortunate that the programmers didn't think about something like spawning when designing maps.  There's absolutely no way to clear the opposing team out of the spawn once they are there.","July 1, 2015","true","23.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Brink and Counter Strike had a baby, but Brink might have also cheated on CS with League of Legends, DOTA, or some other MOBA.\nI can't personally say I recommend it to anyone, but if this sounds like your type of thing, go for it. it is free to play afterall.\n\n-Community: 5/10 About what you'd expect from an online game.\n-Netcode: 6/10 I've been killed by lag so bad I can't tell if the other guy's cheating or not, so yeah, I've seen better.\n-Handling: 8/10 Not the best, but it's pretty fluid.\n-Gameplay: 6.5/10 Everything's REALLY F**KING FAST like Quake, and the weird IFF outlines can get lost quickly in tight querters.\n-Graphics: 8/10 Pretty good overall for being a f2p game.\n-Aesthetics: 7/10 (See Gameplay ^) I heard it's post-apocolyptic, but the game does little to reinforce that feel, and running and gunning at close range gets pretty frantic with how hard it can be to tell friend from foe.\n\n-Overall: I'd say a solid 6/10 or so. Nothing ground breaking, nothing especially BAD. This game /mildly/ suffers what I've come to call "Zombie Panic Syndrom" (Go play Zombie Panic! Source to find out.) Be prepared to do a lot of dying due to being made of paper and fighting enemies who always take twice the damage you do, no exceptions. (Headshots never seem to kill enemies, but always 1 shot you, ect) Though it's not as bad as ZPS or other games that suffer this strange phenomenon. It's a team based game with little team work, insted favoring who has the best characte abilities. Thankfuly, it doesn't feel Pay2Win-ish, letting you get anything in the game if you wanna put in the time for grind. I can't complain and havn't put in a GREAT ammount of time to have a completely solid opinion.\n\nBUT\n\nIt's aight.","November 5, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I only have just entered into it and so can not say with absolute certainty.  Yet from my initial experiences as a game pro I am SUPER impressed.  The visuals are crisp and art well done, the gameplay is smooth as butter albeit seems a litte twitchy in gunplay compared to what I am used to.  The maps are well done, and the game modes varied, and even though I could not tell 100% for sure, I am 99% sure or so that FF was on by default in my first match.  That is completely MIND BOGGLINGLY PRO FOR A TITLE.  As you must know it is rare, yet some like myself WILL NOT EVEN PLAY on Non-Hardcore modes @ all...I am not kiddin.\n\nSO THIS GETS 10/10 just like Warface for my review.  This game is pure brilliance, and the coders did a superb job, and devs and GMs must also be doing fine for this to be so playable in Beta...it's just pure PROCORE gaming all the way.\n\nNot much else I can say beyond that for now, seriously though if you have not tried this yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a whirl and see if it's your thing...\n\nAlso wanted to mention I GOT A KILL IN MY FIRST MATCH (well 2nd yet first didn't count as I had it set to critical/realtime by accident and this caused gameglitches so when I set client to a proper HIGH priority it was awesome).  It was a little bit lucky of one, coming near the end, yet I still did it, and I used my support well!

If you want to spend time and money on virtual hats and a game that has not fixed simple things like shadows going through walls, poor hit registration, and so on, get tf2.\nSeriously, why is this game not more popular?\nI have zero complaints. If I had any they have been fixed or are going to be. Devs are super great and updates actually are useful.\nNo matter what anyone says, this game is not pay to win. I could play 4 matches and get useful cards. Anything above bronze is purely cosmetic. Ive heard people call it pay to win simply because there are case that you can use to get cards of high rarity. But you can get the same cards from a normal case that you find in a match. Not to mention they cost no money to open.\nMercs in this game are handled with an in game currency system. Most mercs are 50,000 credits while others are 30,000. Some people complain about the high prices but they have missions that if you do you can get 3000+ in a couple matches. ( includes completing first match of the day and winning first match of the day. Of those two, both apply to all 3 game modes, so thats 3000 Credits alone from playing + winning a match). Each merc is a counter and is counterable. If you want to get mercs fast, dont waste money on cases and cards. Cards are not the deciding factor in a match. Its player skill. I can do better with a stock card on a merc im good at than i can with a gold card on one im bad at.\nMy friend was telling me he was concerned that this game is still in beta even though its been about a year and i cant imagine why. If this game said it wasnt in beta i would believe it. Im not 100% sure so dont quote me but i think the only reason this game is in beta is because some on the unlockable mercs were under or over powered and were removed to rebalance. 3 mercs have yet to be added, Turtle, Aimee, and javelin.\nplus its free so may aswell try it. Also dont buy proxy or vassile as your first merc people will HATE you.\n","March 27","true","153.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

So is it bad?\n\nIn the most part, the gameplay is pretty solid, consisting of objective based gameplay which task players of one team to defend objectives whereas the later to attack and deliver objectives like narcotics etc. Players have a selection 12 different mercs to choose from which is reminiscence to the class system of team fortress, although you will only get access to 3 at the start. The rest are locked and can be bought for real cash or 30000 to 50000 ingame credits depending on the character. Some of them are unlocked temporarily from time to time. Most of the class for the most part are pretty unique with the exception which feel redundant in my opinion but the choices of unlocking which is given to the player which is pretty welcome.\n\nMost of the maps are pretty decent for the most part and the objectives are placed pretty well and encourage teamwork unlike games like Call of Duty which the gameplay is mostly about gaining kills and unlocking kill streaks which is too competitve in my opinion. Dirty bomb succeeds in this case as a significant increase in points is earned by aiding others or doing the objectives which will result in higher XP being earned at the end of the game. This means that one can gain tons of XP by solely assisting others, giving ammo, healing others and from objectives. Movement and shooting are also pretty solid which is much to expected considering Dirty bombs runs with the unreal engine 4. However the objectives can feel meaningless as there are no story or reason for doing so.\n\nHowever dirty bomb does have its dirty flaws as well. You can't have your own loadout in Dirty bomb, instead loadouts are given in cards which the player wil have no choice in editing. New cards are earned through cases which are reminiscence CS:GO's, but this is one of the games flaws and a sign of corporate being greedy. Drop rates for silver and higher cases are ludicrously low and the game tends to taunt you by having the marker to miss cards with high rarity. What's more the loadouts can't be changed and that the cards that you get are assigned for a character which you might not have.  This results in many useless loadouts being drawn unless of course you buy the god forsaken elite cases which has drop rates of silver and above, cobalt being the best. But to the game's credit, guns aren't too OP like in games like blackshot, so you probably will still get a solid amount of kills with them and that the normal cases can be occasionally obtained for free or for 1000 ingame credits.\n\nOthers probs that i have seen, are also a significant degree of pop in even though the game has taken a watercolor like art style which is supposed to counteract this and that there is a persistent sound glitch that appears in the game from time to time which distorts the sound and why is it not possible to make a private room?! This means that if you want to have a match with your group of friends you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ screwed, gotta wait for a friend too long, TOO BAD. Strangers can pop in whenever they like and if there is a troll, i am sorry, god bless you.\n\nI also encountered a glitch that distorted the model of my teammates like in super smas bros if you swap the character movesets. the objectives can feel meaningless as there are no story or reason for doing so.\n\nUltimately, solid game, its worth a try considering its free. But is it that good? In my opinion its around a 6.5/10. i recommend it for people who want to get into FPS as many of the skills learned here help transition to other fps games and to people who love games with teamwork and are short of budget.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope the review is helpful.

After all, they paid to develop the game, and they need money to keep it alive. And we're talking about Nexon, you're lucky that you can actually be on par with enemy players without paying anything. I'd say you only need to pay for COSMETICS, but if you really want those cosmetics, you can really get them without paying. All weapons are similar and it's all up to preference, and as for the perks, they're just sidekicks, you don't really need them, but they will (sometimes) help you. I currently have 1 Special Edition card (lucky me, RNG), 3 Silvers (traded up from 4 bronze cards each) and currently no Bronze card because I've traded them all up. I also have a BUNCH of Iron and Lead cards, because every 2~4 games you're guaranteed to drop a case for free, rather than wasting 2~3 games worth of currency, which in my opinion, is not a lot.\nAs for the game, there's not much I can say. I have played in this game's closed beta, and I can only say it has been improving more and more with each update. The gameplay mechanics are fun. The recoil, though very reduced and easily controllable, feels fluid and well conceived.\nNow here's what I love: The movement. To me, movement has always been very important in FPS games. From trickjumping back in old Arena shooters like Quake and Unreal Tournament, to bunnyhopping in Half-Life and Counter-Strike, I've always done what I can to learn how to use the movement to my advantage. Ever since I learned this game had a long-jump function, I've been studying the maps as I play to make use of this along with the wall-jumps (and the Springy perk) to get around faster than ever, and to avoid all kinds of enemy attacks. The game is fun and addicting, and though there are still very few maps, they are large enough, and have more than one objective each, which avoids boredom.","November 12, 2015","true","204.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

What on earth are the reviewers talking about?\n\nDirty Bomb is a solid F2P shooter (with no pay-to-win features) that, although in beta, shows much promise when it comes out as a game. Most of the complaints I see have to do with balancing, anti-hack, and the browser history EULA.\n\nAs for balancing, the game is relatively balanced. Of course, with the release of a new the character Phantom everyone (rightfully) got uptight, but he recieved a nerf only weeks after his release. This game is still in beta, and with the current near-optimal balance, there is no reason to down-vote this game based primarily off of that. Any strat can be countered with another, and all it takes it good teamwork.\n\nRegarding hackers, I have played this game for 20+ hours, and I have only come across one aimbotting sniper in that period of time. Perhaps I haven't played long enough, but I have failed to see hackers throughout my gaming time here. I have no issues with this and cannot say that the anti-hack system is not working.\n\nNow, as for the EULA, that's a matter I am actually upset with. Like other reviewers said, it is infringing on you and isn't really effective. I guess it stops you from searching "Dirty Bomb hacks", but that is pretty damn stupid because I doubt it is that effective. Be aware that this is a feature that you will have to agree if you install DB.\n\nOtherwise, this game is very much enjoyable. As I said above, it has zero P2W features in it and is very fun to play, especially with good communication. Developers are constantly adding updates and hotfixes and are actually listening to player feedback. Get it if you dig a solid shooter.\n\n8/10","July 30, 2015","true","27.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

So is it bad?\n\nIn the most part, the gameplay is pretty solid, consisting of objective based gameplay which task players of one team to defend objectives whereas the later to attack and deliver objectives like narcotics etc. Players have a selection 12 different mercs to choose from which is reminiscence to the class system of team fortress, although you will only get access to 3 at the start. The rest are locked and can be bought for real cash or 30000 to 50000 ingame credits depending on the character. Some of them are unlocked temporarily from time to time. Most of the class for the most part are pretty unique with the exception which feel redundant in my opinion but the choices of unlocking which is given to the player which is pretty welcome.\n\nMost of the maps are pretty decent for the most part and the objectives are placed pretty well and encourage teamwork unlike games like Call of Duty which the gameplay is mostly about gaining kills and unlocking kill streaks which is too competitve in my opinion. Dirty bomb succeeds in this case as a significant increase in points is earned by aiding others or doing the objectives which will result in higher XP being earned at the end of the game. This means that one can gain tons of XP by solely assisting others, giving ammo, healing others and from objectives. Movement and shooting are also pretty solid which is much to expected considering Dirty bombs runs with the unreal engine 4. However the objectives can feel meaningless as there are no story or reason for doing so.\n\nHowever dirty bomb does have its dirty flaws as well. You can't have your own loadout in Dirty bomb, instead loadouts are given in cards which the player wil have no choice in editing. New cards are earned through cases which are reminiscence CS:GO's, but this is one of the games flaws and a sign of corporate being greedy. Drop rates for silver and higher cases are ludicrously low and the game tends to taunt you by having the marker to miss cards with high rarity. What's more the loadouts can't be changed and that the cards that you get are assigned for a character which you might not have.  This results in many useless loadouts being drawn unless of course you buy the god forsaken elite cases which has drop rates of silver and above, cobalt being the best. But to the game's credit, guns aren't too OP like in games like blackshot, so you probably will still get a solid amount of kills with them and that the normal cases can be occasionally obtained for free or for 1000 ingame credits.\n\nOthers probs that i have seen, are also a significant degree of pop in even though the game has taken a watercolor like art style which is supposed to counteract this and that there is a persistent sound glitch that appears in the game from time to time which distorts the sound and why is it not possible to make a private room?! This means that if you want to have a match with your group of friends you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ screwed, gotta wait for a friend too long, TOO BAD. Strangers can pop in whenever they like and if there is a troll, i am sorry, god bless you.\n\nI also encountered a glitch that distorted the model of my teammates like in super smas bros if you swap the character movesets. the objectives can feel meaningless as there are no story or reason for doing so.\n\nUltimately, solid game, its worth a try considering its free. But is it that good? In my opinion its around a 6.5/10. i recommend it for people who want to get into FPS as many of the skills learned here help transition to other fps games and to people who love games with teamwork and are short of budget.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope the review is helpful.

After all, they paid to develop the game, and they need money to keep it alive. And we're talking about Nexon, you're lucky that you can actually be on par with enemy players without paying anything. I'd say you only need to pay for COSMETICS, but if you really want those cosmetics, you can really get them without paying. All weapons are similar and it's all up to preference, and as for the perks, they're just sidekicks, you don't really need them, but they will (sometimes) help you. I currently have 1 Special Edition card (lucky me, RNG), 3 Silvers (traded up from 4 bronze cards each) and currently no Bronze card because I've traded them all up. I also have a BUNCH of Iron and Lead cards, because every 2~4 games you're guaranteed to drop a case for free, rather than wasting 2~3 games worth of currency, which in my opinion, is not a lot.\nAs for the game, there's not much I can say. I have played in this game's closed beta, and I can only say it has been improving more and more with each update. The gameplay mechanics are fun. The recoil, though very reduced and easily controllable, feels fluid and well conceived.\nNow here's what I love: The movement. To me, movement has always been very important in FPS games. From trickjumping back in old Arena shooters like Quake and Unreal Tournament, to bunnyhopping in Half-Life and Counter-Strike, I've always done what I can to learn how to use the movement to my advantage. Ever since I learned this game had a long-jump function, I've been studying the maps as I play to make use of this along with the wall-jumps (and the Springy perk) to get around faster than ever, and to avoid all kinds of enemy attacks. The game is fun and addicting, and though there are still very few maps, they are large enough, and have more than one objective each, which avoids boredom.","November 12, 2015","true","204.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You can easily buy everything you need with ingame money, which are easy enough to make. All upgrades after Bronze quality are purely cosmetic.\n3) No killstreaks and only moderate reward for killing at expense of objective game\n4) Maps have progression from one objective to another, so the game is less stale as the match progresses\n\nCons:\n1) Maps have design issues with spawn locations. Some are too easy to camp. Others too easy to defend.\n2) Maps are a bit narrow for 8v8. Unless defending team is vastly inferior, it is impossible to lose in 8v8.\n3) Anti-cheat is garbage, and the amount of cheaters seems to be growing since the time I picked up the game. This is made worse by vote-out option not working well.\n4) No built-in auto-balance, often resulting in very one-sided games.\n5) Joining game that is already in progress puts you into the lobby, where you have to wait for countdown again. Too much waiting all around.\n6) Server usually empties out after the match is over, resulting in unstable matches and poor community. Various reasons. Some people leave to open their loot, some leave due to lack of auto-balance, some just don't want to wait for match to start and rather find another server.\n\n----\n\nI am willing to write off the cons for the beta for now, but devs seem to be rather focused on pumping out new classes (i.e. new content) rather than fixing issues with the game.","August 9, 2015","true","538.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The gameplay is fun and fast paced. A great 'arcade' style shooter. There is definitely many hours of fun to be had especially if you are a fan of games like TF2 or UT. Also if you like to jump alot.... there is A LOT of jumping like a bunny on beans in this game.\n\nGood things:\n\nDiverse gameplay. With the plethora of mercs available anyone can find something to suit their gamplay. From full on support to heavy armors, grenadeers and even ranged revivals this game has got something for every palate.\n\nActive servers. Its very easy to find a game and they have limited servers (ie max lvl 5) for new players to not get owned straight away\n\nGreat fun and encourages team play.\n\nGraphics are very good and also the voice acting/character designs are great!\n\nThe bad things (and there are a few but its Beta and they're still developing):\n\nHackers! Yes this game is riddled with them. Due to Nexon's atrociously bad AC system not only do hackers get through but none hacking players will also get booted quite frequently. There is no report system and the hackers don't even get banned, not even for 'x time' so they just jump striaght into the game again.\n\nGrind! Yes you do start with a few mercs and yes they are very good to put free rotations of mercs in but unless you are willing to shell out a fair few pennies then it will be a grind for igc as most mercs tend to cost 30-50K\n\nBasekilling/spawnr*pe! So you're on the losing team... ok. You're being overwhelmed by the enemy... fair enough. They can actually come and stand in your spawn area and obliterate you before you can even take 1 step - yea not so fun. I know its all down to the player and I for one, hang back at the objective zone to actually let them play. I honestly hate spawncampers from both perspectives as it just ruins the fun of the game.... on to...\n\nCommunity! As with most FPS titles you'll find A LOT of abuse being spewed forth. There is every 'ist' uner the sun here, sexist, racist etc and you will definitely have to put the blinkers on if you don't like profanity! Also there are lot of 'solo' players and this is definitely a team game. If you are a medic, res! If you are support spam ammo! It just doesn't get done.\n\nInput lag or just server lag in general! Sometimes you just can't lay that mine or you'll go round a crner only to find yourself either dead a second later or back where you started.\n\n\nThose are just the main things that spring to mind but for a free to play game its great and worth a download if you even remotely find this sorta thing fun.\n","August 20, 2015","true","117.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is a evolution of that with elements that force you to play as a team.\n\nI know its beta, but based on what I have played the game is seriously unbalanced.\n\nMost  people are playing the the fast mobile classes of Merc, bouncing round with shotties or high rate firing SMGs. Makes any other class kind of pointless at the moment. You really need to balance the quick moving, bunny hopping shotgun classes as they make a mockery of the game if you try to play any other class. Their health, agility and weapon mean you can empy a clip into them and they just bounce right up to you still with 50% health.\n\nGuns are mostly peashooters take way too many bullets for a kill, and as there hardly any recoil to speak of iron sight aiming is a total handicap. You can get a guy down to 10% health after 1 whole mag of an SMG, yet a boucing shotgun player will nail you super quick.\n\n\nAs most, if not all combat is close quarters there is no role for the slower Mercs.\n\nCard system is abysmal, and the selection of guns you get is tiny and you get what card gives you. Although you can swap cards (laodout), you can only do this between games in lobby, not in game.\n\nHere in lies the clue that this will totally become pay to win, better card cost more money and take forever to earn in game, plus the fact that Nexon have a history of pay to win games.\n\nFeels like a game that was going to get dropped as a pay for release, but they decided to squeeze it for some ££$$ instead.","March 29, 2015","false","25.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Not to mention the games anti-cheat is a joke. In the three hours I played i ran into at least 10 games where there were VERY obvious script kiddies running around with the sniper class shooting me and my teammates through walls and various objects with ludicrous speed. In all if this game was a full one time purchase of maybe 40 or so dollars I probably would purchase it. And then just have microtransactions for costume items or small utilities. But when a new merc costs 50k in game currency, when you only make roughly 400 a game, it's an obvious attempt to coerce players into spending cash on this game. If they open the game up a little more and enact better anti-cheat this game could be a lot better.","May 2, 2015","false","3.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

You can find the english version below the one in italian.\n\nHo provato davvero tantissimi FPS free-to-play, essendo appassionato del genere, e devo dire che questo li batte tutti. Vi spiego il perché attraverso diversi punti a favore e sfavore di questo titolo allo STATO ATTUALE:\nPRO:\n- A differenza degli altri FPS, un player colpito mortalmente non "muore" ma rimane in "agonia" e può essere aiutato da un compagno ad essere riportato in vita (velocemente o meno, dipende se usate un medico o qualcos'altro) o essere ucciso con un colpo di grazia dal nemico. Questa novità rende il gameplay molto più divertente e innovativo.\n\n-Sistema innovativo di classi e "loadout". Praticamente questo gioco non è il solito FPS in cui compri le armi e le sostituisci. Qui compri i mercenari che consistono in delle vere e proprie classi (medici, genieri, assalto) con abilita differenti e uniche. Ogni mercenario, oltre alla proprie abilita di classe, ha un sistema di carte chiamato “LOADOUT” con diverse configurazioni di armi e passive (esempio cure maggiori o danno da esplosivi aumentato).\n\n-Si possono ottenere TUTTI i "loadout" TOTALMENTE FREE-TO-PLAY ed è assolutamente EASY. Oltretutto, se si hanno dei loadout più scarsi, si possono combinare e ottenerne uno maggiore fino alla rarità massima (I migliori sono i LOADOUT BRONZO. Tuttavia, sopra quelli Bronzo ci sono quelli Argento, Oro, Cobalto e le EDIZIONI SPECIALI, che fungono SOLO DA LOADOUT ESTETICI e non hanno nulla di più forte rispetto a quelli di Bronzo. E, ripeto, si ottengono GRATUITAMENTE.\n\n-I crediti, cioè le monete del gioco, si ottengono facilmente e addirittura ogni 3 ore vi danno delle nuove missioni per ottenere altri crediti. Tuttavia, non è del tutto semplice comprare un mercenario! Si devono giocare molte partite, quindi non è un "gioco da ragazzi" come potrebbe sembrare.\n\n-Divertimento estremo nelle partite bilanciate, dove il team composto da un mix di classi differenti usa tutti i mezzi a sua disposizione per arrivare all'obiettivo comune.\n\n-Rotazione Settimanale dei mercenari (tipo Lol, Smite, ecc) molto utile per provarli.\n\n-Aggiornamenti Frequentissimi con ricompense molto stimolanti.\n\n-Assenza totale di micro-transizioni o merdate varie come oggetti ottenibili solo pagando, come in altri fps free spazzatura. TUTTO QUELLO che si trova nel gioco, si può ottenere semplicemente giocando. Anche se, ovviamente, puoi spendere i soldi per supportare questi meritevoli sviluppatori!\n\nCONTRO:\n- Assenza molto fastidiosa di un "party" dove invitare gli amici nelle partite normali (ci si può arrangiare come nei vecchi FPS joinando nello stesso server). Al momento, il party è disponibile solo in ranked.\n\n- Bilanciamento pessimo; 1 partita su 3 si insulta il signore a cause delle partite sbilanciate, con la sola possibilità di iniziare un voto per mischiare i team per abilità, che viene raramente accettato dai nemici o dai ragazzini...\n\n- Scelta di mappe molto limitata, ma quelle poche presenti sono MOLTO BEN FATTE E STRUTTURATE. Considerando che si tratti di una Beta, questa ci sta.\n\nIl gioco è DIVERTENTE e TOTALMENTE FREE. Lo straconsiglio a chiunque e, ripeto, considerando che è una Beta, tutti i CONTRO di cui ho scritto verranno presto sistemati, aggiornati e molto altro con i futuri aggiornamenti.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeing a FPS fan, i tried a lot of games of the genre and i have to say this is the best so far, and i'll tell you why through many PROS and CONS of this title at its CURRENT STATE (Which is, don't forget, a BETA BUILD).\n\nPROS:\n- Unlike others FPS games, when a player is critically hit he doesn't "die", but he falls in an "agony status" and may be helped by a teammate and resurrected (Quickly or not, depending if you're playing a medic or something else) or be killed with a final blow by the hands of the enemies. This feature makes the game funnier and more innovative.\n\n- Innovative system of classes and "loadouts". Basically, this is not the classic FPS in which you buy weapons and replace them. Here you buy mercenaries which consist in actual classes (medic, engineer, assault...) with different and unique abilities. Each mercenary, other than its own class' abilities, has a system of cards called "loadout", with different configurations of weapons and passive skills (better heals, higher explosive damage, etc...).\n\n- You can get ALL the "loadouts" in a TOTALLY FREE TO PLAY and EASY way. Moreover, if you have weaker loadouts, you can combine them to get a better one up to the highest rarity (The best ones are set to be the BRONZE LOADOUTS. However, above the bronze ones are Silver, Gold, Cobalt and Special Edition, which work ONLY AS COSMETIC LOADOUTS, and have nothing better than the Bronze ones. And, again, you can get them FOR FREE).\n\n- The credits, the in-game currency, are easily obtained and you even get missions every 3 hours which gives more credit once completed. However, it is not completely simple to buy a mercenary! You have to play many games anyway, so it's not an "easy cake" as it might sound.\n\n- Extremely funny in balanced matches, in which the team is made up of different classes and does whatever it takes to reach the common final goal.\n\n- Weekly mercenaries rotation (like in LoL, Smite, etc...), very useful to try them out.\n\n- Very frequent updates with very exciting rewards.\n\n- TOTALLY UNEXISTING micro-transactions or pay-to-get ♥♥♥♥♥ like in many other free trash FPS games. You can easily get EVERYTHING in the game by just playing. Though, of course, you can spend your money to support the worthy developers!\n\nCONS:\n- Very annoying absence of a "party system" to invite friends in normal games (you can manage to join the same server like in the old FPS games). At its current state, you can create a party only in ranked games.\n\n- Bad balancing system; 1 game out of 3 you curse your god because of the unbalanced games with the only chance to start a team shuffle vote per skill, which is rarely accepted by the enemies or kids or so...\n\n- Limited map choice, but the few ones available are VERY WELL DESIGNED. Considering that we're talking about a BETA BUILD, this is fair enough.\n\nThe game is LOTS OF FUN and ABSOLUTELY FREE TO PLAY in all its features. I totally suggest the game to everyone and, again, considering this is a BETA BUILD, all of the CONS i've written about will soon be fixed, updated and much more with the upcoming patches!","May 30","true","131.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

One of the best competitive/hardcore FPS's out there...and its FREE. If you enjoy fast paced shooters, that rely on teamwork to complete multiple objectives across huge maps and have a ton of depth, you need to try it.\n\n\nPro's:\n-solid and rewarding shooting mechanics; speed of combat is somewhere between Quake and CS Go and the time to kill is much higher then in most games witch is good because that means you can react\n-easy to get into, hard to master (aim for the head, fire in short bursts, always keep moving, DON'T zoom in while shooting...it sounds simple but you will be surprised)\n-the game is based on teamwork and cooperation. The game rewards that and thus it feels satisfying to play your class well\n-every class is capable of putting up a fight while still doing it's job(heal, disarm etc) and I feel like anyone can find a character they love even within a class they may not be too fond of (for example you have a medic like Aura that holds positions very well, or someone like Phoenix that fights and heals on the front line while moving)\n-good amount of weapons/perks/classes to play around with\n-has a LOT of hidden depth (just watch some wall jumping videos to see what I mean)\n-NO Pay2Win whatsoever, business model is decent...combination between Hearthstone and League. You can unlock ANYTHING with in-game currency or try your luck with card packs (just don't overdo it)\n-maps are expertly designed, don't be fooled...even if the number is small, this is because the maps are huge and they all have multiple objective stages, so basically you have 3 maps in 1\n-dev's balance everything in the game regularly and so far I have never seen a balance patch that did something wrong, I believe the game is heading in a good direction\n\nNote:\n-after playing Overwatch I feel like this game, because of the maps and mechanics is a better shooter while OW is a better action game and is much more accessible because a lot of characters don’t rely purely on their guns. I do feel however that because of it’s simplicity, DB is easier to balance, while OW has much more flashy abilities and combos, similar to mobas, that you can pull off and kill entire teams, which feels bad when it happens to you. In DB you rarely get 1 shot randomly because someone just spamm fires a corner with infinite ammo, or just enter a killing field because some OP ability was activated right as you walk by, so it feels less frustrating to play, even solo, but it doesn’t matter what class you play, in DB you need to be good at shooting to be effective.\n\nCon's:\n-the prices are too steep IMO, both real money and in-game currency, still, it's a free game.\n-there is no party matchmaking outside of ranked play\n-the characters usually only have 1 ability unique to them and while they do help you and the team out, they are pretty dull and unimpressive (or you could say, realistic)\n\n\nMy suggestion is: if you want to spend money on something, get a starter pack or just buy the character you know you will enjoy (try them out on free rotations). Cases are basically card packs from hearthstone, you might get a card for a class/character you will never play/own, don't waste money on them, just wait until you have a lot of characters and you want more loadouts or skins (always fun to invite friends over and take turns opening card packs, but don't expect to get anything useful)\n\nOverall: highly recommended.\n","May 28","true","156.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The best loadouts you can get in the game are already available in bronze loadouts. Everything above bronze is all about skins and extra bling bling.\nSilver, gold or cobalt loadout aren't better than bronze loadout. And what's the best part? You are able to buy bronze loadout for every merc with 17,5 K credits! Even freeloaders can do well in the game!\nOf course you have a chance to purchase with real money some expert and elite cases and get a bit higher chance to get some bling bling, but like I said earlier: it's only about skins, nothing else. Also nothing guarantees that you can get exactly the loadout you are looking for. Even if you purchase 35 elite cases, you still have a chance to get huge pile useless loadouts. It's all about luck.\nAlso I should not forget to mention that normal cases drops now and then, if you just keep playing the game.\nFrom normal case you are also able to get high rariry loadouts, if you are lucky enough.\nThough you can also use your credits for trading up loadouts and you can reach even cobalt loadouts by trading up and you can get higher rarity loadouts by that way.\n\nThe game has variation between classes and mercenaries:\nLearn what are strongest parts of different mercs and what are weaknesses.\nLearn how to use abilities and find the most suitable mercs and weapons that supports your very own playingstyle.\nPlayers are all different and so are mercenaries as well. Find your favorites and go to put the show on the road!\nAnd what comes about cheaters, every game have them. I've seen huge decrease of cheaters in public matches and competitive matches, when the new anti-cheat got released. Even when having less cheaters is a good thing, it's good to remember that new anti-cheat is not a silverbullet. The game without cheaters is only a dream and does not exist.\nThough it's a fact that less cheaters is always better. It's the amount that matters after all.\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone who like fast-paced shooter games. ;)","October 1, 2015","true","409.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Its free to play, shut up and download it.\n\nFULL BETA REVIEW (Its really not that long)\nWhere should I start? This is one of the best shooters I have played since my first experience with Call of Duty when I was a kid.  It has jokes that remind you have TF2, play style that reminds of you CS:GO, and classes that remind you of Battlefield, and MOBA style of character rotation.  But the best thing about this free to play shooter…. Aim down sight.\nWith spending a decent amount of time playing CS:GO, I was not a fan of no ADS (Aim Down Sight)\nI see why people like it, and I could even see how it makes things a tad more competitive, but its just not realistic… I mean come on, you don’t see that much hip fire all the time.  Dirty Bomb’s ADS is great, and the speed in which your characters are able to move around makes ADS rather challenge and up close, almost impossible.\n\nFor this one, we’ll do a simple pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Character Rotation Gives a great experience every week\n- Case Rewards are much more frequent in game than others, and do not require cash shop keys to open\n- Great server filtering system, with rooms that are locked to up to level 5 for the new players.\n- Aim Down Sight, talked about this already but that’s how much I love.\n- Very Unique characters providing different “abilities” giving you a wide variety of play.\n- You’re able to bring 3 characters into a fight so you’re not locked to the same person the entirety of a match.\n\nCons:\n- Game will often crash if you are unable to connect to a server\n- The cases that you’re able to buy can provide a significant benefit during a match giving you superior guns, the game does a decent job combatting this giving you the ability to “Trade Up” your load our cards to higher tier load outs, and the in game earned cases have slight chances of landing a high tier load out, this does take a lot longer and for someone starting out, you may get smacked around by someone with superior weapons, but all in all it’s a shooter, guns are guns and headshots still shred.\n- In order to equip new load outs, you have to back out of your lobby and go back to the main menu.\n- Some maps are completely one sided and makes it almost impossible for either defending or the attacking team to complete the object.\n- There are some gun balancing issues.\n\nPlease understand that this is still in Beta and the game will continue to develop.  The developers seem to be very active in checking Reddit and Twitter and overall listening to the community so I am very excited to see everything they have in store for this game.  I gave it an easy 8/10 for a beta, and is right now my favorite shooter for PC, the game is free to play so you have no reason to not give it a shot!\n\nIf you liked this review and would like to see the other games I have already covered or would like to stay updated on future, you can visit my website at www.thatsaverage.com or my blog at www.thatsaverage.tumblr.com\n","June 17, 2015","true","8.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It's free, it's objective based, and it's not pay 2 win. However due to a recent update that introduced an op character, I do not find this game fun anymore. You can either buy the character or grind heavily to get him. All the characters in the game are balanced, for example you could have a fast character but she will only be able to carry a shotgun and place mines every few seonds or you could have a slow character with an assualt rifle that can call airstrikes, but they can only be used every few minutes. This character named the "Phantom" has no balance at all. He carries a Katana that downs you in 1 hit (in most cases) and he carries a submachine gun that is very powerful. He also has the ability to become invisible, and although you can still sort of see him, it doesn't matter because he will charge at you at knock you down rendering you helpless. I was in a match where there was two of them on the enemy team, and it took 3 or more team mates to be able to take down one (by the way teams are composed of 8 or less players) while the other 2 were dead. Needless to say noone in our team could get out of or even be able to spawn in our spawn base because the enemy team could just enter very easily and camp.

You get theses from Loadout Caches, which can be awarded after a game or bought from the In-Game Store.\n\nNow, this seems to be everything a F2P Model has. Unlockable Heroes and buyable Equipment - but here is the thing the thing that actually deals with your combat strength - the Loadout cards - can only be bought with Credits the in-Game Currency. Since I have not yet seen a Real Money -> Credits option (yet) You can not buy yourself better equip (but it also lacks any variety in packs, as in stronger packs containing only a certain rarity and up). But then again, Early Acces. A lot is subject to change.\n\nFor now the game is fast paced fun on big maps that rquire every players skills to complete.\n\nTo finish, I will now Quote the tutorial:\n"Complete Objectives\nWork as a Team\nDont be a Di*k" (which is something A LOT of other PvP games should teach.","April 29, 2015","true","10.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/333930/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","Remember Brink, that game that everyone though it would be amazing, and then was such a majestic piece of sh#t on release, nearly unplayable and extremely lazy? Turns out the devs didn't kill themselves out of shame, and instead came out with this neat game as apology.\n\nSo, what IS Dirty Bomb? Weird, that's what it is. As usual, I'll start explaining the BAD stuff of the game, and then move onto the good stuff, and the stuff that could improve.\n\nOne of the biggest problems that this game seems to have, is it's lack of identity. It seems that the devs were not sure where to make this game a "Moba-shooter" or a "Team-based shooter", so they mixed things up. Kind of badly. Let me explain: In games such as Team Fortress 2, you need to switch from class to class depending of the situation. Can you do that here? Kinda. You can only change into one of your three pre-selected classes. And how many classes are there? Arround 15 or so. What's the deal? And that's not even the worst: Only 2-3 are free, you HAVE TO BUY the rest, either with real money, or ingame currency, which ain't as easy as it seems to get. Three of them are constantly being given for free for a fixed amount of time, like it's done in Mobas, but it's still a bad choice: You CAN'T have a Team-based game were the classes are behind pay-walls.\n\nAnother insanely big issue with the game, is the spawn-camping. And this one is quite pathetic, IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT ARE DONE IN TEAM-BASED MAPS LIKE THIS! And I can tell you, I made A LOT of community maps for Unreal Tournament 2004, Spawn-camping can be a pain. Here, the devs did not even try: You usually spawn right on the open, and the enemy can most of the time, camp there all day long. And kill you. And wait. And kill you. And wait. And kill you again, and again.\n\nThe third issue I have, are the loadouts. They had a neat idea: Cards that have a pre-done loadout for you, with skills and such. I really like it! What I DON'T like, is how it has been done. You can either wait for Case-drops or buy them in the store, when open they work in a similar way as the cases from Counter-Strike Global Offensive, but while there they're just cosmetic items, here they change the gameplay. You might get a different gun for a character that kind of works the same, but also skills that benefit you. The thing is, this is completely random. I think the game would benefit more from a Loadout in the style of Team Fortress 2, a game that it seems the devs of this game took some inspiration, and have the guns separated, which can be dropped, crafted or bought.\n\nThe game also tells you that "It's better to run and gun, not to aim down the sights", and that it's a "faster shooting game", stuff like that you know. And I think that's bullsh#t. It IS faster than other generic and mediocre FPS such as Call of Duty and Battlefield, but calling it a "Fast FPS" is being dishonest. If you want to play something FAST, go play Unreal Tournament or Quake. Dirty Bomb does NOT get close. At all.\n\nAnother little issue I see, is how OP some classes seem to be. Specially Kira. She has a laser that insta-kills and shoots down from the sky, which she can also control. In some maps, you have to escort a "tank" to certain points. You know how much time it takes to repair it, AND HOW FAST THAT LASER INSTA-KILLS IT?! Same with Air-strikes, they're WAY too powerful, and can be used WAY TOO MUCH. Makes other classes look like complete push-overs.\n\nThe last issue, is a smaller one, but a pain in the ♥♥♥ anyway. If you hit the "Quick Match" option, the game MIGHT drop you into games of the United States when you're in Europe, and the same thing in reverse. That's dumb. Just have a Country-Selection option for f#ck sake, I don't want to play with over 150 ping because they ignored simple details.\n\nSo, does the game actually have good stuff? Yeah. And it was quite enjoyable for a while, gotta say. The guns look good, the graphics are quite beautiful, the gameplay is fun until you get spawn-camped for half an hour, and classes work well until people start abusing them. But the thing is, the game is still on Beta. If you really like this sort of game, then I recommend it to you. If you don't, stay away until the Beta is over. You'll be thankful you did, and you'll have way more fun (if it does ever finish the Beta).\n\nOh and, one last thing... You can take screenshots, but other people can't see them. What's that all about, is the game censored? Because I only expected that from EA.","June 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","9","16","4","0"

The game was incredibly fun because of two things.\nFor one it was fast paced. I'm not a very heavy FPS guy after having played Quake. Anything else just feels like a slow game and unbearable. I'll play CoD, BF, and other shooters. I just can't stick to them because of pacing issues. Dirty Bomb makes matches go by fast because objectives are near you, and there will be lots of killing. Enough to occupy your time but not overstay their welcome.\nSecond thing it does right is the amount of varied classes. You can be a healer, an Engineer, a Tank, a Sniper, a fast shotgunner, nader, Ninja, and quite a few more. You're not stuck to the traditional "Gunner, Tank, Medic, Sniper" classes you're used to in modern shooters.\n\nNow with the integration of Steam there are real people to play with. The people I invited to the closed beta from a few months ago wouldn't touch the game because they didn't want another launcher. Now they've got no excuse, and it's good to see so many people playing now.\n\nIf I were to rate my favorite FPS games, Dirty Bomb would sit comfortably high up on my list with Quake. Both great games I enjoy to play and will continue to play as long as there's a community willing to play.","January 7, 2015","true","2.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","7"

Competitive shooter, no! (They want it to be viewed on competitve scale)\n\n-Maps are too small in relation to respawn timer.

The pick up time is so extreme, its a pointless feature.\n\n-Game promotes and encourages you to stack up by design but is countered by a single player with explosives focus or by all means run all medics.\n\n-At its core all guns share very similar dps, and are shared by classes. Pick your HP/SPEED/UTILITY.\n\n\nPersonal grievances:\n\n-When revived by medic (instant get up) the revive-e is Invulnerable to any form of damage for a good 1-2 seconds\n\n-If a team is significantly better, your forced to let them pummel you for the full 15 mins. no /surrender\n\n-I see the same people time after time\n\nIn closing, the diversity in characters is negligible in relation to thier impact of the game aside from medic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlipYa4Real/recommended/333930/","FlipYa4Real","Doc Holliday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlipYa4Real/","115 products in account","Alright I am rewriting this review after a little under 100 hours of playtime.  The gunplay is still very solid with each weapon feeling a little different.  I still highly recommend this game as a W:ET veteran.  Where it goes from here as far as monetization goes will always be a topic of contention but as of right now there is no direct pay to win.\n\nEveryone has the same basic weapons which are dictated by loadouts that you buy with credits you earn in game and are bound to your characters in the form of cards.  There are tiers listed as Lead through Gold with any tier above Bronze serving only to adjust weapon skins.  Bronze cards house the maximum of 3 perks on the card.  Credits are only earned in game or (as of only now) you can buy into the closed beta which I can see being a bit of a joke, but it's worth it for 35000 in game credits and all of the available mercs.  Even if the game flops I already have had plenty of hours of enjoyment and I still find it very enjoyable even with it's future unknown.\n\nThis game is Objective based a lot like Team Fortress 2 and like the game's developer Splash Damage's previous games (W:ET, Quake Wars, *cough* Brink *cough*).  The nice thing about this is it naturally aspires to be a little bit competitive as the entire match is about working together to accomplish some task as the enemy team tries to prevent you.  There's plenty of holds and breaks and during many even matches it can come down tot a single flanking Proxy laying strategic mines and assassinating an Aura and/or a Fragger preventing any hope at the objective.  There is room for Heroes and K/D chasers, although without the former the latter loses much of it's glory and this is where the classes can synergize well.\n\nThat being sad - the classes as of now are not very well balanced.  There is a merc named Fragger that is extremely difficult to tussle with, regardless of your class.  Pretty much 10/10 times if you come up against him and he's at full health you're a goner.  He can kill you before you pull your special or have a chance to run.  In reality his only nemesis is Vassili who is another very OP character.  This is talking pure damage output.  If you throw in the factor there is a merc named Aura who is also 'OP' you may be thinking 'Hey - sounding more balanced all the time...?' but this is not the case.  Only one of these mercs can counter the other.  That's Fragger.  The other two in a standard midrange heads up shootout die to Fragger again.\n\nIn any case, the previous paragraph is something you only come to understand after many hours in the game.  At this point you WILL bein love with the game if you were a fan of SD's prevoius attempts at the genre.  Personally I was a W:ET buff to the extreme.  I adored the game.\n\nGood Hitboxes/solid multiplayer\nNice weapon 'feel'\nFuturistic Design\n\n\n-No ability to mod\n-Few maps\n\n-/+ Card system","March 29, 2015","true","96.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics aren't triple-A but they still look great and it runs really well, and I think the clean TF2-esque graphics help add to the experience. The display doesn't look cluttered, the voice acting is good quality and the online experience is fun without hitches. I'm still getting used to it, but you're not bombarded with different load-out settings or unlockable items - the interface makes it simple to understand what is going on. The sufficient variety different "classes" of online characters makes it easy to have at least some form of balanced teamwork (where at least one player can perform certain roles on a team) without having to pick from a million different powers and abilities like some games do (cough cough Battlefield).\nIn short, if you like playing Titanfall style multiplayer games and don't mind a bit less serious gameplay then you'll enjoy this game.","July 25, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simple shooter with a moba like hero system\n\nWhen it first came out it was amazing, but right now (forgivably though, since it is being tuned over time) its a mess of spawn killing, one sided maps, air strike spam and more of a fight of which team has the more of the OP classes more than any significant level of skill (which classes are OP depends on how its tuned that day. Previously it was the Phantom, but they fixed him a little too hard). Not to mention they altered the way the servers handle hit rego and such since then (intentionally or not) so it has a tendency to not register some blatant hits in the same way youd find in CSGO and the like.\nHowever most of the issues that are derived from the community only really pop up once you go past level 5 and have to go into the uncontrolled rank matches (for some reason the devs thought having <5 servers and >10 server but nothing between was a good idea)\n\nIt aint terrible, by any means, and its free. So give it a try, i recommend it all the same. But come in with an open mind or youll be turned away pretty quick by the flaws it does have.","July 25, 2015","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enemy forces have forced us back to the soulless town, whilst we had the initial order to progress forward. All seems wrecked, but I'm not willing to let 'em conquer any further. Their days will end today. They will end now at our defense. We are strong, we WILL keep stand and will protect our wealth. Remember: We are here to get some s##tload of money. And now go and defend it!\n\nTeams on public seem to be unbalanced, so we didn't even know what hit us even if three of us were on duty together. Matchmaking in the wild seems to be the biggest issue so far, life itself is wonderful.\n\nRushing with Proxy can give you a kick or break your neck, whilst Bushwrecker is his own man crew. Fragger will always seem to win with his grens, but it is more complicated than you think it is. Vassili takes it up from far away, but he's getting cloned all too fast. Sawbonez is ready to battle it in with his devib, while Aura remains calm defending her healing station. So many of us died here - yet there seems to be an endless wave rushing the enemy.\n\nAfter all, you just have too keep an eye on the uhb-jek-tiv, and don't be a d##k. That's all what's needed. But don't forget about these - you don't need K/D ratio, you should not camp if not ordered so by mission control - after all, it's the team that wins, and not you. You simply shall not do it the same way you did before - else we will loose everything. Understood, soldier?\n\nAnd now get your f###ing a## to the objectiv and bring it to the EV!\n</end of review>","April 27, 2015","true","636.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personally do not see this as a pay to win, but a pay to skip.. However taking that route to me would make the game incredibly boring.

My only real complaint so far with the game is you better make damn sure the first merc you buy is the one you want, the grind to buy mercs for free is absurd with the missions (primary source of credits) only resetting once every 3 hours and giving around 1k credits total when most mercs are around 50,000 credits each.\n\nThe loadout system adds more grind, you get loadout cards from cases that you can buy for 1k credits each or obtain at end of mission drops (and they are quite generous with the drop rates right now). However the issue is you get a random loadout card so it's highly likely you will get a ton of cards for mercs you don't even have unlocked and none for the ones you want. You can trade a specific amount of unused loadout cards to get one for a specific merc but again the one you get is completely random. You can buy loadout cards for like 15k credits if you want. Then we move onto elite cases which you can buy for real money which only give silver and up loadout cards, while lead and iron loadouts are completely viable it's highly likely someone with a silver one will have an advantage just because he has more perks. It's not pay to win in the slightest but it's worth a mention. Balance in Dirty Bomb is so so, some mercs are clearly better then others for specific roles and the overall team balance seems to be zero so most games end in a complete stomp for one side.\n\nOverall would I recommend Dirty Bomb? Right now yes, it's fun enough. However it's worth a mention that Nexon of all companies is involved with this one. It's highly possible in the future they will introduce pay to win mechanics like they always do, play the game NOW if you want to play it as the Nexon involvement seems to be zero at this point so when they decide to get involved you will have had your fill and can move on.","June 19, 2015","true","75.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Takes from Brink in a positive way, feels really rewarding, really solid, always no issues.\n-Close to refined, nearly no bugs. There are a few minor graphic bugs but there are really none game breaking.\n-Game modes are pretty well designed, a lot of fun to play on.\n-Maps are well built.\n-Nearly all the characters are balanced. Some more situational than others, some stronger, but nothing will win you or lose you the game if one character is present or absent while their role is filled. (No character x as medic but character y is a medic? No problem.)\n-Good loadout sytem. It was done with the idea of balancing in mind. All cards above bronze are purely cosmetic and bronze cards are not hard to get.\n-Getting characters is not difficult. Compared to League of Legends, you can get the more expensive characters faster than the 6300 IP champs.\n-Not pay to win.\n-Offers rewards from time to time after missions are a nice touch.\n\nWhere it can improve;\n\n-More maps, more variety, more gamemodes. I know designing maps for this game is difficult due to balance issues, but 5 maps is still a few number. 6 including dome, a prototype map. There are 3 game modes, which can get dull when you sink 25 hours into this game.\n-Better UI. Some things can change for the better when equiping loadouts.\n-Party search, finding a game with friends is a hassle, youll almost awlays have one friend on the opposing side.\n-More servers. While the servers are fine, dedicated servers, there is a lack for them. Most are inaccessible to higher level players as there are multiple level 5 or under servers.\n\n\nAlso, phantom needs to be reworked or removed. He is the MOST CRUTCH character in game. You cannot justify a 120/410 character with a 100 melee damage strike and damage reduction/invisibility. You cannot justify it takes skill, you cannot justify it is difficult, you cannot it is difficult to play, you cannot justify he contributes to the team like all the other classes save Vassilli.","July 8, 2015","true","226.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

In 23 hours of gameplay I only have come across about 2 hackers in pub matches but have not played competitive yet. Gameplay is fast paced and the objectives are good, there are many situations that you really need to think and work as a team in order to complete the task at hand unless the opposing team is completely useless.\n\nThe merchs, classes and abilities are interesting and the maps work fairly well for the most part however there is not enough of them. Hoping that more maps will be released soon because the current maps are already starting to get a little boring.\n\nThere are still lots of new players in the game that do not understand how to use various mercs abilities which can be a little frustrating at times and there is generally little communication which is a cornerstone to team based games. Like most team games you will get players on your team that all they care about is sniping and they don't even assist with the objective, hunting players that are having no impact on the objective and not protecting teammates that are working on objectives. I do not understand why people like this play these team based objective games.\n\nIt would be good if there was some updates to loadout card management, being able to 'star' or select favorites that you use most often so that no mistakes are made when trading up cards. I don't think you can even check a cards abilities when in the trading screen. Another bonus would be if we can bind vsay commands to buttons so we do not need to use the menu system to issue commands.\n\nOverall I am looking forward to future updates and hope that they resolve some of the issues that are currently plaguing the game and I also really hope they release some more content soon because I am concerned that the community will lose interest in this game if there is no action.\n\n","August 18, 2015","true","406.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dirty Bomb also has a very active and friendly community and there are lots of giveaways from the dev team with constant streams (Miss Murder xD).  There are also rarely any hackers around on servers nowadays. The only issue i have found so far is matchmaking and the fact that levelling doesn't reward you that much however that should not ruin the gaming experience.

No need to spend money (I didn't spend a single cent), the benefits of higher level cards are next to none and can all be bought relatively easy with in-game earned credits. You don't get that much "base" credits, but you do get a good amount for doing the quests/missions. If you just play three matches of dirty bomb in a day, you can easily get 2k+ credits by doing one of each objective/stopwatch/execution mode game since you get 500 credits for each. And that's not including the daily mission (which you can get every 2 hours or so). You don't really need any loadout past Bronze. Those are pure cosmetic only, they offers NO damage or ability boost whatsoever.\n\nI wouldn't really call this game pay to win though. Sure, in the early levels people with shopped mercs and loadout have a slight advantage over you, but by the time you hit lvl 10 you already have all the points you need for hiring your deadly squad of mercs and for buying one/two loadout cards each. From this point onward everyone is the same. The only difference is the individual skill.  I can understand why people have given this negative reviews, as your average COD or Battlefield player couldn't have the pace and skills required to play this game.\n\nAll in all, Dirty Bomb is like if you took Call of Duty objective mode, mixed it 50/50 with arena shooters, threw in a Mirror's Edge-esque movement system, added strangely MOBA-esque roles and abilities and spiced it with a bit of personality, which results in a very fun and fresh tactical team shooter.","November 20, 2015","true","570.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is definitely fun, and the merc system is a really cool idea and I like the way the rotations are, giving people a chance to try out the mercs before they decide what ones they wanted to play. The graphics are great, and there really isn't a: "Pay2Win." The only things cash can grab you is loadout cases and mercs, which only affect your playstyle and looks. Now looking at this game in the future of competitive FPS games, I would have to say this would not be a good candidate currently. Don't get me wrong, by no means is this a bad game, I love it, but people don't work together well enough, and the matchmaking system as it is currently is not the best. Overall, it's a great game and I like the direction it's going.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/isaacthegrape/recommended/333930/","isaacthegrape","A Big Red Ball","http://steamcommunity.com/id/isaacthegrape/","31 products in account","So, let's address a couple things about Dirty Bomb.\n\nThis game seems to cop a lot of flak, most of which I believe is unsubstanciated.\n\nFirst things first.\n\nGRAPHICS AND ♥♥♥♥\n\nThey're pretty good.\n\nPAY-TO-WIN AND ♥♥♥♥\n\nLoadout cases are dropped completely randomly. They have 3 base rankings, Lead, Iron, and Bronze. Lead has one extra perk over the defult loadout, Iron has two, Bronze has three. There are also other cosmetic rankings that all have three perks, but these are functionally no differant then Bronze cards Do they make much of a differance? Not really. At the most you will get a 30% stat boost from each perk. None of them I've seen so far actually augment your ability to deal damage, rather they mostly focus on cutting skill cooldowns, your movement, reload times, etc.\n\nDispite the loadout cards are that are dropped by each case being totally random, it is not all that hard to get Bronze and Iron cards after a few hours of play. I have only about 40 hours and have about 6 irons and 4 bronze so far. While this does mean that you will find yourself playing other classes more than others, there is really no great decider in this game then skill. Firefights are over very quickly in this game.\n\nIf you want to spend the money, which is pricey by the way (about $10 USD for a single card!), you can. But I honestly have little trouble gunning down players who bought a gold Fletcher or Proxy for example with a stock Aura. Also if you play for about an hour a day, do at least three missions (500-1000 each, min 1.5K a day), and win at least one match of each three game modes (500 daily play, 500 each daily win, min 2K a day) it's easy to make about 5K credits a day. Play five times a week and you have enough to buy one of those mercs you've been playing with on rotation for the last fortnight.\n\nSpeaking of combat...\n\nTEH GUNZ\n\nSeriously, stop whining that the guns are unbalaced guys. THEY'RE ALL PRETTY INTERCHANGABLE IF YOU ASK ME. AIM FOR THE FARCKING HEAD KENT. You will do bugger all damange shooting someone in the chest, even with Rhino's minigun special. This is is not CoD or CS. Think more Enermy Territory.\n\nTHE COMMUNITY\nDunno how it is elsewhere but the Australian servers are fine. There has been a huge influx of new players recently but otherwise everyone seems to get along fine. The voting system is annoying as to pass anything, from a kick to a map restart to shuffling, you have to get like a 75% majority vote. Not impossible, not at all, but some people claim that 'votes never pass, voting is broken'. These people are all coming down from meth, don't listen to them.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nTEH L33T H4X0RZ\n\nSeriously, AIM FOR THE BLASTED FAURK'N HEAD AND YOU'LL GET A KILL MATE.\n\nI have seen one dude who may have been speed hacking in about 100 odd matches of this game. And he got kicked fast. Also, many of the lighter classes can get a perk which gives then a 30% faster sprint. I think they are the only classes that can get it and it does seem to make a massive differance as they can absoultly scoot around the map and knife you. This said, they're not that hard to counter, but god help you if you have more than 100 ping upagainst these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\n\nTHE LEGITIMATE CRITICISMS\n\nThere are plenty of random CTDs or disconnections.\n\nServers suffer regular ping spikes.\n\nSupport is somewhat non-exsistant and seems to be focused on issues other than induvidual player concerns\n\nYeah, there is only 8 maps in total at the moment.\n\nYeah, many players are dumb and you will see medics that don't heal, engineers that forget they can defuse/plant bombs, and heavies that are scared of bullets.\n\nStopwatch can be over brutally quick, but that's kind of why it's fun.\n\nLastly though, and this is rather important. RANKED MATCHMAKING IS BROKEN ON THE AU AND ASIA SERVERS. As in, does not work at all unless you live in North America or Europe. You can easily wait for 30 minutes on the AU or ASIA servers and not find a ranked match of any level, at all.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nGo play it, ignore the people raining on this parade. They simply aren't used to games where ironsights are usually a bad idea, and hipfire is 85% as accurate, and only 3 classes have grenades, and you can't go prone.\n\nIt's silly, it's fun, it's colourful, it's nice and fast, and at the very least it'll be a nice warm up for Overwatch and Battleborn when they launch and hopefully don't completely crush this game, cause I like it.","January 15","true","144.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Certainly 2 years I remember playing it way back on the nexon launcher with every merc available. Since that time I struggle to think of anything new that has been put in, Dome hasn't even been textured yet! Yes, there's execution but honestly that is the least popular mode in the game and I don't think that requires years of work.\n\nWe don't have all the mercs out yet (basically for cash grabbing reasons) and the mercs that do come out are buggy or poorly thought out. Sparks revivr bugged out on revives, rendered team mates invisible upon revive and still does too much damage to the EV/destructable side objectives. Phantom now on paper is just ridiculous, don't rly think he is too OP for 5v5 as he doesn't offer much in terms of gaining ground and securing objectives, in pubs however he is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. The concept of a cloak acting as a shield is completely counter-intuitive, if you get spotted and are getting shot at the cloak is no longer serving a purpose, they know you're there. Instead of being punished for your lack of stealth you are rewarded with 75 free health.\n\nWhy don't we have demos yet? Why don't we have our own private servers yet? Why doesn't ranked work yet? (ranked frequently puts you in a mis-matched lobby e.g. 4v6.) Why are merc re-releases taking so long? and when they are released they aren't in a very good state whatsoever.\nOther than giving us blue reskins with cobalt tier loadout cards I'm not sure what is even happening at the SD offices each day.\n\nTLDR: Looking forward to Overwatch.\n\nHere's a google doc with all my feedback for the game:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1k-BMNhbnl_aq3x9HzQI30GPcmPmPcWWEXuKBAaMlghE/edit?usp=sharing","March 30, 2015","false","471.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each match you pick three potential classes (mercenaries) you can freely swap between upon death. Class balance is asymmetrical. Each class has a role (Soldier, Support, Medic or Engineer), abilities to suit that role and a weapon set/movement model compliments combat at a certain range. Movement is quick like an arena shooter, with an Unreal Tournament style wall jump and Half Life style long jump helping you get around the maps. There is an aim down sights feature, however, due to the speed of movement and the accuracy of hip firing, aiming down sights is more niche than in other FPS games.\n\nCompetitive play is 5 v 5. Casual play is 6 v 6 to 8 v 8.\n\nPros\n\nThe skill ceiling in the game is very high and there's a lot of depth to mechanics. Many new FPS games shy away from features like sophisticated movement and health systems that made games like Quake so rich. Dirty Bomb is not one of these games.\n\nAlthough strafing and crouching the standard evasion model, great players can also use long jumps and wall jumps to further increase evasion in the right situation. Perhaps even the odd standard jump in some niche circumstances. The maps are specifically built with jumps in mind and there are various spots that will provide you with good flanks or an advantage, with the right trick jump. The movement model has depth but it's also not obnoxiously powerful such as in games like Quake, people that haven't quite mastered it definitely stand a reasonable chance against people that have.\n\nHealth does regenerate slowly over time, however, if you don't have access to a medic, the down-time is somewhat punishing if your health bar is significantly depleted. Additionally, you spawn with only a few magazines of ammunition, meaning you will also need access to a Support character or the slower supplying and uncommon ammunition box, to regularly stock your pool.\n\nThe level design is good in the context of competitive play. It's not too open and not too “chokey”. There's usually 2 - 3 potential lanes you can take to push. The inclusion of optional but useful sub-objectives has also further enhanced the design by spreading combat out and giving people more targets to focus on.\n\nMost of the small arms are solidly designed and satisfying to use. The bullets go where you shoot them! Most of the time, it's the better player that will win an engagement.\n\nBalance may not be perfect but the game is very playable, as pretty much any class, in a non-competitive setting.\n\nCons\n\nCasual play feels like a non-consideration. The maps are really too “chokey” and defender-orientated for public matches. Slowly regenerating health and low ammunition pools leave you gimped without a reliable medic and support on your team. It's hard for a single player to carry a bad team, however several competent players can make a huge difference, meaning you often get very imbalanced one sided public matches. Furthermore, several classes have abilities that are very frustrating to play against in the larger scale public matches (I'm looking at you “spammy” grenade launcher). I personally think this is a big thing because it means Splash Damage are overly limiting their target demographic - Dirty Bomb likely will not be able to sustain itself on “hardcore” competitive players alone.\n\nBalance isn't quite there yet and some of the classes are straying in to hard counter territory levels of power. The soldier classes specifically feel like they're excessively superior to the others at killing. There are certain mechanics like high velocity cook-able one hit kill grenades and 1.5s immortality upon revive that obviously need to go.\n\nIn addition to the class balance problems, there seem to be some netcode issues occasionally, perhaps linked to lack of inertia on certain fast moving classes. Certain people forgo good aim and decide to spaz out strafing and/or jumping instead and/or crouching. Unfortunely, sometimes this nets these people the win because directional changes become game breakingly fast. Obviously this negatively impacts the competitiveness of the game quite a bit.\n\nAlthough it's obviously early days yet, the game seems to really lack long term re-playability. You've probably seen all the game has to offer and reached close to maximum progression in a couple of hundreds hours of play, at best. Ranked queues are long and there is only the odd small scale tourne on weekends. There's little in the way of a competitive scene yet and a game like this sorely needs one. Early days though, this could easily change in time.\n\nThe business is currently okay, however, this might change. Progression is mildly P2W in the short term, however, viable competitive loadouts are quickly attainable, and at the end of the day, the progression cap isn't set that high. If you did want to spend money to reduce your grind everything would only cost ~£30, at the time of writing. This price will definately go up every time a new class is released though. (Bare in mind you don't necessarily need everything though and can also mix/match paying and buying content for in-game currency.)\n\nOther minor cons: The UI is laggy. The vote interface isn't very obvious and intuitive. Pub stomping premades allowing on casual servers. The odd hacker and no clear way to report them.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you like fast paced competitive shooters this game is worth a try. It has its flaws and it's definitely no CS, UT or Quake, however, it's something new that's relatively rich. That's something you don't see all that often in this time where we're bombarded with low skill floor modern shooters and not much else.","May 9, 2015","true","241.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pretty balanced from a weapons standpoint from the outset, and after a handful of matches you should have enough to at least try out one new loadout for a merc in your collection. Matches are fun, the production quality is high for a free game. My only complaints are that for some modes/maps, it's easy to get blocked into your spawn (though it isn't nearly as bad as something like Warface). All in all, one of the few F2P games I am considering spending real money on, though I think you're better off getting a bundle or the starter pack on sale hopefully because the prices seem a bit steep individually ($10 for a merc unlock and there's what, 12-15 mercs you have to unlock?).","October 15, 2015","true","168.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't get why people call this game p2w, since the grind for getting a 50k merc is about the same as getting a new champion in League of Legends now, you get occasional card cases as drops just by playing a few matches, you can always trade up cards for a higher tier, and you only need up to Bronze to play competitive, which is easy to get. Everything above Bronze are just skins.\n\nThe Time to Kill an enemy is slow, but that's because you are probab ly not aiming for heads. In today's FPS shooters (Call of Duty, etc.), I am more focus on just landing shots on the dude and get a kill within seconds. In Dirty Bomb, you have to focus on getting headshots, which is nice since I'm no longer mindlessly poining my cursor around and getting kills like that.\n\nThe parkour, although limited, is fun to use. There is basically just two simple things, the Wall Jump and the Long Jump. Though, with these two togethor, it opens up more routes to flank the enemy team at. My favorite is wall jumping over a crate and getting enemies that are behind said crate.\n\nThough, currently as of this review, the game has a lot of technical issues, though the devs are constantly trying to improve their game, so give it some time.\n\nThe only real issue that I have are the prices of everything in the store in terms of real-life currency, but that's about it.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10","April 27, 2015","true","144.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it's been irritating me to every degree.\nHow do we make this game more popular?\nSeriously. This game has amazing potential to compete with games like CS:GO, Dota 2, CoD, and more! So why hasn't it happened? What's the community doing wrong to draw in new players? Is there something the devs could do? The player count right now is certainly large and will most definitely keep you entertained, but if you're a new player, the slightly limited field of experience between players will leave you feeling intimidated and make you feel like you need to take this game really seriously. This game is beautiful, with a sort of TF2/Overwatch mixed with CoD sort of art style, with unique gameplay mechanics, and lovable, enjoyable characters. Things are balanced, there are just enough maps to keep things interesting, and regarding maps, each map is HUGE. MUCH bigger than one would expect out of a fast paced FPS. Please, if you're someone who plans on trying this game out, don't hesitate. Even though the player count is nowhere near as high as it can be, you're someone who can help change that. New players who find the game enjoyable and welcoming for them will help to draw in even more new players.\n\nIn this game's current state, I rate it a 9/10. It's a REALLY fun game. I LOVE playing classes like Redeye, that toss in unique gameplay mechanics that you won't find in other games like CS:GO. The characters have personalities that you can relate to, much like TF2. And its fast paced, addictive FPS action will keep having you come back for more. I think it's safe to say I like this game more than CS:GO, a game I spent considerably more money on, and have roughly 3x the hours on compared to this game.","March 27","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only real complaint so far with the game is you better make damn sure the first merc you buy is the one you want, the grind to buy mercs for free is absurd with the missions (primary source of credits) only resetting once every 3 hours and giving around 1k credits total when most mercs are around 50,000 credits each.\n\nThe loadout system adds more grind, you get loadout cards from cases that you can buy for 1k credits each or obtain at end of mission drops (and they are quite generous with the drop rates right now). However the issue is you get a random loadout card so it's highly likely you will get a ton of cards for mercs you don't even have unlocked and none for the ones you want. You can trade a specific amount of unused loadout cards to get one for a specific merc but again the one you get is completely random. You can buy loadout cards for like 15k credits if you want. Then we move onto elite cases which you can buy for real money which only give silver and up loadout cards, while lead and iron loadouts are completely viable it's highly likely someone with a silver one will have an advantage just because he has more perks. It's not pay to win in the slightest but it's worth a mention. Balance in Dirty Bomb is so so, some mercs are clearly better then others for specific roles and the overall team balance seems to be zero so most games end in a complete stomp for one side.\n\nOverall would I recommend Dirty Bomb? Right now yes, it's fun enough. However it's worth a mention that Nexon of all companies is involved with this one. It's highly possible in the future they will introduce pay to win mechanics like they always do, play the game NOW if you want to play it as the Nexon involvement seems to be zero at this point so when they decide to get involved you will have had your fill and can move on.","June 19, 2015","true","75.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Takes from Brink in a positive way, feels really rewarding, really solid, always no issues.\n-Close to refined, nearly no bugs. There are a few minor graphic bugs but there are really none game breaking.\n-Game modes are pretty well designed, a lot of fun to play on.\n-Maps are well built.\n-Nearly all the characters are balanced. Some more situational than others, some stronger, but nothing will win you or lose you the game if one character is present or absent while their role is filled. (No character x as medic but character y is a medic? No problem.)\n-Good loadout sytem. It was done with the idea of balancing in mind. All cards above bronze are purely cosmetic and bronze cards are not hard to get.\n-Getting characters is not difficult. Compared to League of Legends, you can get the more expensive characters faster than the 6300 IP champs.\n-Not pay to win.\n-Offers rewards from time to time after missions are a nice touch.\n\nWhere it can improve;\n\n-More maps, more variety, more gamemodes. I know designing maps for this game is difficult due to balance issues, but 5 maps is still a few number. 6 including dome, a prototype map. There are 3 game modes, which can get dull when you sink 25 hours into this game.\n-Better UI. Some things can change for the better when equiping loadouts.\n-Party search, finding a game with friends is a hassle, youll almost awlays have one friend on the opposing side.\n-More servers. While the servers are fine, dedicated servers, there is a lack for them. Most are inaccessible to higher level players as there are multiple level 5 or under servers.\n\n\nAlso, phantom needs to be reworked or removed. He is the MOST CRUTCH character in game. You cannot justify a 120/410 character with a 100 melee damage strike and damage reduction/invisibility. You cannot justify it takes skill, you cannot justify it is difficult, you cannot it is difficult to play, you cannot justify he contributes to the team like all the other classes save Vassilli.","July 8, 2015","true","226.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matyman/recommended/333930/","matyman","BlacKnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matyman/","102 products in account","Very fun game. In 23 hours of gameplay I only have come across about 2 hackers in pub matches but have not played competitive yet. Gameplay is fast paced and the objectives are good, there are many situations that you really need to think and work as a team in order to complete the task at hand unless the opposing team is completely useless.\n\nThe merchs, classes and abilities are interesting and the maps work fairly well for the most part however there is not enough of them. Hoping that more maps will be released soon because the current maps are already starting to get a little boring.\n\nThere are still lots of new players in the game that do not understand how to use various mercs abilities which can be a little frustrating at times and there is generally little communication which is a cornerstone to team based games. Like most team games you will get players on your team that all they care about is sniping and they don't even assist with the objective, hunting players that are having no impact on the objective and not protecting teammates that are working on objectives. I do not understand why people like this play these team based objective games.\n\nIt would be good if there was some updates to loadout card management, being able to 'star' or select favorites that you use most often so that no mistakes are made when trading up cards. I don't think you can even check a cards abilities when in the trading screen. Another bonus would be if we can bind vsay commands to buttons so we do not need to use the menu system to issue commands.\n\nOverall I am looking forward to future updates and hope that they resolve some of the issues that are currently plaguing the game and I also really hope they release some more content soon because I am concerned that the community will lose interest in this game if there is no action.\n\n","August 18, 2015","true","406.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The claims about balance issues is there because people haven't put the time in to understand the system on which the loadout cards are done. Right now, credits are easily obtained through normal gameplay. You can gain about 12k from a victory, while getting 7k for a loss, and that's a full game where you joined in from the start. With your credits you can purchase Loadout cases for 1k each, which comes with a loadout card. You then use these cards to upgrade to the next tier. So 3 iron cards, equals to one bronze card. Then 4 bronze cards to one silver, then 4 silver to one gold. Essentially, per win, you can obtain a single bronze card. Put the math in and in about 3-4 hours you can have a gold card.\n\nBalance issues aren't really a decent claim from users. Due to this being a "class" based combat system, each one excells at it's own. Frag, the assault class, destroys anything at long range except for a sniper. Aura, the healer, is great for a fast paced close quarters engagement. She boasts both shotgun and SMG loadouts. Proxy is the shotgunner, and fast paced runner, she's a CQB ONLY! class... Balance has no issue at all, once you know the strengths and weakness' of each class. It's like TF2 people... Each class per situation. There is no balance issues in that regards.\n\nThe game is indeed in closed beta, so performance is an issue. I say that as recording/streaming gameplay seems to be problematic as the game doesn't agree with on-the-fly x264 encoding. I was attempting to stream and my CPU was taking a ♥♥♥♥. I can, however, stream everything else 720p without a problem or a single FPS spike.\n\nGive the game a shot. I reckon you'll like it. It's certainly a different take on F2P shooters.\n\nAlso, uhb-jek-tive gameplay is the best way to obtain exp and maximum credits intake, before you say anything.\n\n\nDon't be a ♥♥♥♥.","March 28, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's not to say that Dirty Bomb is a mere clone, because it really isn't. When it comes right down to it, Dirty Bomb is just a mix of elements already seen in other shooters. However, it is the way that Dirty Bomb mixes these elements that makes it a game worth playing. Take all the good things about Wolf ET, Brink, Country Strike and Team Fortress 2 and you get one helluva fun time. That one helluva fun time is Dirty Bomb. With fast paced action, loveable mercenaries and a very fair monotization system, there's no reason not to give Dirty Bomb a go! What are you waiting for? It's time to play dirty!","June 28, 2015","true","168.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can play it simplistically or complicated and still have a good time. I love the speed of everything and the sense of momentum. The twitch based gunplay is top notch and all of the weapons are fun and fairly well balanced. The character roster rotates periodically so you will be able to play as any character without spending a dime. There are even promotions occasionally which give free characters or loadouts. The characters are all very unique and enjoyable and the world is vibrant and beautiful and very stylized. Every other FPS that I play now just feels sluggish and unengaging.\nThe game does need more optimizing and the community might be getting smaller but those are the only two negatives I have to say.\nI highly suggest Dirty Bomb!","March 4","true","98.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The cons to this game is the Nexon game security and matchmaking however it is getting better and hasn't hugely affected my experience with the game so far.","March 4","true","66.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

New content rolls out in decent timing with some new flavor and new stratagies are needed as well. 4 of 5 stars\n\nUpdate March 2016:\nAs with most updates, team balance was a great fix. A lot of mercenaries were changed as well as the load out cards that go along with them. Some are good, but some are not what they used to be. But I embrace changes as they tip the scale and make me think of different ways to play each of the mercenaries. I still feel the same now as I did in my initial review, with the exception of the team balance.","January 20","true","141.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"
