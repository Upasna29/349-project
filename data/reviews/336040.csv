First off - its one of those mobile cash-model where you can just pay cash and end up owning all the best cards. Not even random - you have packages with 20 legendary cards guaranteed.\n\nThen there would be the graphics - now im not someone to bash on the graphics because a game isnt running with 20158148 fps or has no 64x Anti-Aliasing, but this one is just an abomination. Final Fantasy 7 had better models.\n\nNow to the gameplay - its sluggish. And by that i mean it takes forever to do anything. Every function, every button has some slight delay, some little animation even if there is no reason for it. It might not sound important, but it about doubles the time you would normally need, which means that it also doubles the time you will spend on anything doing in this game.\n\nAlso there are all sorts of creatures but only about 3 females, which have a massive cleavage but also the charisma of a tree log.\n\nAnyways, looks like a quick cash-in. Cheap, boring, not worth your time. Dont let my sacrifice of playing it be in vain and just dont even bother with this game.","January 20, 2015","false","0.6"," 103 of 155 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","103","155","7","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KhanInd/recommended/336040/","KhanInd","KhanIndustries","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KhanInd/","110 products in account","3.x Update Re-review SP Perspective\nOn release I quickly installed the game based on its cool sounding premise. Its half card game and half hex tactics game combined which sounded like a great idea. Played about half way through the first chapter and decided to pick up the Tripler and a few chests because I was enjoying it. Like many others who posted in the forums and gave negative reviews (including me), I hit a brick wall in my campaign a little later. In fact that brick wall would come down like a steel blast door at times if you didn't get any good cards. I hopped on over to the AI skirmish mode to find the AI got massive mana and starting hand bonuses that my pathetic cards just couldn't deal with. After multiple frustrating matches I simply gave up on it and left a negative review. At the time in the game's initial design, I felt that all I got for my money's worth was a frustrating experience.\n\nFast forward to the 3.1 update and I'd figure I would give the game another shot. I'm so happy to say that those initial bad experiences are over. Actually I've been bugging out on the game for the past couple days I'm now loving it. The single biggest change they made is that you can now obtain any cards you feel that you may need using gold coins which can be obtained for free by playing or buying with cash. You no longer have to depend on the RNG gods of getting decent cards from chests which could take a long while to obtain via skirmish on release. This changes everything because now if you got really crappy cards from your chests you got in the campaign before you hit that brick wall, you don't feel like your stuck in a catch-22. That is to say you don't have the cards needed to earn gold to obtain cards needed to progress. Now you can simply get the cards you need by going into the collection and picking them up that way. However now that you can play each chapter up to four times using the new formats as opposed to release when you could only play it once means that your chance of getting stuck in that situtaion in the first place goes down as well so that's another great addition.\n\nThe biggest challenge in the game from a SP perspective is that the levels are designed completely against the player in campaign outside the starting chapter and in skirmish the AI got huge bonuses (which have now also been reduced) to both mana income and starting hand. Add to that the AI had better cards than you on release amounted to a very frustrating experience. Now that I'm able to pick up the cards that I feel I need to overcome those challenges the game changes completely. Now that I'm able to obtain cards, primarily mass removal combos that deal with an AI that can swamp you based on its mana and card advantage, I don't feel like I'm at an impasse any longer.\n\nIts turning out to be a really fun game given the changes. You'll also be pleasantly surprised at the amount of content packed into it given its a mobile port, certainly more depth to it than most other mobile games I've played. You have a TON of strategies at your disposal due to the huge number of spells and creature types you can mix and match. Very cool to see your card game "come to life" where you control on a map the creatures you play.\n\nAnyhow, if you’re thinking about trying the game for the first time it's worth checking out. If you're thinking about revisiting it then go ahead and give it another shot. The game really has changed completely for the better. At least this formally frustrated player thinks so. The Tripler in my opinion is one of the best bangs for your buck in any FTP game I can recall. Once you get it for a few dollars, it’s yours forever and not time based. A+ for that!!","June 7, 2015","true","102.2"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","24","24","0","5"

And you don't have to spend money to play this game at high level. It's rare that the developers of a game are not after your money, and this is such a rare developer team. If you go to the forum, you'll notice that they're visiting the forum daily to communicate with and listen to players (many player suggestions are implemented into the game) and if you need support, you'll get a personal response very fast.\n\nAnyway, if you like strategic games, definitely give this a try!\n\n[Edited to add:]\nIf you're on the fence whether this is game is your cup of tea: the second video is actually quite good in explaining the game (you know, at the top of your screen there are 3 videos and then some screen shots). Like the voiceover in the video says: this game is like Magic the Gathering meeting Battle Chess.\n\n[Update 4 June 2015:]\nThe game has just got a major overhaul, version 3, and it's now even better! More than 1,200 (yep, that's one thousand and two hundred) new cards. More types of battles (like a 'pauper deck' where you cannot use Legendary and Rare cards), more single player missions, and more free coins to be earned. Also the leader board is now reset monthly, and it's set up in a way that less experienced players can climb to the top as well.","February 6, 2015","true","892.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

I know every time I play, usually just a couple battles a session, I'm getting a few new packs (or chests as they're called in this game) to add to my collection either as direct rewards or bought with the cash I'd just earned (admittedly I do have the tripler in effect, which helps speed things up a lot).\n\nCompared to other CCGs, the game is definitely on the lighter/streamlined side of things.  While it now has some 1900 cards now, and unlike Yugioh, they almost all have a point (albeit there are some really odd cards that clearly, outside of pretty elaborate combos, I can't see be included in most decks).  Another honest admission is that when it comes to the monsters themselves, the vast majority of the cards in this game, it can at times feel like they filled out the ranks by simply recombining some handful of variables in every possible configuration (12 races x 3 classes x 24 different powers x etc.) although, under closer inspection, it is clear there are some powers primarily available to certain races and definitely not seen in all 3 classes).\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this game is how simple they make it to buy or sell any of it's 1900 cards.  The basic rules that appear to govern this is that you can sell any card in your collection for roughly a fourth of its retail value which in turn is primarily based on its rarity (although there is a bit of supply and demand worked in as well, so expect to pay a little more than the straight rarity would indicate for a popular card and expect to get a bit less when selling a card there is no demand for).  If you're ever short on in-game cash just sell off those rarer cards you KNOW you'll never use.\n\nLastly I also like how the game structures things with its 2 most common chests, the mini and full.  Mini chests, 400 gold for 6 cards, are the cheapeast way to really add a lot of cards to your collection for minimal cash with the only downside being that the distribution of cards is totally random and 90% it will just be common cards with a couple of uncommon thrown in.  Full chests, 1200 gold for 12 cards, while a far more expensive route to go for your cards, at least GARUNTEES 3 uncommons and 1 rare (or better).  So, as it stands, I find myself going back and forth between both chest types, minis to fill out my collection variety, making sure I at least have a wide breadth of all of the game's common cards, but still throw in a few full packs to get my guaranteed rarer cards.","June 18, 2015","true","39.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It has an extra level of depth than a digital CCG because of its board game layout. Terrain makes a huge difference in strategy and can reall determine the outcome of the match if you can force your oponent(s) from strategic tiles, envelope their archer heroes or pin them in a corner.\n\nOnline multiplayer is the best though and the more the merrier. The best online matches I have played were 2v2 and 3v3 with a mixture of friends/guildmates and strangers. The deck creativity you encounter is pretty awesome, especially when facing oponents using complimentary decks. I still remember a series of shattering defeats at the hands of another clan when they employed inferno decks, even though the night before we had proved better tatical usage winning 4/5 matches against them.\n\nThe animations are great, with moves, attacks and spells giving it a much more immersive feel than from 2/2.5D cards. Throughout the games short history, they have added a lot of new cards, balanced overpowered cards, strategies and heroes well.Recently they increased the rarity of rare and legendary cards, making it less likely to face off against an oponent using decks loaded with rare and legendaries.","February 9, 2015","true","28.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The Steam version is 100% compatible with the mobile versions: your cards and coins are stored on the server.\nYou can buy the tripler which triples all your winning bonuses for $5, and if you like these game even a little bit  you would be crazy not to.\n\nThe game is based around summoning monsters onto a hex grid to protect your hero and attack the opponents hero and monsters. There are various spells, runes and equipment to boost your hero and monsters.  Monsters (and heroes) come in 3 classes: warriors, mages and archers. Warriors generally have more attack power and damage based abilities, archers have lower attack power but can shoot 3 hexes, mages are somewhere in the middle and can attack within a 2 hex radius. Control-decks are possible, but generally you won't be able to win without monsters.\n\nPrizes for completing missions in the single player campaign are generous. Prizes are also paid out for winning online games against human opponents and it's entirely possible to not spend a cent and own as many cards as the big spenders as long as you are willing to put in the time: every card can be obtained without spending money except for additional heroes. This makes suggestions that this game is "play-to-win" simply laughable. Heroes have a system where there is a "hero of the week" which you can use for free, or you can purchase them outright if you decide you want one for keeps. You start the game with one permanent hero, which you can choose from a warrior, mage or archer.\n\nThe developers of this game are passionate about it, and it shows. They are regularly gathering feedback in the forums and implementing changes based on community feedback. If you experience a bug or technical issue they always respond quickly and have a fix ready in the next version.","August 5, 2015","true","442.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The hex based movement on the board also makes it resemble a turn based strategy game.\n\nThere's a lot of variety in the the matches, thanks to the numerous features in the game. The game includes a lot of different boards, all of which have different shapes and feature several bonus tiles. There are also many different kinds of utility cards that you can use to strengthen your team and disrupt your opponents. All the different features work together well and give the game depth.\n\nThere's a ton of different cards in the game, although the developers tend to have gone for quantity over quality. A lot of the monsters are very similar to each other, and some of the spell cards require a very specific situation to be useful. I would've preferred a somewhat smaller pool of cards, with only cards that are genuinely useful and different from each other. Some monsters are so weak that they seem pretty pointless, since there are others that have the same usage cost, yet more health and attack.\n\nThe upside of the large card pool is that you have a ton of choice on what kind of deck you'd like to make. There are many different races and classes, all with their unique abilities. With all the variety available, it's fun to build new decks. You can make lots of different kinds of viable decks.\n\nA few of the cards are a bit overly useful and fit in almost any deck, like the runes that allows you to draw extra cards every turn. This is a major advantage in practically any deck. Still, I haven't encountered anything that's clearly overpowered. The balance isn't perfect, but it's pretty good, especially considering the large amount of cards included.\n\nThese problems are mostly mitigated by how generous the game is in giving you cards. You can buy any card directly, which makes it easy to get the exact cards you want. The most popular cards cost quite a lot, but it does allow you to remove the luck element from getting the cards you want.\n\nYou get cards in the single player at a quick pace even if you don't pay any real money. You might have to replay the quests in other formats in order to get enough good cards for the hardest missions. The game is much more generous to free players than most digital card games.\n\nIf you do enjoy the game, you should buy the tripler. It triples all the cash payouts in the game. There's no time limit or any other catch to it, which makes it a great deal.\n\nSome other reviewers complained about the game being pay to win because of how difficult the campaign is in some spots. The campaign does get hard later on, but not in a way that requires you to pay money. I finished all the campaigns with only 75% of the money an F2P player could get, so there definitely isn't a paywall in the game. As long as you're smart with your deck composition and don't rely solely on legendary cards to win, you can make great decks without paying money.\n\nI really enjoyed that the single player offered a good challenge. It feels like a complete game by itself. In many other digital card games, the single player is more like an extremely easy tutorial for the multiplayer.\n\nThe presentation of the game isn't as strong as the gameplay is. Representing a card game with 3D models is an interesting idea. It makes the game much more animated and lively than usual. However, the art style doesn't match the game's content very well. The game's art style gives the impression of a simple, kiddy game, despite it being fairly complex. The recent update did improve the graphics somewhat. They're not AAA quality, but they look decent enough.\n\nIt's odd that the game has so few players in it, even though it's actually very well made and free to play. The player base does seem to be very dedicated to the game, so you can still find opponents for multiplayer games.\n\nIf you enjoy card games or turn based strategy games at all, give Combat Monsters a shot. It's a lot of fun.","January 12","true","50.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is way deeper than you might expect at first glance, and I like it quite a bit.\n\nThere is one area of content that can't be acquired by normal free play - alternate heroes, and it does stand as a blemish on the otherwise good game.  Honestly, I'd say the whole pricing structure needs a hard rethink, since I don't think it is doing what it should be... encouraging you to pay a reasonable amount for the fairly significant amount of enjoyable time you are likely to experience playing this game.\n\nThat said, the heroes won't keep you from doing anything important.  So give it a play and have fun.","August 8, 2015","true","41.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Before you completely dismiss this review, let me explain why my opinion matters.\n\nYou see, I was just having a nice day when suddenly a friend of mine-let's call him Mr. D-messaged me to tell me to play Combat Monsters. Being the gullible idiot that I am, I downloaded it without question. While waiting, I watched a few episodes of Not Sword Art Online. By the time the ending rolled in, I have it in my library.\n\nRight as it finished, Mr D messaged me to tell me to get on Combat Monsters. At the time, I felt like playing Dota, but I acquiesced to his request and launched Combat Monsters.\n\nNow everyone say first impression is everything, and I agree. My face was concave from the impression this game gave me. The low quality 3d models, the mediocre soundtrack, the whatever UI, it all added to a feeling of nostalgia. I then said to Mr. D on skype, "What the ♥♥♥♥ is this?" He chuckled, and told me to play the tutorial. Play the tutorial I did. What I am going to say next does not fully reflect on everything I feel. It is quite impossible to put this phantasmagoric experience into words. Nevertheless, I will make do with what I can. Holy ♥♥♥♥, it sucked balls. Okay, maybe I am being a little too harsh. I will admit the tutorial guy (I will refer to him as OldBro for convenience sake) is quite funny. OldBro got to me laugh a couple of times but the fact remains, the general mechanics didn't interest me.\n\nWait a second, this is actually starting to sound like a review. Let me try that again.\n\nTake 2: I suddenly realized I am playing a mobile game but now on a computer. I moved away from the screen and sat down on my bed. I closed my eyes. I saw nothing. What am I doing? Why am I playing this? Is there still hope for humanity? Why is Log Horizon season 2's pacing so awful? Mr D's confused queries on skype brought me back to reality.\n\n"What happened?"\n"It's nothing."\n"Are you sure? You sound kinda off."\n"I'm sure it's from Obama's healthcare. Don't worry about it."\n"If you say so."\n"But... Um... I can't play this game."\n"Why?"\n"I just can't, I'm sorry!"\n\nI hung up on the confused Mr. D. I hurriedly closed Combat Monster with Task Manger. I stared at its icon on my desktop. It's ugly visage seemed alien when placed alongside its homely neighbors. It sits there, hated by all, hating all. I shuddered. I am no fool; I will not open that abomination again.\n\nTrue to my word, it still lies there untouched. The thick layer of digital dust accumulated over the desktop icon acts as a natural curtain, gracefully shielding the world from the object that lies beneath it. It will stay that way.\n\nSo what prompted this review? I don't know. I'm just doing this because I'm bored. Oh? What is this? What do I think of the game? Yeah whatever play it if you want, I don't really care. I didn't really play the game. I mean what did you expect? It says right there, 0.1 hours logged.","February 7, 2015","true","0.1"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","59","17","29","28","2"

If you like turn-based board games and CCG, you really should try this game! Imagine playing chess but with cards that give your chess pieces weapons, armor, and shields! This game also incorporates runes which can be placed on the battle board via your card hand and spell cards which can alter your hero or monster’s abilities! This game is like chess on steroids, it has so much depth of strategy with all the combinations that it actually puts chess to shame! Many of the players that play this game have been playing it continually for over a year and a half, that says quite a bit about a game! And, if playing multiplayer type games is not your cup of tea, no worries, because this game has numerous ways to play single player too! The few Issues that I had with game were handled professionally and efficiently by a competent and small development team. Even though you can spend money to buy card packs, it is defiantly not a necessity to win or have fun! Give it a try and some time and have a blast!  And just to be straight I played this game mostly on the stand alone PC version, but it is the same game! ***** five stars*****","July 1, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So I am very picky about card games in general and like most people that compare all MMORPG to WOW I compare all card games to MTG.  Also I have no affiliation with the DEVs or this company.  This game has a twist though.  The cards come to life and you can control them in a 3D arena, instead of static play and the popular 2D side to side animated versions.  The spawns are a bit cartoony, but at least they didn't go out of their way to make them all anime-like = cute & cuddly...  Has a Dungeon Defenders art feel to me with a bit more texture.  Even though the game froze a few times and loading a bit much for such a small game; I have had a blast.  The game only crashed once and it might have been the combination of FRAPS + Gameplay, since I am You Tubing the whole standard Campaign rounds 1-19.  Super easy! 21-0 so far!  Next will be 50 card campaign.  Only downfall is the online community is non-existent so you will be forced to play people that have been here all along to play.  Some say this is Pay-to-Win, but I feel as if it is more a Pay-to-Advance, but if your friend spends $10 he will have a huge advantage over you as new players until you learn the game, but even then still has some advantage.  Player skill varies so anything is possible!\n\n""Opening this game to community allowed WORKSHOP creations would greatly boost this community!""\n\nPROS\n\n1. Fun factor\n2. Easy to master\n3. Nice Graphics\n4. Nice Soundtrack\n5. Customization\n6. Themed Deck building\n7. You can name & save many different Deck Builds\n8. Pay top Advance Argument = Money can get you many nice cards that FTP people will after months\n9. Has Potential\n10. Endless possibilities for expansions\n11. The various Tribes (Races) each have their very own unique racial traits/abilities\n12. No player vs bot skirmish custom battles\n13. Multiple accounts are allowed\n14. All races have their equal (Or damn close) and their obvious conquering opposites.  Dwarves and Lizard men = Similar and Werewolves vs Dwarves\n15. Great DEV response time and they care enough to reply to your reviews!!! (Just look in comments)\n\nCONS\n\n1. Limited Replay allowances\n2. A bit too easy to master\n3. Gold rewards do not feel rewarding enough for some stage completions\n4. End Stage Card Rewards are the same for everyone\n5. Some PvE, but ridiculous to make a career out of PvE only without a few bucks (Easy to tell)\n6. Chest rewards seem a bit lacking, Mystery Chests minimum totals are a joke (Friend got 5 rubicoins as a reward and my lowest was 65)\n7. The online community is all but dead -> (I AM CURRENTLY WORKING TO FIX THIS!)\n8. Due to online opportunities lacking you need to play against experienced players as a new player (Could be good or Bad I guess)\n9. Pay to Win Argument = Money in excess can get you all the cards you need instantly or at least save months of time gathering\n10. Once campaigns are beat and the 4 allowed repeats are done = PvE is dead\n11. Besides PvP no real replay value except for the eventual no EXP and no currency repeated rounds (ANSWERS = Map Maker and more campaign or allow endless repeating)\n12. No difficulty settings\n13. No Workshop\n14. No player created custom map sharing (If Map Maker)\n\n\nMISC (Neither Good nor Bad stuff)\n\n1. No Map Maker\n2. No real Co-Op (Because 6-player FFA alliances are not forced teams and easily backstabbed)\n3. How about an ANTE system\n\nAll stated is as I experienced it and only one campaign is left out of the four within an 6-hour period.  I know some might have experienced something different, but keep in mind I am not you and so on... I breezed right through this game and in a few minutes the entire campaign(4) around 8 hours played.  The answer is more than obvious: Open game to WORKSHOP possible and add a Map Maker up to 6v6 instead of 1v1v1v1v1v1 or at least 5v5 so you can start tournaments and peek greater interest!\n\n\n"I had fun and will play again on my PvP practicing account"\n\n\nSirspoony Game Rating:  7.75/10 rated "GOOD"  10/6/15 UPDATED +0.5 due to DEV response\n\n...with Map Maker = 8.25/10 rated "GREAT!"\n\n...with infinite campaign rewards and More Campaigns and/or Workshop MODS = 8.5/10 rated "AMAZING!!"\n\n...with online custom skirmish matches human vs Bots 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5 and 6v6 + allowed player made custom (Map Maker) matches = 9/10 rated "AWESOME!!!"\n\n\nI have a dead twitch channel I might revive/reopen with streaming this game and a few others for fun.

But, this game rewards you nicely for the grind now I see vs HEX which makes you play a week and doesn't reward you with hardly a card you get on your own.\n\nHEX has "gimmick' tournaments and quests that will give you a lot of crap cards for free and the same identical ones in the campaign whereby this game truely feels "random" in most cases though I do get a lot of cards I don't want or need.\n\nA pak of booster cards with at least at the mininum in this game yield you a LEGENDARY, try to get one of those without paying in Hex.\n\nWhile you can buy and sell cards here the prices are fair. The ones in Hex can go up to 100,000 PLAT that's plat now not gold. It takes 120 gold to get ONE plat so you figure out how long that will take you to get that card you want or need.\n\nThe dailies are a LOT more fun here than the same ole same ole Frost arena in Hex. I got so bored of playing that and the same AI ever game and match I pulled my hair out and am now bald :)\n\nAt first I didn't like this game, but, believe me it's worth the Free to Play tag with a little Pay to Advance tied to it but the devs gotta make a living some way huh? :) I did donate $10 to this game and didn't like doing that but it became worth it with all the cards I'm getting daily and quickly not in a weeks time like HEX.\n\nGive it a try it's FREE afteralll. The tripler is worth the money if you stick with it I'm seeing. Just wish the campaign game was a little more fun than grindy.","January 4","true","143.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","9"

Example all robot archers are pretty much the same in looks, but can have really big dif in stats and skills.\n\nOthervise I love the idea that theres several races with their unique passive buffs and a very large pool of cards to choose from, even if you just started the game.\n\nHowever, theres a few big issues with the game:\n\n1. There clearly has never been any idea to keep cards balanced, you can have a unit that costs 3 with 1/8 stats and you can have the completely same unit, but with only 1 cost. The only dif is that the other card is legendary, the other is common. This is the basis why theres so many dif cards, theres a ton of cards that are just clearly a lot worse than another one. The only trick is that legendaries are expensive and you won't get a ton of those quickly.\n\nTheres a few dif game modes you can play from which 1 doesn't allow any rare+ cards in deck. It's reasonable to say that it's the only gamemode you can have any chance in if you are starting this game. And even then you are facing the elite players.\n\n2. Dead community. And I seriously mean dead. You log in, theres 2 guys online preying on newbies to smash.\n\nOther minor issues are time to time graphics bugs and that the UI for building deck / going through your cards is just horrid. One could also argue that the whole UI is complete garbage. :)\n\nThis is one of those games that I kinda like, but I feel it's not worth playing the game since theres only 1 viable gamemode that is reasonable to play. I just don't see the point in grinding out weeks or even months to get the cards to compete in the 3 out of 4 game modes which all accept powerhouse cards.\n\nI'v played a lot of TCGs in general and some of them on very high competive level, but I can't recall ever seeing so insanely big gap between your lowly common and most rare cards. It's like playing mtg so that you get 1 mana from each land and your opponent gets 3 and he has crafted his deck accordingly. Theres just no way you will win.\n\nOverall I would give this game something like 5-6 out of 10 and im struggling to decide whether to up or down vote here. For now i'll drop a No, but i'll check whats happening with the game in the future and perhaps after changes to the UI i'll upvote this.","April 15","false","16.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

It's a welcome twist to the general layout the genre, but from there, the focus of the game fades away. It can't seem to decide which aspect should be the backbone of the game, is it a #card game? A monster #fighting game? A chess game? It has a lot of nice ideas, but none of them are the core for everything to be built around. The basics are still that, place a card on the field, move it around strategically based on class: ranged, #melee, #magic, equip weapons and items, cast spells, move on. The simplicity isn't a bad thing, but there's just so much more it can be.\n\n\nAudio: 77/100\n\nThe effects and voices are decent enough, but they're nothing spectacular. If anything, they're almost insulting in the stereotypical #medieval #British voices that are there, as if they were all pre made from some kind of fantasy role playing game library.\n\n\nVisuals: 74/100\n\nOn the #mobile versions, the game is alright. It's not sleek like Hearthstone or high end like some others, it sits somewhere in the middle, but parts here and there makes the PC version seem horrendous. Character faces are just blocky and not even in that nostalgic retro way. The characters themselves are okay, again nothing really standing out that we haven't already seen or some kind of twist that changes the norm.\n\n\nContent: 73/100\nThere's a fair amount of things to do, but the game relies on in-game purchases, something that plagues the mobile market and something the developers over at Rubicon seem to want in the Steam version. Granted it isn't shoved down your throat like in the mobile market, but the fact that it is there is a bit of a nuisance for me: Get this pack, buy this item, on and on. And even for little things. One of the first things I tried to do was make my own "pendant," though it's more a flag than anything, and after a few minutes of customizing it, I was greeted with a prompt that "Custom Pendants are for paying customers." Again, this is something more associated and dealt with in a mobile setting, but a full blow port should have most of these things taken away.\n\n\nMultiplayer: 72/100\n\nYes, there is a multiplayer. Yes, I tried it out. Yes, it was only a few matches. And yes, it's just like the core game from what I can tell, but instead of an AI, you have a human opponent. It's like a reverse Hearthstone. I know I should stop comparing this small company's game to the massive Hearthstone, but it's hard not to, especially with its success, there are bound to be many imitators as time rolls on.\n\n\nDesign: 75/100\n\nLike I stated at the start, the game has some nice ideas, the hexagon field is one of those simple changes that increases the possibilities of the game ten fold, kind of like Tri-Dimensional Chess from Star Trek, but everything else just falls a little flat, expected, typical, and in that regard, disappointing. I was a little excited to play this, but I couldn't get into it. Maybe it's just me.\n\n\nPerformance: 71/100\n\nRan fine for the most part. Didn't experience any severe drops in frame rates or tearing. Even the max settings aren't anything to oogle over. I would assume a game like this would look a lot better on a phone or tablet, but on a full computer screen, it just doesn't hold up.\n\n\nVerdict: 73/100\n\nI tried to like this game, I really did, it had the things I like, Hearthstone inspiration, which actually got me back into card games and that fantastic mini game in the underrated FFIX, but it just can't seem to get the ball rolling. Granted the mobile versions seem to have a much warmer reception, the Steam world, not so much and I agree. It's one of those cases where the game just didn't translate as well on a bigger platform. Can I recommend it? Maybe, but unless more fine tuning is made on the Steam version, it's not something you will keep coming back to over and over again.","February 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Somewhere there is a fat troll of a game designergetting off when "he", as in the AI he designed, beats a player.  It's probably the only thing he has ever produced in his life, and it's a pile of garbage.  You see, it starts out decent.  It's fairly balanced, and an enjoyable little pasttime.  I decided to spend $6 to buy some more cards.  A good many, actually, as I bought into a special offer.  Suddenly,  the difficulty level skyrockets.  Fair fights that went down to the wire suddenly become the player ♥♥♥♥♥ing massacred fight after fight.  After a few losses, you get a message that says "you are having trouble, perhaps you should add some cards to your deck".  Hey,  Mr. Troll the game designer, perhaps you should've designed a better game instead of this piece trash.\n\nI keep trying to find some way to salvage something out of this pos for the money, but it just makes me angrier and angrier when I realize how I let myself get suckered in by these trolls.  Yes, it was my choice to play, but the makers basically lie about how the product is going to operate until you have spent money.  Every game has a learning curve, but this curve is like walking on flat plain and running into a wall that shoots 90 degrees straight up.  To be more informative, the game "cheats".  It starts with more resources and (much) better cards (after you have spent money).\n\n"Rubicon", job well done...if you admire dishonesty.  How much do you pay the guys who give you "thumbs up".  I can't imagine anyone really liking this waste of bandwidth.","February 1, 2015","false","9.1"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

I've decided I have to change that.\n\nWhile I still really enjoy this game, multiplayer matchmaking is broken beyond belief. People have a very common habit of leaving in the 1st or 2nd turn of a game, for no reason. When they do this, their rating rightfully goes down. But the other person's rating goes UP. This has created a cycle for me where it's basically "lose a few matches to players who are way better than me", followed by "winning a bunch of matches in a row because people quit on the 1st turn" which boosts my rank back up to where I'm playing people way better than me. Rinse and repeat.\n\nI reccommend this game for a fun, casual, single player experience. Or if you're a pro with a fat wallet. Otherwise I might avoid it, currently.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nShort review:  Very solid strategy game. Worth checking out, especially if you like tabletop wargaming/board games like Warhammer, Heroclix, etc. I am a big fan of tabletop games, and this game really scratches that itch for me.\n\nThe graphics are not revolutionary but look very nice. Some of the sound effects/voices can get a little bit repetitive but it's hardly worth mentioning. Games are pretty quick, and while in single player there's no turn timer so if you need to step away for 15 minutes it's totally fine.\n\nThere is both live and asynchronous multiplayer. Asynchronous seems to work flawlessly, and while I think it's fantastic to have it as an option, live multiplayer is more important to me. And as of this writing it's pretty hard to get a live match. The devs say hopefully this will improve with time, and with the game's full mobile launch (which features cross-play with the Steam version). Speaking of the devs, they seem friendly, helpful, and active.\n\nEven though the multiplayer is lacking action at this point, the single player is still a fun experience. There is indeed a cash shop, but (speaking purely in single player terms), I am feeling very well rewarded by the game without spending a cent. I probably will toss them a few bucks evenutally to get triple rewards.\n\nRecommended.","February 10, 2015","false","26.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","4"

The computer side cheats and says one thing while doing something different. Even the text is off saying +2 while the speaker says +1. If it were a problem with translation, I could almost forgive it. The blatent cheating is something I could not get past and uninstalled it as soon as it became apparent it was a money sink if you wished to win at all.","February 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","6","0","5"

There is some depth to it as along with charecter special effects you also have upgrades to runes making you choose between summoning another monster for more board control or gaining permanent bonuses each turn.\n\nNow the main thing that people are probably going to wonder about is the business model. The people saying it takes a week of grind to get a chest are being disingenuous, there's 3 types of chests a 400 1200 and 7200 to buy and each multiplayer game gives about an average of 50 currency. so no it won't take a week to get a chest it'll probably take around an hour, there is however a transaction store, now there's 2 options one to buy game currency and another to buy a permanent multipler.\n\nNow to the people screaming this p2w because you can buy currency well you can do that on virtually every online ccg/tcg so no it isn't those people don't seem to understand what p2w means because you can obtain every thing. There's a crafting system in the game similar to hearthstone's where u can disenchant excess cards for dust to create specific cards, a huge difference from hearthstone which i really hope they change is that you can't disenchant cards in this game unless you've already obtained 4 copies which i hope they change in the future is to allow you to recycle/disenchant regardless of how many copies you have.\n\nLet me be frank this game is not p2w what it might be is a long excessive grind for f2p but it is possible to obtain every card and hero without paying. However so far the game seems fairly fair its 3 dollars for a triple multipler that's permanent while i don't mind paying 3 dollars for it i understand other people who might be hesitant to do so i hope that maybe the booster will be eventually lowered but have the base currency gain from increased as it does seem a bit grindy but there are single player quests that can grant free cards and currency. However there doesn't seem to be any form of daily quests or addictional single player mode post the quest which i hope gets added so there's at least that little perk to logging on each day.","January 20, 2015","true","34.9"," 10 of 30 people (33%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","33","10","30","4","1"

I should note that I did not experience any pay to win. However as I did not get very far, or anywhere near competitive multiplayer or anything like that, I cannot be certain it doesn't end up pay to win in the end.\n\nThe game is part DCG part turn based strategy, and I really liked that. Even with me enjoying the game, you can tell this was, or at least it feels like a mobile port. Not that there is anything really wrong with that, it just comes with its own sets of positive and negatives.   I would recommend this to any "free to play nomad" or anyone looking for a decent free DCG/Strategy game.\n\n(I should note for those who dont know, DCG/dcg = Digital Card Game)","January 20, 2015","true","3.3"," 12 of 37 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","12","37","0","0"

This really is a great strategy game and combines deck building with turn-based game-play. If chess was invented hundreds of years later then this is what it would look like. With so many  heroes, monsters, weapons and spells etc, the combinations of decks must be endless. I 'm looking forward to getting more cards and get building. The game needs a few tweaks, but hopefully there will be further updates.\n\nIt disappoints me to see people leaving negative comments, particularly about the pricing model. Its a free game for crying out loud and you can play the single game without spending any money at all.  Yes, you have to spend a little (or more if you like) to build decks quicker, but I can't see it being anywhere near as expensive some of the other games on here and this looks like its going to entertain me for whole lot longer.\n\nGet involved!","January 21, 2015","true","0.1"," 10 of 37 people (27%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","27","10","37","3","0"
