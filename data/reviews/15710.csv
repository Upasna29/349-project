Best FMV cutscenes, or for that matter, any kind of cutscenes, in video games (except maybe the other Oddworld cutscenes)\n2. GameSpeak allows you to talk to your Mudokon buddies, making for some ingenious puzzles\n3. The platforming is great\n4. You can possess the enemies and wreck their s**t\n5. It's funny as s**t\n6. The oddness is immense and just great\n7. The story is great\n8. The GameSpeak was expanded from the 1st game to the creatures you can possess, allowing for even more puzzles\n9. It's only $2.50\n10.

Don't expect to run this game at your native resolution (unless you never upgraded beyond 800x600 - in which case, you're in luck!), but do expect the following: some fantastic and challenging platforming gameplay; a vast number of gorgeous levels interwoven with an interesting, dark and downright odd narrative; some brilliant music which changes dynamically depending on the events taking place; and finally, some fiendish puzzles which make use of Abe's talent for posession and the use of GameSpeak - a system by which you can instruct other characters to whatever ends you desire, be it salvation or something more nefarious.\n\nIf you've played it before, there's no better time to return to the original Oddworld titles before enjoying the delights of the HD Remake, New N' Tasty, which recreates the events of the original game in a modern game engine and is "coming soon". If you're new to the series, don't be put off by the age or initial difficulty curve. Exoddus has a quick save system, so you'll never lose progress as long as you're diligent. A must-play!","November 25, 2013","true","30.6"," 53 of 53 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","53","53","0","0"

So it comes hard for me to admit that Abe’s Exoddus is a much better game in terms of structure. Like most second entries in a video game series, Exoddus heavily improves upon the original’s platformer-puzzle formula by adding new mechanics and obstacles for you to overcome. The added quick save and “All of ya!” command are easily the best new features, with the different Mudukon types and possessable creatures being a close second. A great example of a good sequel, Abe’s Exoddus does a fantastic job at continuing the series while still offering unique elements that keep it distinct from the rest.","March 7, 2015","true","33.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

It is my ultimate favorite game and I have played it so many times. I although it isn't working on my PC, but I think it's my fault because it works perfectly on my friend's PC. But I also have it on PSN so no biggy.\nAs for the game, if you ever played cinematic platformers such as Another World or Flashback (The original, not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ remake), you should know that this is the best of that genre. Amazing atmosphere, awesome level design, creative and disturbing story and lore, and the gameplay mechanics are so ahead of their time. From talking to your fellow Mudokins, to possessing enemy sligs, this game has it all. Puzzle, platforming, and chase sequences. Whatever I say won't give this game enough credit, so I suggest you go to YouTube and watch Caddicarus' review of it. He is the best man for the job.","February 21, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It took me 20 hours to complete this game, so that's £1 per 10 hours.\nThe game itself is a classic, growing on what made Abe's Oddysee so great, and while I think Exoddus lacks the atmosphere that made the original so enjoyable, the gameplay itself is much more varied (though I still prefer Oddysee). The cutscenes are better, the music is more complex (if not a tad generic), there are more places and environments to see, and there are more types of puzzles based on the emotion system with the Mudokons. They can be angry, depressed, wired (in other words happy), sick, and blind. This means a lot more is explored as to how the Mudokons interact with you, and especially trying to handle the wired Mudokons running about with enemies, bombs and motion sensors around can get very tense.\nYou can also autosave, another improvement from Oddysee that makes the game much less frustrating.\nI have 2 complaints, however; the first being there are a few ridiculous chase sections that force you to duck and react quickly with a movement system not internded for fast-paced action, rather slow-moving stealth. The game also overstays it's welcome a bit, getting dragged out for a few more hours than it really needed to last.\nSpeaking of stealth, once again every single enemy can make your palms sweat all over your controller, especially if you have some blind Mudokons you have to escort.\nOne more thing; the graphics, for 1998, are amazing. I found myself stopping and gazing at some of the fantastically detailed backdrops of places like Necrum and the Soulstorm Brewery. It's dark and beautifully rendered.\n\nAnyway, get the game now. It's bloody great.","May 22","true","20.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There are many secrets in the game which are essential to getting the good ending for the game - there's even one on the first screen of the game (areas where there are secrets are usually signalled by empty SoulStorm Brews in the scenery).\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that it's a ♥♥♥♥♥ (at least for me) to get running on a modern PC. I think it's to do with my laptop (the Fn keys cause the game to not display the image, but you can hear sound and interact with menus fine).\n\nThis is a good game, and it's not expensive either.","May 9, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole game got a lot easier though with the new QUIKSAVE feature but its essential duty for that however was to replace the old checkpoint system in the previous game thus leading to much fewer frustrations if you die/fail.","November 25, 2011","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The excellent level design, short-but-sweet story, and grand scope of it was hampered predominantly by its checkpoint system. Each portion of a stage would throw three or four challenges at you between each checkpoint, not counting any hidden mudokons. As a result, there were many cases when several parts of a particular stage were easy but fairly slow and time consuming, while later parts were significantly more difficult and led to multiple deaths. Having to replay the earlier, easier parts quickly became very tedious very fast. In some games, this sort of thing doesn't hurt the game, but here, where the gameplay is built around trial and error, and often demands a great deal of patience, it killed the pacing at several points towards the beginning and middle of the game.\n\nI'm mentioning this because Abe's Exoddus included a quicksave feature which circumvented this problem, and for that reason alone could be considered a better game. That's not the only feather in Abe's Exoddus' cap though. The inclusion of such a feature as quicksave can fundamentally change a game like this, and Oddworld Inhabitants clearly kept this in mind. The level design is more challenging than Abe's Oddysee, but more fair. Secrets, previously pretty cryptic and very easy to overlook without the help of a guide, are now found by some out-of-the-box thinking and creative use of the game's mechanics. The core gameplay and overall design have been tweaked to remove tedium. The mechanics have been greatly expanded upon in order to provide much more variety and complexity. The voice acted cutscenes lend the world much more character, and add a great deal of levity to a game that could very easily become quite depressing.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, Abe's Exoddus is the better of the two side scrolling games (as of writing this, New 'n' Tasty is still PS4 exclusive, so I can't comment on it yet). It manages to correct the flaws of it's predecessor while also expanding upon everything that was good. It really is what every sequel should strive to be. More of the good, plenty that's new, none of the bad.","August 16, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the very first sounds of the opening sequence and game menu, I was instantly transported back to late 1990's, sitting in my older brother's bedroom, playing this on classic playstation and a tiny, heat-warped telly that we had to use a bit of blue-tac and a screw to keep the switch on AV (occassionally the screw would come loose and we'd suddenly be plunged into static mid-game!). My brother and I would take turns playing, switching every time we got Abe killed (which, on my part, was normally almost instantly), jumping out of our skins at the scarier parts (this game had the best graphics we'd ever seen at the time) and laughing our arses off at all the fart jokes. We had played through Oddysee pretty quickly, so we were excited to have a much longer game this time (TWO whole discs!), with slightly better graphics, and OH THAT REALLY AWESOME QUICKSAVE FUNCTION! Our mum even got in on the action, and played this with us on more than one occassion, helping us out with the more "puzzle-solving" sections that we couldn't work out (plus she is an x-files fanatic and loves everything to do with Aliens and weird ♥♥♥♥ like that).\n\nSo for me, this game is totally worth playing, even though it definitely wasn't designed to be played with a keyboard, nor on a 27" HD screen. It brings back so many fond memories of the rare moments that my brother and I were working together to keep Abe alive and rescue all of the Mudokons, instead of at each others throats trying to kill each other. I still love the quirky nature of this game/universe - the artwork and landscapes are mind-blowing to me even now that the graphics are incredibly below-par. The characters and creatures of Oddword are so unique and terrifying. I love the 2D platform gameplay - I wish there were more games like this. Some of the levels are pretty easy, and some of them are infuriatingly difficult (for me anyway), which just makes completing them all the more rewarding :) Just don't be a dunce like me and forget that you've only been Quicksaving for the last 3 hours, decide to exit after completing a particularly difficult level and forget to do a proper Save... That ♥♥♥♥ is devistating.\n\nSo yeah, if you loved playing this game when it first came out, you won't regret playing it again :) It's everything I remember and more.\n\nIf you've never played it before, give it a go! It was ahead of it's time when it came out like 15 years ago, and it's still a unique gaming experience in a lot of ways. If nothing else, the story is fantastic. The implications and irony of the story is something you just don't get in many popular games. We sympathize with the Mudokons and their hero, Abe. But most of us, if we took a hard look at ourselves, probably fall into the Glukkon or Slig category... or the kind of Muddokon that just watches it all happen and does nothing.\n\nHD re-make coming soon???

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cadetri/recommended/15710/","Cadetri","Cadetri Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cadetri/","15 products in account","PROS:\n\nProbably my favorite game of all time. This game has some of the BEST cutscenes, if not THE best cutscenes for the PS1 and early PC era. Gameplay is smooth, and for me, It ran without errors on my windows 8 machine, with a medium graphics card. The idea for the game is AMAZING, you play as Abe, a mudoken hero who must free his mudoken pals from soul storm brewery, and other amazingly beautiful and well designed places. The difficulty is completely fair, and, If you die, it is completely your fault, not the fault of the game or any cheap enemies, like in the last game. This game also features quick saves, possibly the best thing lovely lorne luscious lanning has ever came up with. gamespeak has been changed slightly, and a new command was added to have abe say "all a' ya!" where all of the mudokens in the room would follow, even ones in the distant background.\n\nCONS:\nWhile in some rooms, the game makes the player throw rocks at mines that cannot be disarmed. This is extremely tedious, especially when you have long rows of mines to destroy. When you set off a mine, you would expect it to set off all the surrounding ones, right? well no. You have to hit EACH ♥♥♥♥ING MINE to destroy them, and once in a blue hand moon a mine might detonate another. You can also only carry 9 rocks, and you cannot refil your bag of rocks until you throw each one. pain in the ♥♥♥. in addition, you have to release the Z key (Throwing key) after each rock you throw. if you hold it, and choose which way you want to throw it, abe will walk in that direction, towards whatever mine or bone drill you are trying to avoid\n\nThere is laughing gas in this game. Which on paper is a good concept, but in the game it can be very frustrating and unfair. First off, if one of your following mudokens is exposed to laughing gas, they go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. making you slap them to calm them down. But what usually happens, especially if you have a large following of gas-high mudokens, is you can accidentaly slap a mudoken that you have already slapped. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ him off, and he slaps you back. then you have to go and say sorry to him to calm him down. and when you're finally done with all that, one of your gas high mudokens has already ran straight into the barrel of a ♥♥♥♥ing slig.\n\nBut when you put all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t aside, you end up with one of the best games every made, and probably the best of the whole oddworld trilogy. but that is bound to change when Squeeks oddysee is released.\n","August 24, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CK2gamer/recommended/15710/","CK2gamer","CK2gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CK2gamer/","40 products in account","I remeber when I was still a kid & walking the shopping centre with my dad & he discided to into a store where they had DVDs & games on sale & comng past Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is the first game I spotted for the playstation 1.  The reason why I wanted it, because I have the Demo1 disc of the first game & I final got the full copy of the game while sometime in high school when stores like GAME stopped putting them old PS1 games instore.\n\nI do have the copy of this game on PS1, but never expranice the full game, because the game froze when Abe jumped in the well the Scrab temple, but Paramites temple was pretty aswsome, then I never really bothered with cheat code books that my uncle from England sent over to me years before with a copy of Crash Bandicoot 3.  I did complete the game a few years later by using the the level cheat code.\n\nNow that I am 19 going on 20 & have a laptop that runs windows 8 that can play some games like Five nights at freddy's.  Seeing British youtuber Caddicarus doing a retrospective of the first three games & saying at the end of part 3 that the games are on steam.  Well I downloaded the demo of this one & worked fine, then I bought it.\n\n\nStory:\n\nOddworld: Abe's Exoddus takes place straight after the first when Abe saved all the mudokons from Repture Farms.  After having a fall & getting knocked out that laid him to having a vision of three ghosts telling him that the Glukkons are digging up there bones.  So Abe & five friends set off across the dessert to Necrum to put an end to it.\n\nAlong the way Abe finds out what why the Gulkkon digging up Mudokon bones for a drink called Soul Strom Brew that is made from there bones, whitch takes Abe to another journy to the burial vaults of Necrum and temples of Scrabs, Paramites & Fleeches to get the ablity to cure sick mudokons.\n\nWhats new:\n\nWith the character in game & in cutscenes sounds different from the first with, but with a deeper voice & then goes high when changes from saying "Hello" to "Hi" when using game speak as you progressing more into the game.\n\nSome of the cast of characters from the last game are back including the gun crazy Sligs that can now fly & shoot granades & ones without pants & the Glukkons, Scrabs, Paramites & slogs return also.  There are some new characters like the blined mudokons, Fleeches, worm-like creatures that live in the Oddworld underworld that will take a few shots to eat Abe in one whole & Slurgs when stepped on will wake up the Feeches when sleeping.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nI like that I was able to us my PS4 controller to play the game like I did on the PS1 without having to use my keyboard on my laptop.  Getting to possess Glukkons, Scrabs & Paramites for the first time & using there very own game speak which is neat.\n\nThe game runs really well & has a faster loading time & at a good low price.  You can run this game on any PC.\n\nWhat I hated:\n\nI got nothing besides the D-pad not doing anything.\n\nFinal Thought:\n\nOddworld: Abe's Exoddus has a great  sence of humor, good voice acting & level design, including amazing art that shows in the games background & in cutscenes.\n\nIs this worth your time?  Yes.   Its still a great game to this day.  I still do enjoy this game when ever I go back to play it after a long time.","January 28, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I believe just because a game is old and wasn't to popular when it first came out, isn't a  valid reason for a great puzzle platformer to fly under the radar.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/55890986/recommended/15710/","55890986","Colostrum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/55890986/","87 products in account","Along the same premise as the first game, the Mudokons you're trying to rescue in Exoddus are much more complex than the original assembly. Besides the occasional drunk, blind, or just generally resistant creature, they all emote like mood rings, showing red skin when angry and an off-color greenish yellow and pale tone when sick. You have to find healing rings from Shaman Mudokons and apologize and shoulder-pat to make angry ones happy again so they'll follow you to safety. And blind Mudokons have a tendency to walk into drills and off of ledges if you don't guide them properly with verbal cues. On a positive note, you can use their blindness to your benefit. For example, if a blind Mudokon is on the level below you, notably the one with the lever you need to pull but can't get to, you can stand on the side of the screen you want the blind guy to walk toward, prompt him to follow you, and then tell him to "work" in order to turn the crank or pull the lever that allows you access to another level. Another excellent function is being able to guide more than one Mudokon at a time. In the first game, you had to rescue one Mudokon, then come back and get the other one. In Exoddus, you have an "All o' ya" command that captures the attention of anyone present. At points, you'll have a gaggle trailing behind you - sneaking, running, or jumping into the bird teleporters.\n\nBut perhaps even better than the hammed-up gamespeak is the fact that the developers fixed what could easily be called the number one problem with the first game: the inability to save the game wherever you wanted. Not only was Abe's Oddysee a tough game, you spent a lot of time redoing what you'd done because of the need to learn the hard way. Many of the puzzles in the original required some testing before you made it through, and when you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the path each time you fail, it's hard to stay inspired to push forward. In Exoddus, you have an incredibly welcomed quick-save option that allows you to quickly save your progress, anywhere in the game as many times as you want. And when you're ready to quit playing, you simply save to the memory card instead of a quick save, and you're set. This introduces an interesting dilemma, as the quick save certainly makes Exoddus seem easier, in a sense, but the game itself is actually even more difficult than the first one - it's just that now you finally have hope. And just when you think hope's lost, something wonderful like an invisibility power-up appears when you free Mudokon spirits.\n\nGraphically, Abe's Exoddus is the same 2D visual wonder, much like the original or, moreover, Interplay's Heart of Darkness. Yet the graphics seem much more brilliant, as there are more environments with greater diversity in design. And the cutscenes are not only gorgeous, they're entertaining and (can I say it?) funny. No, really. Besides that, the game is quite large, and the environments are expansive. You'll have to rescue the spirits of Mudokons past; battle the typical, yet enhanced cast of Sligs, Scrabs, and the excruciatingly annoying Fleeches (long live the quick save), among others; as well as roll through the mines in mine carts and such. And sound-wise, you really can't get much better without being downright distracting. The voices of all the characters are incredible, and the effects, from getting blown up by a mine to the echoey sound of falling to your death, really can't be beat.\n\nAbe's Exoddus also has a two-player mode. While the Exoddus mainstay is clearly the single-player game, the two-player co-op mode does have charm, as you and another player take turns working your way through. When you die, your partner picks up where you left off and so forth. A bit of advice? Pick a crummy partner, and you might have some fun with this. Otherwise, the waiting game just doesn't parallel the egocentric fun of keeping this title to yourself. In all, Abe's Exoddus is a great example of how a game can stay true to its conceptual pursuit while still improving upon the original, all while keeping its soul intact. If you loved the first one, you'll like this game more. If you didn't play the first one, you can start here. If you hated the first one, it's likely because of the lack of save points, so you should definitely consider giving this series another try.","February 28, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you fancy a challenge, I would actually recommend this sequel over the original, as I found it a bit easier to get to grips with. Also, the controls have been tweaked slightly since the last game making Abe's "chant" move easier to access on the keyboard.\n\nThere are times when you'll have cracked a puzzle or found a hidden door that leave you quite pleased with yourself - this is the kind of feeling you play it for! That sense of reward, being one step closer to saving all your Mudukon chums. (And yes, I do mean ALL of them. Honestly, play the game the way it's meant to be played)\n\nAlso, I noticed a number of negative reviews referring to cutscene and freezing glitches - Guys, GET ODDPATCH!

This game has some of the BEST cutscenes, if not THE best cutscenes for the PS1 and early PC era. Gameplay is smooth, and for me, It ran without errors on my windows 8 machine, with a medium graphics card. The idea for the game is AMAZING, you play as Abe, a mudoken hero who must free his mudoken pals from soul storm brewery, and other amazingly beautiful and well designed places. The difficulty is completely fair, and, If you die, it is completely your fault, not the fault of the game or any cheap enemies, like in the last game. This game also features quick saves, possibly the best thing lovely lorne luscious lanning has ever came up with. gamespeak has been changed slightly, and a new command was added to have abe say "all a' ya!" where all of the mudokens in the room would follow, even ones in the distant background.\n\nCONS:\nWhile in some rooms, the game makes the player throw rocks at mines that cannot be disarmed. This is extremely tedious, especially when you have long rows of mines to destroy. When you set off a mine, you would expect it to set off all the surrounding ones, right? well no. You have to hit EACH ♥♥♥♥ING MINE to destroy them, and once in a blue hand moon a mine might detonate another. You can also only carry 9 rocks, and you cannot refil your bag of rocks until you throw each one. pain in the ♥♥♥. in addition, you have to release the Z key (Throwing key) after each rock you throw. if you hold it, and choose which way you want to throw it, abe will walk in that direction, towards whatever mine or bone drill you are trying to avoid\n\nThere is laughing gas in this game. Which on paper is a good concept, but in the game it can be very frustrating and unfair. First off, if one of your following mudokens is exposed to laughing gas, they go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. making you slap them to calm them down. But what usually happens, especially if you have a large following of gas-high mudokens, is you can accidentaly slap a mudoken that you have already slapped. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ him off, and he slaps you back. then you have to go and say sorry to him to calm him down. and when you're finally done with all that, one of your gas high mudokens has already ran straight into the barrel of a ♥♥♥♥ing slig.\n\nBut when you put all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t aside, you end up with one of the best games every made, and probably the best of the whole oddworld trilogy. but that is bound to change when Squeeks oddysee is released.\n","August 24, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A game cannot be bad if it held my attention for that long, it cannot even be just good if it held my attention for 6 years. There are games which I've abandoned a while ago and never tried to finish, Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a game I never trully abandoned because it was too good of a game to fully abandon, regardless of how hard I found the Vault sections (which prevented me from making any progress for years), regardless of how disheartening it was to get a bad ending on my first complete playthrough.\n\nEverything about this game is awesome, the story, the gameplay, the graphics, the characters, the voice acting, the social themes, everything. Words cannot do justice to this game, to paraphrase Morpheus: "Nobody can be told what Oddworld is, you'd have to experience it for yourself."\n\nThis is the kind of game that I love so much and I've played through so much that I can practically recite it from memory. Every person has that one game that they grew up with, the game that defined their childhood, for some it's Super Mario Bros. or Final Fantasy, for others it's Metal Gear Solid or Baldur's Gate. For me it's this game, I love this game, I love everything about this game, from its amazing stealth and platforming mechanics, to its beautiful environments that put most modern games to shame. If there's any game that I can recommend without any reservations, it's this one.\n\nAnd please do drop some money for its slightly inferior but still worthwhile predecessor Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee.

A game cannot be bad if it held my attention for that long, it cannot even be just good if it held my attention for 6 years. There are games which I've abandoned a while ago and never tried to finish, Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a game I never trully abandoned because it was too good of a game to fully abandon, regardless of how hard I found the Vault sections (which prevented me from making any progress for years), regardless of how disheartening it was to get a bad ending on my first complete playthrough.\n\nEverything about this game is awesome, the story, the gameplay, the graphics, the characters, the voice acting, the social themes, everything. Words cannot do justice to this game, to paraphrase Morpheus: "Nobody can be told what Oddworld is, you'd have to experience it for yourself."\n\nThis is the kind of game that I love so much and I've played through so much that I can practically recite it from memory. Every person has that one game that they grew up with, the game that defined their childhood, for some it's Super Mario Bros. or Final Fantasy, for others it's Metal Gear Solid or Baldur's Gate. For me it's this game, I love this game, I love everything about this game, from its amazing stealth and platforming mechanics, to its beautiful environments that put most modern games to shame. If there's any game that I can recommend without any reservations, it's this one.\n\nAnd please do drop some money for its slightly inferior but still worthwhile predecessor Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee.

Seeing British youtuber Caddicarus doing a retrospective of the first three games & saying at the end of part 3 that the games are on steam.  Well I downloaded the demo of this one & worked fine, then I bought it.\n\n\nStory:\n\nOddworld: Abe's Exoddus takes place straight after the first when Abe saved all the mudokons from Repture Farms.  After having a fall & getting knocked out that laid him to having a vision of three ghosts telling him that the Glukkons are digging up there bones.

This game takes what was already amazing in Oddworld Inhabitants' first amazing game, "Oddworld: Abes Oddysee" and improved upon them threefold, such as being able to chant creatures other than sligs, like Scrabs, Paramites and Glukkons. Words cannot explain how great the puzzle solving in this game is. Every single screen in this game is memorable, just as the first game, and is an amazing platformer. Not just out of nostalgia, but at a critical game-making point of view, I give this game a 10/10.","May 7","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(even the ones that weren't used on abe's oddysee but were there for no reason and or were re-maps of others now have actual porpuses to be there)\n+arguably more colorfull and detailed backgrounds (abe's oddysee had great alien like landscapes that felt sacred,wild,ominous and or dangerous. abe's exoddus feels more like what happens after a big company starts to forage and destroy said landscapes, now entoxicated and more rotten than what it already used to be, but still manages to add more colors and lights to make something enjoyable to stare at)\n+great cgi animations (i don't think they were improved but i had to bring it up anyways)\n+quicksaves are a thing now.\nAbe's exoddus's flawscons:\n-delayed controls, cinematic platformers have always been somewhat clunky and this one is no exception.\n-repeated trends for level design. I swear, there were at least 3 ideas that I saw getting repeated throughout the game.\n- no quickloads, meaning that if you don't save after a quicksave you might have to repeat what you just did assuming you screwed up.\nPersonal experiencethe game was super fun to play through, not only was it beautiful to look at, it also happened to be an incredible thrill ride filled satisfying puzzles, funny cutscenes and unique locales to explore.\nthe game is surprisingly long for its time and genre, ocationally the game can even be pretty spooky which is actually aplaudable for how it plays around with its sound design and ♥♥♥♥ed up imagery to mess with you, its dirty cheap and a literal steal during steam sales so please do yourself a favor and get this game.","June 21, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
