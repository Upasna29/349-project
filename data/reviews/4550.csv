The class system is amazing, allowing you to combine two out of nine mastery trees to make your own unique class with an incredible amount of customization.  You have the fully offensive, close-quarter mastery Warfare, which revolves around duel weidling weapons and becoming a whirlwind of AoE and single target damage, at the cost of defence. Ranged masteries like Hunting which allows you to deal huge amounts of damage from a distance, and debuff your enemies defences. Magic masteries such as Spirit, which allows you to drain the life from your enemies! And 6 other unique and exiting masteries.\n\nThe world is vibrant and beautiful, starting in Greece, them moving to Egypt, then China, and with the DLC, even into the domain of Hades himself! The quests while perhaps a little generic, are very fun and easy to follow, and often give satisfying rewards along with a nice chunk of EXP and Gold! Not to mention the amazing loot you will find along your journey.\n\nAll in all it is a wonderful game, one of my all time favourites, I highly reccomend checking it out. And if you enjoy it, keep an eye on Grim Dawn, a game being developed by many of the same people that made Titan Quest, it promises to be an equaly enchanting ARPG set in the Victorian times!","November 14, 2014","true","060.7"," 150 of 154 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","150","154","5","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neothaka/recommended/4550/","neothaka","Squidcake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neothaka/","365 products in account","Titan Quest, and its worthy expansion Immortal Throne is, imo, part of the holy trinity in ARPG's along side Diablo and Dungeon Siege. Titan Quests theme is unique, and the gameplay is so faithful to the principles that made diablo so great.\nThere is a massive, diverse world covered in several acts. In combination with tons of loot in the suspected qualities to keep the flow of the game intact. On top of that, the game also follows the model of increased difficulty (normal, epic, legendary), remeniscent of Diablo's normal, nightmare and hell. Each difficulty features harder monsters and better loot.\n\nIf at one point, you would get tired of the original campaign, you can try some of the fantastic mods available, especially Lilith: Battle for Jalavin (a totally newly created world which will take you up to 20 hours to complete). This mod in combination with other well known TQ mods such as Masteries mod (skill overhaul mod), gives more than enough incentive to go through the whole experience all over again with a fresh new slate.\n\nAll in all, if you are a fan of ARPG's it is a genuine crime not to have this masterpiece. The majority of the now-closed TQ studio (Iron Lore) are in the process of making a spiritual succesor named Grim Dawn (by Crate Entertainement). Given their history with TQ, this is a title to keep in mind as well and currently available through early acces on steam.\n\nClosing advice: go spend money on this, preferably as soon as possible, you will not regret it.","November 30, 2013","true","115.5"," 89 of 95 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","89","95","0","0"

It has the same well known structure through acts, a great leveling and skill system, and loot a-plenty. Even now in 2015 the game still plays well and feels smooth and fun to play. It has indeed aged well, and the graphics still does the job satisfactory today, as the aestethics makes the world a bautiful one to spend your hours in.\n\nYou should pick up this game if you like games like Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exile, Sacred, Dungeon Siege and I would even say Borderlands.\n\nThe multiplayer community seems to thriving even after all these years, so you shouldn't have too hard a time to find comrades there if that is your playstyle.\n\nFor my taste this is one of the best rpg games I've ever played.","September 20, 2015","true","18.7"," 75 of 78 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","75","78","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/4550/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Titan Quest is a refreshing experience after Diablo 3. Make no mistake: I liked Diablo 3 a lot but it was certainly a bit too casual for my taste. Titan Quest brings back the good old skill tree concept. There are no races here - you just pick the skill tree at the beginning and after several level-ups you can pick another one (the game refers to these as masteries) and as a result of this combination you will have a class.\n\nI'll give you an example: you want to be the expert of close-combat, an expert of swords and other melee weapons. You pick the mastery called Warfare for this purpose. At the same time you would like to summon spirits to aid you in combat and throw molten rocks at your enemies or utilise other earth magic spells. You pick Earth and there you go you have just become a Battle Mage. Overall, you have 9 masteries so you can guess how many combinations you can have. This gives us quite a high replayability value.\n\nOther than this the formula is pretty much the same as in Diablo:\n--the story is divided up into various Acts which all end in a boss battle\n--you have places full of enemies but you can rest in towns; these give you opportunity to pick up quests and visit vendors for purchasing / selling items you acquired by looting\n--you kill then you loot: rinse and repeat!\n--you level up and spend points on your main attributes and skills points on your skills offered by the masteries you picked\n--you get to loot many items and weapons' strength is indicated by their colour; you have legendary and set items here and you can further enhance your weapons by inserting charms and relics into them\n--while you are getting stronger you are expected to find items that add to your elemental protection\n\nOne of the criticism regarding Titan Quest was that it was too similar to Diablo. But if you have a decent system that works quite well why is it an issue to have it copied? The creators simply thought these were quite good in Diablo so they only changed the skill variety which I believe is commendable.\n\nAlso, the environment is a bit different as the game takes place in ancient Greek so you can expect monsters from that mythology. Act 4 is simply jaw-dropping with its River Styx and the City of Lost Souls.\n\nThe game was released back in 2006 and its expansion pack a year later. Still, the game looks good and it utilises Havok physics quite well. One interesting thing, though: the game does not generate a new environment once you restart it, not like in Diablo. So, should you replay it with another class or on another difficulty (these get unlocked after game completion - again, a similarity with Diablo) all environments will look similar.\n\nI liked Titan Quest. I played it after Diablo 3 and for me it was refreshing. I liked its environments with all the mythological creatures. With the 4 Acts you have at least 40-50 hours for one walkthrough on normal difficulty. I say that's quite long considering the high replayability and the multiplayer option available.\n\n","April 8, 2014","true","42.3"," 70 of 74 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","70","74","0","0"

I first played it when Titan Quest came out in 2006 (Titan Quest: Immortal Throne is simply the expansion which came out in 2007) and ended up spending hundreds, maybe thousands of hours playing it - there is simply something special about it.\n\nThe negative:\n\nThe game has some bugs that were never fixed (as Iron Lore ended up closing down before any major patches were released) but it's nothing game breaking. In addition, we're expexting some patches to come through from Nordic games in the near future.\n\nAnother aspect that is worth noting is the fact that this game has no randomization (though it didn't stop me from spending a BIG portion of my time playing it).\n\nThe positive:\n\nFirst of all, the game takes place in an alternative ancient world - the devs decided to take myths and legends from all over the world and use them as a base for the game's story and the result is astounding. Not only is the story very interesting but devs and the the voice actors did an amzing job presenting it to the player.\n\nIn addition to the enthralling story the game offers a total of 9 masteries of which you get to combine 2 in order to create a unique build to suit your personal play style (You can choose your second mastery after level 8).\n\nAnother major aspect of the game that is worth mentioning is the environments - let's just say that they are breathtaking. You can really see all the hard work that went into making this game.\n\nLast but not least, the game is long. I'm currently replaying it and at 10+ hours I haven't even gotten through Act I, and there's a total of 4 Acts + 3 difficulties!!! It's bound to keep you playing for a long time.\n\nThe conclusion:\n\nAll in all, this game has a lot to offer to those who are willing to spend some time with it. Sure, it has some bugs, but what game doesn't? And unlike most games, it offers a very solid story combined with great audio and visual effects as well as a rather unique skill system.\nI would recommend this game to any fan of the ARPG genre. It's not too late to try it out!","October 9, 2014","true","90.6"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","0"

Many will equate Titan Quest as a diablo clone, this is only one viewpoint. I felt that Titan Quest used the design philosophy of if it’s not broke don’t fix it, to the hack n slash genre. I only wish Blizzard would have approached diablo 3 in the same manner.\n\nIn titan quest players embark on a mythological quest to fell the fearsome titans. All the while collecting valuable loot on the way, which I must say is very addicting. The point and click gameplay is assessable to newcomers and veterans alike. There is also different play styles based on the different classes and class combinations in the game. This adds to the depth and replay-ability once you’ve completed the main story once.\n\nI would be remised if I didn’t touch on the soundtrack. Iron Lore produced a visually striking game for its time, but it accompanied by an outstanding soundtrack.  I highly recommend checking out the soundtrack, which unfortunately isn’t something I can do often.\n\nOne thing of note, it is strongly recommended to get the unofficial patch of the game. This fixes a number of bugs and balance issues with power sets. Unfortunately the developer had to halt patches and expansions for this game. As such the community has picked up the torch and ran with it. This speaks something about the game in its self. Not many new IPs develop a following that works to improve the game even when the developer can no longer.\n\nOverall I strongly recommend this to any diablo fans who have not checked it out, or any who didn’t quite like Diablo 3.\n\nOverall Score:  90/100\nHow Long to beat Avg: 25 hrs.

Immmortal Throne is the expansion to Titan Quest and adds graphical updates, another equipable gear slot, more quests and another ACT making it 4 ACTs in total.\n\nIf you like games like Diablo, Torchlight and Grim Dawn this is a must play through.  There are 3 different difficulties to this game.  Normal, Epic and Legendary.  You start out in Normal and once you beat ACT IV's final boss you can unlock Epic and so forth.  This game can be difficult on normal especially if you haven't planned ahead with a build in mind.  The 1st two ACTs are fairly easy, but once you reach ACT III the difficulty does start to ramp up and you may need to respec.\n\nThe following site allows you to configure a build:\n\nhttp://www.titancalc.com/\n\nYou can respec once you reach certain major cities in the game.  Once you've activated the portals to towns you can go back at any time.  Respeccing your class costs gold and you can respec your skills you've chosen, but you can not respec the mastery.\n\nMastery's are the specific class you want to be.  IE:  mage or tank class.  Skills are IE: a heal or dual wielding swords.\n\nYou can enchant your gear in the game too by finding parts of relics and charms while out in the wild killing monsters.  Collect enough and you can make a complete piece and then enchant your gear.  You can farm areas in the game and you can farm bosses too.\n\nYou don't need to install the fan patch any longer due to its current developers updating the game, but by doing so may break older MODs.  Most, if not all, of the fan patch has been implemented and fixes most known issues.  Online multiplayer works as well, but you will need to register with your email in order to play it.  Hopefully this will be patched out on launch of the official re-release so we can just use Steam instead.\n\nNordic games have bought out the rights to this game and have been updating it and have been doing a fantastic job.  Hopefully they will continue to do so to make this game more compatible with current PC's so more people can enjoy it.  Great game and extremely worth your while!!!  10/10\n\nNote:  Titan Quest has been abandoned and as such you SHOULD play Immortal Throne instead!","April 17","true","59.8"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","1"

It is rounded out by proficiently designed environments, with a lot of attention to detail and extensive references to the ancient mythologies of Greece, Egypt, Orient and China.\n\nThe add-on, in form of Immortal Throne, succeeds in expanding the mythical world of Titan Quest by continuing the story across the dark and more sinister Underworld of Hades. Furthermore it introduces a couple of new weapons, and one additional skill class for the original game. It is a textbook case of a great expansion.\n\nThe only shortcoming is the total lack of level randomization, making the game very linear on each of the three difficulties.

(Diablo 1-on-1, haha)\n- TQ:IT came with an unbalanced class mastery called Dream, and any class combination towards Dream are extremely overpowered. (after you go Dream you never go back, every single combination without it feels pathetic, but there are mods that partially corrects those problem, all unofficial)\n- Farming itens can be annoying since you can drop level 5 "rare" gear in a level 20+ area. (you see the rarity, happiness explodes, and than you see the item is so underlevel its useless no matter how rare it is, unhappiness implodes)\n- Storyline is mediocre.\n- No character customization at all.\n\nWith all this i would certainly recommend this game, its at least a 8/10 for sure, and every time a sale comes up, you can buy the Gold Edition almost for free.","April 26","true","125.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","12","12","5","1"

The main problem, it is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get this thing working, more for that further.\n\nPros:\n\n- "Real" places in game and lore based on ancient mythology, making it easier to relate and provides greater immersion (for those at least who actually have studied history) Aesthetically good looking areas, items, characters.\n\n- Very nice graphics, especially for its release date. Zoomable camera. Not too cartoonish, even for standards today it can compete.\n\n- Large amount of playable classes who are created by combining two skill trees, abundance of different resistances, damage types, stats. Plethora or supported mods.\n\nCons:\n\n- This game got a huge problem with screen tearing. Not FPS. Even with Vsync forced and 50 FPS damn camera hiccups are still there, although not that nauseating to look at. It is a big thing as in there you have to move around a lot.\nYou have to downgrade your graphics for the best effect, especially shadows and detail level, that worked for me. Some say, forcing single core and putting save file to another partition and then linking it back to "My Games" folder fixes it.\nActually nothing fixes it completely, regardless or your hardware or what you configure, it is just how this game was made, you can only minimize that to somewhat tolerable amount.\n\n- Beta patch makes this game to crash. Keep that in mind if you want to use it. 3rd person camera mod does not work with Steam version.\n\n- Game lacks auto-cast, for targeted abilities unless it is on mouse you have to push button, target and click to cast. It is forgivable for such old game and not that big of a deal.\n\nSummary\n\nI would put this game "Neutral" rating considering how amazing is the game itself and how epic fail is the technical part. Considering that it is possible to solve issues and make it in a reasonably playable state, I put Recommended.","May 16","true","19.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Do not get me wrong, some of my favorite games of all time are extremely long. The story, gameplay and class mechanics do not captivate one nearly long enough to play for the absurd amount of time it takes to complete this game...\n\nApparently there are mods for this (didn't know this at the time) so that probably makes it less tedious through and through. But damn, how many times do the developers expect me to bait and kill before I can just move on to the next zone? One can say this is a fairly difficult hack and slash, where you need to allocate your build points wisely or you'll find yourself at a disadvantage, quick.\n\nBack to my point, the game is just ridiculously long. There is a abundance of different class styles to try, yet I only was able to try one of them, because by the time I had beaten the game, only a gun pointed straight at my head would compel me to launch it again, and start all over.

At almost 10 years old, this game still looks and plays absolutely great.  The ability to multi-class is unique in the genre, and it adds quite a bit of depth to the game.  The environments and music do a good job portraying the fabled cities of humanity, as the game leads the player through ancient Greece, China, and more.  The Immortal Throne expansion adds an entire chapter to the game's questline, while also augmenting the existing chapters with new loot types.  IT is to TQ what LoD was to Diablo 2.  This game is a classic, and one of the few that has aged well enough to still be a blast to play.","February 14, 2014","true","38.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I found TQ and its expansion to be absolutely my most memorable and favorite experience of all hack n slash RPG games to date.  Some reasons behind this:\n\n-The lore and history of the game was actually interesting and exciting\n-The classes were the most fun about the game, and how you will fine-tune your class-combo skills\n-The enemies were interesting and fun to kill\n\nThe stuff that put it on par with Diablo was the graphics, sound, and itemization.  The part that put it below Diablo was it's multiplayer features, which were almost non-existent comparing to Battle.net features.\n\nHowever, granted playing with other people, just playing through this game once with varying class combos was extremely fun.  Who doesn't like a Gladiator style Spartan with spear/shield, bashing through enemies (literally) in cool combat animations?  Or a Conqueror with dual gladius wielding action.  This game took ancient history (ala Rome 2 Total War) and put it into an action RPG.\n\nBe warned though, that this game will most likely feel dated with today's graphic standards, but it still does look good for a hack n slash RPG.","December 29, 2013","true","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The graphics are realistic and attractive, and the GUI is the most polished of any ARPG to date.\n\nGameplay is 70-100 hours, depending on which character class you play. The quest is long, and it tells a great story.\n\nOne word of caution. Seek out and install fan patch 1.17a (or greater). It fixes a technical glitch in the Immortal Throne chapters that creates a runaway CPU problem on modern computers. It's at a critical point in the game, and can't be ignored. As I understand it, the developers were terminated shortly after the Expansion was released, which means there was no official bug patch. Fortunately, the fan patch exists to clean up this and a few other issues related to character skills. It is an excellent patch, and 100% compatible with the Steam version of this game.","January 4, 2011","true","88.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game has beautiful visuals, great atmosphere music, tons of variety of weapons, gears and enemies. Story line is really simple and poor, but it’s “hack and slash“ after all, don’t look for a deep story in Titan Quest. Anyway there are lots of references to ancient story, to gods, heroes and creatures we know from books and movies. Titan Quest has one noticeable minus: the game is not really hard, at least in company with friends, it reminds me of Borderlands in co-op and I like the challenge games.","October 3, 2012","true",""," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is an add-on, but improves on the original game plus adds some levels. I didn't realize this and played the original game first.\n\nThis is an Action RPG, which is apparently the genre created by Diablo, where you hack & slash a bunch of enemies, level up, and collect tons of loot. The Greek setting makes the game and enemies interesting, although you still get some enemies like undead and ghosts. The story quests and voice-over are decent and make for a nice progression, though these games are more about killing and loot.\n\nMy main gripe is that the final bosses are much harder than the other enemies. You may get to the end and find that you simpy cannot beat the final boss with cheating or grinding levels.

It's clearly cut from the same cloth as Diablo 2, quite intentionally. Despite that, there's really something enjoyable here that makes it rise above its predecessors. Maybe it's the sense of open world that provides a feeeling of exploration. Maybe it's the parade of small towns and a sense of a real place deriving from its real-world setting. I can't really put my finger on it, but it engages me in a way that the original did not. The skill trees also seem simulataneously a bit more deep, and yet without so many useless skills as the original.\n\nDiablo 2 was heavy on randomization and this is not -- but for a first playthrough it seems the superior experience.","May 22, 2014","true","155.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, is very much a game of this decade, featuring real time day and night cycles, advanced lighting, great animations, and ragdoll physics. In that sense, Titan Quest's gameplay feels like it's from another era, but it's engine feels very up to date. This can make a for a very engaging experience if you're looking for an old school action RPG to get addicted to for a while. The game looks great, sounds great, and packs in hours of gameplay and fun, as it features three levels of difficulty meant to be unlocked and played in order to get even better loot, and online play which is very fun if you have friends playing the game with you on skype and whatnot. All of this set in ancient greek times to accurate mythology (for the most part).\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is incredibly repetitive, none of the characters are at all memorable, and certain game mechanics simply feel counter intuitive. For example, the randomized loot system is fun, but i really don't want to spend 50 hours completing a suit of armor which by that point is utterly useless. The game demands a massive time requirement which I am not always willing to yield. Also, the system of collecting relic shards to enchant armor and the inability to enchant rare armor (which is usually the best) is very frustrating.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to fans of action rpgs, but fans of different types of RPGs (The Elder Scrolls) or shooters and RTS' may find this game tough to get into.","December 31, 2013","true","96.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CodeJohnny/recommended/4550/","CodeJohnny","Junior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CodeJohnny/","247 products in account","So I'll start off by saying, stop reading the comparisons to Diablo, Diablo II, Dungeon Siege.  This game stand alone, they did a fantastic job making their own beast, and those things they changed are far BETTER than those other games, and they did it with a smaller Dev crew (entire company 39 at peak?), which is awesome.  Yes you're going to read about 100 reviews that say "if you liked Diablo then", but I say stop comparing, if you want something fun, try this with your friends, you will have a few awesome weekends, of "holy crap that awesome", and "Dude that was Epic".\n\nWhat does this game have?\nYou will not be locked into, you are a mage, you cannot wear armor, you have a sword, you must use a shield, or you cannot cast spells as well, you and your friends will choose multiple combinations, of classes to make a solid character.  You will probably have quite a lot of fun if you try magic and swords, shields and of of several classes of magic, or dual wielding damage with damage top, for a character that punches wholes through armies, but explodes if his friend doesn't soak some, but you'll still have a blast doing it.\n\nYou will travel through farm lands, marshes, mountains, and centaur filled lands, fighting off undead, starting by saving simple farmer's "horse", and working your way up to the entire land from great evils.  You'll find that the lands are vast and far more realistic than most you have played in before, including hundreds of caves, marshes and forrests.  You'll find yourself trying to remember your ancient great gods as you see more names you may recall from your studies, "if not you are sad, and I no longer wish to speak with you..." - Sir Hammerlock\n\nWhat you will not find in this game\nThe Item system has your typical Magics, Rares, Sets and Uniques.  You will not however be searching for 500 hours to find that one uber set that you must have to be the ultimate power, because they are not the best items in the game, the random greens are superior in the right combinations, but the set items are still fun to hunt, save up, trade with friends and wear.  You will not find yourself required to do every side quest, if that is not your cup of tea, you do not have to do it.  You will not find yourself in a diablo3 100% linear map with no options, as I mentioned earlier the maps are Vast with huge sections that can take you and your friends hours to truly explore all of them, between any two save points if you truly want to explore it all.\n\nUltimately, you can comapre all day, but this game kicks complete butt on Story, Execution, and Fun, it is unique several different ways, and you should get it find out for yourself why it requires follow-up.  The people that made this deserve your examiniation and this was truly a master piece for it's time, give feedback yourself, and most importantly have fun.","May 4, 2014","true","216.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

If you like the game genre, you'll love Titan Quest. The game start off rather slowly and it takes a while for you to pick up the pace and get involved into the narrative. By "a while" I mean some five or six hours. Yeah.\n\nBut once the game kicks in, it's awesome. You'll be able to pick two classes out of nine available (or focus on only one, your choice) and that alone makes for a great build variety. Leveling up, defeating enemies and looting feels great and rewarding, but if you ♥♥♥♥ up badly on your build, no amount of items will make up for it, so plan your build ahead or get some advice off the internet.\n\nOh, and be prepared to play some 30-40 hours to beat the game in a single dificulty. I decided not to keep going, but I can imagine that beating the game 3 times would take more than a hundred hours, so we could say the game will be well worth the money. You get to kill things all the way from Greece, going through Egypt, Macedon and China, from the top of Olympus all the way down to Hades's Underworld. It's a great athmosphere if you're into mythology.\n\nAbout the cons, I could say that some enemies are ridiculously overpowered and can kill you easily, depending on your resistances, while boss fights will be a breeze. I managed to kill all the game's bosses and mini-bosses without dying, but some random monsters hit killed me, that happened at least twice per Act. Not to meantion that some enemies will span atacks that keep you stunned, and we all know how much that sucks. Still, once you git a little gud, you'll have a blast all the way from start to finish.\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nSoundtrack - 5/10\nGraphics - 5/10\nContent - 6/10\nChallenge Level - 7/10\nReplayability - 8/10","July 17, 2014","true","38.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As soon as the new act begins, you will notice that your enemies are much tougher here. The addition of caravans, artifacts, and enchanters make this expansion a must-have. There is also a new skills mastery that was added, which in turn adds eight new playable character classes. All in all, Immortal Throne completes Titan Quest in all fathomable ways. The new hero monsters and bosses are also more difficult, and a few of them even boasts creepy voice actors. There are a couple long-winded quests that were added, as well as a frustrating one. If this is the intended difficulty on the Normal level, I have no interest in playing in the more difficult settings. The difficulty can be quite overwhelming at times. Especially with the ill-conceived save system, forcing one to only use rebirth fountains. In the end, Immortal Throne should be considered part of Titan Quest, and not a mere expansion. It truly brings finality to the story, and leaves you with a sense of accomplishment. The end credits music did not fit the setting of the game at all, as it was a bad Metal song.\n\nTitan Quest - Immortal Throne is great.","March 20, 2014","true","67.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It adds some new quests, some new classes, some new monsters and ups the level cap. And that's about it. You have to pay close attention to even realize you are playing the expansion and not the main game.\n\nSomething to strongly keep in mind is that this expansion takes place after the original campaign, meaning that if you don't happen to have a save game ready where you have beaten the campaign then you'll have to do that before you can access the new content. Not exactly a good way to entice newcomers to the franchise.\n\nThe new class, or Mastery as it's called in the game is pretty much the same as the other masteries. Some damage abilities, some damage boosting abilities. Nothing really to care about and nothing that will really have that great of an impact on your game.\n\nA number of convenience have found their way into the game as well, powerful spell scrolls that let you bypass a little grind and Caravans, or banks as the rest of us call them, that lets you store and access items across the various maps. Both are nice additions but not exactly big enough that they'd warrant an complete expansion pack.\n\nThen there are the artefact's. The new uber weapons of Immortal Throne that require you to find a number of crafting items as well as a recipe in order to access their power. A nice addition but unfortunately because of their rarity they only really come into play in the late late game, when you are just grinding to max level and equipment.\n\nAll in all Immortal Throne is what I'd called a standard expansion pack. It adds a little there, improves a little here but does nothing really out of the ordinary and like some of similar expansion packs you probably won't even notice whether it's there or not.","January 15, 2013","true","114.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Genetic_Dust/recommended/4550/","Genetic_Dust","Genetic_Dust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Genetic_Dust/","1299 products in account","Amazing game. Pulled off an original take on the Hack 'n' Slash genre. Similar to Diablo in a few ways, but they definitely pulled the class development and items in a new and different direction. I've literally spent hundreds of hours on my dozen varied characters and haven't gotten tired of the combinations yet!\n\nThe class system uses a unique system that lets you choose two separate classes from a list of eight. This essentially allows you to create over 25 unique character types. Not only that, but how you choose to develop those classes you choose will greatly impact how you play the game. Even for a one-character playthrough, if you actually complete every quest and side-mission, there is probably about 40 hours of solid gameplay! Not to mention, as many other dungeon crawlers have done before, there are three separate playthroughs of varying difficulty with new items and monsters.\n\nThere are a few cons however. The game was never fully completed before release, and fan-made patches are required to make some of the in-game elements work properly (i.e.: time-delay effects and such are broken). I actually was to level 25 with a character who was speializing in time mechanics before I realized that the effects weren't working.\n\nAdditionally, the game can sometimes be buggy. The physics work very well most of the time, and there's nothing more fun than power-hitting a weak enemy and watching the hilarious ragdoll physics ensue. However, sometimes these glitches can be funny, and sometimes they make you have to restart the level. The good news is that in over 400 hours of gameplay, I've only had to restart once due to an error.\n\nLastly, some character builds just don't pan-out and you have to reinvest your skill points elsewhere. I had this happen with a minion-based character, and I had this happen with an elemental melee-attack character.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game for the fun co-op you can have, the fact that it's built differently than Diablo II but is just as much fun, and the classic Greek mythology involved in the plot!","December 30, 2013","true","375.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has never crashed, lagged or glitched on me. The fights get more challanging as you go on, which makes the game really fun.  There are alot of items that make this game special you can get charms, merge them for bigger charms or use them in artifacts. Some monsters drop these charms like boars and birds. There is a trading area backpack. so when you find a cool item and wish you could use it on a different character you can transfer it over. There is a handy teleport to town button you can use anytime and it is free you dont have to buy scrolls or such. You teleport to town, go back in teleporter and return to the spot you were at. If you want a game that totally loose track of time in and love . This is it!","December 16, 2013","true","182.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fun with friends if you can get them to play, but gets lonely pretty fast by yourself.  Very enjoyable the first time through with large maps and plenty of hacking and slashing, but due to lack of procedural generation it's not the best for multiple playthroughs.

A throwback to the original Diablo and Diablo II.  It is challenging enough that leveling up feels like a major accomplishment, but not so overwhelmingly difficult that you give up.  I really like the flexibility in setting up your characters.  There are literally hundreds of different paths you can follow.  Immortal Throne is a marked improviment over the original due to the storage caravan and new Dream mastery.  It is worth the few extra dollars.

I just wished I had got it sooner.\n\nIt plays very much like Diablo and Torchlight. It is set in Greece (to begin with) and is themed around the era of Titans, Gods and the like. The setting is spot on, the graphics are surprisingly good and the game itself is a pleasure to play.\n\nYou have a multitude of options to go with on your character. You get 9 "masteries" to choose from, however, at level 8 you get to add an additional mastery if you want, further customising your character. This means a total of 81 class combinations, not to mention all the hundreds of skills to choose from, or attributes to assign.\n\nIt also comes with multiplayer and a level editor, breathing yet more life into what looks like a large game.\n\nSo, what's not to like? Erm, I really am struggling on this one. No random levels? That's all I can come up with.\n\nThis game is a solid action-RPG that I would recommend to anyone interested in the genre.\n\nJimbo Rating: 8/10","January 14, 2014","true","51.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A throwback to the original Diablo and Diablo II.  It is challenging enough that leveling up feels like a major accomplishment, but not so overwhelmingly difficult that you give up.  I really like the flexibility in setting up your characters.  There are literally hundreds of different paths you can follow.  Immortal Throne is a marked improviment over the original due to the storage caravan and new Dream mastery.  It is worth the few extra dollars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KronusX/recommended/4550/","KronusX","KronusX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KronusX/","266 products in account","Product received for free\n\nTitan Quest is one of those hidden jewels that was released in 2006 and followed with an expansion in 2007. The game was developed by Iron Lore, a company that changed its name later to Crate Entertainment and released the popular Grim Dawn.\n\nOne of the most obvious features you will notice in the game is the Diablo-esque feeling from the beginning until the end. The game is essentially a hack and slash in a mythological world focused on the usual ‘’Defeat the great evil’’ throughout a couple of interesting locations such as Greece, Egypt, China and even Mount Olympus. The attention to details is striking and the game succeeds quite well at keeping you hooked up for hours. The game succeeds even further into showing details based on the enemies you kill which take form of the mythological creatures in every world, such as satyrs and cyclops in Greece or scorpions and alligator warriors in Egypt.\n\nThe customization menu at the menu is pretty simplistic, the options being the Character’s name, the gender and the tunic color, but where the game really shines is the skills customization in the game. Once you hit level 2, you have option to pick out of the skill trees available in game where you can choose the skills you would like to invest in. The beauty of the game is in the ability to pick a second tree at level 10 which enables you to pick a second tree and cross-breed abilities in order to make fantastic combos. I personally played a Soothsayer, a combination of Nature and Spirit focused on summoning pets and walking around with two wolves, a dryad and a lich king destroying my opponents. The customization in-game goes even further when you realize that many times you can combine runes that drop from monsters to make powerful enchants to add to your armor. To push the customization even further, the game has recipes where you can combine three specific enchanting items to make an even stronger one.\n\nThe game’s difficulty depends on the player’s choice on the skills taken which of course makes the game easier or harder but it also depends on the difficulty level or the specific area of the game which the player is experiencing. For instance, my summoner was doing well at 2-15, and it became weaker and weaker until level 20 and then started getting a bit better in terms of the survival of the pets.\n\nThe game’s massive amount of skills gives the game a ton of replayability if you can handle the hack and slash nature of the game (it is definitely not a game for everyone). The length of the game is quite big as well, I am only in chapter two after spending about 10 hours in game and there are at least a couple more chapters, which makes the game much longer than diablo 2 was. The sound of the game is amazing and manages to capture the area in the game, for instance while being in Greece you hear the usual war-like sounds and while being in Egypt there is the thematic Egyptian music which makes the game even more enjoyable.\n\nIf you are willing to put time into the steam workshop, you will also find a lot of mods for Titan quest, such as Underlord that make the game 10x as better and will offer you even more hours to spend on the game.\n\nI did encounter a couple of tiny issues as well. For instance, every time you teleport the framerate drop considerably to 9. In the same time, my summons sometimes had a buggy pathing where they would get stuck in a specific fence and sometimes would switch from aggressive mode into passive. Some steam users also reported some issues into making the game work on the newer computers (the game is 10 years old after all).\n\nOverall, I would say that for such an ancient game, the developers achieved an amazing job and I would definitely recommend this game to any hack and slash fan (extra points if you are a Greek mythology fan such as myself). Despise all its issues, Titan quest is an excellent game to enjoy and is worth every penny.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over tohttp://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group\n\n\n\n","May 31","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Titan Quest is unique in that it has one of the best replay values I have found in a game. Titan Quest: Immortal Throne expounds upon that and gives you and even longer game, with more levels, items, and even another class which further increases the myriad of combinations of classes that you can play as.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very well done and I find the graphics beautiful. There are plenty of suprises that keep it interesting during the first playthrough. There are also a large amount of items ranging from rusty pieces of metal to legendary weapons that make you feel like a god while killing gods. You may think that because the maps never fluctuate on the next playthroughs that it would get old, but the developers thought of that too. They add seemingly impossibly hard bosses to keep the game interesting. Even if you find that it isn't, you can always start a new game and try a new combination of classes for a completely different gaming Experience.\n\n11/10","July 1, 2014","true","195.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played it a couple of years back and I played it a lot. I am a real sucker for ancient mythology and this game delivers just that, but with you as the hero. On top of that I am a fan of the oldschool expansion style when you received a lot of content for your money. And Immortal Throne takes the base game, adds what felt missing and slaps a new campaign on top of it all (along with 1 new mastery and loads of new items)! Overall the expansion still has that epic feel of fighting legendary ancient enemies and the atmosphere/visuals in the new chapter are even better. The only thing I can think of that bothered me is that the expansion enemies felt a bit weaker than the previous ones, probably due to overleveling your character before you get there. But apart from this there is nothing that comes to mind that I do not like about this game and it's expansion.

Fun game to exlore and run through but let's be honest here. After couple of hours you have pretty much seen it all. Kill everything you see and hope for better gear. The boss fights didn't even require any tactic to beat. Just click them to death. Most of the time the game was too easy and the only place which gave us trouble was the last level in the original game. Kinda wished the game had ended there. After 25 hours I was kind of bored of the game anyway. I guess I have to force myself through the expansion to clear the game. Don't get me wrong. It's not really a bad game. Just pretty boring one. I can't even imagine myself playing it through without any friends. In my opinion the game needed more boss fights and some phases to them and of course more rewarding loot. In the end I didn't even care to loot anything. I have no idea if the game is any better on harder difficulty but right now I can't see myself playing it through again.","January 31, 2015","true","27.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Probablemente mucho, pero vamos a tratar de decir lo importante:\n\nPersonalmente, amo este juego, por las horas de diversión que tuve con él cuando era chico, y que aun a mis 17 años sigo teniendo, porque la historia es muy buena, y principalmente, por haber sido el juego que me introdujo a la mitología griega, y por el que terminé devorando varios libros de esta (Figuradamente), y habiendo leido de dicho tema, el juego, salvo en algunos aspectos, es extremadamente fiel a ella, pero bueno.\nVayamos al juego en sí: Muchísimas maestrías y builds que hacer, aparte de que el loot es mejor con cada dificultad es algo que le da un enorme valor de rejugabilidad, que es algo que es más bien presente en casi todos los ARPGs, y también unos gráficos que incluso hoy, son bastante buenos, y le dan una estética apropiada al juego son probablemente las razones por las que ha envejecido tan bien.\nEn cuanto a performance, salvo por un par de partes del juego en las que el framerate se cae al carajo por problemas de los archivos mismos (Torre Del Juicio, y Sala de Cristales justo antes del Trono de Hades), el juego puede correr a unos estables 60 FPS, o más, incluso en PCs desactualizadas. Esto puede mejorarse por medio del fanpatch 1.17, que pueden descargarlo de por ahí.\n\nEn fin. Si te gustan juegos orientados a la mitología griega, con buena historia, fidelidad a esta, y con valor de replay, entonces este es una gema. Le doy un sólido 10.\n\nPD: Es una lástima que THQ haya quebrado. No tenemos Titan Quest 2 por eso ;_;","December 30, 2015","true","36.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","2"

It's true that the maps aren't random, meaning there's a bit less replay value than you're used to in similar games. But every flower has been placed with purpose, and the art in general (and the foliage in particular) looks breathtaking. Since it's a little older now, crank up those shadows and reflections that you couldn't before. Plus, the deep skill trees and unique item sets (with bonuses) do add to the replay factor. One thing to keep in mind if you get the expansion from the get go: don't bother playing the original game (I think I turned mine on and off once, just to be safe.) The way Steam's set up, you only get access to the new features like the bank if you're playing through Immortal Throne; I think it might also mess up game sharing if folks are on the older version. Don't delete the orginal since the second's only an expansion, but hide it away so you don't play it by accident.","July 15, 2011","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spectreSD/recommended/4550/","spectreSD","spectreSD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spectreSD/","212 products in account","I can sum up this game in one word: tedious.\n\nI realize this game has a strong following, so I'll probably get a lot of "not helpful" votes, but I found this game to be a chore. It's just too much of the same thing over and over again for 50 hours. I rarely say this about a game, but it's far too big for what it is. It's not particularly challenging (save the infuriating one-hit kill bosses), but death has no real punishment regardless. You lose some XP (some of perhaps all of which you can recover if you make it back to where you died), and that's it. None of the enemies even respawn as a result of dying. Then the checkpoints are so far apart you'll find yourself having to run through empty areas just to get back to where you were. Worse yet, half of the side quests are fetch quests, so you'll be backtracking a lot to turn them in. This could have been remedied with more portals for fast traveling, or at least putting checkpoints before those cheap bosses. I died less than 20 times in the 50 hours it took me to clear this game, but it still felt like I spent a lot of time running through the poorly laid out levels, now devoid of enemies.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't plenty of enemies. My kill count was over 20K in the end. It is just a shame each area is overflowing with one or two kinds of enemies. There are a fair amount of varieties throughout the game, but each long area feels like a genocide of an entire species.\n\nThe game also suffers from loot fatigue. You will find yourself leaving 99% of all drops behind. Money is too easy to come by (although it is rare when something is worth buying anyway). Crafting is convoluted and mostly a waste of time.  I had so many leftover relics by the end of the game it was silly.\n\nThen there's the lack of interesting story and characters (which is amazing considering it pulls heavily from Greek mythology and has you traveling from Greece to Egypt, Babylon, China, and a couple realms of the gods). It all just kind of feels the same, despite the different look to each place, and since you do almost nothing but kill and sort your inventory, you never get a sense of purpose beyond just pushing forward.\n\nI feel like the game expects you to grind, and that's never fun. Instead, just roll with whatever decent drops you find and you won't have a hard time winning. If only there was something more to the combat than equpping the highest damage weapons and clicking. Maybe my Haruspex was poor choice on that front, but I somehow doubt any other class would have been much more interesting.\n\nI unlocked Epic mode after it was finally over, but I see no reason to do a NG+ when I was bored the entire back half of my first run. This game had all the makings of a good game, minus the fun. Honestly, it plays with all the shallowness of a mobile game.","September 20, 2015","false","53.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","3"

What can I say, I installed this and I got hooked. I think its a pretty good action RPG. I really liked the setting, amount of exploration and the amount of skill/class choices.\n\nThe game is huge, in my opinion, a little bit too huge. It takes about an hour to get a level up if you explore and kill everything after the first few levels. So yeah - the progression is slow.\n\nThat's a little bad for me right now because I have to play through the games I've bought - I'll probably have to quit after a while and continue later.\n\nIt's worth the money though, for sure, if looking at gameplay hours, I find it better than Path of Exile or Diablo 3. Of course, it doesn't get on Dungeon Siege's level - maybe it would if the multiplayer was still available.. now it's not.\n\n\n9/10 because its long, maybe even too long, its also complex and gives you alot of choices -- but the multiplayer is no longer available due to the publishing company going bankrupt.","May 7, 2013","true","11.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Given that this was a "holdover" game for the people that actually enjoyed it, it's questionable as anything but an artifact for a collection 8 years later.\n\nSome of the production value is nice.  The songs are pretty, the voice acting is decent, and the environments are okay.  I keep hearing the graphics are good, at least for the time that it came out.\n\nThe UI has problems.  A control system for the game's many pets is virtually non-existent.  You cannot auto-sort the loot in storage.  The maps are terrible.  Using the quickslot bar seems to have unnecessary lag, but that could just be my imagination.  A "junk" button for inventory loot would have been incredibly welcome.\n\nI plowed through enemies until the end of Act 1, where I met a boss that seemed designed specifically to destroy my toon.  I was running a pure pet build, and let's just say it was impossible for my character to beat that boss in his current state.  The game allows you to respec skills (but not ones put into your mastery level of your two chosen disciplines), and with respawning enemies and chests you could grind your way through just about anything.  I could fix things, but I discovered I didn't want to.\n\nThere are many character builds, and you can pick two masteries (think classes) and combine them together.  There are no synergistic skills.  There are however skills that are viewed as useless and simply "bad builds" under the right circumstances/fights, which I don't think is acceptable for a game of this sort.  Should you stumble across these dead-ends, you can look up guides as necessary, but the game doesn't inspire you to do so.\n\nThe plot... Well...  The word is it was based on the 12 labors of Hercules.  The game is of course almost entirely about Greek mythology, which is exactly the problem - you've read stories or seen movies on most of the things you're going to do in the game.  There are literally almost no surprises whatsoever.  No likeable characters are put forward, including your own.  I kept waiting for the story to become interesting, and it simply never did.  The enemies were uninspired and the AI equally so.  I envisioned dozens of hours of this slogfest (which I've heard becomes much more grindy), of ridiculous piles of almost always useless loot, an endlessly bland experience the game does not seem to want to redeem in other ways.\n\nI still want to believe that there's a good game underneath TQ's inherent apathy, but in this day and age of Torchlight 2, or Diablo 3, or Divinity: Original Sin, I really can't recommend the game to anyone who isn't either a collector of the genre, or simply hasn't played everything else.","September 29, 2015","false","20.0"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

This problem started after updating to windows 10.\n\nWindows 10 compatability is not optional ... it is mandatory as windows 10 is the de-facto standard.\n\nRevised rating 0 / 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitan Quest Gold is one of those games I keep coming back to ... there is so much flexibility in the skill tree that allows re-playing to have a different feel based on class and skill choices.\n\nGame graphics was state of the art at the time of the game's release, and still is pretty decent even by today's standards.  The base game (Titan Quest 2006) supports up to 1600x1200, and the expansion (Immortal Throne 2007) adds support for 1920x1080 resolution.  Animation and textures are really well implemented.  The grass waves as your character runs through it, and your character even leaves footprints in desert sands or ripples when running through water areas.\n\nVoice acting is adequate, but the player will still be reading many chat bubbles.  There are some well researched ♥♥♥-bits of mythology and lore randomly seeded via non-core NPC characters which all add to the level of immersion and provide a contextual framework.\n\nRe-spawn points are well placed on the whole.  The game feels open-world, but actually just has really wide lanes and a linear progression with several paths and side-quest areas.  Items are fairly well balanced, but the game is definitely kinder to aggressive melee than it is to other ability choices.  Playing as a caster or ranged requires more planning and tactical play, which provides a greater level of challenge and more of a sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe game runs really well in both single player and multi-player on current gen equipment (2013/14) under Windows 7 with up-to-date drivers.  At the time of writing this review Titan Quest does not appear to be supported under Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 for Multi-player.  The game appears to scale well when more performance hardware is thrown at it, but will run well enough on Windows XP on legacy hardware as this is what I had when the game first launched.\n\nTitan Quest is a polished product and the game really comes into it's own with the Immortal Throne expansion.  Titan Quest is a true classic well worth playing.  I would rate the game higher, but it does have some minor flaws such as the standard inventory tetris common among nearly all isometric view action RPG titles available at the time of it's release.\n\nRating 9.8 / 10","January 6, 2013","false","254.1"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","2"

This game nothing standing for it except mythology and skill tree. Other reviewers already told majority of points, but I will add most significant one. This game does not respect your time and thinks that you are either a morron or a noob. It locks you at normal mode which is brain dead easy. Level design obviously wanted to include mini bosses in corners of the map, but due to difficulty setting you encounter nothing, but empty space. Also, I'm not obliged to value this game on its potential. I played 13 hours of vannila with no end in sight. This far more than enough time for a game to suck me in. All I got is extremely boring and easy combat, no real loot (majority of items are either white or yellow which are equally worthless. You will get single decent item which might last you up to 10 hours...). Due to how poorly designed this game is, I do not reccomend it. Buy a better game in this category and you will find more enjoyement by far less investment in whatever potential this game might unravel.\n\nIn the end, if you wish to play Titan quest, start with Soulvizier. It fixes game instead of developers. From a start I was almost killed by group of crows, it forces you to be careful. It redesigns skill tree, add new skills. It vastly expands game, increases number of mobs who althought will make your progress slow and it adds way better mini bosses and mobs across the board. It's must play mod if you even consider jumping to Titan quest. Trust me, in vanilla you will be locked to normal mode who is so easy that you can die only then you stop paying attention or in stupid difficulty curve who jumps and go back down. With this mod game become alive to me, I could actually play and enjoy it instead of hopping it getting better and more challening later.","July 10, 2015","false","26.0"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","15","0","7"

Two things make it very difficult for me to even complete the game: (1) Too many passives abilities vs active abilities make you feel less in control of the combat, (2) Potions have no cooldown, so the only strategy you need to employ is having enough potions for any given fight.\n\nBecause of that the combat feels bland and repetitive from quite an early point in the game, and I just can't be bothered to finish it.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics are quite good. Combat feels nice and responsive, especially with the weight added by the physics engine. The story is okay, with decent voice acting. The skill trees are interesting, especially as you can combine any two core classes.\n\nI'm looking forward to Grim Dawn, the spiritual successor to Titan Quest from the same developers.

This allows for a huge number of different gameplay experiences.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csbears/recommended/4550/","csbears","Csbears","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csbears/","433 products in account","With the hype that surronded D3's launch and Path of Exile launching i decided to take a blast to the past and try out a game thats been on my steam list for as long as i can remember.  Upon installing TQ: IT it said that the game could not run without the original TQ installed....alright whatever ill install it too just to try this game out.  The game completely bugs out with all of the buttons screwed up and only showing the background of the start screen.  Checking out the steam forums i find the solution to my woes by deleting a few files and ♥♥♥♥ing around with a script editor.  Start up the game for real this time and finally start playing this ancient relic and remembering that this was a game reviewed on X-Play on G4 back in the day.\n\nIm sad to say that through all of this i dont think it was worth the hassle i went through to get the game to even work properly and heres why:\n\n1.) The Combat is clunky as dog ♥♥♥♥ - Compared to diablo 2's fluid and bloody combat that made you feel like your attacks were not only connecting but had unique death animations ( with gore ) to show you what your character was doing. TQ felt more like your "hero" was hitting (and getting hit) with a pool noodle until somebody fell over from exhaustion with no blood or visual que.\n\n2.) The Skill Trees - When you put a point into a skill tree its supposed to make you feel more powerful and give you some kind of ability to do more with your character.  To even progress with your skill tree you have to put points into a side bar to access said skills (32 points maximum into the sidebar).  Not only does this take AWAY from the action it also elongates the amount of time it takes to get into the more fun abilities.  The skills add nothing bombastic or as fun as a Barbarians Whirlwind or a Paladins Blessed Hammers  or anything interesting...what you get are passives and things to boost your auto attacks.\n\n3.) The Gear - Progressing through the games "Acts" you would expect to have to change out entire sets of gear for something new that makes all the grinding worth while.  That is simply not the case....I am in Act 4 with mostly level 3 and 8 gear being worn on my Warrior/Champion with no forseeable change,  Most likely you wont even get good drops from monsters but instead the trader in town has better quality gear than any mob you will ever kill.  So you will ultimately end up just hording gold so that you can just buy the gear yourself, which again, takes away from the combat.\n\n4,) The Leveling -  As you complete quests and go through the story your character will more than likely out level the enemies you are facing.  This is a problem because you will have to kill two or three times the amount of enemies just to get the same amount of experience as if they were scaled to your level.\n\n5.) The Mobs - In Diablo 2 as you fought your way down into the Barraks / Catacombs of the first Act you see many mobs that either do poison or fire damage which makes any sane person grab a few pieces of gear with those two resistances on them. This all culminates with fighting Andariel who does surprise surprise ♥♥♥♥ tons of poison and fire damage. After beating Andariel and going to Act 2 you will also find many enemies doing poison damage and reinforcing the idea that your decision to invest in some resistance gear was a good one. While in TQ its true that the acts all have their specific mob types and stay true to the mythology they are NOT fun to fight against and dont have that special something that ties them all together like some kind of elemental damage or special attack.\n\nWhat you end up with is just a cluster♥♥♥♥ of poor design decisions that make you feel more like you are a kid mashing action figures together and desperately trying to use their imagination to fill in the blanks in the vein hope that you feel like you are having fun.  My sugguestion is to go try Path of Exile, Diablo 3 or even Grim Dawn ( since its basically a darker version of TQ ).  I wanted to like this game but too many things weighed this game down.  Maybe try it with friends over a few drinks but on its own i wouldnt even pick this game up on sale.","October 24, 2014","false","59.0"," 2 of 22 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","2","22","0","0"

If you are a fan of RPG and loot style adventures this game is a must.The game was made and updated several times by iron lore but then it got droped by them and some things were never completed.The game/mod  community finished this game and a game that was good became great.I am normally not a big fan of putting alot of mods or fan made crap into games (some games they are needed) but this one (fan patch 1.7) is so well done you would be a fool not to use it.The other mod to this game is called Allskins which can summon these special merchants that sell things from body paints to full armor (visual only the armor you have is still used) and yes of course nudity.Even if you didnt use the fan patch this game is still worth the 20 bucks they still ask because of its length and replay ability alone.But hold tight,Titans Quest Gold which has both TQ and TQIM is often on sale here on steam for under 5 bucks.The multi player now only works thru sumthing like game ranger (game spy is done) but you can still make it work.I recommend this game highly for those that enjoy this type of game.This old game is still better than than new diablo3 IMO.","January 23, 2015","true","333.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After 40 hours and finally finishing the entire game (aside from a few sidequests, I got too annoyed to finish them all), I felt overall disappointed. Why? Well let's find out.\n\n~~~Pros~~~\n+Everything looks nice. I normally don't judge a game by graphics, but everything just seems to be modeled to look really detailed and articulated. It just stands out to me in this game in comparison to other games.\n\n+Setting. Greek mythology is awesome and always has lots of potential. Even a cyclops makes an appearance early on.\n\n+Character customization options. 9 various masteries and you can pick two of them. Definitely creates some unique builds and promotes experimentation.\n\n~~~Cons~~~\n-It's incredibly slow in every way whatsoever. As I said before, it took me 40 hours to finish this game, and I feel they could've cut maybe half of that out because all you're doing for most of the game is running between boring locations. Had they made more interesting locations or maybe more sidequests, it wouldn't be so bad. But no. It just feels like unnecessary and unrewarding padding. Occasionally you'll find a cave, but it's not enough to fully reward exploration. Its lengthiness could prevent but the most devoted players to the experimentation of multiple classes either.\n\n-Frustrating difficulty. Yes I know Diablo 1 & 2 had its annoying difficulty moments as well, but this game takes it beyond that. I died over 150 times finishing this game on normal difficulty! (maybe I just suck at it, eh who knows?) Though this game does have the benefit of not losing all your equipped gear when you die at least...\n\n-Loot isn't too exciting. From the last couple of bosses I fought, the most interesting loot I got was an arcane formula. Most of the rest of the loot was stuff I could find from any old monster or even the shop. Maybe I had bad luck, but in other H&S games I played, the bosses would drop at least one worthwhile thing every time.\n\n\nI understand that there's mods out there for this game and that higher difficulties add better enemies and loot, but I only find it fair to judge the core game, and I don't feel my time would be worth trying the higher difficulties. It has its place for those who want another hack and slash fix, but it's not for me.","January 31, 2015","false","46.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are nice, nothing too fancy but not shabby either. Doesn't take much to run, although since Gamespy is sort of dead you have to use services like Tunngle to play multiplayer over virtual LANs.\n\nBottom line, I got many many hours of enjoyment out of this game when I played through solo, and I'm getting even more now playing through again with a buddy.

You can expect to put in 40+ hours to complete a single playthrough, during which you'll cut a swathe through Greece, Egypt, the Orient, Olympus, and Hades, pitted against a menagerie of mythological beings that are familiar, yet refreshingly original. The graphics are better than virtually any ARPG on the market (no mean feat for a game that came out in 2006), and the mechanics are rock-solid, allowing you to synthesize two masteries to create any class you can think of. The atmosphere is rich and you can make the experience as subversive as you want: there are philosophers and scholars who will regale you with anecdotes and little pearls of wisdom; side-qeusts are in abundance, allowing for little reprieves during your journey; the loot-whoring is without equal; gargantuan boss fights like those in ARPGs of yore will punctuate every act on your road to Hades; the list, quite literally, goes on and on. You can usually pick Titan Quest Gold up for a meager $5 during any of the annual Steam sales, and you will be remiss if you neglect to do so.","September 28, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been playing this game for years and have easily racked up 100+ Hours on it. This is a fantastic game with one of the best skill-tree desgined leveling systems I have ever seen!\n\nThe story is nothing new, you're a hero of Greece off to save the world from various Gods and Demons, your usual Greek Mythos RPG but that's not the strong part of this game! This game's strong points come from, as I've already mentioned, it's skill trees - they're simply top notch.\n\nThe game has no focus on PvP and with that they could focus on making some spells fantastical and simply, if the game was to have PvP, overpowered but because there is no PvP it's all fine and dandy. And even though your powers are mighty, that doesn't mean this game is easy! There are certain sections that can easily kick your ♥♥♥, especially on the higher difficulties.\n\nALTHOUGH not all is well. If you plan on purchasing this stellar game for it's Co-Op I have sad news for you - Gamespy has recently closed it's servers for this game and it no longer supports INTERNET play (I have yet to test it's LAN functionality) and Himachi seems unable to fix this so far! So take heed if you plan on playing with friends over the net, at this moment (to my knowledge) there is no way to do so.\n\nHowever this game still is great as a single player experience. If you're a lover of games like Diablo this is certainly a game for you and definitely worth even it's non-sale $15 price tag.","September 22, 2014","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can afford it (and you should nowadays :p) don't bother playing TQ and directly play campaign/multi through the extension.\n-------------\n\nAs TQIT is an extension for TQ, I won't make a full review of all aspects in the game. For that I'll confer to my review on original Titan Quest page. I'll focus on the changes made in this game.\n(For people too lazy to go read the other review, just know that this is one of the best hack&slash existing in solo or as a team, although the slow level progression may be a bit frustrating to people used to fast-level ones like Torchlight 2 or Diablo).\n\nSo, what's new in TQIT? The essential change is the arrival of a new skill mastery. This "Dream" mastery had clearly been designed to strenghten some kind of builds that could be a bit difficult to play in original TQ. "Unfortunately", this skill mastery has been recognized "broken", in that it's kinda overpowered compared to other skills masteries, either as a "pure" class or mixed with another. Still it brings some new fun builds, and as long as you concert with friends on each one role when planning your classes and progresses, this overpowerness won't be a bother.\n\nApart from that, this extension brought new content, a new (welcomed) level cap and some extra content.\nSo, big question is: is there any interest in playing original TQ?\nWell, as the campaign is the same, as well as the skills masteries, I'd say if you can afford the extension, buy it and play directly through it.\n\nPlease note the same (recent) limitation as with original game: multiplayer servers were managed by Gamespy which went bankrupt. AFAIK, only reliable way to play now is in LAN host with Hamachi, but didn't test directly yet.","June 23, 2014","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't randomly generated like Diablo, but that means that the world is set up and looks gorgeous all the way through, especially some of the levels in act III.

The last 15 were fine, but I was ready to be finished.\n\nPart of that probably had to do with the fact that I thought the game was over after defeating what I thought was the final boss at the end of act three only to realize there was still a complete act four to go.\n\nBuilding my charater up was good time and most of the fighting met my expectations.  I thought several of the bosses were a bit too easy, but others were definitely a challege.  I completed all the side quests, but as I noted, in act four I did not clear every single map as I had been doing.  I did what was needed to complete quests, but skipped some optional caves because I was ready to move on.\n\nAgain, the game play was good overall, but I did grow tired of picking up items and selling them off.  Probably would have been helpful to know that I didn't actually need as much money as I amassed.  Also would have helped to know that  pressing "X" showed me only the items worth picking up (didn't figure that out until 2/3 of the way through).\n\nI came to this game from Torchlight, but actually enjoyed this one more.  Certainly from a story perspective, but from a character building perspective as well.  I also enjoyed sending my pet back to sell things in Torchlight rather than having to portal back to towns all the time.\n\nIn any event, it was fun game and my daughter like some of the crazy beasts I fought (and their names as well).\n\nBottom line is I'd play a sequel, which I guess is as good of a recommendation as you can give.","November 13, 2014","true","67.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dungeon Crawler, looting, quests, Mutiple mastery selections making for replayable content. Example would be you start your character and you chose to go hunter. Few levels higher it grants you a selection of a second mastery and you choose nature. While steathly hiding and kiting monsters and killing them with your bow you can now further your destruction by summoning patrons of the forest to deter your monster agression as well pop a healing spell to keep yourself alive. You see where i'm going with this? 2 masteries = Mutiple conbinations of deadly end class results which gives the player a replay value as you can creat so many variations.\n\nAnother great thing about this game as it is CO-OP. HOWEVER, the servers for the game are DOWN. That means no online play which intern means no CO-OP. There are ways to get around this such as local lan (however most steam friends don't live within 30 feet of your house) and various other hosting programs such as Tunngle work. This can add to your games experience alot however if you do not wish to jump through hoops to play co-op I completely understand as steam should have been more clear about the multiplayer from the jump or had some type of server made for steam play or something. Kinda one of the more negative things about the game but at least you're not completely doomed on your own.\n\nThat being said, I have put around 30ish hours into the game making mutiple classes of characters and I gotta say I love it. There is some annoyance to the game seeing as it was made awhile ago. There are transfer features to the game so you can put money on difffern't characters so you don't have to start from nothing every time you want to start a new. The Map is covered in "fog" and you need to explore to pretty much mow the map into view which is ok with me because I like exploring every corner and aspect of adventure games.\n\n\nPros\n-Dungeon Crawler\n-Hordes of monsters that respawn\n-Big variation in Mastery / Class system\n-Graphics are actually somewhat decent! (still old remember!)\n-1000x Weapons just like in your typical Dungeon Crawler\n-Telepoting system (Exp)-You just stormed 45 mins in one direction and you're bag is full drop a tele go to a big city sell and jump right were you left off ( HUGE if you ask me because I hate walking back and fourth to town when I can be there in a few clicks)\n-Side quests to keep you in the game longer and not just charging straight for the finish\n\nCons\n-Repetitive-as in most dungeon crawlers you play 2-3 hours and you need a break.\n-Shift becomes you're best friend-and sometimes you get stuck attacking 4-5 times over the monster you just killed annoying but not game breaking\n-Mutiplayer Capabilities however it's up to the player to decide if they want to setup hosting programs to play which is total BS if you ask me because it's 85% of the reason I bought this game was to dungeon crawl with my steam friends.\n-Some quest markers stick-meaning you complete the objective and it stills shows up on your map as "un-done". Not a big issue but if you're a completionist like me it's important for that marker to go away lol.\n-The name sounds silly lol (SORRY THQ!)\n\nAll in all I give this game 8/10\n-Yes alittle high on the rating but i'm bias for dungeon crawlers.\n-I love my Reskins of Diablo any time I can get my hands on one.\n-Even though it's crappy it has Online CO-OP features that CAN be utilized which still keeps me really happy\n-There is a satisfying feeling when you run into a crowd of enemies and they out number you 20 to 1 then you go ahead and cave every one of there skulls in while loot flies everywhere. Gets me everytime.\n\nLastly- For $15 this game isn't worth the buy-Sorry steam = (\nHowever- when it's on sale: Titan Quest and\nTitan Quest Immortal Throne as a bundle for $4.99 IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH IT.\nThe game is really fun! And for $4.99 you can have hours of fun but for $15 I feel like it's not enough.\n\n*I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW AFTER I GET TO IMMORTAL THRONE*- still working on multiple play throughs lol!","July 6, 2014","true","37.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been playing this game for years and have easily racked up 100+ Hours on it. This is a fantastic game with one of the best skill-tree desgined leveling systems I have ever seen!\n\nThe story is nothing new, you're a hero of Greece off to save the world from various Gods and Demons, your usual Greek Mythos RPG but that's not the strong part of this game! This game's strong points come from, as I've already mentioned, it's skill trees - they're simply top notch.\n\nThe game has no focus on PvP and with that they could focus on making some spells fantastical and simply, if the game was to have PvP, overpowered but because there is no PvP it's all fine and dandy. And even though your powers are mighty, that doesn't mean this game is easy! There are certain sections that can easily kick your ♥♥♥, especially on the higher difficulties.\n\nALTHOUGH not all is well. If you plan on purchasing this stellar game for it's Co-Op I have sad news for you - Gamespy has recently closed it's servers for this game and it no longer supports INTERNET play (I have yet to test it's LAN functionality) and Himachi seems unable to fix this so far! So take heed if you plan on playing with friends over the net, at this moment (to my knowledge) there is no way to do so.\n\nHowever this game still is great as a single player experience. If you're a lover of games like Diablo this is certainly a game for you and definitely worth even it's non-sale $15 price tag.","September 22, 2014","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

MUST be played with community patch 1.17, this is the most finely polished jewel in the hack/slash/stash genre I have ever played, my favorite of all time its only short coming can be its slightly slow pacing wich bores many people. I find it soothing and relaxing. It wont feel slow paced when the screen is littered with mobs, its just the frequency with wich the scenery changes ( wich is beautiful btw).\nThese games were originally made to keep us entertained for a very long time with no ARTIFICIAL ATTRITION. If I want a fast experience to digest a game fast and poop on its replay value I turn to a fps or turn on time trial on a platformer.\n\nMany fans and critics also point out that for a game of its genre the lack of randomization of the environment kills its replayability. Well, I'll let you know as a fan of this genre that you will not find a game made before, or after, for at least untill grim dawn is launched, that has a more rich diversity in classes and skill trees. You choose one "class" tree at the first level up and another at the 8th level with 10 base classes, how is that for character build diversity? And best part is, every skill point you put on anything feels significant. Unless you forget to put patch 1.17 like I reminded you and will remind again. (theres some sad irony behind the reason the game wasnt originally even MORE polished than it is, specially considering how many copies were sold after the developers had to leave it).\nI rather have a beautiful static scenario than the pseudo randomized regorgitated ♥♥♥♥ I played through in D3, wich could have been a legendary game not a "meh" experience for true HnS type fans.\n\nThere is a demo, and this is the expansion of the game. Best call is to wait for the "Titan Quest Gold" pack from steam to be on sale, wich includes original and expansion, do not bother playing original. When playing a new game you will see the content of the vanilla version and at the end of the story you start the expansion line. DO NOT FORGET THE COMMUNITY PATCH 1.17!","July 21, 2013","true","132.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is probably the greatest iso rpg game I've ever played. It's simple, but not to a degree that it could be called "dumbed down" and it has some complexity. Like with the hybrid builds/classes you can make. And because of this it also has a lot of replayability. Due to the hybrid builds you can make, piece of loot that have buffs for two different stats, for example, strength and intelligence, are no longer pointless and confusing because, with the right build, it can become important to invest in both of these stats. I can't speak too much about balance though. Certain abilities can allow you to kill enemies from all the way across the map. Like volcanic orb. But, despite a game that was made to appeal to a wider audience, it still manages to be a easy to use, but not too simplified, action rpg. Shame that some developers think Dungeon Siege 3 and Diablo 3 are the ideal way to make a relatively simple rpg. And it also manages to be fun.","January 13, 2015","true","157.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite a rocky start with my first character (melee) that almost found me shelving this for a second time, my second attempt has kept me moving along to see what the next level or loot drop brings. The battles themselves are not as frantic as Torchlight nor as drawn out as Diablo 2. I foundt the Acts themselves to be a bit on the lengthy side at times but then again, I scoured every inch of every map in my usual thorough manner (which includes the unrelenting genocidal slaughter of anything that could drop loot or grant XP). The story and overall gameplay is predictable (especially if you've ever played its aforementioned predecessor) but with 9 different masteries to choose from and two mastery choices to make, the ability to experiment with so many combinations that make up your "class" (you can even stick with just a single mastery if you wish) is what sets this game apart. Certainly a game worthy of consideration.

Honestly, this game just isn't that fun when it comes down to it. The pacing is so slow that it takes the fun away. Leveling is slow, progressing through the story is slow, heck even walking around the map is ridiculously slow! (despite all my movement speed increasing items). The loot rate is decent, with a mod at least, but none of the rare items I recieved had any interesting attributes. I think what really gets me is how boring the combat is. Just hordes of the same enemies over and over. The fighting looks super lame, the sound effects aren't that great, I wasn't fighting monsters because it was fun, I was only killing them to level up and get more loot. In any game of this genre, you should want to go out of your way to mow down a group of enemies and showcase all of your abilities and enjoy the spectacle. Titan Quest just doesn't do that for me.\n\nAlso, the "Telkine" boss battles were incredibly disappointing. They look ridiculously lame and the battles are forgettable. You certainly don't get that excitement you get from battling a boss in Diablo. Anyone reading this who has played Diablo 1 or 2 all the way through probably just had a flashback of first setting foot into the butchers room, or hopelessly trying to dodge Diablo's red lightning, or doing way too many Baal runs. Those were extremely memorable battles, Titan Quest just doesn't offer that.\n\nEven with the mod I installed to fix some of the games issues (Underlord Mod), it just stops being fun after awhile. I found myself playing just because I wanted to use more of the skill tree and be further along in the game where it might become more exciting. The skill trees are set up well, a reason many people like this game. It is fun to combine two classes and see how it pans out, at least it would be if the combat wasn's so boring.  Playing for 20 hours and "waiting" for the game to get more exciting is what made me uninstall it. There are simply better games of this genre out there much more deserving of your time. I do not reccommend.","September 15, 2015","false","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The skill system is fantastic and allows for tons of combinations. The game is long too, it's no 12 hours and done, the world is easily as big, if not bigger than Diablo 2. Where TQ really stands out however, is the modding scene. No D2 clone since Dungeon Siege has had as big a modding scene. All the mods work perfectly with the Steam version, the community is still fairly active and the game was made with mapping and modding in mind, no having to jump through hoops to get it to work. If you're itching for a fun hack and slash RPG to play, this is the one. This goes on sale all the time, if you don't have it by now, you really should.

It plays out pretty much the same, although you don't pick a class at the very start. When you first level up is where everything begins: you pick your class and you build it up instead of having presets. The interesting part afterwards is that you get to chose a second class some levels afterwards in order for your character to be more unique. You could, for example build a fire Mage with Warrior skills too. You have 3 difficulty settings that you unlock throughout your playthroughs, and you get to keep your weapons and items, but you lose some resistances, so building those up from the start is a must. You also get relics from defeated enemies that you can use on your items to boost your equipment, which is very similar to what Diablo has with Gems.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who loves Diablo-type games. It'll get you addicted to item-whoring","February 20, 2012","true","49.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has some balance issues I think though, I took two offensive trees and at a certain point in the game (about 2/3 of the way through) I suddenly shifted from pwning everything with ease to getting one shot by most things.

Titan Quests theme is unique, and the gameplay is so faithful to the principles that made diablo so great.\nThere is a massive, diverse world covered in several acts. In combination with tons of loot in the suspected qualities to keep the flow of the game intact. On top of that, the game also follows the model of increased difficulty (normal, epic, legendary), remeniscent of Diablo's normal, nightmare and hell. Each difficulty features harder monsters and better loot.\n\nIf at one point, you would get tired of the original campaign, you can try some of the fantastic mods available, especially Lilith: Battle for Jalavin (a totally newly created world which will take you up to 20 hours to complete). This mod in combination with other well known TQ mods such as Masteries mod (skill overhaul mod), gives more than enough incentive to go through the whole experience all over again with a fresh new slate.\n\nAll in all, if you are a fan of ARPG's it is a genuine crime not to have this masterpiece. The majority of the now-closed TQ studio (Iron Lore) are in the process of making a spiritual succesor named Grim Dawn (by Crate Entertainement). Given their history with TQ, this is a title to keep in mind as well and currently available through early acces on steam.\n\nClosing advice: go spend money on this, preferably as soon as possible, you will not regret it.","December 29, 2013","true","48.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/4550/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Titan Quest: Immortal Throne is an expansion to the 2006 action RPG Titan Quest developed by Iron Lore Entertainment. Immortal Throne is a single player and multiplayer game taking place in a fantasy world based on Greek / Egyptian / Oriental mythology.\n\nIf you are thinking of getting this game, make sure you get the Gold Edition, which includes both Titan Quest and Immortal Throne. Remember to install both games, but launch Immortal Throne only as it includes the original Titan Quest story campaign with lots of gameplay improvements. You will need the original Titan Quest in order to get Immortal Throne to work.\n\nFor a game released in 2006, im surprised that the graphics still hold out quite well in 2013. The environment art in particular still looks lush and crisp and doesn't lose out to the more recently released Diablo 3. I especially liked how there are no loading screen when i transition from the overworld to a cave / dungeon. It just looked very smooth and natural. Character customization options are very limited however, and you can only choose your gender and the colour of your tunic. More options to change hairstyles or skin colour would have been very welcome here.\n\nThe main story campaign is rather lengthy and it took me about 30 hours to finish all 4 story acts and that is considering I had skipped some side quests. There are harder difficulties to unlock and if you are dedicated enough, it can easily go up to 100s of hours.\n\nGameplay wise, being an Action RPG, it follows closely to the standard hack and slash action RPG style pioneered by the Diablo series. Unlike Diablo however, it has 9 different unique skill trees each with its own flavour, and you can mix and match any 2 of them that complements your playstyle. Wanna play a full on brutish warrior tank? A pure glass cannon caster? A hybrid of both? A necromancer rogue? You make the choice. There are alot of combinations of playstyle available.\n\nMusic is competently done, and sounds appropriate when played in the respective areas, gives the game world a little more flavour. Sound effects are also appropriately meaty with every swoosh of a blade and blast of a magic spell. Voice over work for the NPCs are a little forced and overacted but nothing too jarring.\n\nNow as for the downsides, the backstory of the game is unremarkable and boring. I never really paid attention to the story and quest givers as it just feels like another excuse to get you kill more mobs. Early game can also feel abit tedious when you keep seeing the same mobs over and over again. It does get better at the later acts, where you get to see more interesting mob varieties.\n\nThe game can be very grindy and I felt that character progression can be abit too slow at times. Because this game released back in 2006, it lacks the bells and whistles of modern Action RPGs, such as needing to manually pick up gold, do item tetris in your inventory, and no hirelings to help sell items.\n\nThere is a Co-op mode, but unfortunately it didn't work well at all when I tried to co-op with a friend, as we encountered bugs when trying to synch up our questlines. It sometimes doesn't even recognize that we have completed the quest. Do not get this game if you are thinking of co-op. There are some temporary solutions available, but we figured it wasn't worth the hassle and would be complete wasted trip if the game decides to screw up at the later acts if we continue to co-op.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.0 / 10\nA competent and very lengthy Action RPG that holds up surprisingly well despite it's age. If you are a fan of Action RPG killing and looting, this one is a worthy buy especially if you can get it cheap on a sale. Its a pity that the co-op function didn't work smoothly, or I would have given it a higher score.\n\nDon't hope for any official patches though, as sadly the game studio that made it is already long gone. There are still a couple of interesting fan-made patches and mods floating around though if you are interested.","October 19, 2013","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

per chapter, with that being said the biome for a lot of these regions can feel slightly copy and paste, more so with the regions ranging from one of two types  'cave-tomb' you'll run through many of these and at times this can feel tedious, so this area of the game gets a solid five out of me for the fact that it has many variations from attacks, armor, weapons, enchantments, but the constant rehash and sometimes just total lack of variety keeps this from being a 7.\n\n\nSound:  The sound quality in this game is nothing to brag about, your basic attack makes sort of a monotone thud no matter what it is you're hitting, or what kind of weapon you're using, the only variations to this sound is when you're casting magic and even those can be slightly lack luster, even more annoyingly the death cries that monsters make can be teeth grindingly bad as killing large mobs of them can spam you with the same phrase over and over.\n\nThat being said however, the music can be complimenting at times while traversing long plains to get from point A to point B, because you died without finding the teleporter first between two possible regions, the voice acting for AI is also in that state of 'it's so bad that it's actually funny' category, ranging from ridiculous accents to voice pitches that one wouldn't normally use, for this mix of good and bad i'd have to leave this at a solid 6.\n\n\nGameplay:  This is where the game starts to shine, it has the loot is key formula rocking about it, though in my experience rare loot has been slightly easy to come by, I know this will not always be the case with every character I use and sometimes can be extremely hard to find going hours on end without seeing a single blue or green in the early stages.\n\nThe class system works a bit like Diablo with your usual Rogue/Archer/Warrior/Healer/Wizard, but the face value of this is the only thing it has in common with Diablo, underneath that face is a very deep layer of meat that you can sink your teeth into, criss-crossing classes to bring out powerful hybrids with their own distinct class names, with a community mod that adds even more class variations, i've only played as a magic user thus far and have found it to work responsively and easy to my control.\n\nThe moves can sometimes be very flashy and over-powered making the monsters into mush with the right set of gear, but playing with my co-op partner I noticed for the first half of the game as a tank he struggled to stay alive cause the monsters provided a serious challenge to him whilst he was under equipped.\n\nIt's addictive game play is a staple for why people still play the game to this very day, with a semi-private but active none the less multiplayer server list of people going through the entire story together.\n\nSo with all this being said, I give it an exceptional 8 based on high replay value and addicting return value.\n\n\nStory Telling:  This is a tricky area, I know the premise of the game is very much based on old Greek mythos with characters like Zeus, Leonidas, and the like all being in the game, but unless you sit there and read every text dialogue that these characters use you'll never fully understand what's going on anyway.\n\nThe game is extremely long with what some 14 hours into the game and only being on the second region, we still have an extremely long way to venture and so much more to learn about this universe, but again with the original point the story telling seems to be spread out dramatically from one area to the next and mostly told through fetch this/kill that type of quests, meaning you're less likely to pay attention to what people have to say and therefore focus more on gameplay than anything story related.\n\nFor that I give this area of the game a 6, the positive side would be the long story of man vs creature a lot of which we've read about or watched movies on growing up, the down side will be that most of the player base will skip over the arching-story just to get to the next set of monster fodder for their loot grabs.\n\nCustomization:  I was tempted to label this section of the review as just 'Loot' because there is a lot of it, thousands of different pieces that can make your character look snazzy, or rough to set you apart from the rest of the group, weapons are diverse and act diverse based on the type that you wear, each piece ranging from an array of different rarity colors can boast a powerful set of buffs that can turn the side of battle by mixing and matching them.\n\nUnfortunately this is also a problem, there is no cosmetic only option and this can leave you looking quite silly if one piece has better buffs than another and you decide that stats are better than fashion, currently my guy rocks what looks like a mini-skirt and a Princess Tiara all in the sake of a faster mana regen, where as my co-op partner is decked out in a cool warrior outfit because he got lucky enough to find fashionable armor that gave great stats.\n\nColoring dye is present in the game, alebit useless cause you can only dye the color of your base tunic, I haven't checked to see if there was a mod to change this but if it doesn't exist yet (it'd be nice to have it in the future!) There also isn't any customization in the way your character can look when starting him out other than choosing male or female as your gender.\n\nSo for this area I give it an 8, key factors being a diverse array of weapons/armors and the weapons actually acting different in terms of colored effects, negative factors that keep it from being a 9-10 are dyes that are completely useless, creation of a character has literally no customization option leaving everyone looking the same when first starting out, and a cosmetic only option missing from the game so we don't have to look silly to be effective.\n\nOverall:  I love this game thus far, if they came out with a new one i'd buy it immediately, the series has been what Diablo 3 should've been the entire time, i'm not going to give the overall a final score cause I want you the readers to make your own opinions and decisions after playing it, my review is simply my experience thus far with the game and i'm confident in saying that i'll be a regular part of this community for as long it survives, it has a very addictive nature and it keeps me entertained the entire time.\n\nWe're in the business of entertainment so i'd say it's a worth while pick even at a full price, thanks for reading guys!","December 21, 2013","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can also choose the character's tunic's colour, but that can be changed in-game by buying one of the several available dyes.\n\nOther than that, the only really grievous flaw the game has is that it sometime features vast sections of the map that have 0 quest content other than "Well, you have to go through 3-5 immense zones contaning nothing but 2 different kinds of trash mobs to get to the next relevant quest item/boss.","January 10, 2011","true","183.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, the mastery system gives a lot more freedom than Diablo 2 skill system because you can combine different sets of skill as you wish. I chose warrior and earth mastery thus battlemage. Another great thing about skill system is that you dont have a lot of active skills which makes choice very difficult. There are a lot of passive skills for you to enhance your active skills which will be used in battle by chance.\n\nin terms of the armors and weapons, the diversity is amazing (different styles of weapons according to different culture).

It plays out pretty much the same, although you don't pick a class at the very start. When you first level up is where everything begins: you pick your class and you build it up instead of having presets. The interesting part afterwards is that you get to chose a second class some levels afterwards in order for your character to be more unique. You could, for example build a fire Mage with Warrior skills too. You have 3 difficulty settings that you unlock throughout your playthroughs, and you get to keep your weapons and items, but you lose some resistances, so building those up from the start is a must. You also get relics from defeated enemies that you can use on your items to boost your equipment, which is very similar to what Diablo has with Gems.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who loves Diablo-type games.

Here is an awesome Subsittute dungeon crawler. You get 8 (9 with expansion) classes to pick from 3 difficuties mimicing diablo 2. And 3 acts (one more with expansion) and the best part that diablo failed big time on you can multiclass. 2 classes per character in this game imagine diablo 2 where you can pick 2 classes whatever you want...doesnt that sound like fun? no matter what you pick though you will have some flaws with that character\n\nAlso it removed the really cheap and annoying immune to mods on the enemy every character can do damage to every monster regardless but some monsters do have resistantances to some. For those who played a melee class you had to deal with immune to physcial ugh no more not in this gem.\n\nIf you have the expansion, you get a storage system so you can easily give items to new characters you decide to make later. And the game does a good job giving you items you dont really need (like bows for a pure close range melee but it does give incentive to try out more then 1 character since the combinations are so high upping replayablility.\n\nLeveling up in this game with the dual classing is complicated but there is no needing to restart if you mess up your build you can spend in game gold to reset your skill points. but you cant reset your class combo so if you pick 2 warrior classes as your combo you cant suddenly switch to a mage combo.\n\nGrinding for equips is much better here then in the diablo series you dont have to indenify anything its automatically done for you also the items scale to the area you are in so you wont get a unique that is made for a lv7 character while you are in a lv40 area the stuff will be around lv38-40. Also store keepers sell items around your level but the mods on the item might not be all that great, but uniques arent so common that you will get all the best stuff immeadially you need to do boss runs to get the best stuff. If you want the best of the best items in the game you need to go hunting speicific enemies since its unqiue to them and them alone.\n\nrandom mobs sometimes literally hold the best endgame stuff. The best shield in the game are held by ants in act4 legendary, the best bow is held by frog monsters in act 4 legendary, the best mace by 1 armed green thug enemies in act 4 legendary, the best staff by skelton mages in act 3 legendary, so in the end some equips wont be unqiues.\n\nOk its not perfect there the map for all areas is exactly the same only differences being that on higher difficulties the enemies are stronger going through act 3 on normal well its the same as act3 epic. The game wont feel the same though it does get a lot harder on epic and on legendary yeah its no cakewalk. Even though you know what the map will look like, the generated enemies is random. And the best part new enemeis start to appear in epic and they are even harder then the boss of the end of the act think of them as super enemies. The first one you meet in epic well the sound he makes as you approach him is ominious and he really stands out from all the other enemies and he has a 1 hit ko move (might be 2 hit if you are a tanky character still the moment you see him wow what a difference from normal mode)\n\nAlso without mods the way it generates items isnt very good there are times you can get the exact same unique drops in a row with the same mods. And a couple skills are bugged as in dont work at all. Fans of the game thankfully released their own "Fan Patch of Titan Quest IT "get that asap it fixes nearly everything broken with the game and doesnt change the game in a bad way its only bug fixes which is good.\n\nAlso the game heavily favors melee and bow over magic (trying to do a pure caster without hand me down items from others result in a hard game a very unforgiviving hard game) casters get very low hp and end up wearing the mage equips which arent as protective as the warrior equips (which everyone else gets to use) and summoners have it worse the summons in all difficulties are hard to use in act 4 whree the enemy gets a huge damage boost\n\nAlso the stats str, dex, int cant be refunded and since all your equips depend on how you add to those, its best to use common sense (warriors dont need int) mages dont need str, hybrids have it rough its hard to do both int and str but most hybrids use str (since str equips are overall better higher defense and much higher resists then mage stuff offers). hunters too have it rough they need dex lots of dex...but its better to increase str for the best equips (warrior stuff) and str giving more damage then dex (but they need dex to equip bows and/or spears)\n\ndex is the oddball stat, spear and bow users need it badly (around 400 dex wihout equips at a mininum) others still need it so they dont get critical hit often (in higher difficulites that is an easy way to die) and your miss % will be high if dex is low since that determines your offense/defense ability when your equips arent all that great. Once you get godly equips that offer defense ability/offense ability you can skimp dex as most characters but you cant refund stat points for dex and since spent points are permenent your first character wont be optimal high dex is required so you dont get criticaled but once you can hand down stuff and make a new character you can keep dex low (unless you are a hunter).\n\nIn the hardest difficulty its very common to see enemies with 1 hit ko moves (A good sign is attacks from the sky) that will 1 shot you regardless of your items and they love stuns (you cant move while stunned >_>) but they telegraph every attack so with careful observation you can dodge most attacks easily and there is a stun resist stat so you can lower the duration of those to be bearable.\n\n90% of the attacks aimed at you are dodgeable so even if your stuff isnt all great you can beat the entire game with terrible equips, but its best to learn how to dodge them early in normal mode where they arent in the 1 hit ko range but they still hurt plenty. This keeps you on the edge of your seat almost constantly. Something most modern games are missing even if you have the best possible stuff you can still be taken down in a couple seconds if you let some enemy skills hit you (some of them being slow and easy to dodge) Though normal mode the easiest mode does eventually get so easy you can survive all atttacks but it doesnt stay that way in epic and espeically legendary you have to learn to dodge attacks.\n\nOverall disapointed in daiblo 3? heres a great game to pick however since its so old no ones playing it much online so you will be soloing mostly but the game offers so much and does so many things right with the diablo 2 formula it will last you at least 100 hours if you love a diablo 2 clone...

But the story follows too, myths and myghtology of ancient times alike are counted by fully voice acted NPC, and having the story jump from fantasy to real world Myths really make it stand.\nGame mechanics are quite good though they do have an old school feeling due to having Diablo II as its source of inspriration.

That must mean that it's pretty good right? well yes and no.  This can be very addictive if you are ocd like me, but  many sections feel like fillers after first run through.\n\nThings that titan quest got right. 1) Interesting class system where you pick two masteries from a choice of seven. 2) streamlined loot sort button, 3) graphics, 4) many many loot and crafting options, 5) cool monster bosses based on greek mythos.\n\nThings that are borked 1) far too long for a loot em up. The game takes about 30 hours just to complete start to finish on one difficulty. 2) the loot reward system is weird, defeating the final boss sometimes don't give you anything worthwhile, 3) Multiplayer on internet is almost non existent.\n\nI recommend this game only if you liked diablo 2.

Despite a rocky start with my first character (melee) that almost found me shelving this for a second time, my second attempt has kept me moving along to see what the next level or loot drop brings. The battles themselves are not as frantic as Torchlight nor as drawn out as Diablo 2. I foundt the Acts themselves to be a bit on the lengthy side at times but then again, I scoured every inch of every map in my usual thorough manner (which includes the unrelenting genocidal slaughter of anything that could drop loot or grant XP). The story and overall gameplay is predictable (especially if you've ever played its aforementioned predecessor) but with 9 different masteries to choose from and two mastery choices to make, the ability to experiment with so many combinations that make up your "class" (you can even stick with just a single mastery if you wish) is what sets this game apart. Certainly a game worthy of consideration. I would strongly recommend downloading the unoffical fanpatch that fixes much of what the since defunct developer was unable to address.","November 27, 2012","true","344.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The last 15 were fine, but I was ready to be finished.\n\nPart of that probably had to do with the fact that I thought the game was over after defeating what I thought was the final boss at the end of act three only to realize there was still a complete act four to go.\n\nBuilding my charater up was good time and most of the fighting met my expectations.  I thought several of the bosses were a bit too easy, but others were definitely a challege.  I completed all the side quests, but as I noted, in act four I did not clear every single map as I had been doing.  I did what was needed to complete quests, but skipped some optional caves because I was ready to move on.\n\nAgain, the game play was good overall, but I did grow tired of picking up items and selling them off.  Probably would have been helpful to know that I didn't actually need as much money as I amassed.  Also would have helped to know that  pressing "X" showed me only the items worth picking up (didn't figure that out until 2/3 of the way through).\n\nI came to this game from Torchlight, but actually enjoyed this one more.  Certainly from a story perspective, but from a character building perspective as well.  I also enjoyed sending my pet back to sell things in Torchlight rather than having to portal back to towns all the time.\n\nIn any event, it was fun game and my daughter like some of the crazy beasts I fought (and their names as well).\n\nBottom line is I'd play a sequel, which I guess is as good of a recommendation as you can give.","November 13, 2014","true","67.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

MUST be played with community patch 1.17, this is the most finely polished jewel in the hack/slash/stash genre I have ever played, my favorite of all time its only short coming can be its slightly slow pacing wich bores many people. I find it soothing and relaxing. It wont feel slow paced when the screen is littered with mobs, its just the frequency with wich the scenery changes ( wich is beautiful btw).\nThese games were originally made to keep us entertained for a very long time with no ARTIFICIAL ATTRITION. If I want a fast experience to digest a game fast and poop on its replay value I turn to a fps or turn on time trial on a platformer.\n\nMany fans and critics also point out that for a game of its genre the lack of randomization of the environment kills its replayability. Well, I'll let you know as a fan of this genre that you will not find a game made before, or after, for at least untill grim dawn is launched, that has a more rich diversity in classes and skill trees. You choose one "class" tree at the first level up and another at the 8th level with 10 base classes, how is that for character build diversity? And best part is, every skill point you put on anything feels significant. Unless you forget to put patch 1.17 like I reminded you and will remind again. (theres some sad irony behind the reason the game wasnt originally even MORE polished than it is, specially considering how many copies were sold after the developers had to leave it).\nI rather have a beautiful static scenario than the pseudo randomized regorgitated ♥♥♥♥ I played through in D3, wich could have been a legendary game not a "meh" experience for true HnS type fans.\n\nThere is a demo, and this is the expansion of the game. Best call is to wait for the "Titan Quest Gold" pack from steam to be on sale, wich includes original and expansion, do not bother playing original. When playing a new game you will see the content of the vanilla version and at the end of the story you start the expansion line.

I played this game a lot until I lost my steam copy. It's got a cool dual-class system which opens up even more build options.

It isn't randomly generated like Diablo, but that means that the world is set up and looks gorgeous all the way through, especially some of the levels in act III. My biggest complaint is that the multiplayers is a bear to get set up, but you can work around it with evolve or a similar lan emulator.

If you can afford it (and you should nowadays :p) don't bother playing TQ and directly play campaign/multi through the extension.\n-------------\n\nAs TQIT is an extension for TQ, I won't make a full review of all aspects in the game. For that I'll confer to my review on original Titan Quest page. I'll focus on the changes made in this game.\n(For people too lazy to go read the other review, just know that this is one of the best hack&slash existing in solo or as a team, although the slow level progression may be a bit frustrating to people used to fast-level ones like Torchlight 2 or Diablo).\n\nSo, what's new in TQIT? The essential change is the arrival of a new skill mastery. This "Dream" mastery had clearly been designed to strenghten some kind of builds that could be a bit difficult to play in original TQ. "Unfortunately", this skill mastery has been recognized "broken", in that it's kinda overpowered compared to other skills masteries, either as a "pure" class or mixed with another. Still it brings some new fun builds, and as long as you concert with friends on each one role when planning your classes and progresses, this overpowerness won't be a bother.\n\nApart from that, this extension brought new content, a new (welcomed) level cap and some extra content.\nSo, big question is: is there any interest in playing original TQ?\nWell, as the campaign is the same, as well as the skills masteries, I'd say if you can afford the extension, buy it and play directly through it.\n\nPlease note the same (recent) limitation as with original game: multiplayer servers were managed by Gamespy which went bankrupt. AFAIK, only reliable way to play now is in LAN host with Hamachi, but didn't test directly yet.","June 23, 2014","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been playing this game for years and have easily racked up 100+ Hours on it. This is a fantastic game with one of the best skill-tree desgined leveling systems I have ever seen!\n\nThe story is nothing new, you're a hero of Greece off to save the world from various Gods and Demons, your usual Greek Mythos RPG but that's not the strong part of this game! This game's strong points come from, as I've already mentioned, it's skill trees - they're simply top notch.\n\nThe game has no focus on PvP and with that they could focus on making some spells fantastical and simply, if the game was to have PvP, overpowered but because there is no PvP it's all fine and dandy. And even though your powers are mighty, that doesn't mean this game is easy! There are certain sections that can easily kick your ♥♥♥, especially on the higher difficulties.\n\nALTHOUGH not all is well. If you plan on purchasing this stellar game for it's Co-Op I have sad news for you - Gamespy has recently closed it's servers for this game and it no longer supports INTERNET play (I have yet to test it's LAN functionality) and Himachi seems unable to fix this so far! So take heed if you plan on playing with friends over the net, at this moment (to my knowledge) there is no way to do so.\n\nHowever this game still is great as a single player experience. If you're a lover of games like Diablo this is certainly a game for you and definitely worth even it's non-sale $15 price tag.","September 22, 2014","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Started playing it at a friend's house in elementary school, and eight years  and two physical copies later I'm still playing it. Here are just a few reasons why Titan Quest is still worth the buy\n\n> Variety of classes and combos\n\nYour character gets two specializations out of a possible nine (eight in the base game) and each gives a bunch of unique talents. There's a class for everyone, from classic sword-and-board warriors to necromancers and assassins and everything in between.\n\n> Mythology\n\nIf you like mythology, this is a great game to play. The enemies and lore are based in Greek, Egyptian, and Asian mythologies and it's just super cool to fight enemies like Polyphemus and Typhon.\n\n> Immortal Throne adds a lot of content\n\nThe base game is great, but you know what's even better? An extra class (Dream), area (Hades), and new features and items.\n\n> The boss fights are really satisfying\n\nSome of the bosses take forever to die, and it just feels SO GOOD when they finally go down, especially the final boss.\n\n> After you beat the game, you unlock more difficulties\n\nThey have higher level enemies, more minibosses, and higher chances of dropping rare items.\n\nHope this is helpful at all, I loved this game and I just want people to have the same great experiences I did.","April 7, 2015","true","71.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I purchased the Gold pack and I stil play it. It's one of those over looked games, one of those hidden gems. The game does get a little repetitive at times, and there are those frustrating moments. Like when you're running through a forest taking on mobs perfectly fine, then all of the sudden you get owned like there's no tomorrow. That is also one of the motivating factors in the game, to level up and keep pushing forward. Immortal Throne adds so much to the Titan Quest experience, I don't know how I played without it. I am dissappointed that there will not be a sequel or expansion to these games, but for what it's worth, the replay value goes above and beyond.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/4550/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Titan Quest: Immortal Throne is an expansion to the 2006 action RPG Titan Quest developed by Iron Lore Entertainment. Immortal Throne is a single player and multiplayer game taking place in a fantasy world based on Greek / Egyptian / Oriental mythology.\n\nIf you are thinking of getting this game, make sure you get the Gold Edition, which includes both Titan Quest and Immortal Throne. Remember to install both games, but launch Immortal Throne only as it includes the original Titan Quest story campaign with lots of gameplay improvements. You will need the original Titan Quest in order to get Immortal Throne to work.\n\nFor a game released in 2006, im surprised that the graphics still hold out quite well in 2013. The environment art in particular still looks lush and crisp and doesn't lose out to the more recently released Diablo 3. I especially liked how there are no loading screen when i transition from the overworld to a cave / dungeon. It just looked very smooth and natural. Character customization options are very limited however, and you can only choose your gender and the colour of your tunic. More options to change hairstyles or skin colour would have been very welcome here.\n\nThe main story campaign is rather lengthy and it took me about 30 hours to finish all 4 story acts and that is considering I had skipped some side quests. There are harder difficulties to unlock and if you are dedicated enough, it can easily go up to 100s of hours.\n\nGameplay wise, being an Action RPG, it follows closely to the standard hack and slash action RPG style pioneered by the Diablo series. Unlike Diablo however, it has 9 different unique skill trees each with its own flavour, and you can mix and match any 2 of them that complements your playstyle. Wanna play a full on brutish warrior tank? A pure glass cannon caster? A hybrid of both? A necromancer rogue? You make the choice. There are alot of combinations of playstyle available.\n\nMusic is competently done, and sounds appropriate when played in the respective areas, gives the game world a little more flavour. Sound effects are also appropriately meaty with every swoosh of a blade and blast of a magic spell. Voice over work for the NPCs are a little forced and overacted but nothing too jarring.\n\nNow as for the downsides, the backstory of the game is unremarkable and boring. I never really paid attention to the story and quest givers as it just feels like another excuse to get you kill more mobs. Early game can also feel abit tedious when you keep seeing the same mobs over and over again. It does get better at the later acts, where you get to see more interesting mob varieties.\n\nThe game can be very grindy and I felt that character progression can be abit too slow at times. Because this game released back in 2006, it lacks the bells and whistles of modern Action RPGs, such as needing to manually pick up gold, do item tetris in your inventory, and no hirelings to help sell items.\n\nThere is a Co-op mode, but unfortunately it didn't work well at all when I tried to co-op with a friend, as we encountered bugs when trying to synch up our questlines. It sometimes doesn't even recognize that we have completed the quest. Do not get this game if you are thinking of co-op. There are some temporary solutions available, but we figured it wasn't worth the hassle and would be complete wasted trip if the game decides to screw up at the later acts if we continue to co-op.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.0 / 10\nA competent and very lengthy Action RPG that holds up surprisingly well despite it's age. If you are a fan of Action RPG killing and looting, this one is a worthy buy especially if you can get it cheap on a sale. Its a pity that the co-op function didn't work smoothly, or I would have given it a higher score.\n\nDon't hope for any official patches though, as sadly the game studio that made it is already long gone. There are still a couple of interesting fan-made patches and mods floating around though if you are interested.","October 19, 2013","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Best played with others, It could get dull after a while playing alone.\n\nSet in an ancient greece setting, You can pretty much guess how the plot and quests will pan out but that's not what is important. Running around smashing dudes with my shield playing as a tank was extremely satisfying.\n\nBefore path of exile and D3 this was the only isometric RPG I would recommend, I would put it on par with POE and if you like this type of game definately give it a crack.","December 10, 2013","true","53.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays out pretty much the same, although you don't pick a class at the very start. When you first level up is where everything begins: you pick your class and you build it up instead of having presets. The interesting part afterwards is that you get to chose a second class some levels afterwards in order for your character to be more unique. You could, for example build a fire Mage with Warrior skills too. You have 3 difficulty settings that you unlock throughout your playthroughs, and you get to keep your weapons and items, but you lose some resistances, so building those up from the start is a must. You also get relics from defeated enemies that you can use on your items to boost your equipment, which is very similar to what Diablo has with Gems.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who loves Diablo-type games. It'll get you addicted to item-whoring","February 20, 2012","true","49.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just beware that it has some ridiculously frustrating problems that make it a nightmare to play! Terrible inventory system, no options for customization aside from the barely mentionable garment colour choices, sudden spikes in difficulty at seemingly random points (outside of boss battles), poor side mission system, very bad input lag when activating abilities, and finally, repetitive and frustrating combat.\n\nOne of the few redeeming features of this game is the skill system. With the addition of this expansion, there are 9 incredibly deep skill trees to explore, of which you can choose two to spec into. This, combined with the various items provided by the loot system, creates multiple combinations that you can experiment with in order to create the most powerful character you can.\n\nHowever, even with this feature, the other problems mentioned make this game very unenjoyable and very difficult to recommend. If you want to flex your skill building muscles, this game is for you, but realise that you will spend more time fighting against the flaws of the game than the challenges it sets out for you.","June 20, 2015","false","89.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does this by following the key basics for good dungeon crawlers: diverse characters, lots of loot, great bosses, and plenty of dungeons/levels/towns. My favorite thing about Titan Quest is the character choices. You pick two classes that then make your new class, and, with each class, you have multiple skills to choose from. You are never stuck playing a class in a single way. Plus, the lore for Titan Quest is awesome and they really do an amazing job with the level design and monster design.

There is no complexity here. Load up and move, click, click and click. Loot. Move on. Level up. Easy as Pie. You must have the Immortal Throne expansion though.\n\nThe environment is beautifully crafted - you just want to zoom in and see the detail. Then whack!  A gang of dragons are on top of you - help! Zoom out.\n\nThe three realms of ancient Greece, Egypt and Babylon and the Orient are so well crafted. Makes you believe it for sure. The first time I walked along the Great Wall of China I was amazed - second and third time as well. Exploring the Egyptian delta and fighting off killer crocodiles was pretty neat too. The music is different in each region and really well done - it's evocative. These developers should be proud of this masterpiece.\n\nYour character - so many different combinations, on each level up you can add stats according to how you want to play. Fighter, Archer or Summoner or something else. Forget the stats though - the key to this game is the various classes and how two of them can be combined. Believe me - no matter what you go with and how you progress - that feeling that you could do better or be more efficient will never go away.\n\nAfter a while you won't be able to stop asking yourself questions.\n\nWhat if I put all my stats in health - would I become invincible?\nWhat about sticking everything into dexterity - is there some theoretical number that will ensure I never get hit?\n100% immunity from Magic?\nHow many turtle shells combined with this set of armour and that class means infinite blocking ability?\n\nJust play the game and enjoy it and experiment - I guarantee you will want to try a bunch of different approaches.\n\nThe loot - the addiction. Always looking to equip the 'next' one. You will find yourselves farming certain regions for relics or unique items.\n\nThe game works fine for me under three different home PCs with Windows 7 and 8. No crashes.\n\nIf you are serious about playing a "Diablo Clone" that does not have cartoon graphics but also gives you an appreciation of our own history along the way TQ IT is head and shoulders above the competition.\n\nNegatives? Yep - it's a Diablo Clone so don't expect a lot of strategy. Keep your left hand on the "1" key to gulp down any health potions just in case. Enable the loot text so you can see the magical items.\n\nOh - and I thought the Gorgons would be tougher.

Gets much better if you like greek mythology and mythology in general. This is my Diablo and Diablo is the true obscure game I've only heard about. Who cares about the "devil" Typhoon is were it's at.\nThey also just got a ♥♥♥♥ ton of cool creatures like Tigermen, Jackalmen, Limos, Sandwraiths, Yetis, Manticore..guys, Liches. You name it.

Picked this up for a few $ and it is still good for its age. On any computer from the last few years you can have the settings on max and it still looks very nice. A bit repetative in a few places which is the only thing that does show its age a little. If you like action RGP (ARPG) this is a safe buy when its on sale.","October 11, 2015","true","74.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
