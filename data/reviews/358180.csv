It uses the same engine as Commander Keen 4 AND greatly improves on it!\n\nGameplay is fantastic; Unlike Keen 4 you can take more than one hit [an improvement if i do say so myself] BUT on the flip side you can't save in the middle of a level. Well you CAN but if you load you're shoved back to the start with all enemies respawned and items gone.\n\nThe enemies are a mixtore of cute and rad, the dialogue give you a chuckle or two, and it has that kind of satisfying difficulty that is legit hard, not frustrating.\n\nAlso if you die, you're treated to one of my personal favorite death animations!\n\nIn short, this game is rad and you should play it.","December 11, 2015","true","9.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/recommended/358180/","BloodCultist","Creeping Flesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/","645 products in account","Best ♥♥♥♥in' era of platformers. Castlevania, Mario, Metroid on NES/SNES and Bio Menace, Commander Keen (id), Duke 1, 2, Hocus Pocus and other Apogee badassery on DOS, was a good time to be alive. I've always loved the complexity in the level design of Apogee's platformers, giving you large levels with verticality and multiple objectives to complete such as collecting keycards to gain access to locked doors, flicking switches to deactivate forcefields, collecting items/powerups which allow you access areas previously out of reach rather than being linear side/autoscrollers.\n\nLike most other Apogee platformers, Bio Menace remains one of my favourite games in the genre, it has Apogees trademark cheesy, tongue in cheek writing, badass interesting levels that are exploration heavy and have many puzzles/obstacles to overcome, secrets to find as well as tons of enemies to demolish in the process. It's also one of the more challenging Apogee games but regardless is still a blast to play. I'd kill for some of these games to get faithful reboot, there aren't enough platformers that take influence from the kind of design these games have. Enough with generic 2D sidescrollers, make something cool like these games ya boring ♥♥♥♥♥♥s!","January 24","true","3.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

You will kill four million mutated enemies and reload your game four million and one times.  Actually, the first and second episodes are tough but pretty doable on normal difficulty, but the third episode is close enough to impossible that you might as well just round up and not play it at all.  Generally the level design and technical aspects of the game are solid, but there's a lot of cheap shot enemies and traps that kill you instantly.  That makes the long levels, infrequent checkpoints, and lack of mid-level save a frustrating mix.\n\nStill, for the first 2/3rds there's some decent platforming fun to be had that's only a notch below Duke Nukem and Commander Keen.  Just know when to quit.","May 15, 2015","true","6.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

Unable to shoot from ladders. Too impatient to wait for them to walk away so that I can get on the platform and start shooting. Sometimes the platform is tiny and the monster just stands there, so I couldn't avoid taking a hit.\n\nJumping feels awkward. The character can shoot while falling, but not right after jumping.\n\nPurple blobs aggro and have long-range jumping attack, combined with the character's fast movement, meant that on multiple occasions I'd run into an enemy with no time to react.","March 10","false","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
