You may find spelling mistakes in every 2nd or 3rd sentence.  Even look at the store page screenshots, there are quite a few uploaded there but you can see the one that shows a red menu and it has "ilnesses" at the top..  that's the kind of mistakes.  Typical foreigners who do not know any better and could easily make the 100's of corrections to the spelling and grammer to make this game presentable.  Also from the looks of things I am only at the very first level of the game and there could be some really bad grammar choices down the road, but they should at least make the first hour of gameplay mistake-free.  I mean, considering it is written by non-english speaking developers...  They did a pretty decent job so far but there are a lot of mistakes to be corrected.  http://i.imgur.com/C2XVasZ.jpg  you life?  http://i.imgur.com/u6vJFiq.jpg keep in mine?\n\nBut that's not all.  The game is extremely complicated.  If you look at the screenshots you will see how diverse the gameplay is, it's like they thought of everything and included a rough draft of their ideas.  It's actually inspiring.  But more than anything it is confusing.  I still really have no idea how to attack an enemy.  At first, you are in the training zone and no enemies attack you so you are free to attack them.  I binded kicking and punching to '5' and '6' on the keyboard (the only options, as 1-4 are used for other items, meanwhile I am using an Xbox controller for everything else) and the attacking doesn't seem to work as it should.  Very first possible sighting of an actual enemy and they just instantly kill you.  Then after death it enters this altered state where you need to find a campfire to escape and the enemies are faster and harder, but if you die again it doesn't even really matter, you wind up back at home anyway.  According to the game lore, you are sent to an alternate dimension http://i.imgur.com/9SyaKCj.jpg\n\nThey also seem to try to copy the lore of Pokemon...  The main character seems to look a lot like the Ash character from the series (although slightly creepier) and it's all about fighting the gym leaders.  Even the very first town is called Oak Town.  But I would think in those types of games you would have a bunch of minions but I haven't been introduced to those types of mechanics yet.  As much explaining as they have done, it's just hard to understand how to play.  I can't honestly recommend this game, but if you do end up with a copy.. try it out.  It's weird enough to play for a bit.","December 20, 2015","false","4.9"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","30","37","0","3"

It has graphics reminiscent of Nintendo DS Pokemon games, a slightly confusing sound, and gameplay that is just too confusing to make sense of.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics for this game are fine and I actually like them. However the graphics are hindered significantly by a cluttered HUD (Heads-up Display) and side menus that just take up the whole screen. It’s to the point where the user cannot even see the graphics, let alone enjoy them.\n\nSound\nThe sound is decent, it’s nothing special. The only issue I really had with the sound is that there was this an annoying barking noise that seemed to be part of the soundtrack and it only served to irritate me to the highest degree.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is the weakest part of this game. It’s absolutely horrendous and atrocious to put it mildly. Basically, the game throws a storyline and gameplay information at you that is so hard to make sense of. It tries to stuff two hours of plot and gameplay tutorials into two minutes and it just does not work.\n\nPros & Cons\nPros:\n•	The graphics are really cool and brought back nostalgia of Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver on the Nintendo DS.\n•	The soundtrack isn’t too bad apart from the barking noise I described earlier.\n•	The story has a lot of potential.\n\nCons:\n•	The screen is too cluttered by text and menus.\n•	The barking noise is extremely annoying.\n•	The gameplay is near non-existent because it’s so hard to understand.\n\nOverall Thoughts\nThis game is a disaster, just don’t even mess with it right now. However, in fairness, it is in Early Access and is self-admitting when it comes to the fact that it is far from a complete product. It has a ton of potential, it’s just up to the Developers on whether they want to make a proper foundation for that potential to flourish and blossom. As of right now, that potential is not being utilized properly.","December 17, 2015","false","4.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hatec/recommended/418430/","Hatec","Lewis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hatec/","1746 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSome feedback:\n- Opening Menu: The Opening Menu to the game where you can choose to continue or start a game is so ugly and hard to read. What's with some of the fonts in this game?\n- Graphics: Nothing seems to match. Everything looks like it's from a different game. I would say hire a real pixel artist but some of the sprites are okay. Also why are some of the characters transparent? The sun and moon look like they were found on Google Images. A lot of the text is unreadable at certain points.\n- Gameplay: Character movement feels very stiff and slow, a lot of room for improvement. I personally don't want to play games that control like this. It was okay when Pokemon did it in the 90s but that was a long time ago. The game has tutorials and training, but the character dialogue is so hard to understand at times I can't follow a lot of it.\n\nHopefully it being in Early Access means something. Best of luck to the developer. I'll have to try this game again in the future and see how it improves.","February 21","false","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's more likely than you think!\n\n"Survive Me Miolhr" is an RPG based game with a zombie theme. When I first played the game, it reminded me a lot of the old 90's Pokémon. Not only does the gameplay remind me of Pokémon, but the main character looks similar to Ash. At first, I had a great nostalgic feeling. However, I was very disappointed when I encountered one of the many bugs in this game. Despite the crashes and bugs, the similarities to Pokémon kept me motivated. I continued to play, and I recommend it even with those errors.\n\n\nPros:\nAny non-ancient PC can handle the game. If you want to check if you can handle the game, go to "canyourunit.com".\nGood choice of sound, it is a little repetitive but it does fit the game very well.\nVery nice graphics, I love the nostalgic feeling this game gives you.\nI appreciate the storyline in this game. The first few hours are a bit confusing, but after this short struggle, it makes sense and is a positive addition.\nMotivating achievements, very easy to unlock.\nTraining mode which gives you a taste of the game and teaches you how to play it.\nAwesome developer, who takes suggestions into account.\nThis game is great for experienced players. It starts out tough, which is nice for a good challenge.\nCons:\nThe keyboard controls could use some fine-tuning. It would be more user-friendly to have one row of controls, instead of what it is right now.\nWhile I like the sounds overall, there is a barking noise that is irritating. I would prefer if it was removed.\nThere are several bugs and crashes due to the game still being in Early Access. They are being looked at by the developer and should be fixed by the time it is fully released, so I can forgive this.\nThe tutorial could provide some more information on certain items, including details about keys.\nThere are typos in the game and on the store page. A proofreader would be helpful.\nThe character controls a bit stiffly, and is slower than needed. I would like the movements to be smoother.\n\nOverall experience:\n\nThe concept of "Survive Me Miolhr" is good. Its unique flare and compelling story makes it worth playing. It has a lot to improve on, but as an Early Access game, this is to be expected. I recommend giving it a try, either in Early Access or when it is fully developed. Certainly Pokémon lovers would find something in common with it, but it has other appealing elements too.\n\n\nRating:\n\nI rate this game 6/10 for its Early Access score. When it has been fixed up, I will bump that number up accordingly!"\n","March 23","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
