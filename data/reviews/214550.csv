The menu is non existant the only thing i can tell you is that you can turn game music or audio on or off. The game starts windowed and there is no option to fullscreen. You can use Alt+Enter to make it fullscreen regardless and it will nicely scale without changing your resolution. Now in fullscreen the problem is that you can't reach your Windows volume control anymore so you should preset this.\n\nControls:\nYou control the game with your mouse. No controller support though that doesn't really fit here anyway. There are moments where you control devices with your keyboard however those are not rebindable.\n\nIngame:\nOfcourse this is what you really need to look at incase of mobile games. You are presented with colourful worlds in which you need to guide your character Eets through cases of emotional distress and to the cake. Reaching the cake can be easy or very challenging. Remembering that there are physics involved for example shooting Eets off a platform with a cannon. There are a good set of items available to help you progress for example Chili's that make Eets angry and jump higher, Bounce flowers to launch Eets in a set direction or bombs to blow away walls.\n\nDid you beat all the levels? Try some of the user made levels or create your own with the steam workshop or puzzle creator.\n\nAchievements:\nThere are 14 of them and are mostly linked to beating the game.\n\nDLC:\nNot available.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you have some spare change and you like cute 2D puzzle games then this is a good one.","November 11, 2014","true","16.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

It is impossible to recommend this for 7 bucks because its an overpriced app at that point. its weird locked resolution and gameplay design (using the 3 stars per level system) just reinforce that. The levels range from easy (place the items and press go) to pull-out-your-hair hard, but not in the "Oh, it just requires some advanced logic" way, but in the  "Oh, I have to put these in the correct spot DOWN TO THE PIXEL, so I spend time trying to get it correct over and over, despite knowing how to complete the level" and it just feels unfair sometimes. To the games credit the latter assorment of levels are few in number. But...then again...there aren't a lot of levels to begin with. Eh. Only played this past the 2nd world or so for the easy 100% game.","June 26, 2014","false","2.8"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","1"

Puzzles are either ridiculously easy or incredibly hard due to countless errors in timing. Think of it like the puzzles in Portal 2 compared to Portal: you understand how to set up the puzzle and you should get it done properly, but if your timing is off than your work is for nothing.\n\nNot to mention of course that the only changes since the "beta" version were 2 other worlds, one of them being the "mystery" world, which is chock-full of those timing oriented puzzles.\n\nToo easy, too short, and too little. Maybe buy this on iOS when it's cheaper and they plan on updating with more levels.","March 14, 2014","false","4.8"," 48 of 76 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","48","76","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ordaku/recommended/214550/","ordaku","Mikasa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ordaku/","462 products in account","OVERALL: 73%\nGameplay & Controls: 4/5 ♥s\nGraphics & Visuals: 4/5 ♥s\nMusic & Audio: 3/5 ♥s\n\nEets Munchies is an adorably animated puzzle game starring a furry white rabbit/flea amalgamation, one which I honestly can't determine if cute or creepy. It's a relatively simple-to-pick up game with basic controls and (for the most part) a friendly interface; this, combined with a gradual learning curve, helps Eets live up to its all-ages claims. It's a surprisingly fun game to play, and I couldn't help but find myself enjoying each level.\n\n-Gameplay & Controls-\nThe game revolves around placing a series of wooden platforms and powerups while triggering different mechanisms to help our friend Eets get to a brightly colored cake at the end of each level. Along the way, the player can also grab different candies as a sort of optional collectible; gathering the different collectibles became rather challenging as time went on. While the concept is simple, navigating through each puzzle becomes an overall enjoyable experience. With the addition of Steam Workship, the amount of puzzles for Eets to navigate is essentially endless, which should keep at least a few ingenuous players coming back for more.\n\n-Graphics & Visuals-\nDespite some initial awkwardness, I found Eets to be rather graphically charming. The different machinations and animals he uses to help him on his way are lively and animated, and I couldn't help but fall in love with the Inhale Whales. Each individual World is visually different, and in some cases rather distinctive, although I have to say that I didn't much like the desert motiff of World Two. However, the game gives off an aura of 2D eye-candy after one's intial impressions, so I have to say I'm rather sold on most of the designs.\n\n-Music & Audio-\nThe tracks in Eets Munchies are rather upbeat and whimsical, although after making it few the first world or two they start to become repetitive. They're overall quite enjoyable, and they certainly add some appropraite ambience for some an adorable title, but one could have hoped for a bit more diversity as far as music goes.\n\n-Final Thoughts-\nOverall, Eets Munchies is a rather enjoyable yet simple experience for the casual puzzle gamer. It's fun and charming, and has a learning curve suitable for just about everyone. I have to say that I wasn't planning on liking the game at all when I first started playing, but it ended up winning me over within the first ten levels, and I found myself striving for every collectible. I think it's worth getting if just to play in some spare time, although I wouldn't say it's meant to be experienced in long sessions as it can struggle as far as holding one's interest. Ultimately, the game is surprisingly fun to play, and I have to say that I would recommend.","March 11, 2014","true","2.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirUseless/recommended/214550/","SirUseless","Seabeast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirUseless/","173 products in account","Eets Munchies Review\n\nI originally got this game when it was in beta through a Humble Bundle a little while ago. I believe I tried it once and then just never got around to playing it more. When I first tried Eets Munchies I instantly fell in love with the cartoony style and feel of the game. The music is very fitting and also enjoyable to listen to.\n\nThat was back in the Beta, now that it has been updated I have to say that I am very impressed. I am so glad I thought of starting this game up again just to see that it now had achievements and steam workshop support to make your own levels! I can definitely see myself playing this for hours just trying to get all the treats in every level.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it is a very relaxing and casual indie game with 48 regular levels in 4 differently themed worlds plus a mystery world which has 12 unlockable levels which are significantly more difficult than the other levels in the game. While playing the game you get introduced to a bunch of different mechanics that spice up the puzzle solving quite a bit. The gameplay is very enjoyable and I like the fact that you can switch between three different speeds ranging from slow to fast.\n\nThe controls and puzzle maker are great and the animation is bloody fantastic. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for or want to play a casual and extremely enjoyable game. The concept of having 3 treats to collect in every level and the more treats you collect the more items you unlock in the puzzle maker is great and it makes for a very nice and a little bit addicting game to play when you want to relax from all your hardcore competitive fps shooters(am I right?).\n\nTo sign this review off I feel like I need to state that as a person who is a little bit of an achievement junkie or whatnot this game is absolutely worth it, even if it wouldn't have had achievements I would still have recommended it. Although we all love achievements so what is there to complain about? Some people might say that 6,99€ or your regional equivalent is too much to ask for but I don't think so, in my honest opinion this game is worth atleast 7€. My advise is that you should buy this as soon as you get a chance to, but if you don't want to then don't ;)\n\n- Liam","April 26, 2014","true","6.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I’d recommend this type of game for a phone, or small portable device.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Your goal is to help Eets (the little white bug looking creature) reach the end of the level, you want to collect the 3 food items also, as an extra challenge. As you collect the food and the cake at the end of the level you unlock items you can use in your own Steamworkshop puzzles.\n\nGame Play: The game itself felt like an app I would play on an apple computer inside the computer store. The buttons themselves actually look like ones used on Angry Birds, so I’m pretty sure that’s how you should be playing this game, but it worked flawlessly with my mouse.\nIt’s a point and click game, that about sums it up. Before you start the game you are given a select few items to set down, then you play and use those items to help Eets finish the level.\n\nAchievements: I had no trouble with the achievements, once I had finished the game as far as I could go (I only had to skip about 4 levels, and still had most of the secret levels left), the rest of the achievements you can look up helpful guides. Basically think of this game as a free “100%” for your steam profile. Pretty neat, I think. :D\n\nPrice: Eets Munchies current price is $6.99, I had actually commented to one of my friends “I’m playing a 5 dollar game… this is great xD  “ I had no idea what the actual price was. I acquired this game through a humblebundle but this is the first time that the price has been nearly spot on for the value. You can play games that will eat up (pun not intended) more time for the same price. But this game is asking a fair price.\n\nConclusion: I enjoyed the game, it was short, quick, and to the point. I recommend this game.","May 14, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This time, I don't. Because this game can literally burn in hell for all I care.\n\nYou know, my first impressions of the game was fine, and it continued on for a while. If the game had ended at the Windy Peaks, I would have given this a positive review. But nooo, it didn't end there. Enter the Mystery levels, where the game designers clearly didn't know anymore how to design a puzzle.\n\nLevels that are taped at the end of the game are usually there to test your skills that you have learned throughout the game, and so does this game by putting all the obstacles you have seen into these levels. I'm not complaining there. The problem here is that 90% of the puzzles suck because they weren't created properly.\n\nIf you know how to solve a puzzle, it shouldn't be a problem. And believe me, I knew how to solve them and where to put the obstacles etc. No, they decided for the final levels that you are required to put the obstacles pixel perfect and that you click on them just at the right millisecond, otherwise you ain't gonna pass. And that, is terrible game design. And let's not forget this Elephant obstable that just does whatever the hell he wants.\n\nIf it wasn't for the Mystery levels, I would say get this game. But unfortunately, they ARE part of the game, and they bring down the entire game too. Klei Entertainment, I appreciate your work, but if you don't know how to create puzzles, you shouldn't make a puzzle game.","March 8, 2015","false","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Eets can only walk straight and is dumb enough to jump into pits of certain death. Your task is to basically "guide him" to the cake, optionally feeding him other candies, puddings and whatnot on your path. Eath puzzle gives you 3 candies and 1 cake. Whereas you cannot directly interact with Eets, you can change his path by laying down items on the ground (which may modify the scenario or Eets' behaviour). There are 5 "Worlds", each with 12 puzzles, the last of which is an extra "Mystery World" which does not contain any candies - just the cake.\n\nI like to brag that I like puzzle games (and that is true). I got this game (like most) in a bundle and didn't expect much. The cartoon-ish graphics, the silly music and the very concept made this title sound like a child game, but you will quickly be surprised. After the first world you will actually have think quite hard to grab all the candies. As a puzzle game lover, I found every single puzzle fair and reasonable, no "dirty tricks" needed.\n\nSadly the replayability value is low.\n\nThe achievements are well designed and flow naturally with the game, but sadly they don't add any extra challenge that the game does not already naturally offer.\n\nThe Linux port is flawless.\n\nGo and get it if you like puzzles.","February 11","true","9.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Definently worth to play if you have spare but not on long periods of time.\n\nOVERALL: 75%\n\nGameplay: 5/5\nGraphics : 4/5\nMusic: 3/5\n","June 18, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Its not too long where you just get sick of it, so it is enjoyable to play all the way through. Also the puzzles are pretty challenging, which makes for some brain teasers and fun to play with another person to figure them out. The only time the game really started to ♥♥♥♥ me off was during the mystery challenges when timing and acuraccy are all of a sudden extremely important. other than that placement and timing of the puzzles is not too big of an issue. Also what kinda had me sold on this game was the art style definelty makes it very inviting and almost appear as a kid game but is still very challenging for everyone. Really enjoyed the creativeness of the different items, and am glad there are so many items to keep the game interesting all the way through. Also the devs did great at coming up with the puzzles some of them are a tad baffeling in my opinion of how they play through. All in all a solid game, worth the price, and fun for all.","November 5, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

He will walk until he either reaches a wall or obstacle, when he will turn around, or when he reaches a ledge, where he will (usually) jump. This is usually not enough to reach the cake on its own, so you have to help him, using a variety of passive or activated items.\n\nThese range from wooden platforms/barricades, or items that will change Eets' mood to angry or frightened. The levels are small and only have a few items each, so it's usually fairly easy to tell what the game wants you to do, but it still feels clever when you pull it off, thanks to the nice animation and relaxing soundtrack. There are some physics and timing related puzzles, but they're not too common and usually not so bad. The game's not very long, so maybe get it on a discount if you don't have it, but if you really like puzzles I'd say it's worth full price.","February 21, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It shares simmilar art style and sound design as Angry Birds, but instead of blowing up piglets you have to guide a white bunny so he would eat the treats. It's easy to get all 3 treats in first levels, but the further you progress, the more difficult it gets. Unfortunatelly, the only difficult sections in this game are "mystery Levels" that you unlock by acing regular levels. After you complete all the regular levels i highly suggest to complete mystery levels which are most satisfying to complete because it takes precise item placement and timing. It is also really good measure to relief stress as the game visuals and sound design keeps you relaxed all the time. Overall 7/10, pretty neat, game that will make you relax.

While I was a fan of the original Eets Chowdown (in fact, one of the first DLC I ever got on the Xbox 360) I do admit it had some flaws, most glaring of which was the precision of the puzzles combined with how very easy and tempting it was to just go "Give me the solution", and cheat your way to victory. While Eets Munchies has the same "Give me the solution" option, I'll be honest- I don't feel as tempted to actually USE it: So far the precision of the items is not as pixel perfect as the original, and those times where you do put something in the wrong place don't feel as frustrating.\nAnother great improvement is the music. Sound effects are replaced with a bunch of notes reminesent of the old Warner Bro's Coyote and Roadrunner cartoons, where Eets foot steps are punctuated by music depending on his mood.  Given that Eets is now no longer 3D rendered, and is now 2D animation, this also makes it tons easier to tell what his mood IS exactly (a feature that previously had to be conveyed in a little close-up image of Eets- especially if Eets starts off the level in the air.)\nAdd to that a level editor, and I'd say Eets is now a much better game then it's first outing.","March 12, 2014","true","24.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a handful of placeable items I have seen so far, some that change the state of the world like bombs, some that change the state of Eets like buffs to jumping or removing the ability to jump entirely.  There are also items that you interact with in real time like cannons or whales that act as jump pads.\n\nEets Munchies comes with a puzzle maker and has Steam workshop support so you can make puzzles to share with friends and strangers alike. Overall i've got to say that Eets is a stand up puzzle game, it may be small but I have not seen any negative quality's so far, its got neat art and a decent soundtrack that fits the style.

It just feels like a Tabletapp so much that its even refelected in the price I would pay for it if interested.\n\nThe Puzzles of the first World were so easy i burned them in under 20min. Thought I would play it to 100% during the "play for free" event.... but then came World 2. It increased in difficutly, stayed fair and fun. Basic Mechanic is to find a way for Munchies to the final Cake. He can walk and run and eating things influences his behavior. But in World 2 I also noticed I didnt liked how items, shooting things/activating things, and munchies Pathfinding is handeld. Overall you have to make up a good plan at several stages by setting up the items. Then it gets to a hasted click Item 1 > 2 > 3 at sometimes very specific moments. For sure fun on Tablets but annoying af when doing it with a mouse. So its not a game for me cause of this buuuut...\n\n- The Character, Level and Itemdesign is very well done and Munchie is a likable little fella i wouldnt mind seeing in another game (jump&run for example).\n- The Mechanics are challenging with a fair learning curve\n- It has harder Challenges that can be unlocked (Wupwup, unlocks! :) )\n- The Music/Ambient of the game is fitting and over the short period i tested it, I didnt made me turn it down for my own tracklist. Thats a big thing for a Puzzlegame i think.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #55 - Eets Munchies\n\nEets Munchies is a puzzle game that took me back to my days playing Lemmings.  You play as Eets and his single-minded quest to get cake.  But Eets is not terribly smart.  In fact he'll happily hop of a ledge into oblivion if you let him.\n\nTo avoid that, the trick is to strategically place items that will help Eets get to his goal of eating his cake.   You place these items prior to starting the level.  Some items are simple like planks that you can place for Eets to walkover.  But other items that you place you click to interact with, and these items will interact with the environment.  Take for example the "Inhale Whale" which you click on and it will inhale Eets and then exhale him to move him up at an angle.\n\nI also was reminded of Angry Birds as I continued to progress through levels and the game would introduce new kinds of items to use that work in different ways.  Another reminder is the way each level has the basic goal of getting to the cake, but also a secondary goal of getting up to 3 additional treats.  It's pretty easy to make it to the cake and progress to the next level, but the game awards you for getting each of the 3 treats as well, which is where the game can get tricky.\n\nI adored the art style.  It has a zany cartoon feel, like something I'd see in Ren & Stimpy.  And the sound effects are matched perfectly with the art.  I thought they did some nice work here.  My only complaint is the music starts feeling repetitive after awhile, but as far as complaints go that's pretty minor.\n\nOne other thing that sets this game apart is the level editor.  I thought this was a really cool touch to add.  The level editor is pretty easy to use, it's basically just drag and drop.  You can build the levels and populate it with the items that you've unlocked from regular play.\n\nI definitely appreciated the inclusion of the level editor as I think that helps add replay value.  I remember playing Angry Birds, and never found myself really replaying levels once I beat them.  I definitely would have felt the same about this game, so it's nice to have the level editor to make your own levels, or get your own from Steam Workshop.\n\nYou might be a little turned off by the price, as there are definitely cheaper puzzle games to be had (particularly on mobile).  But the game is undeniably fun, and given the high potential for replayability, I still think it's a fine value.","April 3","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is casual on some levels while merciless in others. The fact that it is clearly a mobile game for touchscreens is apparent from the UI as well as puzzles. I will not hold it against it though because it works well on PC, even going as far as integrating Steamworks. This grants the game a possibly endless array of user-created levels. Sadly one of the achievements is to create a level and publish it and so Steamworks is flooded with low-quality levels.

The puzzle is basically to get the main character to the final cake, ideally collecting the 3 bonus items. Some of the items will change the mood of the character, and in different moods the character will react in different ways, for example if the character eats a pepper he will get angry and walk faster and jump farther.

I'm afraid I found it "meh" at best.  After a few levels I was already wondering how soon this would end...  The game is clearly made for smartphones as it's a rehash of the simple "get 3 items and reach the exit" idea.  In fact, it's probably better on smartphones than on PC, as there's no full screen grfx, and when you do enlarge the window the grfx do look too big.\n\nWhile just completing a level is pretty easy, however if you are someone who must get every 'pie' before the exit then this game will be quite difficult in the later worlds.  Especially so on the challenge levels (aka Mystery Levels) which have no hints and are very different from the previous "worlds".  I was finally able to complete one of the Mystery Levels after first attempting 5 or so of them.\n\nWhile the game is fairly polished, it just isn't very exciting or new.  It is, however, thankfully short -- I was able to complete all the levels in 2.5 hrs (except the Mystery Levels).\n\n6 out of 10.","January 2, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't feel very challenged during this time until i reached the mystery levels where the difficulty spiked to amazing proportions.\nThe game also feels like a phone app game. Imagine a game that would have micro transactions for puzzle packs but instead you paid 7 dollars to just buy the game at a flat price.\n\nAt this time I recommend the game if it is on sale, get it at 5 USD or less.

Levels range from laughably easy to table-flippingly hard, but in the end, it's just the same ol' thing, just with a bunny reskin.  It's not even that high quality as far as PC puzzle games go.\n\nI enjoyed it for about the first 15 minutes before getting bored.  I somehow managed to clock enough time to get the steam trading cards, but I doubt I will touch this game again.\n\nHonestly, I cannot imagine why anyone would pay $$$ for this game when free alternatives exist to sate one's appetite for puzzle games.  I only have it because it was included in a humble bundle.\n\nIf this game goes on a ridiculous sale (like, maybe 90%?) it might be worth picking up if you like creating your own levels and putting them on the workshop.  Otherwise, pass.","June 20, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This detriment contributes to the overall scant length of the game, but that's easily remedied if you are willing to dive into the abundant trove of user generated content available on the steam workshop.\n\nDespite the flaws though, the game does flourish a very attractive art style with equally appealing character animations. And the included level editor is easy to pick up and use.","June 22, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let the name fool you, at times, Eets Munchies can be insanely difficult. This game is definitely not for the weak minded and the non-strategically inclined. At times, the difficulty of it can destroy the level of fun, so for that, I give it a 3.5 out of 5. Is it a fun game? Sure. Is it worth your money? Maybe somewhere around $2 of it, but nothing more. So unless you get this game as a part of a bundle sale or a holiday sale, don't buy it. If you do happen to come across this game, it's worth playing, but the amount of playtime this requires is the equivalency of a 15 minute break on a 6 hour shift, or a snickers bar after a 7 day famine. Enough to keep you on your toes, but highly dis-satisfying. All in all, I'm undecided on this title.
