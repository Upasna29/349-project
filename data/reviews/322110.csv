"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/322110/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n20XXDeveloper: Batterystaple Games\nPublisher: Batterystaple Games\n\nNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an unbiased, informative review. No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nI grew up playing the Mega Man and Mega Man X series on the NES and SNES, and then the PS1. Anytime I find a game similar to Mega Man, I get my hopes up and try it out, only to be disappointed. Capcom has been giving Mega Man fans the middle finger for several years now, while Mighty No. 9 has been delayed until 2016. All hope seemed lost.\n\nBut then I found 20XX. It's not exactly a Mega Man title, and I keep making that comparison. Why? Because it is an action-platformer that's heavily inspired by Mega Man. What's interesting is that it combines the mechanics and gameplay of an action platformer like Mega Man with those of a rogue-like. And it's amazing. It scratches that Mega Man itch in all the right ways! Even though it's Early Access, I can see how great this game is going to be in the future, and I fully support it.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nI apologize in advance, but I am going to make a lot of comparisons to Mega Man during this review. If you have played a Mega Man title, then you know what to expect. There are 2 playable characters: Nina and Ace. Nina is the equivalent of Mega Man or X, a ranged character who shoots emenies from afar. Ace is the equivalent of ProtoMan or Zero, a character who favors melee combat with his saber. Both characters are able to jump, dash, wall-climb, wall-jump, and charge their basic attacks into Power attacks.\n\nThe game also has all the typical elements of a rogue-like: There is perma-death and it has randomly generated levels. Once you die, your run is over and you have to restart from scratch in the Ark (the game's Hub). In the Ark, you can switch between Nina and Ace, take on Daily and Hardcore Challenges, invite a friend to play with you, buy items, and activate Skulls--extra gameplay modifiers. Let's go over each of those things in turn.\n\nDaily and Hardcore challenges are just that: Extra stages that you can access once a day for some extra challenge. Hardcore is very, very difficult, with more monsters and less power-ups.\n\nWhen you choose multiplayer, you can opt to play locally with a friend, or invite a friend via the Steam client from your friends list. Multiplayer is very smooth, with hardly any bugs. I have read of some minor glitches on the forums, but I never experienced any personally. Co-op is a fun addition to this title, and something a mainline Mega Man game has never had.\n\nAt the shop, you are able to purchase items with Soul Nuts, which are dropped by monsters with a blue glow or aura in each stage. They'll drop anywhere from 1 to 5 Soul Nuts from what I've seen. Items bought from the shop then have a chance of appearing in each stage, so make it a point to buy what you can to improve your survivability each run! You will also find normal Nuts in each stage, which you can use during each run to buy health and power-ups from shops you find mid-run. These are good places to bolster yourself for the challenges ahead, provided you pick up any Nuts you find.\n\nOne of the extra features 20XX boasts is the Bonus Timer. In the top-left of the screen is a timer, usually a few minutes. If you reach the end of each stage and defeat the boss before the timer ticks down to zero, you get an extra bonus item at the end of the stage. Speaking of which, after each boss you are treated to  a room where you can choose 1 of 3 items, in addition to 1-2 bonus items depending on your bonus timer. You can then choose from 1 of 3 stages to play next. Stages get harder as you go, with enemies doing more damage and having more health. There are about 6-8 different stages and bosses, with more on the way in future updates. The nature of rogue-likes helps to keep things fresh!\n\nSkulls are extra gameplay modifiers, which serve to increase the difficulty of the game for added challenge. You can activate as many as you want at once...but only if you are feeling brave! They range from things like poisoning you when your bonus timer runs out, or disabling healing items from appearing. Choose wisely if you decide to take on these challenges!\n\nGraphics\n==========\nEverything is sprite-based, but they are so very detailed! The animations are fluid and look very good. I honestly don't have any problems with how things look. The character designs in the trailers and what's in-game now say a lot about how the game is slowly improving. Enemies look great as well, and there is a lot of variety between models. There is some simple recoloring though, but not much.\n\nThe little details here and there are really what make the game. Things like the little charge gauge on Nina's Buster. The 3 little sections light up as your are charging a Power Attack. The Dash effect looks great, with little afterimages left in your wake.\n\nAll the power-up icons look really sharp, and are easily distinguishable. Attack animations look smooth and well-crafted. Ace's saber strike combo is great, something they added based on player feedback from what I've read.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe music is perfect for the game. Upbeat, dramatic, and heart-pounding. It was composed by a guy named Brandon Ellis, also known as Cityfires. I've never heard of him, but I like his work with 20XX. The developers have said the soundtrack will be available for purchase, possibly in a bundle with the game, in the future.\n\nThe sound effects are great. Attacks, charged shots, saber slashes, taking damage, death, enemies...all of it is very clear. Picking up items and power-ups has a very satisfying little jingle, very reminiscent of how Mega Man handled items.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThe game runs beautifully. I observed a full 60FPS the entirety of my playtime (you can see the FPS counter at the bottom left of my videos, found below), even with a lot of action on-screen during a Hardcore run. 20XX has full controller support, in fact a controller is HIGHLY recommended. The default controls are very good, but can be reassigned to fit any player's tastes. They are very tight and responsive.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\n20XX is an excellent action-platformer, and an excellent rogue-like. Tons of features and additions are on the way, which promises this game to be quite amazing the more it develops. The developers have even taken a very ballsy step: there is a timer on the title screen counting down to the next update. For Early Access, this creates a very volatile situation between devs and players if these updates and promises aren't kept. So far, from what I've read, this timer has never lied! They are also very active within the community, and frequently respond to player questions and feedback. This is how you do Early Access, people!\n\nIf you like Mega Man/Action-platformers or rogue-likes, give 20XX a shot. I promise you will not be disappointed.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nNina:\nhttps://youtu.be/VY14McN7n74\nAce:\nhttps://youtu.be/p6CM7R23vfI\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 12, 2015","true","39.4"," 64 of 74 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","64","74","2","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alwaysydgn/recommended/322110/","alwaysydgn","ydg?!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alwaysydgn/","55 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you love Mega Man, Mega Man X, or Mega Man Zero.... Get this game immediately. Seriously, don't even read the rest of this review, it's a waste of your time, you could be playing 20XX. If you aren't hooked already, don't worry, this game is definitely good enough to stand on its own merits.\n\nMega Man X (or Zero, if you play Ace like me) meets roguelike: the game in a nutshell. You play through the game as Nina or Ace. Nina is a ranged character with a buster capable of charged shots, while Ace is a melee character with a three hit combo, though he can also charge the first swing of his sword for double damage. The characters function the same, essentially, though Ace has just a tiny bit more natural mobility and hp than Nina to accomodate his gameplay style (go fast, kill, repeat).\n\nYou go through a tutorial run which does a very nice job of explaining the gameplay mechanics via gameplay and small sections of on screen text, but after that... heheh. During runs you come across chests. Break these suckers open to acquire: health/energy/nuts, upgrades that can give you boosts to stats, such as attack or speed, upgrades that can grant new abilities, like double jumping, mid-air dashing, orbital shields, etc., or switch out your standard weapon for something a little more shiny, all of which can dramatically change how you play the game from that very point forward, or at the very least keep you alive ;) You may also find vending machines for health or energy. They'll keep you in good condition... provided you have the cash. At the end of your run you fight a boss! Go figure. Beat his ♥♥♥ and then you can either take his power, some cash, or a low-tier upgrade. Beat the stage before the bonus timer runs out and you get an additional chest with who knows what inside!\n\nWhat keeps things interesting? As you beat levels, the following levels become more difficult. More enemies.TOUGHER enemies. More obstacles. Harder platforming. Stronger bosses. The longer you go, the harder it gets, in every way. Hopefully you've been stacking those upgrades and earning some nuts... However if you find the normal run too easy, or just not enough fun... Turn some skull modifiers on. Double the length of all levels, make even MORE enemies spawn, make those enemies act faster and hit harder, turn level obstacles into instant death, do a run with no nuts (hahahaha...), no stat boost drops, make it so the game doesn't end until you die or are done with being immortal. It's up to you.\n\nCO-OP?!?!?! That's right, you can do two player runs, either locally or online! You can choose either character, there is no "You're Tails, I'M SONIC" bs. In local co-op, the screen will expand to fit both players according to the distance between them (similar to Smash Bros. if you've played that), but online, you get your default screen view. Items drop for players the same way but will be labeled with "P1, P2" for their respective player.  Right now the game is in beta, so online play... it's not perfect, but by no means should you avoid it entirely. There's a bit of lag, and some bugs in the safehouse, but a solid experience nonetheless.\n\nUSE A CONTROLLER. It says to use an X360 but... anything similar is probably okay (I use a logitech f310 gamepad). The controls are super tight, exactly like the titles that inspired this one. The level design can honestly be a tad frustrating at times, but if you remember to open your eyes, breathe, and think about what you're doing, you'll get through it (also unlock double-jump as soon as you can lol).\n\nYeah right now the game is $11.99? Final sale price will be $15. Worth every penny now, and this game is trending up. There is a lot care put into this game and it shows. Buy it, add me as a friend, and I'll wreck shop with you.\n\n10/10 <3","January 27","true","113.5"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","22","23","3","0"

It plays and even looks like Megaman X, but in higher definition and add in a bunch of permadeath and random generation into the mix.\n\nOnce in the game you'll be platforming and shooting / slicing baddies until you reach the end where you'll fight a boss in an arena style setting, much like Megaman games. You can also collect various upgrades and weapons while traversing the RNG levels. These upgrades vary from passive effects, such as increase HP or attack power, to active effects such as a new primary weapon, or special ability. You'll also be able to dash, super jump, and you'll be utilizing the best of your platforming and side scrolling action skills.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrpovimyNgE\nThe gameplay stay true to the Megaman formula but since it throws in a bunch of roguelike elements, such as RNG levels and enemy placement, it does suffer from level design when compared to the game's inspiration. Megaman games have always been known for challenging but memorable levels. With 20XX's dependence on randomly generated levels, it doesn't have the same impact in level design as original Megaman games. To contrast this critique, what the game gives up in hand designed levels, it makes up in replayablity, and variety. The game also offers 2 characters to play as. Nina, and Ace. I feel the game needs to take a look into the balance of the 2 characters, as Ace is by far much easier to use and often I do much better with him as a result.\n\nThe art and sound design are great. It emulates Megaman X games well, except brought into the modern age of 1080 and 60FPS. I don't have much complaints about it's presentation. Every thing about how the game look and sound does a great job of paying tribute to it's inspiration.\n\nOverall 20XX is a very enjoyable roguelike/lite and the idea of mixing Megaman mechanics into the genre paid off. I feel the 2 genres are a great mix that seem so obvious once you play it!\n\nPros:\n- Excellent tribute to Megaman games\n- Plays and feels great!\n- Lots of replayablity and experimentation potential\n\nCons:\n- Reliance on RNG level design show some flaws\n- Some minor imbalances between the 2 selectable characters\n\n20XX hours played: 1.5\n\nCompletion Status on 20XX: N/A\n\nThis copy of 20XX was given by the developers for review","August 19, 2015","true","1.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","0"

Firstly, this game is great, and it deserves your support.  If you enjoy the Megaman series of games or action platformers in general this is a no brainer.  It's an awesome roguelike in the style of Megaman with two playable characters and a good variety of enemies and level layouts.  You can find items in levels or at the end, with bonus incentives for completing a level quickly enough, and you unlock more of them as you play.  It's still early access, so there's a lot to come, but even as it stands I wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nHowever, this game has so much more going for it than just what there is so far.\nFirstly, it's a totally reasonable price at $12, it'll go up a bit at official release, but even still I'd happily pay $20 or even a bit more with enough additional features.  Speaking of additional content, there's a timer on the title screen telling you when the next update with additional content is going to come out (about 5 days to the next as of writing this review) which is a level of accountability I've not seen in an early access game.  There are so many out there that you'll hear nothing from for months at a time, and they make a point of telling you at any time how long until more content comes out.\n\nLastly, the devs are great.  I read through other reviews and saw ones mentioning them giving feedback and listening to fans (such as adding in a three hit saber combo rather than just the same animation) which is always cool.  Then I had my own awesome experience with them.  I sent in some feedback with bugs I'd seen and ideas I had and within a few hours got an email from one of the devs who wasn't even in the office at the time thanking me for my feedback.  That's incredibly cool and fairly unprecedented from my own experience.\n\nSeriously, this is an awesome game made by awesome people and you should get it if you're even remotely interested.","July 31, 2015","true","11.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

The overall animations and general movement feels a bit off from a Megaman-like game. Megatroid on Android captures the feel of a Megaman-like game better than this and it's horribly mobile.\n\nBut why would I still recommend this? Well because of two reasons. 1. Thing may be ironed out and more polished by release. 2. The game is still solid enough and definately has the vibe of Megaman X games with Zero too.","December 12, 2015","true","7.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","13","14","3","0"

Not just this, but discerning the forground from background should not be an issue in platformers. The level design seems a bit jumbled, as if enemies were placed in areas without given much thought as to where the players would be in that instance. It's a rogue-like and enemies are procedurally generated? Great! Think about how each enemy would impact that location with it being there. There was actually a level with dozens of moving walkways and rotating platforms that unintentionally created a very false sense of difficulty, and it simply didn't feel rewarding, it just felt poorly made. The levels seemed like they were user-created by amateurs. A procedurally generated game should take into account of the possible variations of design for the best possible experience for the players. I had the same problem with the levels when a dozen of completely random enemies appeared from a lower platform. There was no challenge, everyone was just clumped up in one spot. It just broke immersion and made the experience sour.\n\nThis game can definitely be what it's looking to achieve with some tweaking! These problems are actually not related to the games core engine. Controls feel tight, and the characters do what you want, when you want. The soundtrack is pretty catchy, and having a different pallete for the same character was a nice touch.\n\nThe game is Early Access currently, so I'm currently judging it in its current state. It seems to be trending that pretty much all indie Steam games never truly make it to their final version, which I heavily dislike. If you're one of the people working on this game and are currently reading this, then pat yourself on the back! This game can really be something,  but you CANNOT give up on working on the project simply because the initial purchases have gone through. I've seen it time and time again.\n\nThis is all subjective of course. I had to refund due to these issues, but I hope it gets finished!

The art style is striking and distinct, the music addictive and catchy, the controls have always been very tight which makes the platforming and combat really shine. The playstyle distinction between Nina and Ace is very well established and makes for two solid experiences. The co-op is a very welcome addition as well, distinctly adding to the experience without bogging down the core game.\n\nOver all this is a game I love seeing grow. The devs are incredibly friendly, have been hugely open to feedback and are making something you can tell they love.

With a wide variety of items to unlock and multiple different armor sets that you can mix and match, there's a lot of verity in every run.\n\nThe only down side is how unbalanced some of the stages are.  Sky Temple is almost always a priority to run in the early game because it becomes unbeatable in later games while the forest and fire stages are so much less threatening I don't even remember their proper names.\n\nThe game is, however, still a work in progress and similar imbalances have been smoothed out in previous patches.\n\nSpeaking of patches, even with all the content int he game so far, it's creators continue to fill it with more and more interesting things and I fully expect to be coming back to this game from time to time for a long time coming.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you like, or have ever liked platformers, especially Mega Man X styled platformers,  this game is very worth your money.

Still, the rest of the review is applicable to the whole game.\n\nOne of the most compelling Early Access releases I've had the privilege of playing. 20XX is a procedurally generated platformer heavily reminiscent of Megaman games. I must confess, I've never previously played any Megaman game - I was too young at the time. And yet, this game sucked me in with its lovely 2D sprites and gameplay, proving you don't need to be a Megaman aficionado to enjoy this game!\n\nFor the most part, the game felt incredibly responsive and fun to play. The default keyboard controls felt a bit awkward but manageable, I got used to them after a while. Of course, it is slightly less awkward to play the game with a controller (if you, like me, were migrating from keyboard to gamepad, it definitely takes some getting used to). Levels are procedurally generated based on pre-built level chunks strung together in various orders, and also scale based on how far you've gotten through your run, slowly ramping up the challenge.\n\nOther features of the game include 2 characters - Nina (ranged) and Ace (melee), both with their own unique weapons and features. There are multiple possible weapons for both characters that can be found throughout the level, and they are all interesting to try out and play. On a personal note - I prefer playing Nina due to the range, but Ace has some pretty sick weapons.\nSoul Nuts, a currency which you can find during your run, allow you to buy more items which you can then find in-game. Even as you bleed the level chunks dry for content you can still find new items in-game allowing your runs to become crazier.\n\nAnother admission: I never really played the Daily modes or used the skulls all that much and am waiting until I become more proficient to do so, but they provide additional challenges for the skilled player. Skulls are mostly, if not all, drawbacks for the expert player, an interesting way to ramp up the difficulty.\n\nI really enjoyed the soundtrack too. One of the rare times where I don't actually mute the music and play something else, and the digital-ish(?) theme fits quite well with the game. Definitely going to aim to buy the soundtrack DLC when it is released, since I hear that that will be a thing.\n\nLastly, my most favourite aspect of this is the multiplayer. Almost everything is best done with a friend or more, and this is no exception. Blasting and killing enemies with a friend where you team up is a whole lot of fun. The online multiplayer REALLY works quite well, very few hitches - just the occasional oddity which I'm pretty much chalking up to different regions for now.\n\nThe developer regularly checks reddit and the Steam forums for feedback, is very open to game suggestions, and has even adopted some of them into the game! Major updates are pushed roughly once every 2 weeks, a perfectly regular interval (unlike a lot of Early Access developers that go silent for months on end).\n\nWould I recommend this game? Hell yes! A prime example of Early Access done right, and a model for budding EA developers to follow.\n\nWhen to buy: Now.\n\nEA+++/10 (Very highly polished and high potential. Keep a lookout on this game.)\n\nAttached below is a video of multiplayer from version 0.76a in action, featuring yours truly as the terrible dead weight. Note that in terms of game content, the video is very outdated, as there have been a lot of updates since then, a testament to this game's frequent update schedule. Just take the video as an example of how fun multiplayer can be. :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wzp8_2Z3wA\n\nLike indie games?

I did not notice that it was early access alpha though. I didn't notice until I'd already played for over an hour and loved every minute. The early access version is awesome as hell, and feels like a full game. It's easily worth the $10 already, and that fact that it's going to actually get better over time makes me a happy happy boy.\n\nThe controls are spot on, and feel comfortable to any MMX player. The graphics are serviceable without being so flashy as to distract from the gameplay. The music is good, and the sounds are good too. The bright shining star of the game is the gameplay. The mix of Megaman style platforming with roguelite upgrades and procedural levels make this a blast to play, and the Spelunky style daily challenges and leaderboards mean even veterans will always have stuff to do.\n\nEdit: It's been half a year since I posted this review. I still play 20XX at least every other day. There have been several really awesome changes, including replayable weekly challenges, co-op, and ever improving art.\n\nI was already happy with this. Now it's probably my favorite game of the year.\n\nEdit #2: It's been over a year now, and the game keeps getting better. The biggest recent change was the addition of the core aug system. Equivalent to armor parts from the MMX games. There are four sets with different focuses/boosts, and you can choose to mix and match parts from different sets to get your perfect combo, or try to complete a full matching set for a very powerful set bonus. OFC, since this game is a roguelite, you won't always be able to finish a set.\n\nOne boosts your charged attacks significantly, witrh the set bonus making EVERY attack charged.\n\nOne boosts your boss powers significantly, with the set bonus providing additional power specific effects, which range from mildly handy to ridiculously amazing. (Force Nova is glorious with it)\n\nOne boosts your defense, with a full set making you immune to spikes, lasers, and other stuff that would be an instant death when playing with the "rock" difficulty mod enabled, as well as all the boosts the individual pieces give, of course. It's VERY handy for daily challenges with that mod.\n\nThe last, so far, is focused on boosting your movement/stage clear speed, with the set bonus providing infinite air dashes. Find a decent high spot to launch from and you can fly across an entire level, assuming it's a horizontal level, and you have good timing.\n\nA year ago when I first reviewed this it was already tons of fun. Now, it's a game I will happily suggest to anyone that even kind of sort of likes Megaman games, roguelites, or just platformers in general.\n\nThe only flaw left in the game is the procedural level design, and that's just as much of a strength as a flaw.","June 4, 2015","true","166.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

There's a lengthy initial startup time when you launch but gone is the lag at menus and start starts. Characters feel more fluid and it just feels good to control either blaster user Nina or sword user Ace. They've also added a choice at the end of the level, so you're less likely to get the same level sets in a row now. Boss health was reduced though as their life meters aren't as crazy as they use to be. Haven't had the chance to play co-op yet but the single player experience has very much improved and I still recommend the game to fans of the genre.\n\nNovember 25th, 2014\n\nGame is pretty bare bones at the moment, the levels are randomized but in the 45 minute co-op session I played we did see a level repeat. Bosses are tricky and can be a bit frustrating but the controls work well and a controller definately feels at home with the game. The gameplay feels very much like what you'd find in a Mega Man X game and it's fun to have it in a native PC game. The music is catchy and the levels are bright but have odd gaps in them and invisible walls. Some of the enemies blend in too well with the environment or match the background palette and feel bland.\n\nFor co-op, when players get spread out the camera zooms out to accomadate both players yet, this means you can rush off ahead if you want but it'll become difficult to navigate as some environmental hazards can be hard to discern and some of the enemies that palette match the background become near invisible. Still, Apart from having the screen turn split-screen or not allowing you to outpace your partnet it works well.\n\nAlso, for co-op, if your partnet dies you can stand at their "ghost" and shoot to give them half your life.\n\nThe game shows a lot of promise right now, I just hope they keep developing and continue to add features. Don't get it expecting a near complete game because it's not at that point, this might not be fair but right now it feels a stage or two above a prove of concept demo and doesn't seem to be entirely optimized as the game hangs (for me) when loading and becomes unresponsive for 1-2 minutes before opening, and even then it doesn't focus the window.","November 25, 2014","true","1.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Drawing closely from Megaman and adding in a roguelike element is a cool idea and works well. These guys are definitely on the right track to making a really good game. The multiplayer is surprisingly refined for being so early into beta and offers an impressively synchronized experience. I think it offers a fair amount of difficulty, though I'm thankful that they have a 'challenge' mode system in there akin to Bastion's pantheon/god idol system. Item system feels pretty standard in terms of roguelike item sets, though a few key differences like the swappable armor system and 'prototypes' (upgrades that offer a great plus side but come with a risky detriment) change things up a bit.\n\nYou get a player choice between 'Not-Megaman' and 'Not-Zero' (aka Nina and Ace). If you like shooting, you go Nina. If you like Zero's badass sword attacks, you go Ace. He plays a lot like the newer Megaman Zero games, minus the gun. I typically play as Ace because he starts off with a nice damage bonus, but I've been finding that Nina has more survivability and usually ends up being stronger than Ace later on.\n\nThe music is pretty awesome so far. It reminds me of the newer Megaman games in a way and is very fitting to the environments.\n\nThe Eh Stuff:\nI can't criticize the game too heavily as it's not really done yet, but going from my perspective today, I think the devs have some work to do yet. While the randomly generated level system is a pretty cool approach to a Megaman game, I think the current generation has a great deal of improvements yet to make before I'd consider it complete.

What more could you want?\n\nAlright alright, I'll give you some useful info too. Things to note:\n\nDifferences from MMX: Less emphasis on charge shots. A fully charged attack takes like 2-3 seconds and does the damage of two shots. However, like MMX, they do penetrate through large numbers of small enemies. Ironically, it doesn't make that annoying noise. Or any noise at all.\nYou don't switch weapons the traditional way. You have extra buttons assigned to 3 different ones which you simply press to use. Pretty essential actually, since the alternate weapons are actually more useful in general, and energy for them is way more plentiful. Admittedly, it'd be nice if you could just have a button for one and use the shoulder triggers to switch, because something something Xbox 360 controller. Yes, there is still a boss weakness system, and each boss drops its own unique weapon every time, but interestingly you can choose to forgo it in exchange for extra "nuts" (in-game roguelike currency) or a random upgrade.\nThere are physic adjustments as upgrades. One really rare one I found gave a jetpack allowing short flight every jump, but most of them involve jump height or movement speed. There is no midair dash by default and I don't know if it exists as an upgrade.\nThere are some "buster swap" upgrades. Like, not as an alternate weapon, you literally trade your main shot. Usually more directions fired in for slightly less damage per bullet.\nDefault limit is 3 bullets on the screen at once, like classic Mega Man. There is at least one upgrade that increases this, and massively I might add (8 at once).\nKilled enemies do not respawn, but their drops do not despawn. For the most part, enemies only drop your traditional MM pickups: health, energy, and the game's currency (think MM9's bolts). Even if they fall into lava or spikes, they stay there. However, they are gone forever if they fall into a bottomless pit. Speaking of which...\nSpikes, lava, and bottomless pits are not instant death. The game is still hard regardless. In the case of lava and pits, you are teleported back to the last non-moving, permanent platform you stood on. Vanishing platforms do respawn after about 5 seconds or so. Also, this game has those vanishing blocks. You know, like Heatman. Whoooooooooooop. Except they don't make that godawful noise.\nYou know those super secret areas where you could find cool gear? They exist in this game. Sort of. The gear itself is not found there, but comes as part of different "sets" with specific qualities and are equipped like RPG armor, as very rare random drops. The analogous secret areas, however, let you meet a very demonic version of the game's wannabe Dr. Light character. These areas give you the chance to pick up an upgrade that gives an enormous boost in power while giving an enormous disdvantage. Also, the upgrade's description is listed in very cryptic, sinister terms, so you usually have to figure out exactly what it does the hard way.\nRoguelike quirks: There is inter-run progression. However, as someone who usually hates that, it's handled really elegantly here (as opposed to an obviously grindy fashion). You gain a meta-currency called "soul nuts" (with the in-run currency being called "nuts") after every run, but soul nuts are lost if you do not spend them before the next run. Also, you can't choose from the whole selection items; the hub world shop only has 3 random items (out of those you haven't unlocked yet), and buying one unlocks it as a random drop in future run while granting it to you for free for the next run only. Thus, if you do poorly on a run, but an expensive item you want shows up, you're sadly not gonna get it, because you're gonna lose your nuts (heh) regardless, and there's a good chance it's not gonna be in the 3-item lineup after next run. If everything is too expensive, or you have a little left over, there's another hub world shop which sells basic upgrades and cheaper, already-unlocked stuff to help make your next run easier as a compensation prize. Kind of a cool way to do that, even if it means that runs aren't fully independent.\nThere are dailies and weeklies, and more importantly the inter-run progression system does not apply to them at all. If you wanna go full purist, do this. As expected, you get one chance at each daily, but it switches at around midnight US time. You can play weeklies unlimited times, but it's one specific run. That is, it's generated at the start of the week and not randomized.\nThere are hardcore modes. In-game, they're called "skulls". They let you make your runs harder for no benefit. There are also hardcore dailies and weeklies, but those use specific (and pretty ordinary) combinations of skulls and are not tied to the non-hardcore versions of the same. That is, it's not just "the normal daily run with hard stuff", it's a separate daily.\nLevel generation-wise, this game is very similar to Binding of Isaac. Levels are mostly modular. with a number of hand-made level pieces that are randomly, but somewhat intelligently (most of the time) strung together. Levels also fall into one of a handful specific "themes". This is not merely for aesthetics, each theme has its own distinct set of level patterns, i.e. there are no "universal" patterns from what I can tell. Crucially, this means that you don't get "samey" level design between themes, although admittedly you do get it within any specific theme. However, I attribute that more to the game still being a bit premature in development, I would probably bet money that the patterns will become a little more diverse as the game is developed and balanced. As it stands, I'm actually impressed at how much the different themes stand out from each other gameplay-wise for being dynamically generated. Including how the "sky temple" theme manages to get the art of making aggressively annoying precision platforming stages down to a T every time. Joking aside, it's actually pretty damn good considering that it's generating platformer levels, but there's definitely some room for improvement.\nRNG is relatively friendly in this game. Most of the upgrades are completely modular, like BoI. There are "armor slot" upgrades, the most prominent of which are Mega Man-style weapons. Each boss always gives the same, specific weapon, and you can even choose to forgo it for money or an upgrade if you don't like their weapon. Numbers are a really minor factor in this game compared to other roguelikes, with the most sigificant ones being defense- or mobility-related. Very few of the items have a downside at all, and those that do are extremely minor in that regard, to the point where the item is still definitely an upgrade. Biggest exception being the "Demon Dr. Light" items, which are intentionally designed to have an enormous downside. Even then, half of these still manage to be way less brutal than equivalent upgrades in Binding of Isaac. They're more akin to Nuclear Throne's cursed weapons in terms of downside, minus the whole issue where you can run out of means to do damage at all... which is a big one, but I digress. Level generation RNG plays a way bigger factor than any other form of it, with the second contender being HP and energy drops, namely whether you get it or not after the rare event where you get dicked over by the level generator.\nClosing notes\nMost issues I have involve bugs or the occasional level generation issue. Namely, disproportionately difficult patterns (or almost-impossible patterns, even) showing up out of nowhere in an early-game level. Stuff that i imagine will be ironed out as Early Access progresses. Time will tell! Cool ♥♥♥♥ing game. 8/10.","April 24","true","17.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EJFebus/recommended/322110/","EJFebus","SlackX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EJFebus/","60 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'll just cut to the chase... This game is hard. This game tests your abilities. This game will make you scream at it at some points... and I LOVE IT for this. This game is a reminder of the older years of gaming.\n\nThe platforming is difficult, especially in the later parts of a run, but it is still fair. It may look impossible at some points, but once you see how the platforms move or how the patterns work, it is doable. This can best be seen in the sky stages: a massive amount of obstacles are thrown your way, but there is still a pattern that can be traveled to traverse the stage. However, some of the real challenges come from the in-game difficulty modifications. Adding the in-game difficulty with mods affecting the length of the stage, the health of the enemies, or even your own attack power (or for the truly insane, all 3 plus instant death against falls and spikes), will truly test your abilities against titles such as this.\n\nOr, for a truly nostagiac feeling, just add the spikes and falls hazard mod for a more retro feel. Just... don't look for 1-ups....\n\nThe controls are solid, and very responsive. The immediate response to button imputs, whether with a controller or with a keyboard, allow for quick reactions to whatever is thrown your way. The layout for the controls are simple and easy to learn, allowing a number of players to easily pick up a controller or keyboard and play the game.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game is the inclusion of two different playable characters for a run. Ace and Nina offer two different playstyles within the same environment. These two styles allow players to not only pick their own approach to a level, but to also learn how to approach enemies, find different strategies to approach them, and learn to traverse the stages around them, if necessary, in order reach the boss. The two playstyles have you think about what the character can do, what they can't, and how to approach a situation based on their abilities. This extends into the multiplayer as well. Have a buddy to argue with whether short-range or long-range is better? Now you can try them both out at the same time in a multiplayer run. Within multiplayer, two people can choose to either both play as Nina, both play as Ace, or each play as either Nina or Ace. This allows for both players to approach the stage at their own pace, while working together.\n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, this option opens the door for a number of buddy-to-buddy gameplay experiences, such as racing through a stage to the boss, working together to complete challanges or take down a boss, or even just mess around and enjoy the chaotic atmosphere of the game. Just keep in mind the chaos does get worse as you continue through, so hope you're able to work with your partner by the end of the run.\n\nThe updates are scheduled via a countdown on the title screen. It seems like a general window for an update, but they seem to be scheduled on time according to the countdown. The updates are rather noticable, but consistent and they greatly benefit the game. With the latest update, a great deal of stability was added to the multiplayer. I used what would be the gaming equivalent of a potato to host a game with my brother, and the connection maintained throughout the playthrough. This was without a game booster. Pre-update, occasionally the game would lag and lock out my brother from the game, even with a booster.\n\nOverall, when I started playing this game, I felt like I was playing a good-old Mega Man X game again. How I longed for those days and their glorious return.... Anyone who has played a game like this before should definitely give this game a try. I guarantee a fun time, whether you play solo or with a buddy. Just prepare for a jump in difficulty at the end, and you'll do fine.","February 20","true","11.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Holy hell, this game is fast becoming straight up amazing! Kudos to the devs. I hope this game gets the attention it deserves eventually because now it's definitely an overlooked gem of a game.\n\nRe the bosses (as mentioned in my previous updates), they are great and extremely satisfying to beat now. Great job!\n\nOne thing though, the sound mixing seems to be a bit off. E.g. some sound effects seem a lot louder than others, but that's really all I can find to put my finger on now.\n\n[Updated. Original review below.]\n\nThis game has come a long way since I bought it and the updates continue rolling in, each one making the game even better. It already has a ton of content and you can sink lots of hours into the game as it is now. The bosses are even a bit harder and more varied now even though I still think they're a bit on the easy side. All in all this is shaping up to be a solid game that shows how Early Access should be done.\n\n[Original review:]\n\nThis is definitely Early Access. The game shows promise but is extremely rough around the edges. (E.g. I get sent to some debug mode that's full of bright red collision boxes whenever I press 'start' to pause the game and it'll randomly go away if I pause/unpause again a few times... Maybe... And my weapon charges while I hold 'right' on the d-pad — not on the analog stick though — making it very difficult to actually move right and shoot. However, I expect both of these problems to be relatively rare since there isn't a torrent of complaints about them in the forums.) Bosses aren't exactly super challenging but I can't imagine they'll stay like that forever. The platforming is pretty tight and controls are very responsive and feel good. 20XX basically has all the ingredients of a great platformer, it just needs to put them together in the right amounts using the right recipe.\n\nIf you are willing to buy a game on a promise and think this could become an interesting game, then you should definitely buy this. At this very moment there's not a whole lot to it and — since it's Early Access — there may never become anything of it, but if platforming and roguelikes (e.g. Spelunky and Rogue Legacy) is your thing, this could be your next favorite game ... when it's done.","February 3, 2015","true","27.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Some of the level generation needs some work, as certain platforming sections are virtually impossible due to bad monster placement, so there may need to be some tweaking done, but early access/beta makes this excuse-able for the time being. Some folks think Ace is easier than Nina, but I tend to disagree about either character being better than the other, as I've found both of them more effective vs some bosses, and less against others, as well as having weak and strong points in certain stages. They are "Different" but I wouldn't say terribly easier in one play style than the other. It depends heavily on your playstyle. The music feels decent but needs a little bit more depth to the tracks, I would say add some basslines, and make the melodies a little bit stronger, but they do seem to have the "spirit" of the source material. I know I'm gonna be playing this for hours to come, and look forward to when I finally complete a run rather than just getting murdered around the 4th or 5th level.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Myrianda/recommended/322110/","Myrianda","Myrianda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Myrianda/","108 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter much deliberation I finally decided to try this game out, and I can honestly say that it was a great decision. As a long time Mega Man X fan, I have dreamed for a sequel of some sort to give me that action/platformer loving that I crave. From what time I have played, this game is definitely worth the buy in the sense that it already feels like a complete game; which is rather shocking considering its in EA and has a better quality than most 'launch' titles. The developers are also extremely active and helpful, which shows a lot of promise for this game's development.\n\nAs for gameplay, this is where it truly shines. The platforming is top-notch with many challenges for veterans and newbies to the genre, while also mixing in item drops to give it that Binding of Isaac feel. No one playthrough will ever be the same, and you can choose what order you would like to fight each boss. So if you completely hate one boss, you can skip it (most of the time), but that boss will get increasingly difficult as you put him off. So in some cases its best to just get it out of the way whenever possible, or you have the choice to tackle them when you have more upgrades. As seen in the intro vid, you can play as Nina (Mega Man) with the very familiar arm-gun to shoot enemies from afar, or Ace (Zero) with a beam saber for up close and personal balls-of-steel style gameplay. Each character can get weapon drops mid-game to completely change up how they use their current weapon as well, leading to multiple styles of gameplay within each character. If that's not enough, they added a daily challenge mode and a daily hardcore mode for players to sink their teeth into should they desire an extra bit of challenge. In the Challenge mode you can try to clear the game to make rankings on leaderboards, and in the daily hardcore you are faced with 3 skulls (or special scenarios) that change the way the game is played. These each reset once a day for your daily source of Mega Man action.\n\nLast but not least, this game has multiplayer. Granted, all of my friends are naysayers and don't believe in this game, but if you have ever wanted to play a Mega Man game with a friend this is your chance. Having played a few multiplayer games with strangers you can just jump in and murder everything with little to no communication. Gotta love mindless mayhem, cuz I do. ^_^\n\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with this game. In fact, there really is not much to say about it negatively aside from one thing. The level 8 Sky Temple and go F*** itself. Having cleared the game multiple times, its the biggest nightmare of the game, and lasers will haunt your dreams.\n\nOverall in its current state, I give this game a 9.5/10. I'll change the rating as EA progresses, but the tl;dr of this review is that this is probably one of the best roguelikes  on Steam currently, and wholeheartedly worth every penny.","September 24, 2015","true","25.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It is a very fun one, even if I died, I felt like just jumping right back in.  Something I feel is lacking in other rogue-likes.\n+ Unlockables. Granted there is not too many right now, but I like the feeling of earning a lot of soul bolts, and getting new stuff to find in the game.\n+ Co-op. I have not been able to play a lot of it, but the little I did, I enjoyed, a lot. You share items, but you also share bolts.\n+ Full Controller Support. If you are not using a controller in this game, your going to have a hard time, trust me, I tried.\n+ There is probably more, but this is the main ones. ^^\n\nCons.\n\n- Sky Temple hazards. These can be run killers. I am not a huge fan of them, but oh well. Some of the hazards in the sky temple are very hard, but most of the others are fully fair.\n- Some of the character's movements seem a little off, but that is a nitpick.\n- Soul bolts after you unlock everything right now are kinda useless.

I have 8 hours in at the time of writing this. That might be higher by a lot when you read this. $12 for a awesome game right now.

Not enough items to spend soul nuts on - this coinsides with 2, Once you buy everything, theres really nothing left and your collecting soul nuts for no reason, be nice if we can spend it on lives.\n4. continuously increased difficulty - I wouldn't say this is a problem, however, it'd be nice if the difficulty didnt screw you over as you advance through the levels. Better placement of enemies and level hazards would be nice, have them a bit more spread out instead of basically deciding which way is best to die, nothing like deciding whether you want to burn to death, get slaughtered by a mob of enemies, spiked to death, or fall into lava all in one shot, and its all in the direction you have to go and no alternate root.","October 6, 2015","true","43.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I'd recommend it keeping in mind that it's in beta.  The gameplay, art style, and music in this game are superb but who cares.  I'm making this review to point out some technical difficulties I've been having.  First of all, the game tends to crash about 20% of the time.  I'll be playing and it will randomly crash (most after finishing a level, going into the next).  Second of all, the online is a little tricky when it comes to connections.  Lag is abundant and inviting a friend to a game can be complicated if your friend isn't in the actual game.

In a similar vein to games like Rogue Legacy or Risk of Rain, this game has you pick (currently) two characters - Nina or Ace, and explore procedurally generated levels in an attempt to defeat the boss of Level 8 or something. (The story is to be added into the game at a later date.) With lots of variety in it's current form and updates every two weeks, I would highly recommend picking up 20XX even in it's current form. Although do note that it IS early access, so there are a fair few audio oddities here and there, and currently the balance is a little off (Agnisort is much harder than the other levels at the moment) -- although it sometimes adds to the fun when you get a ridiculously powerful build going, with five speed augments and a Core Aug set bonus. ;D\n\n[Edited as of 16th April to be a bit more accurate to the current version. :V]","March 21, 2015","true","193.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Everything about it, from the characters, the enemies, the bosses, and the soundtrack just ooses megaman x.\n\nEvery single run through of the game is a wild ride and it does a fantastic job of making the levels harder and harder as you go, as well as the bosses.  Remember that boss you fought first last time that was a total push over? Well now he isn't, he has extra moves he didn't have last time or maybe even a second form.\n\nThe game is also very challeneging. Sure you might be able to beat 2 or 3 levels very easily but to beat all 8 bosses is quite the challenege. If it's too hard play easy mode which allows you to choose some extra power ups to start with. Too easy? Play one of the daily/ weekly challenge modes or enable some of the optional "skulls" which change the mechanics of the game (think halo skulls).\n\nThe more I play this game the better it gets.

The game certainly feels very polished, and does its job quite well. Its very fun, and has that 'one-more-run' addictiveness.\n\nAt first glance, I was nervous that this game would be too difficult, requiring twitch-like reflexes, but in reality it is very forgiving. You only lose a little bit of life for falling, and I found it quite easy to pass a few levels on 'Normal' mode straight from the get-go.\n\nPros:\n+Very polished. It does its job very well. It feels like a great modernized version of Megaman, complete with (good) retro music and tight controls.\n+Controller support is awesome. Everything feels great. Tight controls.\n+Awesome meta-game upgrades that I like in any roguelite.\n+Lots of items and abilities.\n+Co-op seems super fun (haven't tried yet, but have watched several LetsPlays).\n+Daily run leaderboards.\n+The choice of the classic arm-blaster character and a melee character.\n\nCons:\n-Honestly, nothing that I can think of.\n\nI'd say totally make the purchase if you enjoy Megaman. The roguelite elements simply add tons of replayability and variation to an already great setup.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiyaki/recommended/322110/","Kiyaki","トップハットのきやき","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiyaki/","320 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReview Date: 2/9/2016, subject to change.\nMultiplayer not tested as of yet, due to lack of MMX-loving friends. *sadface*\n\nThough it lacks the refinement of the old Megaman X games as of now, 20XX is probably the best successor to the MMX franchise out there...and given that the actual franchise went out on some lackluster titles and appears to be stuck with the rest of Megaman in some sort of indefinite Capcom limbo, that's about all we can ask for right now.\n\n20XX can be best described as a mixture of Megaman X4 and Rogue Legacy, certainly fulfilling the criteria to be marked as a "Rogue-lite". You have your pick between two characters: Nina and Ace, whom are themselves mirrors of X and Zero respectively and their base playstyle is pretty much identical to how X and Zero functioned in X4; Nina has the traditional "X" Buster, and Ace emulates Zero's Z-Saber via some sort of arm-mounted-laser-buzzsaw, which somehow defies logic and slashes like a sword. I must reiterate that it is clear the gameplay they were trying to emulate in this was that of Megaman X4, which they almost completely and totally nailed. Personally, X4 was my favorite of the X series, but if for some reason you didn't care for it, that's something to consider.\n\nYou start out with dash capabilities ala all the X games going forward from X2. Each session begins with you inside of the "Ark", a hub paying homage to the pre-Sigma boss rush rooms of yesteryear. From the Ark, you can swap between Nina or Ace, spend Soul Nuts (Explained Later), or enter into a run of the game with each teleporter sending you to a different difficulty setting, with the higher teleporters leading to special leaderboard runs like daily challenges you can only attempt once per day. Choose your character, pick a teleporter, and the game itself begins proper.\n\nThe game, as mentioned earlier, is a Rogue-lite. You progress through procedurally generated Megaman X style platforming levels, fending off numerous enemies and manuvering around enviromental hazards. Throughout the level, you'll find scattered crates and which will contain either health or energy pickups, or power-ups, along with chests that are guarenteed to contain a power-up usually waiting behind gauntlets of enviromental hazards you have to manuver in-and-out of to claim your prize. The level design is not entirely linear, but only in one tileset will you potentially find yourself "confused." The golden rule in everywhere but the Skytemple is simply "go right", which will eventually always lead you to the end. The Skytemple breaks this rule by having sections that require you to traverse intricate vertical jumping challenges which may send you in either direction before eventually letting out on a higher, right-most platform, so until you've memorized all the potential tiles, it is the only one where you may find yourself actually "lost" in. Occasionally, beyond the first stage, you will also come across halfway-point enemy gauntlet rooms that will offer you a core power-up if you can complete the rush whilst adhering to specified limitations (No dashing, no powers, only powers, etc), along with traders who will offer you powerups of all varieties in exchange for Nuts (again, explained later). On top of all this, defeating the stage boss within a certain amount of time (a number of minutes increasing slightly with each stage you pass) will gain you a bonus chest, so in the end the game simultaniously encourages and rewards exploration and skillful manuvering, but punishes too much lollygagging within a single stage.\n\nPower-ups will improve your character for the entire duration of your run in various ways. They include things like increased health or energy, new weapons to replace your default, or things that provide entirely extra functionality. They also come in two flavors: normal and "core", with core powerups usually giving a fancier effect, and visually replacing a piece of your armor in homage to the old upgrade capsules of the MMX franchise. On top of that, each time you successfully complete a stage and down a boss, you are given the choice of either absorbing that boss's main power, binding it one of a couple of extra, otherwise unused keys/buttons, or picking between a randomized upgrade or a batch of Nuts. The various flavors of power-ups become more and more mandatory as you progress further into a run, which means that ignoring exploration in favor of rushing the boss room can potentially result in you being extremely underpowered in the later stages.\n\nSo I've explained what makes the gameplay itself properly rogue-lite, but what is it that brings in the comparison to Rogue Legacy? What is the carry over that makes playthroughs beyond the first appropriately interesting? Well, that comes in the form of previously mentioned Nuts and Soul Nuts. Nuts are the game's currency, dropping randomly from enemies and crates. Within a run, Nuts can be spent either on randomly located vending machines which will disperse either health or energy depending on the machine type, along with a power-up related to said resource if you cram enough Nuts into a machine to make it explode (Max health up if you blow up a health machine, for example.), along with Traders who will offer power-ups in exchange for large amounts of Nuts, along with one option usually heavily "on sale" for cheap, so even if you are low on Nuts you can usually walk away from a trader having gained something. The amount of nuts you get will vary based on power-ups you obtain and just random luck, and all of them are lost upon death...with one exception.\n\nThroughout runs, you will come across the occasional enemy that glows with a blue hue, sporting increased health and damage than its normal counterpart. Kill these, and they will leave behind glowing blue Soul Nuts, usually in batches of 1 to 4. Soul Nuts do not appear in your Nut count during the run, but instead are carried with you back to the Ark upon death. Back in the Ark, there is a Trader on the westmost side whom will allow you to spend Soul Nuts to unlock new power-ups that will then be able to drop in future runs, or, if you have already unlocked all the power-ups/want a bit of an advantage on your next run, you can instead spend them on his upper selection of lesser power ups that will then carry with you into your next run. Anything you freshly unlock will also be given to you for free on your next run, provided you do not exit out of the game prior to it. Do note that you cannot bring any of these "starting boons" into the difficulties above Normal.\n\nWhen it comes to pros and cons, I can happily say that as least in my experience, there are very few cons and none of them really outweigh the pros. The main gripes I have mostly have to do with art design of all things. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, both due to the game being in Early Access and also because of updates in general as I very easily see these developers continuing to support the game beyond leaving Early Access (Provided it is adequately successful, which it ENTIRELY deserves). Unfortunately, I'm running out of space for this review, so I can't really list those in the detail I would like to.\n\nThe long and short of it: If you are a fan of the Megaman X games, especially X4, buy this immediately. It captures the core gameplay of X4 *almost* perfectly, and is well supported by its developers. This is probably the closest we'll get to a proper MMX successor, unless Capcom pulls their head out of their ♥♥♥ in regards to the Megaman Franchise, and most would probably agree that isn't likely to happen any time soon. 20XX is the best MMX game I've played in years, even though it isn't actually MMX. It's cheap (especially on sale), extremely fun, and is all but guarenteed to please any old grizzled MMX fan.\n\nGive it a try.

The random levels generator is pretty Unstable I would say , You can play 1 time and get 3 Hp bonus with the first 3 loot- crates or play another time and get the Freaking 4 leafed clover at the end of the first boss and struggle the second level like ♥♥♥♥ , To give you an idea , Sometimes I can get to level 8-9 without dying , But if Im unlucky with the random factor , I can barely pass the second level.

This is how you do a platformer, this is how you do a Mega Man game. The controls are tight, the obstacles are the right level of difficult (save one that sticks out), the music is right on point.

Flame Shield is almost on-demand invincibilty, while other powers fall short.\n-No story, but this is an Early Access review. That might change.\n-Cartoony. The game looks like a Newgrounds game.\n\nThis is a polished piece of work, and manages to entrap me and frustrate the hell out of me all at the same time.

The animations are fluid, the art is unique, there is a good variety of powerups and enemies, the sound and music is high quality.

Nina and Ace only have two “alternate” main weapons, and one for each is ridiculously rare. Ace’s range-reducing, but theoretically more powerful, multi-slash feels more like a nerf than a buff. Thematically, the differences between Nina and Ace are limited to gun vs “knife”; in arguably my favorite MMX game, MMX4 (You can’t make  me pick just ONE, okay!), X reflects the classic Mega Man character with special powers based upon defeated enemies manifesting themselves as projectiles, in addition to my favorite feature of MMX, hidden upgrades; Zero, on the other hand, gains Street Fighter-style powers, including a “Dragon Punch”-style flame sword, an ice stalactite “spike” move, or a somersault slash. Ace gains none of these things, and his powers beyond his basic attacks are identical to Nina’s. I would like to see more variance.\n\nAnother flaw to 20XX is its randomization algorithm. I have unlocked many things after several deaths, but I encounter the same upgrades over and over in a single run. To play with the more fun stuff that requires large sums of soul nuts, I have to start a “casual” run and select three of my powerups as defaults. It is one thing to be difficult, and normal mode is no more challenging than casual besides gaining three powerups to start; if I don’t care about leaderboards and just want to enjoy the game, why would I ever select a mode beyond casual? “Skulls” add objectives to runs, but I would currently not bother to attempt them until I felt confident that good powerups would spawn.\n\nOverall, I think 20XX has the potential to be an adequate proxy for a licensed Mega Man game. We shall see in the near future if it will be remembered as flattery or artifice.\n\n","October 18, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

All you can do is unlock stuff to pick up in the levels.\n\nThe other main problem is that there is ♥♥♥♥ everywhere AND it just blends with the background making them super hard to see. That is not really a problem on early levels but as you advance, there is more and more stuff and they do more damage an they are harder to kill. So to emulate a higher difficulty, all the game does is putting more of the same enemies you fought earlier and they do more damage. You don't receive enough health to make up to it. The game literally tells you after the tutorial : "prepare to die". I'm pretty sure it meant : "you are supposed to die and be mad about it".\n\nKeep in mind that I've only played the game for 1 hour and it is not in it's completed state. Later on, you'll be able to play with a friend online and just for that, the game deserves to be played. It's 11$ now and will be 15-16$ when the game is completed but you can expect to be on sale at some point.\n\nI hope you found this review helpful.","June 26, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like Mega Man X and roguelikes this game is for you. With a solid selection of main weapons to find, special weapons to obtain, and very interesting power-ups, this game never fails to excite me (getting the Wave Beam in a run = Yessssssss!)\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, there are two characters: Nina (who uses ranged primary weapons) and Ace (who uses melee primary weapons). Both characters can charge up their primary weapon to dish out some nice damage. In co-op (locally or online) you can even have a team of Aces or Ninas if you wanted (although the synergy of a Nina and Ace team plays out well as each of them can cover for the other pretty well)\n\nThe game offers a lot of fun replayability. There are daily challenges, daily hardcore challenges, and you can even modify your runs with "skulls" in which add unique difficulty to you run (longer stages, more enemy health, toxin timer; just to name a few). I love to challenge myself to a run with maaaaany skulls activated, it is really fun! I highly recommend starting with one or two skulls and then every time you beat a run with skulls on, try to add another skull on for the next run to keep ramping up the difficulty; it's a great training method and it'll keep you occupied for many hours!\n\nIn short: This game is awesome and has high replayability with crazy challenges, stuff to unlock, cool bosses and special weapons, and sweet, sweet offline and online co-op. Ever wanted to play a Mega Man X game with your friends? (I know I have!)\n\nThis game is inspired by X, but yet has a slew of it's very own unique things to offer...\n\n....So what are you waiting for?

From what I've seen thus far it works really well, though the game itself is very clearly in alpha and can use many changes.\n\nFor one thing, I feel the physics engine could use a bit of tweaking. This game is obviously trying to emulate Megaman X's physics, but it doesn't feel quite as smooth and satisfying(ex. The dash isn't really as effective unless you have the powerup that increases the dash's power.). For the most part, it works pretty well, it's just kind of rough around the edges at the moment.\n\nAnother problem I have is how the levels are designed. I was incredibly interested in the idea of having randomly-generated levels, but the levels seem to give off more of a rage game vibe than anything else. The time limit really doesn't help either. Sure, it adds a bit of intensity to really beat the level, but it puts you in a state of stress that Megaman games generally do not have. The bosses, however, I have no problem with. I love how the bosses are designed.\n\nAll and all, I do like 20XX. It is a great concept and shows plenty of potential.

A series that endured and always delivered what it promised. Hard as nails difficulty over a wonderful soundtrack delivered with the same gameplay time and again. In todays market, many complain that games are "too similar" or "Don't do anything to advance the series" in an accusation of being stale. This is true in some cases, but I've never felt it a negative for others. Megaman was one such series that never grew stale for me. From 1 to 8, then X through X3. I was late to the playstation, so X4 and X5 were missed for me in the beginning. Later, the series would return in the form of Collectors packages (The Megaman Collection, and the X Collection). Again, it proved that there was a desire for these old games, even though mostly unchanged (They did some amazing work with the music in those collections). Then, radio silence. Megaman was abandoned by the company (certainly not the creator, who fought hard for it) and a wonderful idea was thrown away. Megaman Universe. It was a sore disappointment to hear of a game that would play like Megaman, with huge crossover potential and player created levels would be here for limitless potential of fun. Though, it seems that dream lived on in this game.\n\nBatterystaple Games picked up the torch that Megaman universe attempted to produce, and began running as hard as they could. For an indie developer, I'm personally amazed at how well they've done here. The game controls as great as any side scrolling platformer of yesteryear or even today. Better than most others. Controls are tight and gameplay is fluid. Never have I felt a cheap death through bad hit detection or input. The only advice I can give, is that the controller is a necessity. Keyboard just isn't going to cut it here. That said, controls on some indie games are shoddy and clearly needed fine tuning in early access or alpha stages. Not so here. Even in Alpha, Batterystaple nailed it.\n\nLevel design is another area I was nervous about. Roguelikes are a popular breed right now, but often a voxel world is used. Easy enough to procedurally generate, it's significantly harder to do this with side scrolling, non-voxel elements. I was concerned many levels and layouts would look the same. While, Yes, there are a few times in my five hours (and growing) I saw a usual layout, it was always blended into a previous layer or later layer seamlessly. Thankfully, the level design also doesn't reuse different platform layouts in the same level. Meaning it won't be a direct mirror of somewhere in the same level. Speaking of level design, again this is quality stuff from indie developers. Batterystaple really captured level design here, and staged the levels based on how many bosses you've beaten. Level 1 is short with one boss. Level 2 is longer, with a sub boss station. The station features a challenge such as no boosting, not getting hit, or timed completion to give you a reward. Then, later levels have the same layout, but spike throwers added in. By Level 5, the enemies are getting upgrades too. With changed colors (Oh, good ol' pallette swap) come added fireballs. 3-way shots turn to 5. One burst of lasers turn to three. Again, the level ramp-up just proves that rogue like runs in a procedural generation can be done, and done well, if the developer has the right formula to use. These guys sure did.\n\nGraphics and Music. This areas great in one, and pretty good in the other. Graphics are perfect to me. They recall the classic 16-bit era with perfection and at no point did I feel the enemies were complete copies of the game that inspired this. Instead, they were the developers own take on them, and done well with their imaginative creations. The music is pretty good, but the one thing I feel could use some help. Not that they're bad, but the same four tunes seem to stand out, especially when certain levels are reused for two bosses. This isn't a negative, by no means, but something that Batterystaple can surely hit on with their race to release. Whats in here is great, to be sure. I just feel theres room for more.\n\nOverall, I know it's early alpha, but for the price, I can't argue buying it right now. Help these developers along and get them to release day on this with the money they deserve for putting such a great game into our hands. They took a classic that was once amazing and revitalized it in the way it's own parent company refused long ago. Mighty No. 9 is due to come out soon and while I'll be playing that as well, I feel there are things Batterystaple did here in 20XX that Mighty No. 9 hasn't done yet (and i'll certainly be playing both of these). Perhaps an endless mode is in the cards for that game too, but i've yet to hear of it. 20XX though, it's like an endless mode every time you start. With powerups to buy that drop in the generated levels, daily and weekly seeded challenges to play for fun or bragging rights via leaderboards, Co-op, modifiers that change the game with significant things like "spikes make you die" mode, and a second playable character with a laser sword to alternate with, I honestly cannot say anything better about 20XX than i've already said. This games entirely worth it, if you have any love for sidescrolling platformers, and especially the forgotten Megaman franchise, don't wait for a sale. Buy this game and show the love. You won't be disappointed with this.\n\nPros:\n-Revitalized side-scrolling platformer genre with the perfect 16-bit look and feel\n-Procedural Generation of levels combined with Rogue Like power up system make each new playthrough different.\n-Perfect controls and perfect accuracy of side scrolling just "feels right"\n-Co-op, Daily, Weekly, and Modified Weekly challenges make a great way to keep interest.\n-Price is great for this. At 12 bucks, it seems a steal. If on Sale, it pretty much is. The games fully playable with almost no problems found in most Early Access/Alpha games. Polished right from the start.\n\nCons:\n-Layouts can sometimes start to feel a bit samey if the generation puts some similar components together a few times in a row.\n-Music is the same four to five songs. While nice, it will be noticable in a longer run including same areas.\n\nA final statement. Cons are included just as some feedback. In no way do I find these actually negative, as I have played right through and enjoyed every single thing. I merely put them for points where improvement could be done (and most likely will be, given the developers excellent track record of updates.). Overall, it's feedback and not meant to dissaude anyone.\n\n-M-","January 22","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each level is made up of certain blocks that link together to form levels, so there is a repeating, noticeable pattern.\n\nBalance: 4/10\nA lot of the upgrades seem pretty damn useless if not extremely underwhelming. Ace is 100% better than Nina because he can hit above and below him, as well as dealing more damage AND having more health.

I really enjoyed Zero more so i'm glad they carried that character over too.\n\nPros:\nCombat feels very much like megaman x games.\nPowerup collectables were a good addition.\n\nCons:\n1. Though it is classified as roguelike the levels are not very dynamic. Needs more diversity badly.\n2. Crashes. And this is extremely bad for roguelike games since a crash means you lose EVERYTHING you did for that run. I just got to the next level and it just instantly crashed and I lost it all.

I've never been a huge fan of Mega Man, but I do enjoy the games, and I've played them all. This is basically Roguelike CooP Mega Man, and that's great. It's pacing is super fun, and the enemy, item, upgrade and level variety is really quite expansive. Most of the enemies are just amped up versions of previous, weaker enemies, but that's fine. It still adds to the game quite a lot, in my opinion.\n\nIn the game there are two playable characters, one with a gun and one with a sword. Both do similar damage, but from what I saw the DPS of the melee character is higher, which makes sense considering he has to get in closer. There are also multiple weapons for each character that you can unlock and find within the game, which is really cool. Each weapon requires a different way of playing, and they all have their ups and downs. There are also powers which cost energy that you can acquire that equally change the battlefield, like a pack of fireballs that spin around you to block shots and hurt enemies, or a minigun that does decent damage over a good range. Lots of different powers.\n\nSomething I really like is the bonus timer: It incentivizes you to complete the level quickly, but it doesn't force you at all. The reward is an extra gold chest at the end, which contains an item or upgrade. Another thing is that each and every item and upgrade I've seen is actually substantial. I've never gotten something and thought, "Well this is kinda crap." Yes, some are better than others, but there are no useless upgrades, and no incredibly op ones as far as I can tell. The game is balanced quite well.\n\nThere are no real BS enemies. Some are frustrating to fight, but once you learn the patterns of each enemy you can dispatch them fairly easily, unless the level layout kinda cheeses you a bit, but that doesn't happen often. The bosses are plentiful (I believe I fought 6, but there may be more.), and each boss plays differently. I read some other reviews where bosses are spammy and cheap, but each attack that a boss does gives you a new opportunity to attack them. As far as I saw, there are no stupid instakill moves, no invincibility moves, nothing like that.\n\nThe graphics are okay, nothing to write home about but not terrible to look at. The design of things is really good, it's just the execution leaves a tiny bit to be desired, such as assymmetrical sprites simply flipping rather than being drawn from each side. Overall it doesn't detract from the game much, and it's still nice to look at, so no big deal. The sound and music are pretty good, sort of generic but not bad at all. The music is fast and upbeat and helps to set the mood and pace of the game, which is all it really needs to do.\n\nIn the end, if you like action platformers (Mega Man), and you like roguelikes, pick this one up. Bonus for coop! Have yet to play it with a friend but I have just the person in mind.  ;)  Great game for the price and for the fact that it's in early access. I encountered absolutely zero bugs, but the random generation can be a little strange, though that's a risk you run in every roguelike.","September 23, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One Life = You die and your back to the hub, which is kind of odd considering games like this have multiple lifes. That makes you start again on the spot and game over you when their all gone.\n\n2. Bosses = Their really cheap, a challenge is one thing. But them spamming is just mind numbingly silly.\n\n3. Controls = For the love of god, were in 2015. People will not always have a controller, why not make it possible to use the keyboard and mouse. Since it is on the desktop and not a bloody console? (My Wired 360 Controller keeps disconnecting at random, and that causes me to die alot.)\n\n4. Player Base = Is it me? Or the Player Base is so barren, youd have more luck finding people in the middle of nowhere. It feels so dead and desolate, like really desolate.\n\n5. Soul Bolts = This one is rather confusing, so normal bolts and soul bolts? Whats the bloody diffrence? Really? You lose the normal bolts when you die (Look up number 1.) and you keep the soul bolts? but thats just silly on its own. Cause when you die, the game forces you to spend the soul bolts unless you want them to vanish? Really? So you die and want to get more and you lose them if you start another mission? What the hell is the reason for that? Arbitrary Grind Fest?\n\nThe graphics is kinda good, but in a bland kind of way. But not in a bad bland way, just meh at best. Enemy A.I.? Is there any? Think this things follow a pre-determined pattern, gonna look into that deeper.\n\nMy final score for this game is a 5/10\n\nWould have scored more if the issues above was solved, or fixed. Cause the changing control option just crashes you, unresponsive state that you can never escape.\n\nIf your a fan of Megaman games it will tide you over, but a none fan of the franchise it will be a huge hit and miss.","November 4, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend 20XX to any user, Mega Man fan or not. It has an art style that many seem to hate, but I personally don't mind, two very interesting and unique protaganists, and satisfying action-platforming elements. This game has tons of replayability with many different bosses and daily / weekly challenges, yet more is sure to come in the full release. This game technically has no learning curve, but what's good is that you have to make the learning curve yourself. If you're not that good, start at casual mode and work your way up. And once you've gotten really good at the game, there are plenty of upgrades and skill mods to play around with, plus local and online multiplayer support.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun game that I enjoy immensely and recommend highly.

The levels are good, the bosses are fun, this is a solid game and easily worth playing even in its current early access state.

The randomized levels lack the polish of the games it takes inspiration from and certain segments will quickly become familiar, but for the most part they are fun and the variations keep you interested.\n\nOverall, solid effort.

From what I've seen thus far it works really well, though the game itself is very clearly in alpha and can use many changes.\n\nFor one thing, I feel the physics engine could use a bit of tweaking. This game is obviously trying to emulate Megaman X's physics, but it doesn't feel quite as smooth and satisfying(ex. The dash isn't really as effective unless you have the powerup that increases the dash's power.). For the most part, it works pretty well, it's just kind of rough around the edges at the moment.\n\nAnother problem I have is how the levels are designed. I was incredibly interested in the idea of having randomly-generated levels, but the levels seem to give off more of a rage game vibe than anything else. The time limit really doesn't help either. Sure, it adds a bit of intensity to really beat the level, but it puts you in a state of stress that Megaman games generally do not have. The bosses, however, I have no problem with. I love how the bosses are designed.\n\nAll and all, I do like 20XX. It is a great concept and shows plenty of potential.

Seriously, ZX came out ten years ago, the last X game was twelve years ago...\n\n20XX evokes nostalgia for the Mega Man X series and the era of challenging platformers, while not aping the early 1990s. The art is clean and aesthetically pleasing, the soundtrack is phenomenal, and procedural level generation coupled with the game's roguelike-like permadeath make for a fantastically difficult, non-repetitive action platformer that feels like a modern take on a long past world of video games.\n\nI don't think I've ever played a classics-inspired game on Steam that felt so right. It feels like being a kid again. Though if I had played more of the Mega Man series as a kid, maybe my runs in 20XX would last longer than a few levels.\n\nWatch the full review on YouTube.","May 21","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Agonizingly difficult, in fact. Something the developers are well aware of and is likely much of the intention for the game. As someone who has played--in its entirety--every game in the Megaman canon from NES, SNES, and PS (even Rockman & Forte, and yes, Legends) I thought this game would come naturally. It didn't. I got so frustrated with it I stopped playing it. After some time though I gave it another try and now I'm hooked.\n\nIt's still difficult, no doubt exacerbated by the fact that I'm playing on a keyboard and not a controller, as the game rightly recommends. The challenge of it though, is part of what makes it so appealing. It's also what will likely keep its replay value very high.\n\nThere's two playable characters, one with a blaster and one with a saber (sound familiar?). Where the game really differs from others (AHEM) like it, is that rather than having set levels, the levels are randomly generated, though you'll see a lot of familiar and recycled set ups. Levels and bosses increase in difficulty the further along you go. Things start out innocuous enough, but after you defeat three bosses or so, the game get down right cruel. You'll gather numerous power-ups along the way to assist you and collect nuts (insert one of the litany of "nut" related jokes in the game here) to purchase  others. The randomly generated levels ensure that things stay interesting as you'll probably never play the same level twice.\n\nThe one drawback with randomly generated levels though, is that it's hard to feel like any progress is being made in the game. You get ONE life. If you die, you have to start all over. That can be more than a little frustrating. I gather though that the intention is not so much to make progress in the game per se, as it is to make progress in your SKILL with the game. That's perhaps more rewarding than just beating a level (in theory, at least).\n\nWhat would be ideal, is to see a story mode that does have a complete and tidy, level-by-level, boss-by-boss playthrough experience in addition to the "challenge run" style the game is in currently. Perhaps your progress in the challenge run can have some bearing on the story mode (unlocking powerups and so forth)? The game is still in development, so who knows what the developers will come up with.\n\nIt bares mentioning that most of the music is really phenomenal, with the perfect retro 16 bit upbeat techno-rock-guitar feel to accompany the game. Many of the tunes are infectiously catchy. Also, the platformer obstacles are definitely more challenging and creative than just about anything I've encountered in the Megaman or X games. You will need some serious precision timing and masterful finess with your jumping and dashing to acquire many of the powerups scattered throughout the leves.\n\nOverall, 20XX is stupidly fun to play--especially for an old Megaman veteran like myself--and challenging enough to keep me coming back. The one thing lacking is a sense of progression through the game (beyond building skill and buying powerups to use in casual mode). I appreciate the familiarity of it, as well as the the novel elements like the various powerups and array of ways to make the game MORE difficult (told you the developers knew what they were doing). Perhaps I'm just a nostalgic gamer hungry for a little bit more of the familiar parts of the game. Regardless, the game is well made and deserves your attention, certainly if you're a fan of Megaman. Just try not to break anything in the first hour or so.","December 17, 2015","true","34.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Thats it, since this is like early access, it made sense there was no story yet.\n\nThe gameplay fit well. And it even warned me to get a gamepad. Sure wish I did now. But I still enjoyed it though. Just like the mega man games, every boss has a several weaknesses and resistances to curtain special weapons.\n\nThe various stages you can travel to are very varied with levels such as Factories, Temples, and even Arctic levels.\n\nThe more you proceed in the game, the more power-ups you can unlock. As of recently, there are leaderboards, bosses were buffed up a bit because they felt too easy, and other things.\n\nA final word to mention is that since the game is still in Early Access, expect your data to be deleted a several times. The game updates a new patch every 2 weeks or so. Most of these patches change the game drasticly and others, like the leaderboard, didn't affect the save file. But once the game gets out of early access, it will cost $5 more than when it was in Early Access. So if you want to get this game, do it as soon as possible.","May 23, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Games like Rogue Legacy were similar, yet operated through static screens rather than a fluid open environment. When I first played it I was excited and overwhelmed by the gameplay, art style, music, and chaotic fun I was experiencing.\n\nNo two runs are ever the same. The items are well balanced and plentiful, the characters play different yet equal, and the learning curve is incredibly steep but never deterring. Veteran players and those new to the platforming genre alike will adore this game. With tight, responsive controls, 20XX will hardly feel like it cheats you.\n\nThroughout the alpha stages I've submitted bugs and recommendations on the steam discussion board, and almost every post had feedback from the developer. BatteryStaple is true to its players, and I believe will continue to listen to their community to make the game grow.\n\nOverall this is a game I'm eagerly awaiting to reach its full release. Whatever content BatteryStaple has up their sleeves is sure to make this game a must-have for those who love sidescrolling chaotic action.","September 25, 2015","true","85.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Love how you came back to the old character designs and it came with some new animation to boot! It's much better than the last character update (they were kinda bad imo) that you guys implemented (God, Nina looks like she was pmsing at everything LOL.) You really captured my attention with the fluidity of the game and it feels so much like the old Megaman game(s) no lie.  With that being said I would like to see a is:\n\n1) Boss overhaul with new movesets. Would like to see bit more diversity when they attack me. I mean it wouldn't hurt to ask, right?\n\n2) Keep the stages but change the scenery with each new boss, because it was kind of repetative, and again imo. Like each 2 boss would have the same stage but seemed like it was copy and pasted... I like a fresh new feel with each boss.\n\n3) Option for a savepoint (since some people are asking for it) in the cheats menu(or whatever its called).\n\n4) Maybe whenever I get a ability, like the mario hat for example (looks like a mario hat to me), Nina's or Ace's feet would get an upgrade in looks.\n\n5) Option to continue when you beat every boss in story mode? :) or maybe give us the option to continue in the cheats menu?\n\n6) True final boss? I mean "SPOILERRRRRR" if it is considered as spoiler:\n\n\n\n\nthe roller boss did mention in the dialogue about a mother (If I remembered correctly). Maybe the mother can be the true final boss? idk I'm just giving out ideas.\n\n7) Option to change Nina and Ace's color would be nice. Playing as red Nina or blue Ace would be awesome!\n\n8) And Lastly, keep up the fantastic work with the community. I mean not many developers would interact with the customers/community like you do.\n\nAlthough this game still have a long way to go as it's still in early access, I feel like this game would be in the colection of many who loves the original Megaman! Whenever I play this game it feels like nostalgia just hit me and with every new stage a challenge awaits me. I would really recommend this game to anyone who is really interested! It's only 12 dollars (at the moment of this review) and the developer is really interactive with the community of this game (I can't stress this part enough about the developer).  Plus side about this game is that it updates about every 2 weeks so that's a win win in my book!  Props to the devs. Will give this game my score when the full release is out.","September 12, 2015","true","29.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I read most of the reviews, and decided to grab it for me and my wife to play. Lets take a look.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Great idea. Not many other Mega Man style games out there. I feel like it could potentially be a good game. I like the idea of the rogue-style.\n\n- Very reminscent of Mega Man games, down to the character models and enemies.\n\n- Randomization of levels can be interesting. I can see there being replay value here.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Boring after about fifteen minutes. You just start to lose interest because of a few reasons I'll list below.\n\n- Very poor co-op. It's just honestly not very fun. Most of the time you're in each other's way, and the other person feels like a tag-along. It's like both people are playing a single player game, and there isn't any interaction. It's more frustrating than anything else.\n\n- Awful bosses. This game makes you work towards bosses that aren't really unique or very fun to even fight. Most of them are defeated easily. You're given their powers, but once you die you lose it all. It really loses the strategy behind Mega Man boss fights, where you fight one boss to get his power that will help you defeat another. You're working towards the "boss" every level, but most of the time the bosses are just regular enemy models that have different colors.\n\n- Randomization in levels. Seems like such a cool idea, until you realize that the levels get frustrating at times and you're just grinding to get to the end. The levels lose their charm quickly because of the randomness, which kind of kills any feeling of a story. There's no stopping and going back to base, customization of your gear or bonuses or character, or really anything. You lose all of your progress when you die, and it sucks to load up the game and start from scratch simply because you really don't feel any kind of satisfaction by getting far. You don't really work towards anything.\n\n\nVERDICT:\n\nOverall, I feel like this game needs some more story structure in order to give us a direction. I found myself disliking the game fairly quickly, which isn't something that happens to me often. I wasn't expecting Mega Man here, but they gave the game such a Mega Man look and feel that I can't help but compare it. I would suggest they add a Story mode that allows you to hit checkpoints after killing bosses. Make the bosses more difficult and the levels more varied. Powerups are disappointing and the nut system is exciting until you realize you don't really care about anything that you can buy.\n\nStructure is important, because this game is a little confusing in the beginning. I feel like a short tutorial level, which is prevelant in some of the Mega Man games, would be useful here. The first few bosses that I fought were disappointing because I didn't realize they were actually bosses.\n\nI can't recommend this game in the current state. It's playable, but not very fun. If you're looking for some classic Mega Man gameplay, go get an emulator and play Mega Man.","February 25","false","1.1"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","3"

Approvals all around mostly. Enemy designs look FAR BETTER than the player designs. (If you're going to copy Mega Man in the glorious X~X4 days, why not make it look that good all around?)\n\nOn the other hand, it's a Roguelike/Roguelite(?) - meaning that failure is just about inevitable unless you get a win condition/conditions during your run, a few glitches in a few stages render that precision platforming impossible alongside swarms of enemies that respawn when off-screen, useless lies of powerup pickups** and on a personal level - luck is trash**. Also, the playable character designs are eyesores - the "X" equivalent looks terrible, as does the "Zero" one, "Zero" is slightly less annoying to the eye. The game is in "Early Access" as well, so if you run screaming due to that, I don't blame you. It houses many a glitch - the most annoying of which being that whenever you start the game up, the game considers you WiiToddEd and INSISTS on showing you what pickups do (Health, Currency, Useless tokens, etc.) AGAIN, obscuring your screen for the duration of any pickup - not just the roguelike "weapons and passives" that you'll hopefully find.\n\n**In reference to luck, I haven't found anything worth using in several playthroughs, and that lack of boosted ability / powers will absolutely rear it's ugly head within 2-3 stage completions. Furthermore, the game touts "FIND SECRET PATHS / OPTIONAL PATHS TO FIND POWERUPS AND UPGRADES!" There aren't many. What I think is a secret usually ends up being health loss + fall into a pit after skillfully following a platform to a roof of some sort..\n\n*Powerups that aren't explicit benefits (and many that are!) are pretty useless. This isn't Binding of Isaac where powerups are EVERYWHERE and can be quickly amassed for actual gains. This is 20XX, where one item that boldly claims "Enemies drop more health powerups!" will follow with "I killed 75 more enemies, and haven't found a single health pickup! I had to beat that last stage with one bar of health! Not ONE DROP!". Many of the items are actually death traps. Speed increases? A particularly harrowing pickup that disables your ability to use special weapons at the cost of boosted strength? The air dash in particular is a let down. Should be a double jump instead!\n\n(***The game also has a nasty little bug I've run into. The aforementioned "point I'll get to in a bit", is here. Sometimes, the game loves to snuff out your jumps! If you hold down the dash key after dashing, every jump you do is a "Dash Jump" or empowered jump that goes faster, generally farther. If you're on a moving platform doing this, it may not allow you to jump, rendering you dead VERY VERY FAST. This is something that's unacceptable when combined with a certain level's difficulty curve compared to others..)\n\n\n\nDo I recommend it? Needs more balancing before I can give a clear yes or no. I'm leaning to "No" because the gameplay "learning curve" is out of tune. Plus I've just had no good runs in my time with it. This is an early access "early-thoughts" review.\n\ntl;dr - Don't pick SkyTemple stage unless you're ready to deal with fake difficulty. It's a stage that's 2-7x as long as the others and combined with many ANNOYING enemies that have shot reflection/block, rain down lasers, and has more general platforming than any Mega Man X series game has ever needed? It's a **** time all around, and will likely end your run.","December 29, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

The structure of the game, with moderate randomization, optional extra challenges and leaderboard tables hints of a game that could last for a long time and even build a competitive scene.\n\nNow, the problem is, the controls are awful. I'll admit i played this with a keyboard, whereas the developers highly recommend a 360 controller, but i'm used to running Mega Man X this way without problems. Indeed, the keyboard caused some initial hiccups, like the inability to dash-jump, but once i enabled double-tap to dash it worked fine.\n\nThat's not the major issue here though. The game's animations don't feel nearly as fluid as the ones i've come to expect from the mega man series. Chaining dash and jump animations together, a staple of the X-series, feels clunky and error-prone.\n\nIt's possible that the game will smoothen things out by the time it goes live, but for now, i can't really recommend it. Nailing the controls is the absolute number one priority for this kind of game, and right now it doesn't look like it has.","January 3","false","2.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

It doesn't have Capcom behind it and thus, the graphics, mechanics, gameplay, level design, boss design, etc. are not going to be the same as a game put out by them. I'm not saying this is a bad game and you shouldn't get it if you love the frustration of rogue-likes and the Newgrounds Flash-game-esque ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of a childhood memory coupled into one package; just that it's not going to be what you might expect when you think "Mega Man". To speak to the generation of the levels; at least when I played the game, even on the easiest setting, there are some combinations of stage "blocks" (or whatever you want to call them) that led to some ridiculous scenarios. I understand that that is what makes this game but, if you're going to have the idea of "completion" of a run in the game at least make it viable that every run can potentially be completed. With the design I saw you have about a 50% chance of getting stuck with somthing outright undoable - especially by a team. One more thing I can speak on is team play. It sucks. There's so much going on in some stages of the game and the graphical design does not take this into account to the point where my duo partner and I would complete the levels almost individually to reduce the risk of death. That's bogus and pretty dang lame if you ask me.","February 20","false","2.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

I usually can only stay entertained by it for about 20 minutes before bordedom sets in. Without a sense of accomplishment the game feels endlessly pointless. I have no interest in online multiplayer which might help others enjoy it...\n\nIn two months 16 hours of gameplay is pretty sad for something that seemed so promising. It's close, but it's just severely missing a "fun" factor.\n\nThe random levels makes finding power ups a chore, and as another reviewer said "a death trap." As there may or may not be anything there or a way to get back.\n\nThe bosses are lame at best, just glorified level creeps. With the level challange to beating them being the level, itself, becoming more difficult as they get harder. With no story it's hard to find a reason to care about fighting them. They repeat constantly, I think there are maybe 4-5 bosses? All garbage, all lacking a sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe developers have added very trollish items to ruin your runs, like one that removes almost all of your health and another that removes your ability to use specials. The items don't say what they do instead having some cryptic description. Think finally making if further than you have only to pickup an item that gaurantees your death. It's just not fun.\n\nIn mega man, you would get more poweful as you got "upgrdes" in this it's not always the case and I personally hate it.\n\nI really dislike the in level shops as they almost never have worthwhile items or perhaps there just are no worthwhile items.\n\nI'm going to actually uninstall now because at this point it's becoming clearer and clearer to me I just want to play mega man x and that this game won't ever give me the real satisfaction due to its rogue like elements the developers seem to insist on.\n\nRandom level generation is garbage and I feel an excuse to not have good level design, this isn't Terraria. Also there are only 3-4 really different feeling levels the rest is petty much just copy/paste with a few different textures.\n\nIf you like mega man games, I'd say pass. It'll feel good at first but after a little bit be prepared to be underwhelmed and sad at having something so close be so far off.","February 13","false","17.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","7"

A friend bought it for me to play together, and it was noticable right away that it's far off from its inspiration (or at least, its similarities in character design and control remind me vaguely of Megaman, but of a weaker version.)\n\nSome points:\n-The online co-op is decent, and was what I derived most of my enjoyment from.\n-The game has daily challenges and such, which could suggest some long term replayability.\n-The level design is kind of terrible. It really just likes to throw a bunch of enemies at you and pretend it's hard, when a charge shot wipes out everything in a line anyways. The platforming is basic, and relies heavily on poorly timed hazards like lazers that always turn on at the time you actually need to jump.\n-Disappearing block platforming, constantly. If you didn't like those parts in megaman, you'll hate them here. They're strewn throughout the levels like a weed on fertilizer.\n-The random generation really feels like the same thing over and over. Most of the items are basic "more damage, more drops, higher jump, max health, max energy", with a few interesting things mixed in.\n-I repeat my earlier point on hating the level design. Perhaps randomly generated platforming is only good on paper, especially when that naturally means a lot of repeated platforming sections.\n-Don't really like how the character controls. That may just be personal.\n\nHopefully it tightens up before the end of its early access phase. The game is generally well reviewed so hopefully it gets the support it needs, as it looks like it will be more or less successful regardless.","May 3","false","1.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","2"

But it also establishes a core philosophy which you will either like or hate.\n\nThe developers of this game have decided to create difficulty through randomization. In my personal opinion, that is a cheap concept and spells the death of any design process.\n\nSome of the things it does well:\n\n+ Initially it captures the feel of Mega Man. The music and stage concepts are okay, but repetitive.\n+ The Powerups that can be found do change the way in which you might approach the game.\n+ I would say the controls are fairly tight, although the game just sometimes, at random, decides not to read input.\n\nNow, for the things that ultimately turned me off:\n\n-Randomization of powerups, when/where/how you get them, and realizing they're all temporary. Using randomization as the driving component of difficulty is fatal to any game.\n-The game provides no sense of progress.  You're given 1 life to beat the game, and your success is largely dependent on the random exposure to powerups.\n-Stage design/difficulty is simply lazy after level 5. They begin just hoarding enemies that fill the screen with nonsense.\n-There are a max of 4 stage-types, so it becomes dull.\n-Even when you complete the game, there's no sense of satisfaction or accomplishment, as it all hinges on luck of finding powerups and you just... do it again.\n-Crashes. But EA...\n\nThe game attempts to capture the spirit of the classic megaman games, but can't help but sabotage itself attemping to put lazy and modern twists on it. People purchasing this game will be looking for a very specific experience. And, at first you may think you've found it, but in the end you'll realize this isn't what you were looking for, load up an emulator and play through the classics that did it right.","February 15","false","82.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

There's little to no feeling of feedback from everything you do, from shooting people or to even landing. Some sound effects that should exist are completely absent, such as certain enemies being hit by bullets.\n\nThe character designs are awful as well. They're unoriginal for one, but also very unappealing. Nina, the blue character, has overly animated hair despite wearing a helmet and giant anime eyes that stick out much more than they should, and her alternate colors, when you're player two and player one is also Nina, are absolutely atrocious.\n\nThe second character, whose name I didn't even care to remember, is entirely forgettable. His alternate weapon, a blender, you can find, is shorter range and garbage, where as Nina's is a four way shot which completely destroys bosses. Meaning, this character gets nothing but worse, on top of his hideous design, a weird buzzsaw on a stick that is somehow a sword sometimes and awkwardly fitted on the rest of his body.\n\nThere's very few tiles as well. Barely an hour in, and repeating levels became an issue already. The very idea of this being roguelike might be interesting, but then comes severe issues with it. Without speed items, the game is incredibly slow and dull. And if you ever die and lose all your speed buffs, you'll be reminded of how miserable it can be.\n\nThis game shouldn't be in Early Access, it feels as thought it's in an alpha state. But some early access games, such as Starbound, end up releasing in an alpha state of their game. In other words, 20XX may never get more refined in its gameplay, and it may never be worth the money you spend on it. Wait for it to release, and ask if it's still bad to the unfortuante who already purchased it. Changes are, they'll still say no.","January 21","false","1.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I tried the multiplayer with a friend and it was more fun than single player. Still think that the rougelite elements could be a secondary to a great adventure, and I am sure that I am not alone.\n\nUpdate 2: The new change in the bosses is awful. The somewhat cool looking rollster became a hamster with down syndrome and splits into multiple new hamsters when you beat one of them. Abysmal idea for a boss. Penguin now craps out GIANT ice dung all while having infinite ice shot generators shooting at you, again, "why would you do that?" The level design is still really bad ESPECIALLY sky temple and agnisort. Those levels are NOT fun, they just flat out suck.\n\nYou know something is bad when you dread selecting a certain level. It's even worse when you have to play the same level twice! What? you can't think of something else so you just redo the same thing? The only reason this went from a 3.5 to a 4 is because some of the new upgrades are cool, but being a rouguelite game you just feel empty inside after doing anything.

Having only one life and losing everything when you die is kind of a deal breaker for me... especially since some of the bosses just fill the screen with powerful attacks that are all but impossible to avoid.\n\nBottom Line:\nReally good nostalgia, but the game is frustratingly stingy with health and is way too eager to take rewards away from you.","September 4, 2015","false","1.1"," 18 of 70 people (26%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","26","18","70","4","6"

It has lots of different abilities, enemies & worlds to explore. It has daily & weekly challenges; including hardcore ones which are basically impossible :). In addition to that, it has skulls which can be used to modify the gameplay experience even further (think Halo). Multiplayer co-op is really fun and the different character types (melee & range) play well together.\n\nOnly negative is I've hit a few crashes from time to time, but usually on loading so it's not too impactful. The net code, admitted by the devs as sketchy when loading into an MP game, usually shows the other person you are playing with clipping through platforms and sometimes floating in the air. This is primarily visible when spectating the other person after you’ve died in an MP match.

This game is definitely cared for by it's developer (constant patching/updates & even responds/listens to the community) and has a huge amount of replay value. (It even has co-op: Local and Online)\n\nTons of power ups are scattered throughout randomized stages, bosses are quite challenging & this game even caters to speedrunners/ item collectors.\n\nAlso, if you don't like a certain aspect of the game, there is most likely a modifier for it (Located at the "Skulls" Kiosk)\nThese modifiers can make the game easier or harder depending on what modifier combinations you use.\n\n\nTIPS\nIf you like playing as X, play as Nina.\n\nIf you're a Zero fanatic, play as Ace.\n\nBe sure to use a controller. It's almost a must for this game.\n\n\nWARNINGS\nKeep in mind that this does follow the route of a "Rouge-like"...

The game is updated frequently and you always know when the next patch is coming out from the counter on the main screen or you can join the group for ealier updates so, theres always something to new coming out at the moment. If you want all the megaman action with all the controller throwing, hair ripping, and soul shattering fun that comes with great platforming then you need to play this.

It's in early access and pays homage to Mega Man X series.\n\nIt has online coop which is described to be fairly alpha (I have not got to testing online modes) but it has a pretty nice local coop capabilities which I tried out with a friend. The soundtrack is really good, especially the main theme plus cool art. I really like the way you obtain items and unlock upgrades (augs) plus there's a crap tonne of interesting and different ones to unlock or purchase for use in your next run, some augments can only spawn in a run. All of the levels feel well designed and engaging with a plethora of different enemy spawns and pseudo random level generation. I havent seen any random clipping into walls/blocks, noticable glitches or zips while I have been playing. There are platforming tricks to be done like hitting one cycle platforms at speed and nifty boosted wall jumps and other physics tricks you can utilise to skip an otherwise extremely awkward section or to save time on conventional routing of a level/section (Provided you obtain the required add ons). The bosses can be pretty nasty at first (easy once you know them) but later in the game they are always difficult with a tonne of extra life and new abilities. A good challenge. There's alot of cool weapons, core augments and standard augments that you can unlock and/or find in a run which are interesting to synergise, giving you pretty hilarious results. Im surprised by how complete the game is already. All of this adds up to a great platformer game experience. After 100 hours playing in both solo and local coop on normal mode, I still want more.\n\nThere are some minor negatives i'd point out:\n\nHad occasional yet very rare Input errors with a wireless pad. For example, I'd push left while holding a shot or while mashing shoot, nina would auto turn right after the initial input resulting in missed shots (shooting the wall instead of the dang boss) though I reiterate this is pretty rare to happen. In local Coop mode your friend doesn't also get augments purchased for the next run. And a not so serious gripe, jumps on ice to ice with over hanging and strategically placed enviromental hazards can be trolly and have embarrassingly ended some of my runs lol. That's all I have.\n\nMy opinion on a change brought by recent updates:\n\nOccasionally now later in the game, some sections are made needlessly difficult to excute without sustaining large amounts of hits and subsequent damage because of excessive and awkward placement of the enviromental hazard i'll call torch flames. They were a hazard before but it seems as if they spawn more frequently and in more awkward places now. Map RNG is harsh sometimes I guess..\n\nI really like this game and can't wait for it to officially launch! Great fun!","March 3","true","99.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's fun, fast paced, addicting, rewarding for those who have the skills necessary to perform some advanced techniques, and the item system is honestly the best part. Each and every playthrough is unique and has some excellent easter eggs and references. I think this game could give Mighty Number 9 a run for its money, especially since it will be updated frequently/regularly. I've spent only about 4 hours in total playing this game on my own account but at my brother's house I must have spent a total of 5-6 hours by myself. The game never really feels like it gets boring because of the rogue element and I highly recommend this game to any mega man fans. I recommend playing with a controller too, but I got by using my keyboard for a very long time. The animations are great, the music is just as catchy as the old mega man games, plus unlocking new items/ content feels good even when you die shortly after.

What I mean by this is, when playing megaman, you can continue from the start of the stage (With all your powerups and buffs) but in this game, I only found myself constantly restarting without any such powerups or buffs.\n\nIt's a bit dissapointing because I - personally - don't like to 'start from 0' every time, and neither did my friend. What this meant was, as we're probably not the most skilled players in the world, we found the barrier to entry was much higher for us.\n\nGameplay wise, it felt pretty tight and smooth on my end - but the methods for dash jumping felt a bit iffy. Friend found that things felt very 'Floaty' compared to a MegaMan game. So various feelings are floating around on it.\n\nThe level design, however... I really hated the level design. A huge thing with MegaMan games - which is what drew us here, advertising it as a 'game with megaman like gameplay' - is that your levels need to have an intelligent design to them. But there was a number of times where we found ourselves in a spot where there'd be -no- way to dodge. No way to evade. No way out.\n\nThere was nothing as upsetting as slowly progressing with 1 hit left, knowing that making a mistake would kill me. Only to see a sure-fire death trap up ahead. A laser barrier behind that I had to jump through, a wall that I had to climb up via walljumps right opposite of it, and a Cannon right at the top of it. No way to get up there and hit the canon without eating a hit.\n\nAfter an hour of playing, we found we DID enjoy the game... But we didn't enjoy it enough to keep it.\n\nPost-edit add in: I'll put a recommendation on this game, but only for the fans of the Rougelike genre, specifically!","May 26","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"

Also the platforming and controls are so smooth and actually play just as good, if not better, than a certain platformer series that this game may or may not be based off of COUGH Mega Man X COUGH.\n\nThe items and armor upgrades are all cool and unique, and it feels so rewarding when you earn them, whether it's through completing battle challenges, or platforming challenges. 20XX is also a roguelike, meaning it changes every time you play, and you get to choose which boss to take on next. New weapons also give new fun ways to use the character, allowing you to develop your own strategies to clear enemies and finish the stage. This game honestly has me more hyped than Mighty No. 9 ever could get me, and the soundtrack for this game is absolutely beautiful, and just SCREAMS Mega Man X. I actually need to listen to the full title theme before I start the game and exit the game. All the time.\n\nAnother feature that adds even more replayability are the leaderboards and daily/weekly challenges, which are premade 20XX runs, and they're solid, clean fun. The game also has a casual mode which increases accessibility to people who aren't hardcore platformer players, and lets everyone have a good time. Also, did I mention you can bring a friend and you can both have a grand old time?\n\nThis game nails everything down hard. The platforming is solid, the gameplay is fun with rewarding challenges, and there's just so much diversity and upgrades that you'll just keep on playing.","April 21","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Never the less, let me help you a bit, by listing the things that make this game awesome.\n\nSuper-tight controls. This takes the freedom of movement it took all the way up to Megaman Zero to perfect, and then makes it even better. Get ready to dash-wall-jump off a wall, over an enemy, turn, shoot, backtrack, and grab onto a small platform with your head for another wall-jump.\n\nExcellent platforming play. Ground? What ground? While it can be a bit frustrating in the Sky Temple, with its countless traps, the game fully has you making accurate leaps from one tiny platform to another, or going up and down walls, or doing disappearing block puzzles. What more, the randomly generated levels prevent you from getting too "muscle memory" with the jumps. While the levels are still primarily linear, they do have you going left, right, up, and down. You're not just going screen by screen clearing enemies, but also having to watch your movement at the same time.\n\nThe soundtrack! Oh, the soundtrack! Brandon Ellis is a genius. I could spend pages explaining it, but it'd be faster if you just looked it up and listened to it.\n\nThey have a reddit in which they take user input into consideration. The game is seeing improvement after improvement, with regular updates still coming out.\n\nPlus, there's something to be said about how Roguelikes can have you coming back to the same game, time after time, and still having fun.\n\nOh, and it has cool power ups and graphics and whatnot. But seriously, how did you make it all the way down here and STILL haven't bought this game? BUY THIS GAME!!\n\nAlso, coop multiplayer: SO AWESOME!

The level elements are randomly generated, giving a new experience each time you play. Collecting augmenting items, aquiring armor, and obtaining bosses weapons all enhance your robotic warrior as you blast your way through the game.\n\nPros:\nGameplay: The game feels very similar to Capcom's iconic JUMPANDSHOOTMAN franchise. While the physics are not completely identical, it's accessable enough for veteran players to jump into the action.\nItems: The variety of collectables breath life into the genre, changing the game in fun and exciting ways.\nMusic: The score is top notch.\nDifficulty: The game starts off very friendly for beginning players, but scales up in difficulty after progressing through each stage, reaching brutally punishing levels late game, just like Mega Man games are known for.\nSupport: The developers are constantly updating the game (and do so every other Wednesday), adding new content and responding to user feedback. It's refreshing to see how involved the creators are.\n\nCons:\nRandomly Spawning Items: This game is a roguelike, so random powerups come with the territory. But it can be very frustrating when you cannot find powerups that are relevent to your current character build.\nDIfficulty: As I mentioned, this game can be downright punishing. Especially if you don't have the proper items and equipment, some of the late game stage hazards seem cheap and infuriating. The laser traps in the Sky Temple in particular will make you want to throw your controller if you couldn't find anything to help you deal with them.\nLearning Curve: This isn't a con so much as a statement, but there is a definite adjustment period needed to get use to the game mechanics; especially if you're a Mega Man veteran. For example, the fact that your health doesn't replenish at the start of each new level seemed very strange at first, but once you get a feel for the game, these adjustments become a nonissue.\n\nAll things considered, I love this game, and am continuously impressed by how far its come. I can't wait to see the finished product.\n\n9/10 Would definitely recommend.","May 19","true","50.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I mean by this is, when playing megaman, you can continue from the start of the stage (With all your powerups and buffs) but in this game, I only found myself constantly restarting without any such powerups or buffs.\n\nIt's a bit dissapointing because I - personally - don't like to 'start from 0' every time, and neither did my friend. What this meant was, as we're probably not the most skilled players in the world, we found the barrier to entry was much higher for us.\n\nGameplay wise, it felt pretty tight and smooth on my end - but the methods for dash jumping felt a bit iffy. Friend found that things felt very 'Floaty' compared to a MegaMan game. So various feelings are floating around on it.\n\nThe level design, however... I really hated the level design. A huge thing with MegaMan games - which is what drew us here, advertising it as a 'game with megaman like gameplay' - is that your levels need to have an intelligent design to them. But there was a number of times where we found ourselves in a spot where there'd be -no- way to dodge. No way to evade. No way out.\n\nThere was nothing as upsetting as slowly progressing with 1 hit left, knowing that making a mistake would kill me. Only to see a sure-fire death trap up ahead. A laser barrier behind that I had to jump through, a wall that I had to climb up via walljumps right opposite of it, and a Cannon right at the top of it. No way to get up there and hit the canon without eating a hit.\n\nAfter an hour of playing, we found we DID enjoy the game... But we didn't enjoy it enough to keep it.\n\nPost-edit add in: I'll put a recommendation on this game, but only for the fans of the Rougelike genre, specifically!","May 26","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"
