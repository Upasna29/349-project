The art in this game is other-worldly and trippy, and it's a blast to tear through the twisted alien armies that vary from Fluffy laser bunnies to alien ghosts to cylon-esque robots.\n\nBoss fights are the set pieces here, with each boss requiring a different strategy - and man are they all weird as hell (in a good way). There is decent replay-ability due to the timing and "score" you can achieve from taking the bosses down quickly or without taking too much damage. The different pets you can buy add depth to the way you can approach the games' challenges - just try to remember to save up the yellow "currency" in the beginning, so you can afford the more expensive and interesting pets. Some of them are downright hilarious - a flying cat that shoots and screeches? Yes please.","August 21, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The pace is a little slow, but it picks up as you move along.  The mechanics are creative and solid.\n\nAs other reviewers noted, it's geared towards using a gamepad, and you might find the controls unintuitive otherwise, though you can look them up in the options menu.","August 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

This is the stuff nightmares are made of.\n\nSound: Yay\nThe music has a heavy retro/synthwave feel to it which goes along well with the other elements of the game.\n\nGameplay: Yay\nA gamepad is highly suggested. Almost every button does something. This allows for a variety of ways to approach and attack.\n\nOverall: Buy\nIt's creepy, it has variety, and it's fun.","May 6","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Monster design is so out of this world and simply hillarious.\nThere is some controls confusion (when you plan on a keyboard), but you can overcome it.

It brought me back to a time when games gave you that warm tingle of being immersed in a unique world. The art direction, and combat come together to create a game that is super fun to play.","August 25, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't think I've ever seen a game with sprites this good and such smooth animation.  Really great.\n\nThe character designs were cool too.  Nice music and atmosphere.\n\nOverall cant recommend due to camera zoomed way too close in - too many leaps of faith and the controls don't really seem appropriate for keyboard.  If i had a gamepad maybe its worth buying at this price.","August 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","4","14","0","0"
