I'm not a hater, i'm just saying that in my opinion Source Engine is better than GoldSrc.\n-  Only 1 server I know of is still up.","January 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","29","44","6","6"

The gameplay is similar to Quake with all the same weapons and pickups except for the Half-Life's trademark crowbar as a melee weapon. The game is very fun to play and you can get into it pretty easily. Learning some of the most advanced techniques mimicked from Quake such as bunnyhopping can be tough to learn but other than that the game is not hard at all to play. However, the game doesn't really have that many active players and you won't have the same kind of fun playing it as Valve's other titles.

He subsequently managed to consolidate power following the 1924 death of Vladimir Lenin through suppressing Lenin's criticisms (in the postscript of his testament) and expanding the functions of his role, all the while eliminating any opposition. He remained general secretary until the post was abolished in 1952, concurrently serving as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 onward.\n\nUnder Stalin's rule, the concept of "socialism in one country" became a central tenet of Soviet society. He replaced the New Economic Policy introduced by Lenin in the early 1920s with a highly centralised command economy, launching a period of industrialization and collectivization that resulted in the rapid transformation of the USSR from an agrarian society into an industrial power.[2] However, the economic changes coincided with the imprisonment of millions of people in correctional labour camps.[3] The initial upheaval in agriculture disrupted food production and contributed to the catastrophic Soviet famine of 1932–1933, known as the Holodomor in Ukraine. Between 1934 and 1939 he organized and led a massive purge (known as "Great Purge") of the party, government, armed forces and intelligentsia, in which millions of so-called "enemies of the Soviet people" were imprisoned, exiled or executed. In a period that lasted from 1936 to 1939, Stalin instituted a campaign against enemies within his regime. Major figures in the Communist Party, such as the old Bolsheviks, Leon Trotsky, and most of the Red Army generals, were killed after being convicted of plotting to overthrow the government and Stalin.[4]\n\nIn August 1939, after failed attempts to conclude anti-Hitler pacts with other major European powers, Stalin entered into a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany that divided their influence and territory within Eastern Europe, resulting in their invasion of Poland in September of that year, but Germany later violated the agreement and launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Despite heavy human and territorial losses, Soviet forces managed to halt the Nazi incursion after the decisive Battles of Moscow and Stalingrad. After defeating the Axis powers on the Eastern Front, the Red Army captured Berlin in May 1945, effectively ending the war in Europe for the Allies.[5][6] The Soviet Union subsequently emerged as one of two recognized world superpowers, the other being the United States.[7] The Yalta and Potsdam conferences established communist governments loyal to the Soviet Union in the Eastern Bloc countries as buffer states. He also fostered close relations with Mao Zedong in China and Kim Il-sung in North Korea.\n\nStalin led the Soviet Union through its post-war reconstruction phase, which saw a significant rise in tension with the Western world that would later be known as the Cold War. During this period, the USSR became the second country in the world to successfully develop a nuclear weapon, as well as launching the Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature in response to another widespread famine and the Great Construction Projects of Communism.\n\nIn the years following his death, Stalin and his regime have been condemned on numerous occasions, most notably in 1956 when his successor Nikita Khrushchev denounced his legacy and initiated a process of de-Stalinization. He remains a controversial figure today, with many regarding him as a tyrant.[8] However, popular opinion within the Russian Federation is mixed.[9][10][11] Stalin is attributed to 20,000,000–40,000,000 deaths as a result of his regime's actions.[12][13]\n\n","February 16, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Skip it and grab Quake instead.\nDISCLAIMER: As an Australian, the playerbase is almost non-existant. While playable with 4 to 8 friends, you won't enjoy this game as much if you're by yourself.\n\nDeathmatch Classic is essentially just a deathmatch type game mode using Quake's weapons (and some of its maps). It feels like it was an experiment to recreate Quake inside Valve's new engine than anything else, because it lacks any sort of content unique to the experience.\n\nNot that there's anything wrong with this game: Quake's multiplayer is some of the best there is. There's a bunch of cool weapons, each for different playstyles and situations, and the maps give a nice sense of dynamic movement. It's quick, fast, and tonnes of fun.\n\nThe issue here is that Deathmatch Classic doesn't add anything other than a couple of maps. They're still good, but the issue is that for $5, you're playing a thinned down experience of the multiplayer portion of an 18 year old game that is available on the same platform. As part of the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology, it's an okay bonus, but as a standalone title it's not worth the price.\n\nRATING: 0 UP, 1 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals).

It is unrelenting. Murder until you can't murder any more, then murder more. Slaughter people. End their lives. Snuff out their existence.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Redember/recommended/40/","Redember","Brody","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Redember/","156 products in account","Deathmatch Classic is Valve’s first game in their “Classic” series which consists of games that are either an homage or just related to the game Quake in one way or another, why? I’m still not sure, but I can only assume it’s because Valve loves Quake.\n\nThe game takes all your favorite Quake deathmatch arenas and puts them into source, while still replicating all of the weapons from Quake and having the same placement around the maps for players to pick up and use.\n\nJust like Half-Life you can select your model to use while playing, and of course it’s all Half-Life characters. So what is this game then? Is it a Half-Life and Quake crossover? Well not really, because there’s nothing in the game that even says Quake or shows the Quake emblem and all the powerups such as Quad damage are replaced with the lambda. It’s just Quake Multiplayer reformed into Half-Life.\n\nSo Valve made an online deathmatch shooter focused multiplayer game, even though they just replicated Quake and treated it like a tribute, they didn’t even bother to fix the problems it already suffered from previously\nAll the weapons are incredibly unbalanced to where it’s just Rocket Launcher: The Game, really. They didn’t change any of the weapons from Quake at all.\nIn Quake’s singleplayer the regular shotgun is made to do a set amount of damage to enemies who have a set amount of health, so that’d be around 2 or 3 hits for your basic enemies because their health is built around what weapons you can obtain and when. But this game still gives you 100 health so therefore the regular shotgun is like throwing pebbles at your enemies and the rocket launcher can and will kill people in two shots.\n\nThey didn’t even think about the fact that your weapons get better the further you progress in Quake, and that it would be a stupid idea to just randomly scatter them through the maps to where when you get the best weapon (The Rocket Launcher), you’re set for the rest of the game. I am 100% aware this is already a flaw in Quake’s multiplayer already, but it still plays into this game and that doesn’t make it okay.\n\nThis game overall just feels lazily put together so Valve can feel like they made their own rendition of Quake, the game can be fun but the horribly balanced weapons will be your worst complaint.\n\nThe game’s $4.99, but I would just buy Half-Life, Day of Defeat, or even Ricochet. But this is still good to have if you already own all of Valve’s other Gold Source games.","September 24, 2015","false","17.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/40/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Deathmatch Classic is a multiplayer DM action on HL1 engine, copying almost one to one Deathmatch of Quake 1. It was a free modification that came with patch for Half-Life back when it had retail release, yet as of right now it's being sold serapately on Steam.\n\nAnd I must announce first, the Internet community here is almost dead. Not worth the purchase, I am afraid. Most often, you will see a list of completely empty servers, only sometimes getting 1-3 players playing on one server.\n\nBut yes, what you see here is almost complete copy of Quake 1 Deathmatch experience - a Valve's tribute of it, with same weapons, same maps even, close textures. But it's now shinier and a bit slower-paced. You get same maps. You get same weapons, but they look quite HD compared to Quake 1 style. You know them, shotguns, nailguns, grenade and rocket launchers. And as you know, rocket launcher is really the best weapon here, can't really hope to hit all time with weak projectile weapon that is Nailgun, while Rockets provide heavy-damaging splash effect anywhere you point at. Another thing, is that high-ping is quite unfriendly in this game, you can only hope to do damage with rockets. So yes, Rocket Launcher is overpowered and main thing there, like in Quake 1.\nOtherwise, classic Arena formula. Stock, shoot, then run and restock. It's quite fun to duel, combatting and juggling with rockets and then getting away to restock health and armor, taking best on map.\nNow, if only it wasn't so dead...","August 15, 2014","false","2.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

It's still just Half-Life 1 multi-player and the problem with Half-Life 1 multi-player is that you have an incredibly amount of significantly better choices within the same game.\n\nCounter-Strike, Natural Selection, Day of Defeat, Half-Quake, The Specialist and the list goes on and on. No what what kind of FPS multi-player you are looking for, there will be a mod that serves your need and this makes Deathmatch Classic a somewhat redundant choice.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to buy this.

At the start of the game, you're told all about how horror is supposed to be a mystery and ♥♥♥♥ in order for it to stay scary, but the game goes to huge ♥♥♥♥ing lengths to completely get rid of any sense of mystery or terror, because it loads you up with tons of weapons and tons of easy enemies, and it even tries to explain everything about them to you when you'd really rather just not listen to that ♥♥♥♥ at all. Amnesia did it right: only show the monster every once in awhile so the player is actually fearing the next encounter. Tossing the ♥♥♥♥ers at the player like they're cannon fodder just shows how simple and unscary they are. What also didn't help out was how the main character ♥♥♥♥ing narrated EVERYTHING that happened. I get that he's a writer or whatever, but seriously, when there's supposed to be a tense moment and your character is shocked at what he saw then goes "I was so totally shocked at what I saw", it breaks the ♥♥♥♥ing immersion. Chalk another one up for the lovely developers who probably have their fists up each other's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s right now. The game should've been a co-op zombie-like shooter because the only actually fun part of the game involved your AI companions helping you out in shootouts while one of them talked ♥♥♥♥ about your mom. There is some nice scenery in the game and altogether the atmosphere of a small country town surrounded by mountains is nice, but there's no horror here, there's no amazing gameplay, and everything is hugely repetitive and dull. I wanted the game to be over about four hours before it actually wrapped up, but I guess it wasn't the worst game I've ever played Fable II. All-in-all it was an interesting game that I don't think had any beta testers 11/10 it was alright. -pcgamer","July 19, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

DMC also imitates Quake's physics, which allows an advanced player to gain a lot of extra speed or jump very high by using a number of movement skills such as bunny hopping and rocket jumping.\nThe default game speed in DMC is somewhat slower than in Quake. The weapons scale from the basic shotgun to the rocket launcher and the "shaft", a powerful directed-energy weapon. Three kinds of bonuses are scattered over the maps, which give the player a temporary special power: "quad damage", "invulnerability", and the "ring of shadows" which turns the player into a ghostly, almost invisible figure.","March 26, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First thing that I saw was this. It was 32 MB so I thought, well It will download for about  6 secs soooo, yeah, let's give it a try. I joined a server which had 1 guy playing on it, cuz all the others were empty. There were two teams, Satan and Jesus. I choose Jesus cuz he's my man, and I went around and killed satan bots with a shotgun like a boss. Then After a while, the other player started Team Killing and I got disconnected for no reason at all. :P Anyways, very fun and crazy.
