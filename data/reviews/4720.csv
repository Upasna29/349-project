Don't try this at home or at your place of business :)\n\nWhile my play time on Steam will appear non existent, I have played Condemned every year since it's 2005 introduction. Containing multiple endings, Condemned, a first person psychological horror, offers the player a chance to experience some of the most well implemented melee combat that has ever been produced.  A great variety of melee weapons are available and weapons such as rebar, pipes and locker doors can be pulled literally right out of the environment.\n\nWeapons are not limited to Melee.  Ranged weapons are limited in availability and include but are not limited to rifles, pistols and shotguns.  Ammo is limited to what is loaded in the weapon so shots count.  Run out of ammo?  Ranged weapons also double as melee weapons.  Melee weapons are rated by damage, swing speed, block time and reach.\n\nCondemned builds great atmosphere. Its story is told through the brilliance of forensic investigation using forensic tools and activley involves you in crime scene investigations. Condemned was released in 2005 and you can tell by the games character modelling however the environment that the game presents remains outstanding. The game's engine loads as fast as any engine I've seen and keeps load times to a bare minimum.  Great use of sound and nice visuals complement the immersive story.\n\nThe weapons of Condemned.\n\nIn February 2008 all copies of Condemned were confiscated in Germany because of §131 StGB. Distribution in Germany is now prohibited by law.*Source:Wikipedia[en.wikipedia.org].","March 3, 2014","true","0.2"," 71 of 78 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","71","78","0","13"

It was developed by Monolith Studios alongside F.E.A.R., so yeah, there's good things to expect here. You play as Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent stationed in NYC who's framed for the murder of two fellow police officers and is being chased by the Bureau while he attempts to find clues and follow the trail of the real criminal behind it all. The atmosphere is superb and full of creepy noises and heart-pumping suspense to go with the eerie locales including (but not limited to) an abandoned subway, an abandoned department store (WITH CREEPY AS ♥♥♥♥ TELEPORTING MANNEQUINS), an abandoned school... yeah a lot of abandoned areas, hence "Condemned". Complete with these areas are enemies galore, all of which are pretty much mentally screwed up drug addicts, both minor and major. The combat is satisfyingly brutal, crunchy, and has a great weight to it with every hit. It requires precision timing when blocking too, and takes a bit of practice to get it right. You can pretty much pick up anything layed about to use as a weapon (really, even a friggin' desk drawer) and firearms come into play later on. Weapons are plentiful, and health pill cabinets are found pretty easily throughout the game. It took about 8-9 hours to complete for me, so it's certainly every bit worth the price you pay, even if you don't get it on sale. Really, if you're a horror fan, this is a MUST BUY!","October 25, 2014","true","11.4"," 51 of 52 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","51","52","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/4720/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","This was a game I picked up based on a bunch of recommendations from various imageboards and a few friends. For what it’s worth, Condemned: Criminal Origins lives up to the hype and immerses you in a world of filth, horror, and redemption. You play the role of Ethan Thomas, a FBI agent tasked with tracking down serial killers, who ends up wrongfully accused of a crime he didn’t commit. Your desire for exoneration drives you to follow a trail of madness with only your FBI lab tools and intuition to guide you.\n\nDuring the game, you will be spending your time doing one of the following: combat or forensics. In the combat phase, gameplay resembles that of a first-person shooter or beat-em-up requiring you to either aim carefully or time your blocking and movement so as to avoid taking damage. You also get a taser which is extremely useful in situations where you are facing groups or enemies with firearms.\n\nFor the forensic phase, you will draw upon an array of tools to scan the surrounding area and collect the necessary information to continue the storyline. The implement used is automatically decided on depending on the circumstance and you are only required to point it at the very obvious area of interest in just about every instance, so there really isn’t much of a challenge. It’s basically just a vehicle used to drive the story forward. Regarding the story, everything is “good enough” and just about all the loose ends get tied up by the end so you won’t need to draw your own conclusions for the most part.\n\nEarlier in my backlog, I came across another murder mystery with a few similar themes (Deadly Premonition) and I’d have to say this is definitely the better of the two, at least story-wise. Be sure to pick it up if you want a little horror-mystery hybrid in your life.\n","November 28, 2015","true","8.5"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","47","53","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orbs/recommended/4720/","orbs","Meep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orbs/","435 products in account","Condemned is a deeply atmospheric and violent horror game.\n\nYou're a crime scene investigator: you start off by visiting a crime scene and use forensic tools to determine what happened there. After the initial investigation you find out the suspect is still in the building and go to corner him, but in a turn of events he manages to grab your pistol and you get conked out. You wake up to find you're wanted for two murders you didn't commit and must now clear your name by tracking down this maniac killer through some of the eeriest parts of the city.\n\nCondemned is a standout game when it comes to horror because of its immersive level design. Environments are extremely well fleshed out and thick with atmosphere. The gritty realistic detail in textures is particularly impressive, especially for a 2005 game, and because the horror and scares are subtle and more psychological in nature there is a genuine tenseness when exploring a new area. Not to mention that most of the derelict places you wander through are so dark you're forced to go in with just a flashlight to light your way... it definitely recalls some of my creepier urban exploration adventures!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=271182752\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=271142655\nBesides having an immersive horror atmosphere, Condemned shines in its brutal melee combat. It's especially impressive how realistic the enemies movements to your blows are. The most unique part of the combat is you can pull your weapon arsenal right from the environment: pry out a rebar pipe, rip the door from a locker, snatch a metal sign to get bloodied up - every location has its own host of makeshift weapons to put to good use. Oh, and I like that the enemy AI will fight each other if one of them accidentally hits the other - nice touch.\n\nAdmittedly the gameplay when it comes to the forensic stuff is forcibly linear. They shoehorn you into only being able to use one type of scanner or tool when you have an array at your disposal and you are basically only doing it to move the story along. It's still fairly interesting and interactive though, and the findings you report will give you clues into what's really going on and what to do next.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=250811336\nAll in all, I recommend checking this out if you're looking to explore a genuinely tense game spiced up with savage melee encounters and an engaging story. If you've played FEAR you know these guys will deliver on a solid horror game.","June 15, 2014","true","8.8"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","37","39","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/4720/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Condemned: Criminal Origins features a story of a detective who ends up on the run due to strange circumstances. He's after a demented serial killer, and to catch him and clear his name, he must take to the underbelly of the city. However, something strange is going on. Homeless people that have taken to living in abandoned buildings and tunnels are acting needlessly aggressive and violent. But it's more than just that, something darker, more sinister is thriving in the unseen places of this city...\n\nFeaturing a rather well-done and satisfying melee-focused combat system (seriously, not exaggerating, it has one of the best melee combat systems in a first-person type of game in my opinion), you'll find yourself exploring 10 different locations through the game, and periodically using some gadgets and gizmos for forensic sciences to try and track your killer. But of course, the best parts of the game aren't the combat or the detective work (though neither are bad!).\n\nThe horror element in this game doesn't really fully reveal itself until the later half of the game, which I think is an interesting choice. The atmosphere in this game is fantastic for certain, but things start to get seriously creepy and a bit unpredictable about half-way in. It's interesting as most horror games like to sort of blow their load at the start and then fuel the survival element in the second half of the game with more and more difficult enemies. This game does get harder per say, but its horror element really starts to shine in its second half, and I even think there may be less enemies in the second half of the game as well.\n\nThere are some very clever scares here, but honestly most of the horror comes from a really dreary atmosphere the game has, which is particularly strong in three specific locations/chapters in the later half. The story is interesting, though in this titles case I think you'll end off with more questions than answers (which might be for the best, as the sequel shows).\n\nIt's not perfect. Most notably, the final chapter and boss are a bit disappointing (a shame as they're promising in concept but just not executed all that well), but the game is definitely worth checking out for any horror enthusiasts out there. Most of the title has excellent execution and atmosphere, and it truly is one of the best horror games to have released in the last 10 years.","March 3, 2014","true","8.7"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","0"

A hidden gem as some call it.\n\nStoryline 10/10\nThe storyline of the game is perfect, it has it's twists and surprises. You start off as agent thomas who's been framed for second degree murder and is being hunted down by the bureau. If you enjoy detective work and a great meaningful story this game is for you!\n\nControls 7/10\nThe controls for the game could have been better thought of, what annoyed me a little was the fact that there is no jump button...You use spacebar to kick. Another thing that seemed strange to me was the reload system, there is none. If you press the button R it just shows you how much ammo is left in the gun. What could have imporved it was if you could transfer one ammo clip into a different gun or just put it in your pocket.\n\nA.I. 8/10\nIts funny how the A.I.works in the environment of the game, they use walls and small debris to hide. I did notice the A.I. running around one box trying to figure out how to catch me better xD\n\nGraphics 10/10\nI honestly can't complain about the graphics, they were amazing. There is an option to set the graphics to the lowest where you can barely see the outline of a gun or set them to highest and see a loose screw on the ground.\n\nOptions 10/10\nThe game offers plenty of options to change the sound, graphics, difficulty. Unfortunately you can't change the fov ingame, you have to manualy go into the folder and change settings.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nThe gameplay is one of the most important parts of the game and this game got it perfectly, I didn't find a moment while playing where I was bored. As I stated earlier you are a detective so that means you get to do some detective work right? YEAH! You're mission is to catch the one who framed you, serial killer X and you do so by following clues hes left behind. Somehow you have pockets the size of buckets. Every time you find a clue you take out a different machine or device to catch fingerprints or dna samples which you send to your partner in crime, Rosa. Following up all the clues you start to wonder who the serial killer X really as. (It tells you at the end of the game.) This game took me 15 hours to complete without rushing and dying over and over xD\n\nFinal Verdict 8/10\nThis game is something else, a game not many people realize has potential. If you ever get the chance you should play it. I had a lot of fun and many raging moments in the game, but that's just me being a noob xD","December 4, 2014","true","15.2"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","32","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/4720/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Condemned: Criminal Origins is a first-person psychological horror game by Monolith, renown for kickstarting the F.E.A.R. franchise, where the player takes the role of Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent who gets framed by a serial killer for killing his colleagues during a crime investigation. This sets motion for the events that are to follow in which Ethan, guided by his only trustworthy ally who believes he was not behind the killings, has to hunt down the real serial killer. In the meantime, Ethan also begins noticing the sudden increase in some very peculiar events that occur around him and to almost every person he meets.\n\nAs a survival horror, Condemned: Criminal Origins is a “beautiful” experience. What I mean by that is that the game focuses more on eerie atmosphere and enigmas reminiscent of games like Penumbra. No overuse of cheap jump scares and excessive gory imagery. For me, this is what I always wanted in a horror game which in recent years Frictional Games have always successfully provided for my fix. But even when the game ends up using these tropes for one or two occasions, they are well placed in the game and not overstay their welcome. Sure, the game also throws in a few supernatural elements, which I do not want spoil for obvious reasons, into the mix later on that make the experience even more petrifying. Frankly, there are quite a number of things which Condemned: Criminal Origins nails perfectly, and one of them is certainly the stellar audio design. The moment you hear all that tromping upstairs or around you, you truly start believing you could bend a steel pipe by how tense your butt cheeks are. I am not joking when I am saying that I occasionally pondered whether the real name of this game should have been Condemned: The Ferret Tromping. Likewise, the great soundtrack compliments the atmosphere and fits with the tone of the game. You can feel the cold shivers running down your spine. Bloody violins.\n\nWhen not wetting your pants like a sissy, Condemned’s gameplay is mostly all about melee encounters. Even though you can use a few firearms, their ammunition limitation makes them only worthwhile and effective in the short term. I suppose the best firearm is the taser as it can momentarily stun your enemies, giving you a window of opportunity to either steal their weapons or take an effortless shot at them, but it is useless against boss fights. Instead, you will be spending the majority of the time with melee objects such as pipes, planks, sledgehammers, axes, crowbars and many more, smacking your opponents to death. Whilst the melee combat might not feel exactly like in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare in terms of variety of moves, every swing has a “weight” to it. Thereby every miss you make can decide whether you will stay alive any longer. Now each weapon in the game has its own benefits and downsides. Some can deal more damage but are slower to manoeuvre and others deal less damage but are swifter. Honestly, the melee combat is perhaps amongst the best aspects of this game as it makes you think and move tactically. It feels satisfying too.\n\nFor a horror game, I think the AI in here is exceptional. Most of the human enemies will try to play hide and seek rather than simply attacking the player the moment they are spotted. Moreover, they do not just hide in one spot; they constantly switch their positions. This makes encounters unpredictable and always different in each playthrough. Naturally, there are a couple of scripted moments designed specifically to scare the player in the game, but thankfully these are very few.\n\nIn terms of graphical fidelity, the game shows its age quite clearly. There is no denying in saying that it feels visually “consolised” as the textures do look all muddy and the excessive bloom (when turned on) reminds me of games on a Xbox 360 from 2006. But in terms of art direction, it does a good job on the various designs of the enemies you can come across and the environments that almost feel like you actually visited them in real life. Additionally, the second half of the game, from a level design stand point, is much better and scarier.\n\nOf course, the game is not without its fair share of problems. First off, there are sections in the game which require you to take down some sort of a obstacle like a (wooden) door to advance to the next area. Being in the possession of an axe most of the time, at least in my case, one would think that would suffice. But you thought wrong as the game explicitly tells the player that it requires a specific weapon, like a sledgehammer, to take it down instead. This leads to going back and doing a couple of fetch-quests looking for the right item. Plus, you cannot guess what item  will require next time. Luckily, the aforementioned item generally tends to be nearby. Now, my main gripe with this is the simple fact that it is purely stupid. I have an axe, why cannot I take it down? Why do I need a different weapon which has pretty much an identical function as an axe in the game’s context?\n\nThen there is Ethan’s walking pace and stamina. The game gives the player the ability to sprint, but only lasts as long as “running” from one end of the room to the next.  It is not even running; it is a very slow jog. You see, it totally makes sense walking slowly in the more atmospheric segments of the game where you are in a pitch dark environment holding your melee weapon and a flashlight in hopes that nothing will startle you, but there are many occasions where that is not necessary -- such as when you have to backtrack in areas which you have already cleared out. This can be rather irritating when you are forced by the game to walk so slowly. It feels like the developers were somehow scared that people would sprint their way through the game, breaking the immersion they tried to achieve.\n\nThe next issue which I am about to discuss is not too serious, but the forensics investigations in this game are sadly meaningless since you are always told where and what to search for. Take your scanning equipment, focalise it on the object you want to analyse, press click and presto you are the greatest forensics specialist in the world. Personally, I strongly believe this is where the game missed its biggest opportunity to deepen its gameplay. Not only that, but it could have made you feel almost like a detective, looking for clues and making deductions.\n\nBeing a very linear game is not an excuse for the repetitive gameplay. The melee combat is definitely fun and rewarding, but after a few hours you will realise that smacking people’s heads and balls is what you will be doing almost the entirety of the game. It can get tiresome after a while due to the lack of variety. Because of that, the level design can also feel a bit too claustrophobic at times with its very narrow corridors and awful FOV. See, this is where a more complex and appealing forensics mechanic could have been handy to bring some proper variety.\n\nAnd lastly, while the game’s story starts out very promising, leaving the player with many questions and interpretations, it falls flat right towards the end. You can already smell the Indigo Prophecy stench from miles away, and that is one nightmare I try to not remember. The approach of “show, do not tell” which is adopted in the first three quarters of the game is well executed, because you know, a mystery is ruined the moment you bluntly explain it, but the ending kind of ruins most of that. I even think the last scene of the game nullified your entire journey.\n\nIn conclusion, Condemned: Criminal Origins ticks all the boxes for a solid psychological survival horror game. Despite some questionable design choices and a rather abysmal ending, it is singlehandedly one of the scariest experiences out there, and I am not saying that lightly. Clocking around 6-8 hours, I would say that it has about the right length, so if you like horror games, pick this one up.","March 12","true","10.4"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","4"

It's a really dark and twisted murder mystery in first-person perspective, with a lot of beefy and satisfying melee combat. The combat is very engaging and intense with smart enemy AI, almost like a fight in real life would feel like. There are guns too, but you can't rely on them completely since ammo is limited and hard to find. So when you do happen to have a gun to use, it is a special privilege. So you mainly have to resort to grabbing some 2x4 or pipe in the environment and whack some foos, usually freaky ♥♥♥ deranged hobos and psychotic killers.\n\nYou also have a bunch of very neat investigator tools and a taser that aren't just tacked on gimmicks; these mechanics actually make the gameplay very different from other FPSs. The investigation work brings some adventure/puzzle aspects to it. In fact, calling this game an FPS really doesn't describe the game as well as it ought to, nor does calling it a survival horror game or an adventure game. It's quite a special blend of all those aspects. And yes, it is scary. One of the scariest video games I can think of. And with a compelling story, if you ask me.\n\nIf you like Monolith's F.E.A.R. series, Condemned is made by those very same people and is every bit as good (perhaps even better, in terms of a horror game). If you want to play something unique and different (and also really good) in the FPS or horror genres, I highly recommend Condemned. Unfortunately, the also very very fun (but more action-y and melee combat-focused) Condemned 2 never got a PC version.

It's kind of one of those old school deals where you learn from your mistakes. The weapons, and there are a ton of them, all have their own feel, swing at different speeds, and are fun to use.\n\nThe health system is well designed. You always seem to find med packs when you really need them.  Overall, level design is really clever for a linear game with very little backtracking.\n\nLooking at this before purchase, I wondered how scary it could be running into homeless people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/4720/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A pretty cool horror game with a story that has its pretty unfitting moments and an odd ending that didn't seem to make sense I found.\n\nThe plot for the whole thing is pretty simple, you're framed by a killer of two cops and you're on a journey to find him. Throughout that journey you experience weird shtuff that can mess your trousers quite a bit. The story itself is actually a bit interesting to say the least however I don't feel that it was told all that well whatwith it just being a bit slow on the telling despite how somewhat short the game itself is (like 6-8 hours).\n\nAs for the actual gameplay it's an extremely simple first person, mostly melee based combat; they attack, you time your block right, you get a chance to attack some more until they're down. If you're good enough you can have them start fighting each other. There are guns in the game but they're very limited and restraint; you can't collect ammunition and you can't reload them though you can turn them into very fragile melee weapons. The entire game itself is pretty linear and it has a habit of having you backtrace (ie. acquire item X from this location to open door Y that you passed through a little earlier) though I didn't find it to be unbearably strenous. Because you're a Serial Crimes Unit agent you'll also be using investigation tools to partake in some CSI stuff by finding evidence that the person who framed you left behind which what you find that advances the plot further can be interesting.\n\nThe real selling point of this game however is the survival horror part; you start to hallucinate spooky shtuff, most of where you go gets extremely claustrophobic & obviously dark, and the game can be downright freaky to move around in. For the most part I found it very uneasy to even go where I was supposed to and more uneasy whatwith me being a bit bad with the subject of horror in general. That's how I prefer my horror anyway, making you feel terrified as opposed to using petty jump scares (though I tend to be bad with those as well and plus there aren't too many in this game I found).\n\nGet it for when it's cheap.","October 24, 2014","true","8.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/4720/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","Condemned: Criminal Origins is a very nice surprise for the discounted price of 3 buck something. Yeah I’m dat cheap. But I hadn’t even heard about the game until this Steam daily deal popped up. I had this vision for the original F.E.A.R. when the game came out, it was the wrong vision. I pictured a game sort of like Half-Life 2 where you walk through a creepy environment without hair raising moments and minimalistic shooting with a focus on a horror story telling.\n\nTurns out Condemned: Criminal Origins was the original F.E.A.R. I was looking for. It was practically released at the same time as well, circa 2006. I’m guessing development was somewhat parallel.\n\nIt uses the Lithtech Jupiter EX game engine that I completely endorse … aside from the stutter-like frame rate, given the fact I didn’t feel this present in F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin (which I highly enjoyed) it must have been some bug inherent to the engine’s flagship release batch. There are 4 different types of saves which are very handy, but the Auto-Save will usually suffice on normal difficulty.\n\nAs with F.E.A.R. 2, I must say that I have been quite impressed at the amount of content that is presented level design-wise. Whenever you progress through the game, they (Monolith?) always manage to change the scenery completely and smoothly. One moment you might be outside in some playground, the next you find yourself in some school’s locker hallway, then the next you find yourself in some bloody basement. All in one map with different 3D models and textures. That’s something you don’t find often in a lot of games which choose to repeat the scenery until the next level loads.\n\nI really don’t want to ruin this game for anyone, but Condemned: Criminal Origins had probably one of the most original boss fights I had seen in a long time. It looked heavily inspired by what I would call Sinawali (a Filipino martial arts involving sticks/batons). Most of the game combat-wise is based on melee strikes and blocking. Sometimes you will find some guns with a few shots, to which you are able to use its stock as melee on enemies that aren’t wielding a gun themselves. You also carry a Taser which is very handy for stunning your enemies for a few seconds (or frying bladder weak enemies). Although a bit of an eye-candy, there are also four optional finishing moves. The key word being optional … which some games don’t give. Add some sidekicks into the mixture and what you have is a fairly interesting combat system.\n\nEnemy AI is impressive, they fight each other if one accidently gets hit by another. They also somehow crawl through the bottom of bookshelves and attack by popping out half way. Some even disguise themselves in a creepy abandoned store by standing still amongst mannequins. Crazy huh?\n\nI’d say the story was mildly entertaining. It perhaps was a little slow to start off with in the beginning, but it just keeps getting better and better, including what was written during level loading screens. There are some basic investigations done like clue finding on certain visual cues. I’d give bonus points for this to the developers as to be totally honest I’m sick and tired of games infested with Full Motion Videos. Maybe that was okay back during the PlayStation days when it was difficult to include videos in games on other gaming platforms … but these days I’d prefer more interaction to my story. And this game hits the spot with that. It wasn’t hair raising or shocking … it was just good old fashion creepiness to build endless suspense. Of course there were some cut scenes, but the game wasn’t entirely saturated with them. The cut scenes happened at the appropriate times in my opinion.\n\nExcellent job done in the sound department. They are definitely responsible for the creepy atmosphere to the game without creating edge of your seat moments.\n\nI think my only quarrel with the game was perhaps the weapon, hand, phone and character 3D models. LOL, I’m not sure what the artists were thinking, they kind of just looked like 3D box modeling monstrosities with baked textures applied to them. At times I couldn’t even tell if I was holding a crowbar or a snake with a head defect. But it hardly takes away from the atmosphere.\n\nOverall a very relaxing 7 hour experience. If you haven’t played this game before and enjoy being in a horror-like crime environment that won’t make you jump out of your chair with the sight of things like Alma Wade … then this is a must have.","June 4, 2014","true","7.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/negrorat/recommended/4720/","negrorat","japanese adult video actress","http://steamcommunity.com/id/negrorat/","289 products in account","This is a game that throws out traditional [build tension -> release tension -> throw out a puzzle] methods of level design that most horror games employ. Instead, the terror comes simply through personal experience.\nWhat do I mean? I mean the game itself isn't that scary. The (comically stupid) enemies are just crackheads and thugs with hoodies on, whom you could encounter just by wandering around my beautiful home city of Los Angeles for a few hours. There are little-to-none scripted jumpscares, and the game being broken up by cutscenes provides solace from the vaguely menacing environment just as some atmosphere was being built. The real terror of this game is all from the individual's experiences.\nHiding in a tiny cubicle, listening to the grunts of SEVERAL pipe-wielding druggies outside, but not knowing where they would come from.\nAccidentally running into an enemy as you had your back turned.\nAlmost slipping off treacherous scaffolding to your death.\nThe real power of this game comes from simulating very real events. Though there will never be a mysterious event that causes all homeless men and meth-addicts within a hundred miles to resort to bludgening eveyone they see, all of the environments in the game are places where you would encounter someone like that. The closest in real life you'll ever come to stepping foot in Silent Hill or Mount Massive Asylum is to walk through a subway at night, or an abandoned apartment, which are both areas in the game.\n\nSo this game isn't particularly scary for everyone, it all depends on what you draw from it. With that out of the way, if you're not fazed by the situational horror of this  game, there's still plenty of content to enjoy. The controls in this game are amazing, especially if you consider that it's a port. The mouse has a certain weight to it when you swing the view, which would be annoying in a shooter but in a melee-heavy game like this it is welcome. The melee combat itself is where the game shines, as you have probably heard before. The swipe of your attack cuts through the whole screen, and the range on some of the weapons allows you to hit enemies way before they're close enough to hit you. The whole mechanic, from the powerful-looking swing to the delicious smack it makes upon hit, is just satasfying to use.\n\nOne of the game's downsides is its barren level design. Aside from the dozens upon dozens of pipes and conduits and such lying around, there are almost no collectables. Health is found in emergency kits on the wall. There are secrets called "metal pieces" and "dead birds", 3 of the former and 6 of the latter in each level. Unfortunately, it is not revealed until much later what they actually do. (plus, they're super hard to find, and usually you end up losing health from random enemies on the way) So gameplay consists of beating up homeless men and going through the occasional (heavily-scripted) investigation sequence.\n\nIn conclusion, situationally scary gameplay makes you paranoid as you run around repetitive levels, but that repetitiveness is atoned for a little by the varied environments of each level. 7/10","November 2, 2014","true","2.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The AI is unlike any other game I've played. I love how your enemies can fake you out during battle. It sure keeps you focused, and every fight is a new experience. It's not as if your enemy has a set pattern that you can conquer in a couple tries, no! It's unpredictable and will push you to try different fighting techniques. Timing is key with the fighting system. And don't be fooled into thinking you can just whoop multiple guys at once like you're Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee...no, sometimes you have to RUN to survive.

One of them ends up framing you for murder and in your struggle to gather evidence to clear your name, you discover there is something even more sinister lurking out there. The story evolves slowly and constantly applies a state of terror that had me peeking around each corner to make sure the coast is clear.

Its like the environment uses way higher quality textures than the characters do. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? Or why can't everything just look fine, instead it puts the supposed F.E.A.R. engine to shame by using blurry and low as hell textures on characters. F.E.A.R., for example looked better and it came out like a year earlier than this. Well enough of nitpicking at some of the visuals, cause to be honest most of the game visually looks pretty decent, but now on to other things.\n\nThis game seems to do somethings more or less unique like for example: Ammo is pretty damn limited, and there isn't even such thing as getting ammo or reloading your guns. Instead you pick up guns from wherever, or from enemies you kill and they may or may not have a full clip in it. Also enemies can ACTUALLY RUN OUT OF AMMO! WOW! So if you kill an enemy that has a gun fast enough before he attempts to waste ammo on you, you can benefit from it and have a more full clip of ammo. Its like literally one of the first games I've seen do that for enemies. I wish more games did that. I'm staring at you Half-Life 1 and 2, where the HECU soldiers and Combine soldiers infinitely pull clips of ammo and grenades out their ♥♥♥ without instead eventually running out of ammo and doing some well coded melee fighting with you.\n\nMost of the time you have to rely on melee weapons and its somewhat dodgy mechanic of combat, but for the most part it works. You can die fairly easily, especially from certain weapons so you do not want to take combat lightly and screw around, even on easy mode. So get ready to time your blocks right and avoid damage as much as possible. Some enemies telegraph their attacks obviously, and some others fake you out so hard it makes you want to facepalm. They then get a free shot at you after you've wasted your block, which by the way isn't constant like say Oblivion or Skyrim. Why not make the blocking constant? And reward the player by only stunning the enemy if you block right before their attack strikes you.\n\nAlso every now and then you have to gather evidence by using your fancy FBI tools and camera. I guess thats pretty cool, it does suck though at certain parts where there are enemies, making you vulnerable because to do ANY attack, you have to put your tool away, which takes about a second and a half and then slowly pull your weapon out and then finally be able to attack. Rinse and repeat about 10 times.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints with this game is how ABSURDLY slow your character moves. And "sprinting" is barely faster than how a normal person would run.

The game covers it's bases in the melee department, with each weapon that you are able to pick up or switch with abundance (pipes, boards, fire axes, etc.) coming with its own set of combat statistics. If you are looking for a shooter, though, you might not enjoy the gameplay as each time you pick up a gun, you get the bullets in that specific gun, and are unable to consolidate ammo between guns. This tends to make melee combat your mainstay in C:CO.\n\nBeing vage as to not give anything away, I can say that the story really pulled me in. Not because the main character was well-played or relatable, but because the game's environment--as previously stated--is highly atmospheric. You'll get a lot of jumping-in-your-seat moments as you play through the campaign.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 4/5, losing a half star each for somewhat linear combat at times, as well as the odd inability to pick up multiple clips of amunition for the same weapon. Everything else is pretty stellar.","March 2, 2014","true","1.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Fairly short and very linear (I played start to finish in one long sitting). The ambience is nice, but there are a lot of frustrating aspects. You can only run for about 5 seconds, and even then its very slow. Worse is the fact you can only carry one weapon at a time, and you can't "combine" ammo for the same type of fire arm, so you will have to back track if you want to use those 2 or 3 bullets. Not that you need to use firearms at all, you should really learn to use melee weapons... because at the end it is mandatory (and they take away your taser too, so don't rely on that as a crutch too much). But even if you do forgo guns for melee, you will still have to backtrack a lot because you will need different melee wepons to open different doors. So slow movement + lots of mandatory backtracking. Finally many doors lock behind you for no reason (in game anyway), very often right after you pass first aid kits. So you end up feeling cheated there too.\nThe fighting mechanics are usually ok, but there are issues. Enemies sometimes would shoot me through walls, including once through a ten foot thick concrete subway pillar. On the other hand if an enemy is crouching behind a knee high box, with their whole upper body exposed, my shots would (to their head) would have no effect - you have to wait till they come out of cover to shoot you. Enemy melee attacks for the most part can not be sidestepped; overhead smashes will auto-track you mid-swing. Also very often the range on enemy melee attacks is far greater then it should be. They would appear to miss me by about 5-10 feet, but I would still get hit. You are just expected to parry everything.\nBy the end I felt like I has earned a blackbelt in Condemned-jutsu, the last level really forces you to master it to get by. The final boss fight though ends up being a little anticlimactic, as there are so many health kits around, you can almost ignore his hits and just keep whacking him. This became a problem at one point, because if you don't know what to do, you can whack him for ever and he will not die - you have to get him winded then press 1 (something I had never before had to do to win). If you ignore it and keep attacking, he will try to fight you some more. This almost became an infitnite loop for me.","March 5, 2014","true","8.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(2005), in that it still manages to make you feel highly vulnerable while not stripping you away of all options to defend yourself. firearms feature sparingly, cannot be reloaded and only come equipped with a single magazine when taken from enemies.\nthe melee combat can definitely be described as a visceral experience, with fire axes, sledgehammers, steel pipes and conduits being among the armament you'll come across.\n\nthe investigation segments don't require much input on your end, usually only consisting of taking a couple of photos or collecting a sample of some gross stuff to send off to the SCU's lab team for analysis, but they do serve as a nice breather between the tense action sequences.\n\nbeing a game from 2006, and a port of one of the very first XBOX 360 releases, the graphics are certainly quite dated, with low resolution textures and models, so if you're somebody who requires eyecandy to be able to enjoy a game you should grin and bear it you whiny baby the poor quality may be a downside, but the lighting and general atmosphere of the levels still holds up well.\n\nthe story is your standard thriller fare, you go through the levels collecting evidence and growing ever closer to catching your suspect, but it somewhat jumps the shark during the last 30 minutes or so of the game and suddenly changes the game from being (mostly) grounded in reality to some really strange supernatural ♥♥♥♥ that is kind of a mess and feels like the developers had to think of a conclusion 30 minutes before the release of the game. maybe it's explained in the sequel.\n\nunfortunately, the sequel, Condemned: Bloodshot, hasn't seen a PC release as of writing, so if you're left wanting more after completion, you'll have to get a copy on the 360/PS3. of course, purchasing Criminal Origins shows that there's a demand for it, but you never really know with SEGA.\n\noverall, Condemned is definitely a horror experience that's worth a shot, if only to get away from the masses of shovelware that the horror game genre has pushed out recently, though seeing as it took me only 5 and a half hours to complete the campaign, you may want to wait for a sale.","February 21","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Blah blah enough with my life story.. I hated it on 360. Controls sucked... Graphics sucked at 720 and sub 30fps. It was ♥♥♥♥. However, I do stand firm that when it comes to horror games, sometimes it's best to look to the past. I did get this game for free from Sega via the Make War Not Love prize pack 2, but I will write this as if I paid $14 for it. I will edit it as I play further.\n\nImpressions so far aren't bad at all. A few people have said that there is not native controller support for xbox controllers. If you don't like using KB&M, download xpadder. Given that this is basically held back by being ported from the Xbox 360 in 2006, the graphics can be ugly... that should be a given in the mid 2000s. It does look way better than the 360 version, so if you haven't seen that version... I'm sure you can imagine. This still does come from the time where the skin and hair texures are combined. So, the default KB&M controls aren't overly complicated like in some Sega games which is a good thing even if for some reason you prefer using a controller. I will recommend this game(it is free at the make war not love website at the moment) Some people have said that playing this game for extended periods of time have made them feel sick. I didn't notice that too much but I'll put that out there for anyone considering this game just in case.

All add to an uneasy setting that can heighten senses and create scare moments.\nInvestigating: As an FBI agent you’ll have all types of data collecting tech to take samples and send back to the lab and tech agent Rosa. These moments help progress the story while breaking up the combat gameplay.\nMelee combat: This is enjoyable and satisfying to get involved with. It’s possible to find any weapon lying around from a desk to 2x4 with bolts. Combat will involve an attack or block, by blocking you will open up the opponent for a counter attack. Blocking can take a little getting used to, but is imperative to learn to survive the game. If you beat the enemy AI enough you will open up an option for a finisher. A finisher could be one of four options to snap a neck or slam them into the ground. On top of all that you have a taser gun that you can use to stun someone, take their weapon or a cheap shot.\nGunplay: All round just bad, doesn’t feel right. Necessary in some circumstances, but melee combat trumps it.\nDifficulty: There was only a few times I felt challenged, once you gain the experience with melee combat, the game gets easier.\nLevel design: As a linear game you would expect the level design to hold up to keep it interesting, and it does -- from different locales to tight corridors.\nReplayability: With these type of scare games, the best experience is the first, because playing it over you know what you are facing around the corner and with that lessens the fear. There is the added option of collecting items for achievements. But these achievements are in-game not related to any Steam achievements. I did not notice if they unlocked any new moddable options.","March 12","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game was released back when I was a junior in high school, I remember my girlfriend would watch me play it just because we'd have fun laughing at the jump scares. I used to go out and rent it all the time and eventually I traded in a couple of my games just so I could own a copy. I'm not going to go through the pros and cons specifically I'm just going to say if you like jump scares and a decent story, for 14.95 you really can't go wrong.\n\nAnother point I'd like to add is after the release of condemned 2, sales weren't strong enough to ever come back with a condemned 3. Jace Hall the creator who owns the rights, from the last I heard he wasn't sure where to go with it and he's looking to grant someone the license to continue the series and by the looks of it PC was on the list. All I'm saying is supporting this game and picking up a copy couldn't hurt. It will only help in furthering the future in seeing another condemned project.\n\nSo all of you indie devs, step your game up and grab ahold of condemned and give it the revival it needs. Here's what he stated in his original facebook post in January 2015.\n\n\n\n"Deep thought..and question...\n\nI helped to create a video game console franchise called "Condemned." I currently own the entire franchise.\n\nThere have been 2 game titles released for the franchise, "Condemned: Criminal Origins" and "Condemned: Bloodshot" - they both did well, and I am consistently asked when a third game might be created.\n\nSince I am focused on other things, and will be for quite some time, this franchise is just sitting there.\n\nI am contemplating finding an interested and proven Indie development team AND PROVIDING IT TO THEM, so that they can take over the franchise and move it forward.\n\nAs an indie, it can be very hard to get marketing/media attention for a title that you work on. This franchise is already quite known, has market demand, and is in an innovative genre/category.\n\nShould I explore this idea further? What say you all?"","March 9","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Only 2,50 EUR for this masterpiece! It would be a sin not to pick this one up till the offer lasts.\n\nI did not know Monolith did not become defunct but was acquired by Warner Bros. I thought they'd really stopped developing video games for good. This all happened around the time they came out with Condemned. It was interesting to play this game after FEAR which was action-packed and you needed to quickly react and shoot enemies - at the same time the bullet time concept made it all easier.\n\nSo, when Condemned came out and I saw this game did not really have any weapons in it I took a step back. I mean, melee can certainly be interesting but FPS games were never about close combat but by utilising a certain assortment of ranged weaponry. Yet, Monolith managed to make the game interesting till the very end by incorporating an exciting and mysterious storyline.\n\nYou play an FBI agent who becomes a fugitive after a killer frames him for the murder of a police officer. Thomas, while hiding from the cops, tries to uncover the truth and visit long abandoned (condemned) buildings to find clues as to who this mysterious Serial Killer X might be. Throughout the game you can grab almost any object you come across. Steel pipes, planks, crowbar and even a fire axe is at your disposal to get rid of your enemies. These are not necessarily people you are after, but people who occupy these buildings - petty criminals or junkies just seconds away from a lethal overdose.\n\nOccasionally, the game lets you do some crime scene investigations. This happens when Thomas reaches a new milestone in his investigation: you have a variety of gadgets at your disposal with which you can collect samples and send them to your lab analyst - the only person who trusts you - for further analysis. That is how you can progress and go through warehouses, an old school, a library or the deadly sewers and eventually you'll reach an orchard to finally face the antagonist of the game.\n\nCondemned has an appalling story and makes you stuck in your chair until you complete the story and find out the fate of agent Thomas. It has a creepy atmosphere and it truly is a psychological horror. I do not know exactly how many such games are out there for the PC but this is certainly one of the classics.\n\nOnce you pick this up and complete it you'll find out why I hate the developers for never releasing the sequel on PC.","March 9, 2014","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The only thing I kind of disliked is the lack of ability to jump in the game. It's not a deal breaker, but it definitely limits the freedom of movement as you always have to find a staircase, a ramp or similar to get to slightly higher places.\n\n\n\nWhile the game *is* first person and you *do* get to find weapons to shoot with, I won't go as far and call it a first person shooter because the action is clearly designed around melee combat. You will find projectile weapons like pistols, shotguns etc. throughout the game, but they are rather rare and mostly only contain a few bullets. If the magazine is empty, you can't reload the gun and will have to use it as a melee weapon instead. Most of the time you will be searching the enviroment for other melee weapons like pipes, desk drawers, fire axes, sledge hammers, wood planks and so on. They all have unique stats in terms of damage, speed, range and block, so you might want to try them all out instead of sticking to one type of weapon.\n\n\n\nSince you are a FBI agent, you also get to use a couple tech gadgets to analyze blood stains, finger prints, DNA trails and so on. At various key points in the game, the HUD will tell you to use the gear, so you will have to search a room or an entire area for evidence. It's a neat little addition and adds a welcome change to the otherwise entirely puzzle-free gameplay.\n\n\n\nGraphics-wise, the game doesn't provide you with too many options and, like many console games, suffers from low-resolution textures. The atmospheric lighting manages to cover that up for the most part, but in brighter areas it gets quite obvious. Then again, the game was released in 2005 and considering there are games released in 2010 and earlier that look worse, one can hardly complain here.\n\n\n\nOne of the slightly more outstanding aspects of the game is the enemy AI. You will find the enemies run away from you and hide behind corners when you aim your flashlight at them, they will wait out for the right moment to flank you, eventually will beat up other thugs if they stand between them and you and so on. The AI is not that extremely complex, but then again, a lot of recent cover-based third person shooters don't manage to do that.\n\n\n\nWhile the campaign felt relatively long, it only took me roughly 6 hours to beat. There are no additional game modes or a multiplayer mode, so once you are done with the story, you can either re-play it or simply move on as, apart from finding all collectible items, there's nothing else to do in the game.\n\n\n\nSo, if you liked the original F.E.A.R. and want to play a game with the same unique style, make sure to give Condemned: Criminal Origins a shot as this is the closest to F.E.A.R. you can get.","July 6, 2013","true","5.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I freely admit that I haven't played it thoroughly since I purchased it during the Halloween 2013 sale.\n\nThe actual game is fantastic. The gameplay is fairly unique, the graphics are acceptable for the era it came from, and the story/writing isn't too terribly appalling.\n\nIt is worth mentioning however that the game presents a lot of problems on my modern PC. Randomly dropping to 5fps after certain cutscenes, sudden crashes, things like that.\n\nI also recognize now that the gameplay is, while enjoyable, quite clunky at times. The way the player moves feels a bit off compared to most FPS games, and the weapons ranges don't always seem to match their appearance. Neither do the enemy attacks, for that matter.\n\nAdditionally, the voiceacting and dialog are both terrible, which creates a sort of harmonic resonance that serves to make both even more grating. You know the way that the smell/sight of vomit or rotting eggs has a tendency to make a person want to throw up? Well, imagine if someone ate whole rotten eggs (shells still on) and then threw them up in some kind of frenzy of blood-filled chunks and nasty egg yolks  -- it would be far more off-putting than either individual gross-out.\n\nStill, it's an enjoyable game, and well worth it if you can get it cheap.\n\nRecommended to anyone who likes something different from the usual, with the caveat that the performance might be a bit sketchy, and the polish is far from what we'd expect in a more recent game.","November 30, 2013","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot is a bit generic and forgettable, so don't expect a Spielberg-caliber story. Replayability isn't very good; once you're through, you've pretty much seen it all. For a long time, I found this game in a bargain bin.\n\nI'd imagine you're a little confused. If you look up, it says that I recommend this game.\n\nThose things that I griped about above are all negligible (at least for me). You don't buy this game because it doesn't look like Crysis nor do you buy it because the story will enthrall you like To The Moon. You buy this game because it will scare you.\n\nThe sounds and environments alone were enough to make me contemplate turning the game off in fear before I even saw any sort of threat. Dark, derelict locations such as abandoned shopping malls, run-down subways, and remote farmhouses with an eerie soundtrack (fun fact: the soundtrack sometimes makes use of subtle shepherd's tones) drive the tense feeling of this game. When the atmosphere turns hostile and enemies rear their heads, you'll be seeing a range of things from ugly street thugs to nightmarish abominations.\n\nGreat melee combat with solid controls help you wade through the horror, as firearms are a scarce commodity. You'll play most of the game weilding a pipe, electrical conduit, fire axe, or anything else that you find in the environment around you. Combat is engaging and satisfying; you'll be planning your melee strikes and kicks while blocking your enemy's attacks, sometimes executing a finishing move.\n\nI'm a big fan of this game, and how easily scared I am playing horror games I definitely got a lot more than my money's worth. If you can look past some drawbacks, this game is a great experience at an even greater value for it's price.\n\nIf there were any bejeezus in my body at the beginning of this game, they were all gone by the end.","February 14, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a game for a buck though, it was well worth it, even if it was a bit too short for my likings, only 5 hours. Remember, it was made by some of the same people who made fear and that work shows. The game has a great scary atmosphere that can turn even the smallest thing scary. Yet the game doesn't have an Alma character or jump scares so it doesn't go overboard. The fighting system is unique and I give it credit for that. Instead of reloading, you can only check the ammo in your gun and the game has a great system for melee weapons. The investigative tools are interesting but they just pause the game and aren't overly important in my book. The story is good, nothing special but good. My only complaint about the story is that it has an open ending but the sequel never reached PC. This all would have made this a great game except for one short coming, your character is slow. Your character moves at a very leisurely pace and even the running doesn't make you speed up that much. Going down stairs or even ramps is a huge pain because it takes forever. The point of games like Outlast or Amnesia is that you can run away from danger whereas in this game you can slowly walk away. Yes, it gives the game a steady pace but that pace is Slow.

But the repetitive combat and awful, boring boss encounter in Chapter 8 broke my spirit and left me a shattered man. Unfortunately, the game just didn't age well, but at least it isn't the second one. Some of the characters look so big and round as if they were carved from giant blocks of meat.\n\nAmmo is extremely scarce, which means the combat relies mostly on melee weapons. The melee weapons didn't act differently from each other in interesting ways. At least the taser and kick helped to mixed things up, but couldn't keep combat from feeling like a chore. I grew bored of it and combat takes up a huge portion of the game.At one point, I encountered a section in Chapter 8 where enemies would keep spawning until the last one with the item I needed finally came in the house for me to kill. I had to repeat myself a couple times which caused my eyes to glaze over. I nearly passed on to the spirit realm. Enemies that seemed to hit me from much further than they should did not help the combat situation either. You can't hit me with a short pipe from five feet away.\n\nThe investigation aspect also falls victim to the repetition. It's great the first couple of times, but then it loses its luster and only served to move the story forward instead of being interesting. It's a fairly linear game. I did not have to rely on the light tool to follow a trail of blood. I could just press forward and hit those progression points. They had some great uses of the tools later on in the game to keep the investigating aspect from becoming dull. I just wish they could have kept the quality bar high up the whole time.\n\nThe story seemed interesting and I really liked the concept of Serial Killer X. That's a neat villain to have. I'm not very sure of the supernatural aspects. They could've stayed grounded, but I suppose they needed their explanations for why an FBI agent killed over 150 homeless people, drug addicts, and others with pipes and axes and stuff. Oh well.\n\nI can't recommend this title. It's not 2005/2006 anymore.","March 1","false","5.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

You play a disgraced FBI agent, a man who the story tells us has almost abnormally high muscle and bone density, but who in the game is uncapable of walking over knee high fences or running more than a few seconds without needing half a minute to catch his breath. From this, an entire game is born.\n\nThe game is a horror title, with the gameplay built around exploring abandoned facilities in a city gripped by madness. Deranged citizens constantly attack you as you explore, and very little of the combat is performed with guns. Almost everything is done with melee weapons taken from objects lying around. There is a satisfying clunkiness to the combat, but its simplicity lacks depth, and there's little else meaningful to take its places,\n\nThe melee weapons also take the place that keys and keycards would in other games- a sledgehammer is needed to open some doors, a crowbar others, etc. This becomes contrived when the obstacles to get past are something like a piano blocking a stairway. In this world, no one is capable of climbing or jumping.\n\nIn some of the later levels there are genuine chills to be found, but the gamplay feels rote most of the time. The pace is glacial, and for most of the game you are stuck exploring these places at a slow walking pace. Whenever a story sequence takes places, you are confined to a tiny area, unable to walk ahead. There are quite a number of moments, none of which are interesting, and the wait to continue the level can be agonizing.\n\nThe story is preposterous, almost farcical, with motivations that make zero sense and a clueless protagonist. There's a major disconnnect between the protagonist's motivations and the actions the player takes.  It's hard to care about catching a serial killer who kills other serial killers in a game where the primary mechanics consist of the player killing hundreds homeless people.\n\nI'm surprised the title took less than 6 hours. It felt like so much more. People interested in this game can walk-very slowly- away.","January 9","false","5.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","7","14","3","0"

You move slowly as if wading through mud, can't jump over obstacles or crouch under them, while being pursued by howling madmen? This is that nighmare. I mean, christ almighty it's slow. I'm not one to normally complain about a meandering pace but this is absolutely glacial. It's very atmospheric, but it'd be more atmospheric if I didn't move like a sumo wrestler on a treadmill.\n\nThat said, I can see what the appeal is - or at least, what it was back in the days - in that the game is pretty effective at scaring you and making strung-out drug addicts genuinely menacing. The melee combat is... well, it's a matter of taste. If you really get used to it it's passable and a fair bit more visceral than most games (though not as good as Zeno Clash) but it's a pretty tough learning curve to get used to. The character moves incredibly slowly even in combat.\n\nThat's not the end of the problems. The game talks about achivements and how you unlock them, but doesn't actually have achivements. Good job, Sega! The collectibles are tedious to find thanks to the snail's pace you move at, and they don't actually unlock anything useful (like a speed upgrade). You can't take bullets from weapons to use them in others, even if they're the same gun, so once a gun is spent just throw it away like a cheeseburger wrapper. Your protagonist carries around a literal ton of analytic equipment but can only hold one weapon, because apparently two handguns is just over his capacity.\n\nI can't recommend it, which is frustrating, because it feels like a flawed gem. Sadly, it's more flawed than gem, at least if you're entering this without nostalgia.","February 22","false","8.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

And even with a better PC, I'm experiencing the same EXTREME framerate drops again, even if I'm playing with everything on low.

The gameplay is fun, the atmosphere is creepy, and all in all, this game is excellent. But with a sloppy port like this, I'm not sure if I can fully recommend it.

The code is not good, your character will constantly stumble, objects in melee are closer than they appear. It was produced for Xbox 360 and it shows.

The "spooky" segments sometimes come off as F.E.A.R lite, but the way it does horror and combat shows that you CAN do a game with scary gameplay when the protagonist still has a weapon. The whole "fear of homeless" thing, while dangerously close to classism, still makes for some really effective horror.

Framerate drops the longer you play unless you disable all HID in windows.\n\nStill some sounds just do not load and many other little anoyances along the game.\n\nIt is a great game but this version is broken.\n\nThere is a retail version that I did't have the chance to play but It is supposed to be much better.\n\nSteam get your ♥♥♥♥ together.","January 15","false","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One day he mysteriously stopped his playlist on it and I was curious about the rest of the game. I finally was old enough to buy it and played it for myself.\n\nThat was a big mistake.\n\nI'm the biggest p*ssy you'll probably ever know. I don't know why I willingly bought this game.\n\nGOOD:\n- Decent graphics for it's time.\n- Probably the best combat I have seen in a single game ever.\n- Tazer goes to Super Tazer. Prepare for 1-hit kills with SHOCKZ!\n- Great atmosphere.\n- Bunch of extras stuff. (Concept art, the such. I always liked when games did stuff like that.)\n- Good voice acting. I guess.\n\nMEH:\n- You can beat the game in 6 hours or even less. (I didn't collect the bonus stuff unless it was right in front of me, so that's my time for just going through it.)\n\nBAD:\n- For me: Little to no replayability. Could just be me and horror games, but there's really not much to it besides extras.\n- I had no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea what the story was AT ALL xD (You're insane? Something's... weird? The final boss was--... Unexpected. o.o)\n- The end of the game (Unless due to the previously stated) seems like it was thrown together just to quickly wrap up the game. The area you're in is so unlike any other in the game and I noticed the game started to look cheesier and cheesier. The final boss fight was detailed, but... The end area of the game made no sense. None. Zero. Oh, also prepare for nightmares at the very end.\n\nOverall... Yeah go ahead and get this game IF, and only IF you think you can stand thinking about nothing but it for the next week or so. That's what I kinda did anyway.

I'm surprised it's so highly rated on here. Each level consists of slowly trudging through another very beige, very linear environment. I sware my play time would have been greatly reduced had the developer chosen a walking pace beyond something of a snail, you can't jump either, except when the game tells you (climbing is the same). Combat is reduced to learning your enemies melee animations, blocking, then clubbing them over the head with the dozen or so objects your allowed to use as weapons. There are guns, which thankfully reduce the amount of time your stuck in boring melee combat, but they are few and far between, and rarely have more than a few bullets. Atmosphere, which also seems to be lauded here, is pretty much cribbed from any number of 2nd rate psychological thrillers (Se7en, Session 9, etc).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/recommended/4720/","praisecheadle","c5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/","1138 products in account","This is one of the few "scary games" that actually managed to freak me out in places. Storywise, Condemned is a great serial killer detective mystery, and is very reminiscent of the movie Se7en. The gameplay in condemned is brilliant. You could consider it a first-person shooter, but gunplay is a minor element compared to the melee combat, which this game does better than most. The melee system lets you swing, block, and kick, and is incredibly satisfying. You can use just about anything as a weapon, and are required to use certain weapons for certain environmental taks (sledgehammers to open locks, fire-axes to break down doors), which makes you switch up your strategy. The way gunplay is handled is very interesting and well done as well. Instead of finding a bunch of random ammo just laying around everywhere like in most games (which even games claiming to be realistic tend to do), Condemned limits you to what ammo is in the guns you find, making shots a commodity. Once you run out, you either use your gun as a melee weapon, or toss it and find a different weapon, which is yet another way this game makes you switch up your strategy. This is an older game, so the textures are quite low-res, but the great art direction makes up for this and gives the game some brilliant visuals.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lt_seanwolf/recommended/4720/","lt_seanwolf","SeanWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lt_seanwolf/","418 products in account","When it comes to horror in gaming, I'm gonna be honest: I find horror in gaming to be laughable to the point of not even being scary. Games like Slender, FEAR, FNaF, SCP, all they do is just make me laugh and never scream in horror. Sure, some might make me flinch a bit, but that's it. WIth that said, I had a lot of recommendations for 'Condemned: Criminal Origins' for a while now, with people saying that it's one of the best FPS and scariest games out there. Well, I'd like to know what game they were playing, cause this game is not the game they were talking about. This might be one of the worst games I've played in a long while. The horror elements are laughable to the point where they are BORING. When it comes to the much touted combat, it's lame. All you do is just left click to swing or fire your weapon, right click to block, space to kick and that's it. I dunno, I guess I'm use to more refined FPS combat in games like Zeno Clash and Mirror's Edge, but I expected a bit more when it came to this game with all the praise it got. I mostly stuck with the firearms whenever I found them or tasering the opponent, to which I found the taser can make most fights end in seconds with one well tase and one well hit with your weapon. The one good thing I will say about this game is that, well, the detective gameplay is pretty fun. Granted, it's not as involved as most games with this feature, but, nonetheless, it is fun. Now, I'm not one to harp on graphics (to me, graphics are not a selling point in a game), but WOW! Does this game look ugly! Even if I did get this on Day One, I'd probably think it's ugly! The character models are janky and not pleasing to look at (even the normal characters suffer this fate). The only other good thing I'll say is that the dialouge is well acted and fun to listen to....coming from the normal characters. The psychos dialouge are just cliched bad guys who want to bash your brains in dialogue. Out of all the games I've played, this is, hands down, one of the worst I played in a long while. Sadly, that means I can not recommend this to anyone at all. If you want a game that does first-person combat better, play either Zeno Clash games or Mirror's Edge. If you want a game that does horror good, get either the first or second F.E.A.R or Amnesia. Just avoid this game.","February 22","false","4.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Graphics are okay except for humans but the real problem lies in the story and mechanics. After finishing it, I still don't quite know what all the supernatural elements were about and the motivation of the enemies involved. There are a lot of junkies and random human enemies too but they don't quite have a motivation for attacking you and if they were hypnotized then that's not really explained. Nothing is in fact ever explained and the rules of world is left untouched. In terms of mechanics, the game's inability to allow the player to store a gun and bullets is a major drawback and not a creative way to create tension. It almost seems like the developers didn't know which direction to approach, a survival horror (without weapons) or a crime mystery. And while they probably meant for both, their execution was lacking. The horror was fine somtimes, in fact I had a couple of startles, but the supernatural element falters heavily.","May 26","false","9.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Theres only one killer left on SKX list and its a killer by the name of the torturer. So its a race who can get to The torturer first. This game is quite frankly one of the best horror games i have ever played. In the game you use melee weapons to take your enemys down raging from planks to manequin arms. The game also has weapons but be carefull since theres no ammo, once you run out of ammo you have to find a melee gun quick before the enemys get you. The game has really creepy enviroments that will keep you on the edge of youre seat. The game has some problems. Minor glitches that occur throught the game will some times make you replay the chapter but after some glitches is still a fantastic game so overall skip the lame games like Resident evil 6 and Outlast, and play a game that is frankly of the scariest game ever made i give Condemned Criminal Origins a 9.5/10","November 22, 2013","true","5.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Proceeds to kill both of my partners with my 0 bullet gun. Actually, it seems that many of the homeless drug addicts you kill in this game have the ability to literally sweat bullets and proceed to use them to kill you, since while the shotgun I retrieved from a locked safe only had 3 bullets in it, the hobo around the corner had at least 15 rounds for his shotgun. I guess having strong enemies, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, and dark lit maps counts is all it takes to count as a horror game.\n\nI know I've only played an hour, and maybe it gets decent further on, but I didn't enjoy a single moment of the time I played. For a game that revolves around investigating and fighting, it's got some of the worst mechanics for both.\n\nAll of the enemies I've fought so far have been actual drug addicted homeless guys that really have it out for me for no other reason than they're addicts. The melee combat is terrible. Your attacks are either too slow to attack consecutively or aren't strong enough to stun enemies. There's a 100% damage block you can use, but it's very hard to predict when they'll attack, as their recoil animations and their attack animations are nearly identical.\n\nGunplay is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. You're only ever going to find guns with enough ammo for one, maybe two kills. You're then forced to use the gun as a melee weapon, where's it's good for a hit or three before breaking and doing negligable damage. Why use the gun as a melee weapon? Because this FBI agent apparently decided to burn his weapon holster after his gun was stolen, so you have to choose between carrying a gun and carrying an actual melee weapon.\n\nAs for the investigating, it's so far literally just walking around with a magic tool out until you find a glowy bit, then you take a second tool to scan it or take a picture. There's one part where you follow a trail only visible with your tool, except that it's through a linear area and the story progressed without needing to use the tool. That's it. It's not any kind of puzzle, unless you count having to look at the controls layout every so often, since they didn't bother to give you any of the keybindings in game.\n\nAnother big annoyance is medkit spacing. I'll find three in one area, use one, and decide not to waste the other two, so I progress, take some damage in the next fight, but when I go back for my medkit, the previous door has been mysteriously closed forever. I suspect this has to do with the game's age, and it needing to unload the previous area in order to load the current. It's still really annoying to have to clear a whole nother area before finding another cluster of medkits. You can find some randomly hidden in closets or on desks, but in a game where one enemy can take out nearly your full health bar if you trade blows, I think carrying medkits would have been a better choice.\n\nWhile I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the mechanics, the sprint feature is just terrible. You get a few seconds of hardly noticable speed increase and the bar takes ages to refill, to the point you've already forgotten about sprinting by the time it's refilled.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, I want to talk about how stupid the game's premise is as well. Early game spoilers ahead.\n\nSo, as far as I'd gotten, the main motivation for our hero, Ethan Thomas, is that the serial killer he's hunting stole his gun (again, out of bullets) and used it to kill the cops I worked with. The local police force decides it's much more likely that what actually happened is a seasoned investigator decided to out of the blue kill the officers helping him on his case. At least, that's what the mysterious weirdo who showed up in Ethan's apartment said. I'm convinced this guy was just trying to make me look even more guilty by running from the police, but I don't care to play long enough to find out.\n\nMaybe I would have enjoyed it a decade ago when it released, but compared to other games you could buy today for $15, Condemned: Criminal Origins is a waste of time and money.","May 25","false","1.0"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","0"

I really liked the idea of a psychological l horror game based on the evil that men do, and the detective element sounded cool. Too bad it sucked ♥♥♥.

You can't move during these sequences and they happen often.\n*Not remotely scary\n*Poorly integrated supernatural elements that clash with initial tone\n*Sprinting is only slightly faster than walking\n*Sprint button gets stuck for some reason even when you clearly have stamina left\n*Tedious boss fights\n*You can't take ammo from one gun and transfer it to another of the same kind, so you have to back track to where you left your other gun, and as I said, sprinting doesn't really work\n*Unsatisfying ending\n*Blocking doesn't work\n*Blocking doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work\n*WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOESN'T BLOCKING WORK?!?!\n*Because blocking doesn't work, you just end up mashing to kill enemies, and they come often.\n*Relies on jump scares instead of atmosphere to scare you\n*Environments all look the same\n\nConclusion: The only thing that is "criminal" about this game is charing 14.95 for it. I payed three ♥♥♥♥ing bucks for it and still feel ripped off. I hear the console version is way better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/recommended/4720/","OperationalOperator","Ridah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/","519 products in account","If you can play Condemned 2 Blood Shot instead of this one (was only released on PS3/360) then do so. Condemned 2 has essentially everything 1 does but its a bit better in every way and somewhat less clunky and has more variety. 2 isn't a great game but both of these are diffrent and are not terrible games. Decent games atleast.\n\nThe story is a bit hard to follow in both and dousn't really make alot of sense though it sets up some interesting scenarios for you to playthrough but there is so little variety in gameplay that what your doing in the first fight of the game is the same thing you do in the last essentially with the same weapons too.\n\nElements like how to block or when to arn't telegraphed very well to the player either, you learn that axes suck at block and suck along with sledgehammers for anyhing but objective items and the 2x4 or metal pipe maybe the best weapon in the game aside from the machinegun.\n\nWhat kills the game for me is how you walk so slow. You can sprint a very very short distance but anytime you hit an incline or a decline whether its stairs, a wheelchair ramp, or a small pile of garbage in a hallway you start walking very slowly. I understand why they added this but in no way does it add to the game. Its a reason to not play this game alone. Its not fun to be forced to walk slowly whenever your just looking for the item or objective or at any other time. Enemies can run through these places just fine so good luck trying to get away from an enemy.\n\nThe actual melee combat is alright, nothing new but still better than the Elder Scrolls game. Enemies will reach to getting hit somewhat realistically and will be staggered along with if you block they will also become staggered. The problem is no matter what weapon you use essentially the fighting is the same. Either a weapon is worthless or its one of the few great ones.  You do find some guns scattered around but your to stupid to know how to reload so ammo is bound to each guns magazine.  Some situations and enemies can be neat but for the most part the actual fighting isn't really that great especially when you have to fight an enemy with a gun. For this you really need to just taze them then take the gun. Thank goodness the tazer recovers charge over time.\n\nSince you are a cop you investigate certain crime scenes. These are just fluffer basically as you can't do them wrong. You whip out your light, find the evidence, take a picture, and move on. Really just a gate to break up the gameplay. You cannot mess these up. You are required to do one action at a time with one choice.\n\nGraphically the game is pretty good, not as good as FEAR imo but good enough especially for the time.\n\nStory is weird and confusing. Its very hard to follow and just really a background. Who really cares about it.\n\nHaving played the original years back on PS3 I kept thinking to myself of diffrent areas and scenes that were obviously taken from the first game. I wouldn't say its a 1 to 1 port as they added so much and content was definetly new in 2 but they sure took alot of ideas from 1 to the point that your not missing anything by skipping to 2 unless you care about a story thats not very strong to begin with. Just read the wiki page and you should be setup for 2 if you care. I don't really feel like I gained anything out of playing this one though aside from being frustrated with it.\n\nIts alright and if you havn't played the 2nd and don't have a console it might be worth a playthrough, just don't expect much and you won't be dissappointed.","October 13, 2015","false","6.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4as/recommended/4720/","4as","4as","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4as/","359 products in account","Condemned is a first-person brawler with horror-ish setting and a hint of criminal investigation mechanics. Seeing the positive reviews and the fact it was developed by the same team that created one of my favorite games of all time: FEAR, I decided to give this game a try. Unfortunately Condemned turned out to be a quite disappointing and mostly dull experience.\n\nMost of your time playing C:CO will be spent being engaged in a melee combat, so you would think developers would put extra thought into this part to make sure it is actually fun, yet it is not the case. The combat in Condemned it sluggish and clunky, to a point were it gets boring and annoying pretty fast, luckily it also doesn't require any special thought on normal difficulty. The biggest problem here is how little control you have over your swings and how slow they are - with bigger weapons you might start your attack on a completely open enemy, but then notice he takes a swing at you so much faster, so it would be better to block it - but you can't! Once the attack is in motion you have no choice but to observe it being played out, which is rather unfair considering your enemies are perfectly fine canceling their attacks (faking). Speaking of blocking, at first you might want to try and be clever about how you approach your enemies, by anticipating their attacks and blocking them (or "parrying" actually, since you can't hold the button down, you have to tap it), but you will soon find out it a very unreliable method - press the button too early or too late and your block will whiff; press at the right time, but your enemy has a bigger weapon and you will be damaged anyway. Also, your block becomes even more useless once you start encountering enemies in 2vs1 and 3vs1 situations. Add to that the fact that med-kits are quite common and it will quickly become apparent that the fastest and most reliable method is to just keep swinging till everything dies, while ignoring any damage dealt to you in the mean time. On the plus side, there are some occasional firearms here and there to make things more interesting - saving those 5 bullets (more or less) for head-shots is quite fun.\n\nIf instead of fighting you are more interested in Condemned's horror setting, then you need to know it is almost exclusively based on jump-scares and doesn't really try build any kind of tension. Maybe in one or two instances the developers tried to do something original, but most of the time it comes down to something jumping in your face. It also doesn't help that everything looks so blend, so rather than being scared, you will feel turned off by the low quality of the environments and, especially, the character models. Not to mention, for some reason, few significant cut scenes have their sound effects missing.\n\nFinally, forget about doing any kind of real "investigation" - gathering evidence just comes down to pressing "X" when the game tells you to. Afterward you can't really even go anywhere, as you listen to the analysis results, so in the end the whole thing is nothing more than a nuisance.\n\n\nCondemned: Criminal Origins might have been a decent game when it first came out, but by today's standards it unfortunately looks and feels like a budget game with almost nothing that would make it stand out of the crowd.\n\n5/10","November 16, 2014","false","5.7"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","10","26","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GloriousEnd/recommended/4720/","GloriousEnd","MellowDan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GloriousEnd/","59 products in account","I saw this on a top ten scariest games list so I decided to give it a go.\n\nCondemned: CO does have atmosphere that is immersive and mildly creepy (complemented by a gloomy soundtrack). This is the strongest aspect of the game and it is this, along with the semi-engaging story (with the hope for a satisfying ending or something that could conjure an interesting idea), that compelled to me play through to the end.\n\nAfter it was all over, I was ultimately dissapointed with this as a survival horror title. For one, there were no puzzles (which are a staple of the genre). Instead, you have fetch quests (i.e. find sledgehammer to break lock on door or find valve someplace to turn off steam). The fetch quests are not even difficult because the levels are fairly linear and you are not given the option to interact with many objects outside anything that can be used as a melee weapon.\n\nThe enemies (maybe with the exception of the mannequins in the department store), were not disturbing at all. And this is a major complaint for a survival horror game because it, unfortantely, bogged down the dread/scare factor quite a bit. Most of the time, you'll encounter hobos running at or away from you with x melee weapon. To the game's credit, there are well executed jump-scares at times, but for the most part you see it coming (even when they are hiding behind a wall with one arm clearly hanging out).\n\nCombat system is clunky, as it should be in this type of game, but becomes repetitious after awhile. Thus, it doesn't feel clunky anymore and engagments with enemies felt more like busywork instead of terrifying encounters. The melee weapons do vary in damage and speed but the technique (block, hit, hit, repeat) remained the same. Occasionally you can find a firearm to spice things up a bit but primarily you will be using a melee weapon.\n\nWhen the story wrapped up, I was underwhelmed which was a shame because the set up was decent and had potential. This would've been forgivable if there were in-depth character examinations. Yes, you do learn about the characters but it's nothing extensive that makes you either connect with them or intrigues the mind. Thus, I had no desire to replay the game for the story/characters at all.\n\nIf you're a fan of atmospheric games and on the fence, then I would recommend getting it on discount because, for all its faults, it does have redeeming qualties that made me (somewhat) glad I played it. It's possible that you might find the experience more terrifying than I did because, after all, horror is subjective. However, if you are looking for a game on par with something like Amnesia in terms of horror, then I'd pass this one up.\n\n5.0/10","February 6, 2015","false","10.0"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

Other than that, the graphics didn't seem any better than the 360 version. Keep in mind, this game is VERY old, and what I consider a classic. In its time, the graphics were pretty good, but it certainly has not aged well, so bare this in mind. The story for its time was very interesting and easy to follow with a satisfying ending.\n\nMouse and Keyboard controls are more effective than using a Controller, as FPS games tend to be. You rely more on melee weapons but guns are still useful, just limited in ammunition and you can't reload them, but you can use them as blunt weapons once you've run out of ammo until you find something better.\n\nThe game can be brutal and even on Normal you'll get hit hard at times, so it might be a bit of a challenge. On what is now my 3rd playthrough of this game total (1st two being on the 360), I beat it in 7 hours without going out of my way for the collectibles. It might take you 10 hours on your first playthrough, more if you intend to get as many collectibles as possible.\n\nIt's a satisfying experience and if you're not new to video games and just happened to miss this gem, or you enjoy Horror games and aged graphics don't bother you, I highly recommend this game. If you're new to games, don't really care for story, and/or Graphics mean a lot to you, eh, maybe look elsewhere.","December 29, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a great game, written by Monolith, if you can not tell. This was written along side F.E.A.R. Imagine fear with a melee basd combat system. The backdrops look like F.E.A.R. When you start the second level you would think you were playing Blood 2. Great atmosphere as Russ Abbot would have siad. But "oh Mr Harry" why do you walk so slowly over the rough ground? Tip toe throught tulips....If this carries on in the same Monolith mash up manner..... I can not wait for the crazy mech bit from Shogo Mobile Armoured Division!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/georgeclooneyisbatman/recommended/4720/","georgeclooneyisbatman","Rowsdower","http://steamcommunity.com/id/georgeclooneyisbatman/","137 products in account","Let Monolith take you through a joyride with creepy atmosphere, scary visual effects that keep you on edge, a great story, and satisfying gameplay. Condemned Criminal Origins is a game where you play as FBI Detective Ethan Thomas who is framed by a serial killer for the deaths of his fellow officers. The only thing he can do is prove his innocence by tracking down the killer. But it's not a simple walk in the park, along the way you will fight violent civilians whose number has been growing in the city recently.\n\nThe enemies themselves are so scary because they seem like regular people from far away but every time you get close to take a swing you see their messed up demonic faces. It's really cool. The enemies kind of behave how I imagine crack heads would. They usually have a melee weapon with them but they can, if forced to, grab a weapon from the map. Combat is really satisfying as you can swing, block (which causes a stun if done successfully), and kick. It's kind of like Kirby games because you can get different weapons mid-level that you choose depending on your mood (except for the scary crack heads). There are also guns in the game. Both you and the enemy can use it. The guns are more like a Get out of jail free card because it usually kills an enemy with one shot. There's also a taser but it's similar to the gun because it makes things too easy (except for one situation).\n\nThe investigation scenes are also better than the ones in F.E.A.R. In F.E.A.R you are given more pieces to the puzzle of what is going on by pushing E on a computer and letting your friend talk about what you found. In this game you have to use forensic tools to find the clues rather than hit a simple button. For me it’s more satisfying to use the tools because you actually see the evidence and hear the results of its analysis.\n\nOnly con of the game is that your character walks SO SLOW. His sprint is as fast as a normal walking speed but it only lasts 5 seconds. This is bad for two reasons. One there are collectable birds and metal pieces that you can find in the level. How do you expect me to explore when I am so slow. I go to a place where I think there will be a bird, there isn't, I try to run back to the path but I run out of sprint, I cry from frustration. The second reason why the running speed is bad is because some enemies (only a few each level) have guns. So you have to run towards them and take them out but you can't do that because you are so slow. The only way around it is to use a gun or the taser.\n\nNonetheless this is a great horror game that gets under your skin rather than relies on jump scares. Definitely get it if you like F.E.A.R.\n","November 2, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Especially since these enemies -will- irritate you enough that you'll want to beat them to death with a gas pipe.\n\nThe storyline is quite interesting. It's like a mash-up of Silent Hill, Bioshock, and Outlast. It's got enough depth and quick shot moments that you'll want to pay attention.\n\nMy one complaint? The obvious one: No Condemned 2 for PC.

I guess someone might read it, considering it's up for sale on the Steam store.\n\nAnyway. Decent game, mainly focused on melee. Graphics are very decent for the time, though you do have to jump through some hoops to make the engine actually work and give decent framerates (usually fixable by disabling HID devices in Control Panel -> System). The gameplay itself is pretty good, guns are pretty widely available so I actually used them most of the time. You are for some reason hamstrung with the limitation that you cannot carry more than 1 weapon at a time, even if it's something that you could conceivably stick in your pocket, like the .45 pistol. I guess your taser is already taking up all of your pockets. The walk speed in this game is hideously slow and the sprint meter goes down WAY too quickly, especially when you have to game the system and run back and forth killing dudes and then running back to caches of more guns (after all, our hero can't carry spare shotgun shells in his coat pocket).\n\nSound design is pretty nice, very atmospheric and oppressive. There were a couple places where the music is too loud and jarring. The jump scares were mostly pretty predictable but thankfully there weren't too many of them.\n\nThis game surprised me the most with the length. It feels longer than it really is, but I beat it first time through in 6 hours. For a game without much replay value (it's essentially a corridor with cutscenes), that's not very long. And even then, it probably felt longer because the gameplay was beginning to wear on me.\n\nI'm on the fence with this one. If it had a little more content, I might be more willing to recommend it. As it stands, though... buy it if it's 75% off or something. I would have trouble justifying paying more than 7-8 dollars for it.","June 28, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is thanks in large part to the game's visceral combat system which focuses on melee weapons, as well as an intense atmosphere that will keep you constantly wondering what's just around the corner. This creepy atmopshere is further developed by quality level design and some good use of lighting and sound effects. Enemy AI is mostly intelligent; your psychotic opposition will sneak around quietly, strafe and block effectively, and won't just whale away on you when they see you. However, while the game holds up just fine from a gameplay and mechanics standpoint, there are some muddy textures and awkward character models that are less than appealing when compared to more modern games.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that can provide some solid thrills and an immensely satisfying combat system, Condemned: Criminal Origins is as good as it gets. An underappreciated title that plays just as well today as it did 7-8 years ago.","July 5, 2013","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No One Lives Forever, FEAR and now Condemned: Criminal Origins. All three very different, all three are entertaining. This game changes the pace by making it a thriller where you're running around with melee weapons or a firearm which you can't reload but you can tap R to check how much ammo is left, and you fight your way through psychos who are hellbent on trying to relieve the blood from your body. Good scary moments combined with smart AI to pull it off?

Some parts did remind me of F.E.A.R or gave that similar vibe but saying that I belive it was the same team that made it.\n\nalso the game emphasises melee combat in which I liked alot. being able to use the surrounding objects as weapons: pipes off the wall, crowbars, shovels, paper-cutters, signs etc.\nWhen you had the option to use a gun it had very little ammo (or what was left from the previous user) you'd quickly go back to a blunt weapon.\n\nThere was quiet a few collectables around the levels but didn't really really intrest me to go and get them.\n\nThe game felt like extended movie it was short but sweet, I wanted to know more about protag along with other things I won't explain.\nI liked the game but I doubt i'd be replaying it again anytime soon.

Seven years later this perfectly pulpy first-person brawler looks better than ever as the viewer descends deep into the abstract, hellish heart of human violence. In almost every respect from design to art to coding it is a well realized experience of tension, like Doom in an episode of The X-Files, in which demons called The Hate enter stealthily into a metropolis causing a plague of psychopathic madness as heralded by dead birds. The lines between reality and fantasy are so often blurred the viewer so often cannot tell if they are in the real world, hell, or if they too are touched by insanity. The combat is brutal, pipes or 2X4s torn from the wall batter opponents to mush, and exploration and investigation (though far too linear) break that up to move the narrative along. It's a grim experience to be sure but with an undeniable message: "He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster."","November 16, 2012","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Afterwards, you stop off at your kid's school for a PTA meeting, followed by a brief jaunt out to the countryside to eat some apples at a farm.  All the while, you get to hang out with serial killers, PCP-powered hobos and even a cenobite or two.

You may think that this is an FPS game, but you would be wrong! This game has guns, but they kinda suck. You can only have as much ammo as the gun came with, the only way to get more ammo is to get a different gun. Melee combat is the games focus. Combat is simple, but fun. You can hit, block and use your taser. You also have 4 different execution moves when the enemy is on his knees. The main problem I have with this game is that the movement controls are clunky and slow. You have two speeds, snail and snail that has been pushed by another snail, and your stamina bar runs out VERY quickly. And don't get me started on walking on the stairs... dear god. The game is also very creepy and there are some parts that will give you a mini heart attack. Walking around in the darkness with the only source of light being from your flashlight and hearing guys in the distance yelling at eachother and killing eachother is uncomforatable and unsettling. Then you walk around a corner and some hobo with a shotgun is standing there with you in his sights.\n\nTL;DR : Get this game, its amazing and you wont regret buying it. And I forgot to mention the story, its also pretty interesting and you probably would want to see what happens later. Now I have to go and finish the sequel...","April 14, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though, in the art department, the game suffers many things F.E.A.R. did while also getting off worse in some cases when it involves character and item models. The environments, while bland and just what you'd expect, are well designed and flow well. The sound department on the other hand deserves a medal for their efforts as this game has incredible sound design. From the scuttle of foot steps to the rugged breathing of a drugged up lunatic this game pulled no punches in the grossly enthralling atmosphere created by the sound effects alone. On the gameplay side of things while appearing very similair to F.E.A.R. it is quite different taking a focus on improvised weaponry using things like rebar, pipes. conduits, and 2x4's along with many other handheld weapons to battle it out. The mouse, at least for me, started incredibly sensative and I actually believe it is best played hyper-sensative since it makes the combat feel more "natural" and disorienting as fighting crazy drugged up human-not-monsters probably should. The times you do get a gun it doesn't last long as there is no reload function so you get stuck with the ammo that it had. The other section of gameplay that occurs occasionally throughout is the "one button do-it-all" crime scene investigations. The main character carries around a Batman style toolbelt filled with everything he needs to analyze crimescenes with items that are all context sensitive that can only be brought out when the game wants you too. Every single one is mapped to the same button and there is no thought involved in anaylzing crime scenes although this makes investigations easy it also removes any enjoyment that may be had. Going back to the horror genre discussed at the start the game has no jump scares as one may expect instead going for the previously mentioned atmosphere. It's creepy, unnerving, and it's slightly disturbing. The only real complaints I can have aside from the do-it-all csi button is the fact that there is also a do-it-all action button (jumps, climbs, crouches, crawls, pushes, pulls, grabs, twists, opens, closes etc.) which many games do have it just felt overly-used in this game, and the incredibly slow rate at which the character walks especially while on stairs. It makes moving through environments which you've already cleaned of enemies a chore and long walks with few enemies also a pain. The game is perfect length for what it does clocking in at around 6 hours on a rather relaxed play speed with beating it in 5 easily achievable if you just rush through. Overall it is a good game that is a worthy brother to F.E.A.R. if you don't enjoy stories about ghosts with daddy issues.","June 8, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seven years later this perfectly pulpy first-person brawler looks better than ever as the viewer descends deep into the abstract, hellish heart of human violence. In almost every respect from design to art to coding it is a well realized experience of tension, like Doom in an episode of The X-Files, in which demons called The Hate enter stealthily into a metropolis causing a plague of psychopathic madness as heralded by dead birds. The lines between reality and fantasy are so often blurred the viewer so often cannot tell if they are in the real world, hell, or if they too are touched by insanity. The combat is brutal, pipes or 2X4s torn from the wall batter opponents to mush, and exploration and investigation (though far too linear) break that up to move the narrative along. It's a grim experience to be sure but with an undeniable message: "He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster."","November 16, 2012","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whether that be muffled footsteps upstairs or crushing of rubble and glass behind that corner. Every sound will make you tighten your grip on the 2x4 nail or electric conduit. You can use most of the environment as an weapon. Except Bloodshot really varies what you can use better. The brawling action is addicting except for the momentary block making it difficult if you block at the wrong time. The enemies don't have attack patterns and will deceive you whenever they can. Dodging, attacking twice, hiding behind corners when you aren't looking, whatever they can do to beat you. That makes you hesitate sometimes which I love. Again Bloodshot has more random patterns whether that is a pro or a con. And finally the story is immersive but inconclusive. I like how Rosa isn't reading a book to you. Every clue leads to another piece of the story. Feels like you are doing an actual investigation. This made me spawn a bunch of theories about what happened, where they went, etc. Short summary: Immersive but inconclusive story, addicting brawling combat with varying makeshift weapons, and heart-pounding suspense. 8.7/10","June 12, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics still are decent, even by today's standards (maybe not the people so much), but it's the gameplay and story that keep it fresh.\n\nThe combination of FPS combat and the investigation sections give a nice variety to the gameplay. The idea of "use whatever is around" to defend yourself gives a realistic approach to the combat. There is also a blocking system that works fairly well, which makes the melee combat a little more engaging. The investigations usually just come down to scanning the area for simple clues, but it keeps the story moving along.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics themselves do not sell this game, though. It's the story and atmosphere. While it gets weird towards the end, overall the story is solid. It kept me engaged, and was believeable (in it's own twisted way!). I constantly had the feeling of being "on edge," never quite knowing if I was safe or not. It leaves you not knowing what to trust, be it other people, the situation, or your senses.\n\nIf you want a game with a creepy atmosphere, engaging story, and fun combat, I would recommend this game. While it's not without its flaws (the story does have some pitfalls, combat isn't revolutionary, graphics do show their age), it was still a very worthy play-through.\n\n8/10","July 3, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it's more than that :)\n\nIt's basically a horror game with melee combat, so not exactly your traditional shooter (though guns can be used in the game). It's the creepy, tense kind of horror, and while there are a few jump scares, fear comes from the tense atmosphere.\n\nIt's also worth keeping in mind that this game was released about ten years ago, and it shows, especially when it comes to game design. Condemned adheres to old game design philosophies, such as slow walking speed, backstory told via loading screen and documents (which are locked behind collectables), locking areas behind doors that can be broken only after a certain weapon has been found, etc.\nThese are not negative points; they're just part of the deal - old game, old design. But if you have patience, you'll find a wonderful game, with beautiful level design (albeit linear), wonderful melee combat and a tense horror atmosphere.\n\nThe only negative is that the game doesn't really make any efforts of explaining the story, so you'll have to collect all birds and metals to get some additional documents that explain the story. But it's worth it and I can say I definitely recommend this game. It's an old gem.","February 22","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of those games that tried too hard to shove in all the graphical features in over quality contents. Even Flim Grain was in it, no way to disable that without disabling the whole shader.  Those are some bad times...\n\nOnto the story telling development... The game is rated M for mature. Mainly because of the violent and gore, however... it play out as if it was directed for teenagers.  Kinda missing the whole point where your intented player/crowd target are.\n\nYou start out as an FBI agent character, you're in a building with bunch of drug addicts welding nailed plank and lead pipe trying to kill you. Some how it's ok for this FBI shoot to kill in order to defend yourself.  What did I do?  I shot them in their legs.  ONLY their legs and yet they die on second shot. Because the first shot doesn't even slow them down at all.  This really goes against the principle of working for law enforcement, during an crime investigation. Seriously... what the heck? You just don't get free-passes to killing anyone. Sure, I could kick them down, but that's still missing the point here. Being an FBI isn't an expressway to license-to-kill.\n\nAs for the storyline, it's very poor. Doesn't take account of important details to form its plots.  Like when you get knocked out by power fusebox.  (yeah I know... how? there are no violate materials in it.)  An main character, a serial killer, took your gun and ran.  While we were still in the game building, he pointed gun at me later on when he cought me off guard.  He was able to fire 2 bullets from that gun at someone else who tried to rescue me.  What's the problem?  I already emtpy the whole clip in that gun before he took it from me. There's no way he would've gotten another clip.\n\nAs for the gameplay, It's also poor.  It's trying to be an scare-tactic walking-around-in-the-dark-building, even though it's never really dark enough to get freaked out by minor things like rats runing across the room on cue.  There was too often that these hostile NPCs running across the doorways or other end of a hallway you're in as on cue scare event. Which doesn't really feel right for any of those moments.  Because they just go hiding for a moment and then attack you, even though you could see where they were the whole time? It's awkward. Didn't even need to use my flashlight at all.\n\nThis game is a flop and I'm very much surprised to see that people are still rating this positively good after all these years.  Just what the heck, people?  F.E.A.R. (the game from Sierra) came out in the same year was far better than this game when it come to AI, scare-tactic. and story development.\n\nDidn't take very long to disappoint me.","February 24","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Due to being a avid horror fan it's been on my list for a long awhile now and I want to kick myself for not playing it until now. The combat is the main attraction: it is absolutely fantastic. Aside from some iffy encounters (In one fight it felt like I was playing Morrowind because nobody was hitting anyone) it was pretty satisfying.I like that sometimes enemies accidently hit each other then they start fighting. This game is one of few that I feel makes guns feel as scary and powerful as they are in real life. So unless I have one too, I'm scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ due to their long range and high damage. This is probably the only game where I counted not only my shots as I fired, but the enemies' aswell. I liked the investigation mechanic. Story is interesting and so are the serial killer characters. The MC's voice acting isn't that good, but everyone else I thought was fine. The game has a really great atmosphere which in my opinion is the most important part of a horror game (or horror in general). Though personally I never found the game scary (although I am a tough cookie to break.) Even the infamous mannequin section. I found it very amusing one of the collectables were dead birds.I only had one problem when some boards in the attic were supposed to disappear but they didn't, looked it up and solved the issue by waiting till they disappeared like they were supposed to. And with the final boss I didn't know I had to press 1 as it didn't say so when it gave me the indicator to grab him. Plus the game configure tool only has some weird random resolutions, so I had to edit the settings CFG file to run it at 1080, which it runs just fine at. Also keep in mind this game is pretty short, I beat it in just 6 hours. All in all I loved it though primarily just for the combat.

Condemned is a great game in my opinion, but there are a few nitpicks.\n\nWhat do I find good about the game? Well the atmosphere is great for a survival horror game with dark levels, the feeling of not being safe, and the levels consisting of mostly runned down buildings. Enemy AI is good, although it can be a bit questionable at times, it is for the most part good and they can hold their own in combat and will even react to other enemies hitting them and attack them which I think is nice. Combat is fun, although sometimes it can be a bit weird at times with the blocking, you do have to time it correctly, although sometimes I personally felt that the block sometimes doesn't work or it works when it looks like it shouldn't, but that may just be me. It might also feel a bit repetitive the more you go through given how nothing about it really changes and you'll be using the same strategy over and over and over. Guns on the other hand do add a bit given how there's not many in the game, you can't reload them, you need to manually check to see how much ammo you have left for them, and they are the only weapons in the game that can break. The investigation parts where you take out tools and collect evidence, that's a cool part especially when you have different investigation tools and how sometimes you need to use them to follow trails to find more clues. This is especially when it comes to the 2nd to last level, which I won't spoil.\n\nThe game's story is interesting. I won't go over it too much, but the story of Ethan Thomas and him solving a crime that he is blamed for a murder he didn't commit and must track down the killer and figure out his motive, is definitely interesting and it's even pretty good.\n\nI do have some major complaint with the game and that is that this game is short. I beat this game in about 5-6 hours, some of that time spent in offline mode, so at the time of typing this I can't accurately say how long it took me, only an estimate.\n\nBut overall, I think this game is great. If you don't mind repetitive combat and a short game, and you want a good solid fun survival horror game, I easily recommend this game.","March 28","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact that they reel back and are stunned for a short moment gives you the time to properly plan your next move without allowing you to stunlock them to death.\n\n- Enemy behaviour works quite nicely most of the time, running to hide when they are injured, or you are armed. Blocking semi-consistently and throwing angry yet clearly telegraphed retaliation punches after being hit.\n\n- using "R" to check ammunition in a gun you picked up works very well in this game. Since you don't have a gun often enough to justify a constant ammo indicator and you only ever pick up guns without additional magazines (even though this is weird in the beginning when you bring your own gun) the key still does roughly what you'd expect it to do and the animations for checking you ammo are well done.\n\nBut now to the meat of the review, namely my long, long list of issues with it.\n\nBalance Issues:\n\n- In pretty much all cases taking smaller weapons works out better. they have less damage and reach, but higher swing speed and blocking consistency. Swing speed is immensly valuable, as a successful hit can stun your enemy and break their attack and the lower blocking value actually manifests itself in blocking straight up not working in some instances. So no matter wether you are going offensively or defensively, the only justification for things like slegehammers and fire axes to be in the game is to break down doors or locks, outside of which they just aren't a truly viable option, unless you manage to take out all your enemies in one hit.\n\n- As far as I could see there were three types of enemies: People, skeletons trying to pass for people. And enormous balloons trying to pass for people. The combat works beautifully when you are fighting people, but fighting skeletons or balloons is really easy. Skeletons go down in a single hit from your taser gun (which recharges after a few seconds) so they are about as threatening as old yogurt and balloons tend to not recoil a lot, but still get stunned, meaning that a good way to defeat them is to just take a small pipe and beat them over the head a bunch of times in a row.\n\n- Movement is just TERRIBLE. Your characters default speed is a fairly slow walk and his "sprint" which he can do for about 6~7 seconds before getting exhausted is more of a slow jog. Such a thing as "taking a staircase quickly" is not at all possible. Attempting to sprint down a staircase only serves to bug out the walking animation, which is especially infurating considering that on several occasions you are asked to "track down the suspect" who is fleeing from you, and seems to have grasped the concept of both running for extended periods of time and taking stairs in a hurry. It's not like he could actually escape of course, no matter how long you ♥♥♥♥ around, but it's pretty hard to get exited for a chase, when my character seems to think he's just idly walking down the street.\n\n- Jumping isn't a thing at all, The enviroment is usually designed that it doesn't become an issue anyway, but combined with the terrible stair movement I just wish I could shortcut things by jumping down stairs.\n\nBugs and annoyances\n\n- when looking at flickering lights, there's a chance your entire screen will flicker, making it nearly impossible to see anything at all.\n\n- performing finishing animations on balloons it will assume headheight at normal people level, meaning will execute your finisher at their chest.\n\n- The entire idea of "snap, punch, ect" when looked at in the option menu at first when setting your controls can be a bit confusing, as it's not immideatly apparent that those are finishing moves only and hence can safely be put on the 1-4 keys.\n\n- Most cutscenes are "semi-cutscenes" in which you can move around in a certain area but hit an invisible wall trying to go certain places, the limits seeming fairly abritary and occur during levels, meaning the areas cut off by invisible walls are areas that were accessible seconds earlier.\n\nOverall Issues\n\nSimply put: Condemend fails at horror. It doesn't even seem to attempt horror in most cases.\nSure the enviroment is generally worn down, but horror comes from disempowerment, the feeling of smallness.\nIn order to be afraid I must feel that there is a power aligned against me, that defeating is just out of my grasp, that I am merely attempting to defend myself against something that I don't feel like I have a chance of defeating.\n\nBut all that stands against you is one kind of smart, mostly lucky criminal and a whole bunch of deranged psychos, who anyone with a decent understanding of video games should have no problem grinding into dust. Condemended sufferes from the F.E.A.R. problem of action horror in which a game kind of tries to be scary but utterly fails, because you've spent the largest time in the game murdering people yourself. Does the game really want me to be afraid of the regular enemies, that I often get the chance to perform finishing moves on? You can't be afraid of someone if you are just busy picking out their cause of death. They could have you scared with the skeletons, but really, as mentioned earlier, one shot kills with a gun that recharges don't really make me wet myself. The balloons are somewhat menancing but not strong enough to count as scary.\n\nIt seems to attempt horror in some semi-cutscene moments but it is just outweighted by all the psycho murdering you do yourself.\n\nPlot issues (spoilers ahoy)\n\nTo run down quickly as far as I got: You investigate a serial killer called "the matchmaker" He shoots 2 policemen with your gun and obviously that means that you killed them with your own bloody hands, so you set out to clear your name.\n\n- The FBI IMMIDEATLY and ironcast assumes that you killed those two people, even though you communicate that the suspect has taken your gun and there didn't seem a lot of disbelief over that. Sure it was the people you told it who got killed, but they didn't tell anyone else? You'd assume that they would tell the backup that the suspect is now armed with an agents weapon.\n\n- The madmen are in places that they have absoloutely no business being. I understand the abanodone building but they are pretty much everywhere in the subway. Including the subway station JUST outside the characters apartement. It's not an empty station either, trains still drive trough there. (even though apparently most lines only drive twice a day?)\nSo either they just kind of... let the crazy people have it or...?\n\nI haven't finished the game yet, but I can say from the time played of people who have finished it that this game has more serious, glaring issues than hours of gameplay.\n\n\n","March 18","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For its age and replayability, I recommend picking it up during a sale.\n\nCondemned: Criminal Origins Review\nStory\n\nPlayers take on the role of Ethan Thomas, a talented FBI agent specializing in the investigation of serial crimes.  Thanks to his perceptive instincts, Thomas builds a reputation for hunting down several notorious serial killers.  His latest case involves investigating the serial killer known as the "Matchmaker".  But soon Thomas discovers he has been framed for the murder of two police officers and must use every tool he has to survive the manhunt and bring the Matchmaker case to a close.\n\nGameplay\n\nCondemned's gameplay can be considered survival horror with an emphasis on melee combat.  While guns make an appearance, they are few in variety and ammunition.  Guns cannot be reloaded but they can drop most combatants in one or two shots depending on their lethality.  When you invevitably run out of lead, you'll have to use other means to defend yourself.  Pipes, two-by-fours, paper cutters, even locker doors can picked up from the environment to protect yourself.  Ethan can perform a low kick to create reactionary distance as well but learning when to block an attack and when to strike is important to survival.  Enemies will try to feint you into blocking as well as swing wildly when struck adding depth to combat.  Thomas also has a recharging taser he can use to stun and disarm enemies, but be warned enemies will find another weapon in the environment if you let them. The AI of enemies also allows them to hide and wait until they can jump out and hit you.\n\nAs an investigative agent Thomas is known for his sharp senses.  When prompted through a visual effect, Thomas can use one of several CSI tools to analyze evidence at a crime scene and transmit it to his lab technician, Rosa, for analysis.  There are hidden collectables to find in each level as well as an endgame decision to incentivize replay if you so choose.\n\nDesign\n\nReleased in 2005, Condemned certainly shows its age in terms of textures and animations at times.  Textures can be muddy and some character models appear puffy or move oddly at times.  The game's pedigree comes through in the areas of lighting and sound.  One of the best examples of Condemned's strong points is the level where Thomas finds himself in a long abandoned department store, a level so creepy that few rival it in all the games I've played.  From the enemies you fight in the level to the ambient noises you can hear, every level has its own feel to it and it's own aesthetic.  The finale to the game is quite a spectacle and will definitely test your combat skills.\n\nThe only major technical problem that I encountered while playing occurred during the subway level.  For some reason almost all sound cuts out for me during this level except for a select few noises like gunshots.  This lack of sound only occurred during this one level and while it ruins the immersion in this instance, I chose to overlook it since the rest of the game was flawless technically save for a minor progression bug (solved by reloading my save).  In the event you desire to fix the sound on the subway level, there is a fix you can find in the discussion forums for the game.\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nI consider this game to be some of Monolith Production's best work.  If you have a love for any of those late 90's, early 2000's crime scene investigation shows, or want an atmospheric first person psychological horror game, this is a game for you.  My advice for how to play: at night,  lights out, and headphones on.","March 18","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/4720/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","In Condemned: Criminal Origins, the goal of the game is to move through mostly linear, filthy buildings in an urban environment, occasionally deviating from the obvious path to pick up meaningless collectibles, such as engraved pieces of metal and dead birds. During these treks, the player uses a variety of improvised and non-improvised weaponry to fend off legions of greasy hobos, pale-skinned crack ♥♥♥♥♥s, acrobats who cosplay as Sméagol, and f̶a̶t̶t̶i̶e̶s̶ tumblr users. There are light elements of forensic and puzzle gameplay that keep the story going, a narrative which is surprisingly easy to follow.\n\nThe game is plagued by awkward combat, usually the fault of indiscernible attack reach, as well as a number of weird design choices. Some sort of make sense, in sacrificing logic for the sake of gameplay. I can understand why the player isn't allowed to pick up ammo, as the guns give a huge advantage, but other times it looks the developers got lazy in their planning. Why are there so many invisible walls? Why do defeated enemies take so long to telegraph their helplessness before I get options to perform special finishes? Why is there even a toggle for the flashlight?\n\nActually, I take that back. There is only one reason to ever turn the flashlight off: when a pronounced visual effect comes onto the screen and intensifies the already high contrast. Otherwise, it might as well be kept on for the entire game. Often, it's dark enough to justify using it, it's not on a timer so it can be used whenever, and it doesn't do anything to alert the enemies to my presence. In fact, the enemies might as well not even exist until I pass a certain invisble threshold and they spring into the level with their canned, predictable routines.\n\nThat's my main issue with this game, is how nearly every moment designed to deliver on the suspense is a triggered event which usually fails in this endeavor. Sure, other things, like cleverly-placed objects to trip over and ominously-moving furniture help to build that sense of dread, but when it comes time to actually scare the player, it's frequently something that can be seen a mile ahead of time, such as the truck-sized blobs of meat that think they can hide behind corners without getting stuck on said corners.\n\nYet, as much as I've been ripping it a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this one is alright, at least for one playthrough. It's an odd combination of atmosphere, combat, and puzzles that would seem mediocre on their own, but coagulate here into a unique, if at first glance lackluster, experience.","March 18","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"a" (left movement )key paired with the attack button usualy knocks enemies with the back of your weapon, this is a nice touch to the combat and only enhances with more variety.\n\n-The game starts slow but it gets better and better believe me. same thing goes for the story.\n-level design is great, the locations are nice, and so is the way the levels are set up.\nmedkits and weapons are placed at good spots when you need them.\nits clear the gamedesigners knew what they were doing.\n\n- sound design, the sound in this game is very good, so good, it sends shivers down my spine.\n\n*cons:\n\n-The game starts slow but it gets better, alot better.(could be a con/pro depends on what you think).\nbecause the game starts a little slower , this could potentionaly turn some people off.\n\n-graphics (mosly textures) are not good, remember this game is from a decade ago.\nunless your a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥, you dont need to worry about this much, youl get used to it within 20/30 min.\nmy tip (use a sweetfx, especially because it has better AA and other stuff wich comes very handy)\n\n-the port, o boy o boy o boy, a shame, but oh well.\nluckily you can fix most problems, very easily.\nyou can change fov in the ini files.\nsteam version of the game doesnt have the complete audio(some missing files from metro chapter i think), but you can download it online. and just drag it into you games directory.\ngame loses fps  in time with certain keyboards and mouse (logitech i think)\ni have a sharkoon fireglider mouse and did not have this problem.\nThere is something about the option menu that wants me to throw my ♥♥♥♥ing pc out of the window, awful and not very user-friendly.but it works.\n\n****AAAAAANNNNNNNNDDD NOWW*****\n\nThe worst con of this game........................is ???\n\nThe movement , the mother♥♥♥♥ing movement in this game is soooooooo bad.if you thought fallout 3 and and new vegas had bad movement o boy o boy, this will be a treat for you then my friend, a bad treat.\nevery time you walk on little piles of rubble, your character decides that it wants to take a fu cking shii tt and you will have to DEAL WITH IT. O whats that? you want to look down to your feet while moving, nah you cant have that.\natctivate slowmoooooooaaaaaatttttttiiiiiiioonnnn, UGH and theres nothing to fix this.\nhowever just like the graphics youl get used to it + it introduces a new game machanic  called (avoid the rubble).\n\n\nEven though i absolutaly despise horror games, i really really liked this one. i really recomend this game, very underated\nmy rating: 7.8/10","March 11","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It makes sense.\n\nIrony aside, game is quite aged and some gameplay mechanics are quite poor. Movement is clunky, gun play isn't smooth and forensics, while being a great idea, is only available on certain plot-dependant spots. However game offers really nice atmosphere. It isn't your classical horror, it's more of a thriller, which reminded me a Fincher's "SE7EN". Story is solid and characters are quite interesting,\nIf you like tense atmosphere, heavily story-dependant progress and don't mind somewhat flawed and dated gameplay - Condemned: Criminal Origins is definetely a game worth checking out. With a playtime of just under 10 hours and significant amount of memorable moments you won't get bored with it.","April 7","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's story is well written and very scary when it comes to the horror elements, the game heavily relies on strong atmosphere with great horrific music and sound effects. The game's graphics, although slightly outdated, are very dark and scary which fit perfectly with the game\n\nThe game is sort of a mixed bag, the game mixes combat with forensics and although the combat is pretty bad when there are a heavy amount of enemies and the forensics are okay, the game repeats it over and over and over again. The game just does the same things constantly, fight some bad guys, search the area, fight some more bad guys, search another area and so on, after 4 hours of playing, I got pretty bored\n\nThe game's compatability on PC is not the greatest either, the resolution is fixed to a certain resolution and when I try to change it to another resolution which the game says it supports, it crashes. Also, the game sometimes experiences heavy amounts of frame rate drops and stuttering and also missing sound effects which ruined my experience of playing the game\n\nCondemned: Criminal Origins is a good horror game, but it doesn't stand out as one of the few games that actually make a horror game great\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","March 10","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is great for people who liked a good story with horror and mystery to it.\n\nThe game was ahead of it's time in 2005 for alot of the details added into the game. The GUI's, interface, character movements are just amazing for it.\n\nThe graphics aren't ideal for the year 2016, but it doesn't take away from the gameplay. If you don't mind a game with graphics from older time, this is good for you.\n\nThe story has a good plot. There isn't a repeat of repeat to it and it's different in each area of the game. The story is also well made to keep a player hooked for a good amount of time.\n\nThe level design is kind of the same throughout the game; many doors, needing a sledgehammer or fire-axe to break/open some doors. But each time it is enjoyable because the plot isn't the same repeat.\n\nI suggest the game for anyone looking for a good RPG horror, mystery, detective game.\n\nGraphics - 3/10 (for this day and age)\nGameplay - 8/10\nStory - 8.5/10","March 15","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsb123/recommended/4720/","dsb123","A Red-Letter Day","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsb123/","114 products in account","Curator-esque Review\nCondemned: Criminal Origins is an excellent first person horror game from the creators of F.E.A.R. that features brutal melee combat interspersed with crime scene investigation elements.  For its age and replayability, I recommend picking it up during a sale.\n\nCondemned: Criminal Origins Review\nStory\n\nPlayers take on the role of Ethan Thomas, a talented FBI agent specializing in the investigation of serial crimes.  Thanks to his perceptive instincts, Thomas builds a reputation for hunting down several notorious serial killers.  His latest case involves investigating the serial killer known as the "Matchmaker".  But soon Thomas discovers he has been framed for the murder of two police officers and must use every tool he has to survive the manhunt and bring the Matchmaker case to a close.\n\nGameplay\n\nCondemned's gameplay can be considered survival horror with an emphasis on melee combat.  While guns make an appearance, they are few in variety and ammunition.  Guns cannot be reloaded but they can drop most combatants in one or two shots depending on their lethality.  When you invevitably run out of lead, you'll have to use other means to defend yourself.  Pipes, two-by-fours, paper cutters, even locker doors can picked up from the environment to protect yourself.  Ethan can perform a low kick to create reactionary distance as well but learning when to block an attack and when to strike is important to survival.  Enemies will try to feint you into blocking as well as swing wildly when struck adding depth to combat.  Thomas also has a recharging taser he can use to stun and disarm enemies, but be warned enemies will find another weapon in the environment if you let them. The AI of enemies also allows them to hide and wait until they can jump out and hit you.\n\nAs an investigative agent Thomas is known for his sharp senses.  When prompted through a visual effect, Thomas can use one of several CSI tools to analyze evidence at a crime scene and transmit it to his lab technician, Rosa, for analysis.  There are hidden collectables to find in each level as well as an endgame decision to incentivize replay if you so choose.\n\nDesign\n\nReleased in 2005, Condemned certainly shows its age in terms of textures and animations at times.  Textures can be muddy and some character models appear puffy or move oddly at times.  The game's pedigree comes through in the areas of lighting and sound.  One of the best examples of Condemned's strong points is the level where Thomas finds himself in a long abandoned department store, a level so creepy that few rival it in all the games I've played.  From the enemies you fight in the level to the ambient noises you can hear, every level has its own feel to it and it's own aesthetic.  The finale to the game is quite a spectacle and will definitely test your combat skills.\n\nThe only major technical problem that I encountered while playing occurred during the subway level.  For some reason almost all sound cuts out for me during this level except for a select few noises like gunshots.  This lack of sound only occurred during this one level and while it ruins the immersion in this instance, I chose to overlook it since the rest of the game was flawless technically save for a minor progression bug (solved by reloading my save).  In the event you desire to fix the sound on the subway level, there is a fix you can find in the discussion forums for the game.\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nI consider this game to be some of Monolith Production's best work.  If you have a love for any of those late 90's, early 2000's crime scene investigation shows, or want an atmospheric first person psychological horror game, this is a game for you.  My advice for how to play: at night,  lights out, and headphones on.","March 18","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/4720/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","In Condemned: Criminal Origins, the goal of the game is to move through mostly linear, filthy buildings in an urban environment, occasionally deviating from the obvious path to pick up meaningless collectibles, such as engraved pieces of metal and dead birds. During these treks, the player uses a variety of improvised and non-improvised weaponry to fend off legions of greasy hobos, pale-skinned crack ♥♥♥♥♥s, acrobats who cosplay as Sméagol, and f̶a̶t̶t̶i̶e̶s̶ tumblr users. There are light elements of forensic and puzzle gameplay that keep the story going, a narrative which is surprisingly easy to follow.\n\nThe game is plagued by awkward combat, usually the fault of indiscernible attack reach, as well as a number of weird design choices. Some sort of make sense, in sacrificing logic for the sake of gameplay. I can understand why the player isn't allowed to pick up ammo, as the guns give a huge advantage, but other times it looks the developers got lazy in their planning. Why are there so many invisible walls? Why do defeated enemies take so long to telegraph their helplessness before I get options to perform special finishes? Why is there even a toggle for the flashlight?\n\nActually, I take that back. There is only one reason to ever turn the flashlight off: when a pronounced visual effect comes onto the screen and intensifies the already high contrast. Otherwise, it might as well be kept on for the entire game. Often, it's dark enough to justify using it, it's not on a timer so it can be used whenever, and it doesn't do anything to alert the enemies to my presence. In fact, the enemies might as well not even exist until I pass a certain invisble threshold and they spring into the level with their canned, predictable routines.\n\nThat's my main issue with this game, is how nearly every moment designed to deliver on the suspense is a triggered event which usually fails in this endeavor. Sure, other things, like cleverly-placed objects to trip over and ominously-moving furniture help to build that sense of dread, but when it comes time to actually scare the player, it's frequently something that can be seen a mile ahead of time, such as the truck-sized blobs of meat that think they can hide behind corners without getting stuck on said corners.\n\nYet, as much as I've been ripping it a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this one is alright, at least for one playthrough. It's an odd combination of atmosphere, combat, and puzzles that would seem mediocre on their own, but coagulate here into a unique, if at first glance lackluster, experience.","March 18","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It makes sense.\n\nIrony aside, game is quite aged and some gameplay mechanics are quite poor. Movement is clunky, gun play isn't smooth and forensics, while being a great idea, is only available on certain plot-dependant spots. However game offers really nice atmosphere. It isn't your classical horror, it's more of a thriller, which reminded me a Fincher's "SE7EN". Story is solid and characters are quite interesting,\nIf you like tense atmosphere, heavily story-dependant progress and don't mind somewhat flawed and dated gameplay - Condemned: Criminal Origins is definetely a game worth checking out.

Gritty and atmospheric with the best melee combat I've experienced in any game. It's a suspensful game, not because of jump scares but because of the atmosphere it builds around you. The enemy AI is top notch too.\nExample: Walking through a dirty, dank subway station I turn a corner to catch a glimpse of a drug addict duck behind a stone column. As I enter the room he opens fire; I duck behind the nearest column. Both guns and ammo are scarce in this game, so I knew I could weather the storm. A few shots, pause, he's reloading. He comes out again, one, two, three...four, five, six shots. I bolt out from behind the column and hit him square in the chest with a sledgehammer as he's reloading his pistol.","July 25, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So off you go - avoiding the cops to clear your name, stalking and trailing behind the person who killed the two guys that was there with you.\n\nSo you find out this guy is like a serial serial killer; he kills the serial killers who kills the victims but with a twist - he makes them use their own methods of killing to kill themselves with.... so off you guy, following his trail, but always a couple or so steps behind as they're already dead when you rock up. So eventually your manage to catch up to this guy and beat some sense into him, but not before an old guy comes out and knock yo ♥♥♥ down. You wake up in some farm, get lectured by the person(not the old guy), then the old guy saves your ♥♥♥ but unfortunely took of your finger but at least you're alive. So now you go into the barn and find this mysterious dude who seems to be causing the problems. You beat his ♥♥♥ and his minions and win! Well not really, at the end your character apparently turns into the *mysterious* dude who cause the problem...? idk, it's confusing...I might have to watch for an explanation or go watch #2 to see if it continues the story.....\n\nGameplay: You can beat down or shoot down enemies. There's also a block button so your block your opponent's melee attack and then come back with yours to knock their ♥♥♥ down!  You can also pull out your taser and tase their ♥♥♥! Hahaha. I didn't really like how he passes out after 20 or so meters of running. He must be some fat guy who can barey make 20 meters before losing juice....\n\nBut the thing is he didn't look all that fat to me...so should be able to do a 100 meter sprint no problem, here he passes out after 20!  Also no dual wielding, really? I get that you're probably using the left hand to hold the torch but about the times when you don't have the torch on? There's a couple of weapons which require two hands but you're still able to use the torch??! Must be shoulder torch(or clipped onto something) then or else it's impossible and if it is a shoulder torch, you should be able to dual wield! The only reason this came up because I saw one of the enemies who was dual wielding the pipes thingy and I thought aw why can't I do that too??!\n\nAlso why is there no ability to pick up ammo for a weapon and add it to yours? I'm sure he's smart enough to pick up the last two shells from another shotty to fill up yours which only has 3 to start off with so it makes 5...or a way to pick up both melee and guns and swap between them depending on situations.....\n\nThere are a couple or so jumpscares but they didn't really faze me that much because I was always mad when I keep missing swings or this fat character is too slow to catch to an enmey who's running away...hahahaha\n\nSound: Creepy and eerie atmosphere. The game surpports EAX 2 and 3, my lappt can't emulate EAX so I had to play without it...I could have played this on my tower as it can do EAX(all the way up to and including 5) but couldn't be ♥♥♥ really...hehehe, already had it installed on my lappy and too lazy to move files and install it on my tower...\n\nGraphics: I suppose not too bad looking when maxed out for a several year old game at the time of course. Runs silky smooth at 60 fps with V-sync on on my 980M, but when on HD 4600, plays like crap...hahaha, unless you're used to console fps which is usually 30 fps, then I you should be able to handle 10 fps. Of course this is with the game maxed out, when I first started the game, it giving me decent fps, like 100-ish but obviously wanted eye candy... heh, so turned everything up...\n\nConclusion: Umm....Well, there wasn't any bugs or glitches I experienced, except that area where I got lost and didn't know how to get back out to the train tracks part and somehow got stuck in the barrels....and had to reload a save game to get out as I can't cheat my way out as I don't there exist cheats in this game.... I want to vote neutral but why is there no neutral vote?? Well, I suppose I did enjoy the game a bit so why not recommend it? Oh yeah, steam overlay doesn't seem to be working for me so yeah that's that going. COuld just be me because I was scouring the discussion forum and found some people having similar problems and some don't actually have this problem at all....weird...\n\nI still didn't really get the supernatural stuff though....perhaps my mind isn't meant to be paying games like this...\n\nIf you like jumpscares and scary/horror(with a bit mind bending weirdness) like theme game, this is for you, if not take a pass.\n\n================================\nPlayed on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display; resolution 1920x1080.","May 28","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
