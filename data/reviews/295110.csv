PvP is fun on H1Z1 but I would enjoy a little cooperation :)\n\nIf you're thinking of buying this game or only just bought it, please read this!\n\nI've played this game for a good amount of time now to say that I wouldn't recommend it no longer.\n\nI played this game about 1 month after launch and I have to say, it was the most fun I've had on a game in a long time but after a bit I quit. When I came back to it (about 2 months ago) I saw they added new stuff and I was happy but two major things affected the WHOLE game. Community and Hackers.\n\nI always tried to overcome the Hackers (having my base ♥♥♥♥ed up by them, loosing hours/days of work) but the community is something I can no longer handle after all of my hours spent into this game trying to not get mad at the people on this game.\n\nI wanted to bypass it and thought I'd give it one more go but instead I will literally let people kill me and see what happens (not being defensive) and I can tell you now it makes you realize what game you're playing.\n\nFirst death: Guy hit my twice with bow whilst I was alt-tabbed then said "IF YOU DON'T ♥♥♥♥IN'STOP I'LL KILL YOU!" So I stood still with my hands up (Was a fresh spawn on all of these deaths apart from fourth) and he shot me in the head saying "Get rekt noob lololol"\nSecond death: Guy said something in a different language then started to punch me until I died then called me "♥♥♥♥♥"\nThird death: Geared guys in a car, let me live but then told me to leave then ran me over\nFourth death: Found a hunting rifle, and a pistol and came across a geared guy. I put my hands up (can't do any actions once you put your hands up, meaning no way can I do anything to him) and said "Don't kill me please, I'll drop everything I have" he said "ok" and as I dropped my stuff, he shot me in the chest with his shotgun.\n\nYeah it's a long review and people might not actually read it but I was bored and wanted to help someone out if they were thinking of purchasing this game!\nAt this current state, do not buy it. The community might even become better over time but that's something I wouldn't put money on :/\n\nOverall rating: 3\nGames great, but the community actually downranks the game that much that it's unplayable for me once you've had enough.\n\nBonus story: Spent 2 hours helping this new guy and his brother gear up and learn the game more and when I had good loot and trusted them, they just shot me and tried to play it off as if it wasn't them. (Since they were new, we was still in a party and they didn't know how to leave lmao.)\n\nI still play this game because it's the only game I enjoy playing compared to my others :c Still hate it\n\nEdit: I don't really play H1Z1 no more but I appreciate peoples feedback and didn't expect it to get this many votes :D Also to the people saying I'm an idiot for trusting people, my point was that when I was vunerable, that's what the community was like. It's also like 4 man clans just killing you too with no cooperation. It's even more annoying when the cars or players don't render and they see you which makes them chase you for 20 minutes when you've just been gearing for 2 years :c I know I can deposit my stuff in a base but hey ho you get my point and hackers just ruin it anyway D:","September 2, 2015","false","485.3"," 1,073 of 1,256 people (85%) found this review helpful 163 people found this review funny","85","073","1","163","63"

I grabbed it without hesitation when it first came out and enjoyed it since. However the last news from the developers made me lose all my hope on this game. Though I will still analyse it to clarifty why I do not recommend it. Here we go.\n\nPro's\nAmazing Gunfights, good weapon crafting also the bow feels kinda amazing\nCrafting is variable and fun\nGraphics\nThe game offers hilarious moments with a lively community\nBR\nCon's\nCheaters ( This includes Aimbots, Wallhacking, Teleporting, SpeedHacking and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of etc.)\nSad attemps on cash grabbing by devs.\nAs you can see, game has lots good content in it. I am not a hardcore Survival Genre fan however I managed to play this game above 50 hours. Game is really fun with friends, building bases, finding weapons getting loot is fun and it makes you feel like you are achieving something, progressing in a sense.\nHowever since the launch of the game there are hackers everywhere. People are teleporting through the map and using aimbots to take you and your friends down and your work goes to waste in the end. Though, I understand this is an early access and the devs are interested in the issue so this is not the biggest problem. It just keeps people from playing the normal gamemode.\n\nPeople who were frustrated with the hackers and other ♥♥♥♥ goes to play BR.\n\nBR is amazing, it is an amazing game mode and In my opinion even better than the original Arma 3 one. However, today devs decided on a new pass and made it official that they will use a pass which will cost something like  7$ for month. So If you want to play BR, you have to pay 7$ for a monthly pass.\n\nFirstly, they charged us 19.99 for a game in early access which will be free to play when released.\nThen they charged us for crates which contain ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetics.\nAnd now they are charging us for playing the best gamemode the game has to offer.\n\nEveryone was afraid of this when a Russian Investment Firm purchased SOE and made H1Z1 their game but we sure do not expect that. I could spend hundreds of dollars for cosmetics like I did in DOTA 2 and CS:GO but I will not spend a penny in a game which charged people to play in early access and even creating a subscription for a gamemode in which hackers are all around the map and killing you without you could even spot them.\n\nThis was a mistake made by DGC. And I will keep this post up until they change their policy to something which we can understand and support as their audience. Until then, as someone who played this game for over 90 hours-do not buy this game go spend your money and subscriptions on other games.","March 19, 2015","false","144.3"," 830 of 991 people (84%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","84","830","991","41","27"

I respect that and call that a very fair move.\n\nI personaly got my refund and still wont recommend the game.\nWhy?\n\nI still dont like the idea of paying for loot in survival games , because even if you wont abuse airdrops with big groups , its still like a dropbooster for the server you´re playing on.\n\nand MOST of all - Airdrops ARE a nice game event (see dayz mod ) but they should be rare , rewarding , other than in dayz spawning totally random (so its more exciting if you see one) and should be NORMAL part of the game. By selling them you took away all this points.\n\nSo my Point is , f2p should be only Cosmetic or NOT BE.

A few people were gathering around making friendly small talks and making small sheds. I shot somebody in the butt. They got angry and started chasing me with machetes. crowbars, and axes. They wanted to gut me alive. We ran around the houses, the backyards, the slides. They couldn't catch me because we all ran at the same speed.\nI ran into another crowd, one of them's butt I had shot previously. They recognized me. Luckily for me, the other crowd attacked them on accident, thinking one of them was me. The two crowds started a gang war between each other. I ran into a berry bush and hide, watching the two crowds fighting each other, thinking I may be able to pick some goodies up after they are done with each other. Both sides suffered some casualties before they realized I am the true culprit. They stopped fighting each other and ten people started looking for me, calling my name telling me I won't see another day of daylight.\nThey moved closer to the bush where I was hiding. "GET HIM!" One of them spotted me, started chargigg toward me with an axe. I ran, and luckily found a  truck not far away on the other side of the fence.\nI E into the car, locked the door, checked to see what the car might be missing. A battery, and a spark plug. People were gathering around the car, started punching it. In a hurry I checked my bag, well, what do you know, I do have a battery and a spark plug! I put the battery and spark plug into the slots, and brrrrrrrmmmm the engine started.\nI did a 360 reverse with the car, in the process ran over four people, road rage has never felt this good.

As most other reviews show, the developers mostly focus on the Arena and Crate side of the game - it makes them money.\n\nStill wanna try it? Read the following first.\n\nMy friends and I (a total of about 8 of us) joined a PvP server after getting the basics down in PvE. We found some abandoned chests in the middle of nowhere filled with supplies (when the dev's DO ban players, they apparently destroy the base but leave storage containers?). We set up shop fairly quickly in the woods about a 2-3 minute walk from a housing development. Had all the walls, had some watch towers; I even went so far as to place structures on the second floor to act as a roof, so nobody could snipe in to the base from the mountain behind us.\n\nWe had it good for a week or so. Ran in to a few solo players and groups here and there, but for the most part everyone just fired warning shots. Only one of us ever got killed on a supply run, but we always carried light anyway in case this sort of thing happened. During one such run, a guy out solo starts shooting at 4 of us, so naturally we shoot back and my friend popped him with a hunting rifle. Dude drops, so we go to loot his bag. He starts swearing up and down that we're all going to be sorry, etc etc and called us hackers. We shrug it off and go back to our base. Not 5 minutes later we have around 15 players outside of our base, ghosting through our ♥♥♥♥ing walls and killing all of us. They were also placing IED's ON our base, which to the best of my knowledge cannot be done unless you are in the group of the person who placed the foundation. It took them all of 5 minutes to destroy everything we built.\n\nI reported the players because we did manage to kill 2 of them (some of our group came back while we were under attack) and they miraculously were back at our base after respawning 2 seconds later. I never heard back from the developers\n\nI uninstalled and haven't played it since","December 27, 2015","false","109.2"," 964 of 1,184 people (81%) found this review helpful 206 people found this review funny","81","964","1","206","59"

Your chances of getting a gun from a paid airdrop are almost as slim as your chances are surviving with the loot that actually drops from the crate - I managed to single handedly steal an airdrop from 3 guys because they weren't even watching, but I didn't get a gun anyway, only IEDs, moonshine and some swizzle. Another airdrop I saw only dropped things like a waist pouch and wooden tools.\n\nSo if you do manage to get a SINGLE gun from an airdrop, you will have to be\n1) extremely lucky to actually get an airdrop containing a gun\n2) extremely lucky to actually get the airdrop and survive the zombies and attacking players\n3) extremely lucky to survive more than an hour with the single gun you got from a crate - WHICH IS AN ITEM YOU CAN FIND IN THE WORLD ANYWAY\n\nDOESN'T SOUND TOO PAY TO WIN TO ME, BUT ANYWAY.\n\nOkay, so now you should be fairly convinced that airdrops are not gamebreaking. This game, is fun as hell. I had nobody to buy this game with and have made many friends (and enemies) by just running around and talking to the whacky people found all around the lovely H1Z1 map. Most people will stop for a chat (unless you have a gun and they also have a gun, then they will probably shoot you) and you can always have a good time within a few minutes of spawning on a high population server.\n\nI have no idea where I was going with this review, but this game is fun. Really, really, really, ridiculously fun.\n\nI love shooting people in the head with an arrow. I love getting shot in the head with an arrow. I love blasting nerds away with a shotgun. I love getting blasted away by nerds with a shotgun. I love the zombies. The zombies hate me. I hate the bears. The bears, also, hate me.\n\nWho cares what this game turns into? It's a great way to spend $20 and it's fun NOW. The changes they have been making have only been good, and anyone who thinks this game will turn into a horrible monstrosity of a videogame out of nowhere are probably the same people that think Obama is in the Illuminati and will shoot into space in a super secret alien aircraft if the world goes downhill.\n\nAnyway, buy this game and we can have fun together. I might even shoot you in the face with an arrow.\n","February 3, 2015","true","339.4"," 1,688 of 2,102 people (80%) found this review helpful 718 people found this review funny","80","688","2","718","45"

Everything is about BattleRoyal in this game. H1Z1 != zombie survival game, but H1Z1 = deathmatch. That's what it is with lier developers.\n\nIf you are interested in survival, don't get this game. Survival is really, I mean really boding, basically nothing happends in-game and update-wise either. To build a base, which will be most likely raided in no time by hackers takes days if not more. They don't even consider implementing features they promised long long ago, like barricading yourself in random buildings (which are currently part of the map), but I could mention less complex, more simple but important stuff, no. They'd rather not even touch the main game.\n\nI'd advise you to fallow this only if you are interested and if these lazy, lier, cashgrab devs take the minimal effort to care about most of the community and the Main Survival game, maybe ti will worth it. If they don't, is not worth investing in this game in the future either unless you buy it for the deathmatch which does not worth a single $ to me, is so cheaply made.","November 25, 2015","false","299.9"," 510 of 611 people (83%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","83","510","611","36","24"

Always carry shotgun now, always shoot first.  Only ask backpack-related questions.\n\nDay 35\n\nFertilizer Quest never ends.  Too many bases, too many backpacks.  Such smoking ruin.  Others rebuild, and are destroyed anew, in a vicious cycle of Fertilizer and Backpacks.  The blood of animals and survivors alike flows into a biofuel slurry, stuffed into trunks of cars along with endless piles of shotguns.  What is this place? Who am I? Can I have your backpack?\n\n\nCommentary:\n\nHackers-\n\nYeah there are some problems with hackers on the high pop servers.  Report them enough, they get banned, then some pop back up with each steam sale.  Considering the anti-cheat so far is entirely "manual" ie. requiring human intervention, I think Daybreak is doing ok in that regard.  Wait-and-see is the smart approach, as anyone can see, since they are still iterating on the anti-cheat mechanisms.  Anyone who has played any online game, ever, knows there is a constant arms race between developers and the people reverse-engineering their game to cheat at it.  Don't like it? Don't play online games.  Or, go back to your xbox. You'll also find that hackers don't usually bother with the low-population servers as much or at all.  Which brings me to my next point:\n\nPopulation-\n\nI know people love their WoW servers to be the highest population possible, but all games are different.  Complaining that "there's no loot" or "OMGhackers everywhere!" or "I just get killed at respawn" while continuing to play on a high pop server is like repeatedly smashing your head into a wall. Gameplay varies massively depending on the population and ruleset of a server.  Can't get ahead on a high pop because you can't amass enough to build a proper base before getting raided?  Well, you should probably move to a more secluded location or consider a gameplay option that favours your playstyle.  Large groups may benefit more from the increased activity on hi-pop servers.  If it's just you and your buddy, you are definitely more likely to have a good experience on the lower-population servers.\n\nKoS-\n\nPlayer vs Player server?  Get shot at.\n\nNobody needs a reason to kill you.  Every reason is already present:\n\n-you may have friends flanking\n-you might have a weapon not visible\n-you could be scouting to raid later\n-you are probably interfering with the item spawns\n-you have at least some things that can be used\n\nIf you're lucky, you'll get someone who roleplays while they shoot you in the face.\n\n\nLast, Toxic ♥♥♥♥:\n\nHave nothing good to say? Buhleted.","June 20, 2015","true","312.1"," 726 of 890 people (82%) found this review helpful 1,060 people found this review funny","82","726","890","060","23"

Items are glitchy and bugged, the servers are laggy, and the dev team is...well, they ain't bright.\n\nThe whole thing is basically a cash grab. And that's fine. You know, capitalism and all...but do you really want to give your money to a dev team that doesn't do anything of substance? I wish I hadn't.\n\nPlease don't buy this game. Don't support this developer.\n\n-Update 3/11/2016-\n\nOkay. So. I felt like my original review was a bit sparse. And with Daybreak's most hilariously broken update of the game to date releasing recently, I felt like revisiting it.\n\nDaybreak.\n\nI mean, what can I even say. I've invested nearly 800 hours into this game. I first got it almost a full year ago. One of the first things I noticed was super bugged was a skinned item called the "His Regards" machete, which is just a machete with a cosmetic skin on it.\n\nSomehow, in the process of applying that skin, the machete loses all value as a weapon. It has no range in melee and becomes usable only at point blank range. When you use it in first person the animation bugs and your character grabs the blade and swings the handle. And when you put it on the ground, it looks like a tee shirt.\n\nIt's been like that since I first saw it, about a week after I bought the early access pass.\n\nAnd that right there basically sums up this game's development cycle. Even after months and months of development, all they have is what they started with. They fix almost nothing, and they're constantly putting out new content that:\n\nA. is usually just as broken as the older content (and seemingly just as unlikely to be fixed)\n\nB. usually breaks the rest of the game somehow.\n\nFor example, in this most recent update, they added a new zombie type and did some stuff with base permissions and somehow managed to break item stacking (?) and the game's camera (????). And they'll totally fix those things in 'the near future'.\n\nAnyway, with 800 hours in this game and almost a year of watching this ♥♥♥♥ under my belt, I could go on for pages.\n\nForget this game exists. Check on it in about five years maybe. But in the meantime, run away. Run far away and never look back.","November 5, 2015","false","785.3"," 286 of 344 people (83%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","83","286","344","20","5"

Not for Battle Royale. But it is very hard to survive in this world, where at least 50% (I think more) of players can see you and items trough walls because they have CHEATS. Company won't apply solid anticheat to this game, because they making most of the money on stupid cheaters, who are addicted to this stupid game and buying new accounts after they got baned. Every larger group on the server have at least one cheater in team who is giving an info tho the others, where players are.\nSorry but it's impossible to play like this when u are not cheating. I've played since day one with hundred of players. Most of them moved to other games long time ago. I know this is alpha, but some bugs aren't fixed since begining and on top of that after some updates, new bugs appeared. Most of the weapon spawns are always in the same place so when u respawn, you go straight to that place when you'll find the gun, or another player, waiting with this gun already to kill you. Sorry but I've played Infestation before - and what so ever this game sucks too, there was not fixed weapon spawns and you had to look for the guns in every places. Optimisation sucks. I have GTX 970 and i7 2600K@4.4 GHz but my framerate drops sometimes below 30 in towns... We already know that some of the promises they made at the begining, won't happen. Map supose to be growing - it's not gonna happen. There supose to be weather changes - how the ♥♥♥♥ they want to do that ??? When they were testing rain - framerate was dropping to 15 on some computers...\nThey just keep adding stupid crates, tshirts and more crap to buy for real money that no one needs.\nI think we need to wait another few years for someone to make good zombie survival game.

I enjoy this game and still play alot, but in all seriousness, dont waste your time or money. The only people having fun in this game consistently are hackers. SOE, or daybreak as they are called now do NOT care about hacking. I have submitted over 12 emails of captured hackers and they do nothing. Its not even like its a small amount, its every server, its blantanly obvious and they do nothing. Hacking in this genre is so bad because unlike call of duty or PS2, when you die you lose everything. You spend time building or arming yourself to die to some 14 year old russian with ESP and Aimbot. Dont build a base and store ammo in it because it will get one shotted or no clipped by a hacker. The hackers are getting around HWID bans because the cheat sites are providing spoofs to protect them. Seriously, they have already made money off the people that bought the game and the hackers just get more copies and throw more money at them so why would they want to stop it? Its like the tobacco companies wanting to stop smoking. They dont. They can give a simple ban to someone every now and then and they just buy the game again and hack again. Its a genius money making idea, but its bad for those of us that would like to play the game and enjoy it. This game could of been so fun. Its not bad dying when its a good intense fight. Its so much fun! When a teleporting, wall hacking, no clipper aimbots you....its not fun. The server should pick up on players moving too fast or teleporting but they dont even try to stop it!

F2P P2W (free to play, pay to win) at launch and currently Pay to play, pay more to win in alpha.  As a standard player, having to wait one something I had purchased and then after a few hours finally managing to play, I found that most containers had nothing in them even though there were no players around to have looted them.  Everyone seems to be KOS (Kill on Sight), maybe due to a lack of chat box, and even when I managed to talk to someone he told me he was going to cave my skull in.\n\nAnother thing is how fast hydration and hunger dissappear, my character can drink water like it was nothing, if you threw him into the sea he'd leave nothing but the ocean bed.  While it was kind of exciting it also made me sad that the world was so barren but not in a good way.\n\nI found a car, it didn't work.  Needed to find spark plugs that after playing for three hours had seen head nor tail of.  Also there are no safe zones, no where to hide, but thats kind of a good thing.\n\nLastly was my crate.  2 crates 1 key.  What did I get a camo.  Fair enough but they expect me to pay for 320 station cash for another key to get a camo after already paying for the early access.

I'm going to give my input of the aspects of this game.\n\nCrafting:\nSo the crafting system in this game is pretty solid, you can either choose between servers that give you a total recipe wipe, or some that doesn't. And the crafting is pretty simple, which is a good thing. It gives you a small, 4 box window of items you can place in. Let's say you place a piece of cloth inside a box, it narrows down how many recipes you can learn with the cloth, and it also shows you what you can use in your inventory to use with. This makes the game more playable for newer players who might not know what to mix together.\n\nBase Building:\nSo we all like to group up with friends and build our little base up and defend. Well, in this game that's kind of pointless. There is no bed or sleeping system, meaning there is no location save. If you die, you're randomly placed on the map. Also, while they do give you the option to make your own base, it's easily broken in to. The doors that you can "lock" with a code are easily broken with melee weapons, and even fists if need be. This means that your crates filled with goodies will be taken, very quickly. And to add on to the factor that building a base is.. Pointless, zombies aren't a problem when it comes to being threatened. The most I've seen from a zombie swarm, or attack is 1-3 zombies slowly walking towards you. I don't even think they can break into buildings, windows, doors etc.\n\nHealth/Water/Energy/Stamina System:\nThis is probably my favorite part of the game. They have a 4 part system involving Health, Water, Energy, and Stamina. Like any basic survival game you'll need to eat and drink to survive.  Your health is quite managable, while zombies don't do near enough damage to kill someone in a few hits, that's easily healed with a bandage or two. Players on the other hand will mess you up with a knife or gun, you'll go through heavy damage and then bleeding will kick in and finish you off if you don't bandage soon. As far as Water/Energy goes, they did a good job with this. Your energy levels and thirst levels deplete in a quick manner, making you go into the world and explore to find supplies. But, the down side of this is that blackberries can ruin this for any player. You can simply walk into the woods and amass 100 blackberries in 5-10 minutes. Blackberries replenish about 2-3 energy/thirst, which is a lot when you have 100 blackberries in your inventory.\n\nZombies:\nOkay so with this part of the game, I have A LOT to say, but I'm going to keep it short. H1Z1 is a zombie survival game without the zombies. You will find Zombies out in the open, maybe 1-3 together at a time. But.. There is no challenge when it comes to them, they're very slow, and they die to 2-3 shots to the chest with a bow, and one to the head. The health levels of the zombies would be fine if they were more deadly.. In the game you'll have the choice between choosing a PVE server (No PvP) Or a PvP Server. I don't see a reason at all to play a PvE server because zombies will probably never kill you. What I see that can be done with this is, change PvE servers (or maybe even both servers) to have a HEAVY load of zombies. Maybe change their speed, damage level, and health. It would be really fun to see swarms of zombies in packs of 10-30 at a time. It would add suspense knowing you're surrounded in a building, trying to scavenge for food. It adds that survival feeling. but at the time being, if you want to have fun on the game, just play in a PvP server and fend off the players. Hopefully heavy loads of zombies will be added.\n\nPlayers/Community:\nSo the player base of this game is quite interesting. You will see many players, sometimes in groups, sometimes alone. This can either be a problem, or a good thing for newer players. Let's say I'm brand new to the game of H1Z1 or survival games in general, and I see a player, or maybe two. My first instinct is to maybe raise my hand in friendship, hoping to make a friend to help survive in the world. Well, this probably won't go so well for me, chances are the other player(s) will have a bow and kill me for what I have. This is not saying that every player in the game will KOS you (Kill on Sight) And I'm aware that there is nothing you can do to fix this problem but with being catious in the world, this is only a fair warning to anyone who reads this, Watch your back, everyone is an enemy.\n\nHackers:\nSo a lot of people thumbs down this game because of hackers. I play on DeadWood, a normally High Pop server. I don't have as many hours as some of the hardcore players, but I've only ever come across one hacker. And it wasn't a "Flying Around like an Airplane, raining Arrow Missiles" type of hacker. It was someone with a simple aim lock mechanic that would hit you everytime with a bow (Even around corners). Only once have I seen this. Maybe other players have encountered more hackers, I have not personally. And while hackers ARE a problem, I don't think it's as bad as most people make it seem.\n\nMap System:\nSo you're normally not given a map in these games. In DayZ you could find pieces of maps, but not in H1Z1.  While some people will complain about not being able to find there way around, I personally think it's a good thing. The map is not very large and has maybe.. 3-4 major towns where most of the PvP happens. And to make things better, someone or SOE themselves (Sony Online) Added a map system in the Guides to help you out. All you need to do in game is type /Loc and you're given X, Y, and Z coordinates. All you do is go to the map in the Guides, or even google it, type in your coords and it find you on the map. If you're new to the game and don't know the map very well yet, this is an easy way to find friends and group up. And since the map isn't too big, getting to your friends isn't that much of a challenge.\n\nMy Final Verdict:\nPersonally, I absolutely love this game. For quite some time I've been waiting for a decent survival game and this one nailed it for me. I love logging on with a friend or two and getting into some trouble with other players. The only thing I don't enjoy so far is the lack of zombies, when and if that's fixed, I 100% reccomend at least trying it. If you're a person who doesn't enjoy PvP, and wants to mind your own in the world, then wait a while and see what they do with PvE servers when it comes to Zombies, they really need to add more of a challenge in that ascept.\n\n- Happy Hunting\n","February 6, 2015","true","52.4"," 587 of 769 people (76%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","76","587","769","55","20"

And i will tell you why.\n\nSurvival games. I love survival games. Always have, always will. Its with my love for survival where H1Z1 fails me. Dont get me wrong. I love H1Z1, look at my hours played, ive supported the game since launch. However....for survival, i get more bang for my buck with Ark. At its current state, there is nothing surival about H1Z1, development has primarly been on the battle royale mode, which is a call of duty esqe mode where players fight each other.\n\nThere is no survival here, while possibly the best MMO zombies out there, h1z1's zombies are scarce, and easy to deal with.  Food and water consumption are no big deal with the amount of animals and empty water bottles you can find. Guns and ammo are almost as plentiful as they are in battle royale.\n\nThe building system is bulky and dated, they had a chance to do something special, something diffrent, something that pertained to modern surivial...in tv shows and movies survivors often make abandoned buildings their homes....not so here, the landscape is dotted with ugly bulky makeshift forts. Out of the big 3 (Ark-Rust-H1Z1) H1Z1 falls into last place with its building mechanics. Loot balance is also way out of whack.\n\nDont get me wrong, there are some bright spots, all in all id say the AI is good. Cars are excellent, shooting mechanics feel much more realistic then other survival games, while still feeling "fun" to shoot. Crafting mechanics are also very fun.\n\nPerhaps the thing that has kept me playing for so long is the loot and exploration. Something which is huge to me in a survival game. I want to see what the world was like when it ended. The enviornments of H1Z1 are varied and fun, i love exploring abandoned houses, dams, and churches for loot.\n\nOverall however, from a hardcore survivalist like myself, id say its a no buy. Not yet, not till they bring survival back into it. Thats why people like myself supported the game to begin with.","October 9, 2015","false","418.8"," 280 of 351 people (80%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","80","280","351","19","9"

To prefice, I didn't like DayZ, I hated Rust, so when I heard of this game, I was only pulled into it because all of my friends were tying their weiners together and buying it so I was like eh, ♥♥♥♥ it.\n\nWhat came next was literally nothing that I expected at all. The environment on its own is very well done, especially for early access. The grass looks nice, the trees are more than believable, my sounds your feet make on each terrain is very satisfying because it changes based on what you step on, which if you don't think about it can really pull your immersion, which this game is all about. The wildlife (bears, wolves, deer, ect) are responsive and even though their animations arent extremely spectacular (yet), they still instill the deepest human fear you can imagine into you when you are being chased by them, and you only know because you hear their paws pounding the ground very quickly behind you, slowly gaining speed, while simultaneously growling and presumably making fun of how hard your ♥♥♥ is flapping from sprinting down the road..  Being chased by a bear makes my adrenaline glands do heroine and P90x.\n\nThe items and crafting in the game is surprisingly deep, which I expected it to be the opposite. They use simple items to craft simple things, like a stick and a cloth scrap make a makeshift bow, which makes you go "Oh duh, that makes sense." All of the crafting in the game has the same ideology, using common sense items to make common sense tools, items, weapons, and traps. I'm looking at you, precariously placed Landmine in front of the police station.\nNot only are there decent weapons, you can craft a buttload of other things, including shacks, foundations for really big bases, walls, barricades, and more things which can make for a lot of crazy intuitive base building. It takes a while to build your first shack, but when you do, it's oddly satisfying, given how small it is. But, you can always build a fat ♥♥♥ base somewhere if you have the time and resources to do it, or having friends to help. But beware, people can walk into your base if you don't lock it with a passcode, or if you build it in a place people can jump over your walls, and take your stuff you stash, or break stuff you like. Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nThe server system is pretty neat, you have a bunch of stock servers with set rules like, PVP, PVE, Recipe Wipe, (when you die you lose your recipe list), Headshots Only (I've killed people by shooting their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s so I'm not sure about what that extends to) and First Person Only (which keeps you from going third person to see around a corner with your newly wider camera, you ♥♥♥♥ing cheater.) All of the server rules are fair and I like the way they set them up to be, you can play on just a PVE server so you can learn the game, not having to worry about players ganking you right when you spawn, which rarely happens anyway, or you can get right into the action, and play on a PVP server, never knowing when someone is going to walk around the corner and try to beat you to death with a branch. Yes. A branch. That's a weapon.\n\nThe zombies of course, as of right now, are terrifying in numbers, because some sprint at you out of nowhere and grab you, and some just walk slowly to their demise with a precise headshot from my trusty bow. On their own however, are merely an annoyance as I can just run past them and they just de-agro after a while. Building a base with a zombie horde though is very scary, and happens a lot. Mostly right when you're vunerable texting your mom about your ♥♥♥ rashes. They are planning on doing more with the zombies, and you can find that info on the wiki, but as of now, they aren't anything special, but they also aren't irrelevant. A good balance in a PVP-Zombie Apocalypse game in my opinion.\n\nThere is a very powerful sense of realism in the game, from hunting deer with a bow, using a machete to cut its skin off and getting venison meat, to cooking that meat on a campfire, restoring a deft amount of energy instantly after eating, to also hearing another player walk into the same building you are in, but you are on the second floor, and you can hear their footsteps inside the house but you don't know where they are going next, so you hide in the bathroom, waiting and listening to their every move, bow pulled back, ready to headshot that ♥♥♥♥er as soon as he makes the vital mistake of opening the door, but they never do, and you don't hear anything anymore, and in your head you're screaming "♥♥♥♥ IS HE STILL IN THE HOUSE ♥♥♥♥ ME I'M SO SCARED JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL", and you sit there for about 5 minutes in the same spot, until you brave yourself through the house and outside, where you will sprint away in just one direction for 10 minutes straight.\n\nThe immersion in this game, with friends or by yourself, is intense. I've never screamed louder, had my heart pound harder, or be as in the zone as I have playing this game. There is almost never a dull moment, especially on a PVP server. I spent about 2 hours crouching through a town with my friends to find loot to just hear gun shots in the distance, and we'd all just prone right where we were, just to be quiet and hope they didn't shoot at us, which makes it more intense. You forget you're playing a game, it actually feels like you're in the apocalypse. That you're starving, and you need more ammo for your pistol, and your friends are scared which makes you scared which makes your eyes twitch at the sight of any movement, including frolicing deer in the police station. ♥♥♥♥ you deer, you made me shoot blindly into the darkness because I thought you were satan. Thanks.\n\nSurprisingly, even though people thought the game was going to be pay to win, it actually isnt. You can find guns pretty decently now after the last patch, which makes it more fun in my opinion. I don't mean you find one every time you check a dresser drawer either, you mostly find appropriate loot for your area. I found a hunting rifle in an armoire of this trailer, and all I thought was "Of course these hicks who used to live here would own a ♥♥♥♥ing sniper rifle, PERFECT." The same is for police stations having bigger weapons, grocery stores for having food and tools, and auto shops to having car parts and wrenches. It all makes sense, and it's all fun. The immersion is always constant which I think is incredibly hard to pull off in such a way in today's times.\nIn this way, airdrops with weapons in them don't give you THAT much of an advantage anymore. If you learn where to look for weapons, ammo, and good hiding spots, then all an airdrop does is save time. Also, people can just hear your airdrop and run to it, so you might even lose a contest between 1000000000 people trying to get your airdrop. I'd prefer to just go to some rednecks house and find a shotgun and 50000 shells. Not literally, but I'm sure that much was in there at one point in his life. So for any of you looking to invest in this game, but are deterred from it because P2W was very prevelant at launch, be at ease knowing they made it balanced enough to where it's Play 2 Win but Pay 2 Get Slightly Ahead Kind Of.\n\nThe map is very large as well, full of different environments that you would expect, like plains and heavily wooded areas. Treking to one part of the map, such as Ranchito Taquito, which is a town in the northeast, can take almost what feels like an eternity, because it's so damn large. I read the map currently is 65 KM or rougly 25 miles total in size, and they're only gettin bigger.\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with this game, and I'm still playing it, nowhere near done at all. The devs literally push out a patch once every 2 days or some ♥♥♥♥, and they fix a lot of stuff. It's nice to know they are supporting the game actively and it's not some silly zombie-genre cash grab.","January 28, 2015","true","93.6"," 605 of 796 people (76%) found this review helpful 199 people found this review funny","76","605","796","199","22"

I'm not sure if the new Devs care at this point. Since this game is in early development it seems like this would be the time to figure out a way to solve this problem. Games like these need to have an admin on the sever just looking into all deaths that happen, not just a "report last death" option. This would be a great way to improve gameplay for the future of H1Z1 and over all monitoring of the culture of your users/players. I do love this game and can stick around through the smoothing out process, BUT at this point I almost wish I could have a refund because of the inability to play due to too many hacks in most pvp situations.

It's no fun, seeing them flying by in the air, just to land right next to you only to headshot with aimbot. They also fly into your base, wait for you to come out of your door, then proceed to shoot you while you're unaware of them being there, because they simply shouldn't be able to be there, without blowing gates up.\n\nI can't believe I have spent so much time on this game, only realising now how little the developers care for stopping the hackers. They do this, then they do that, is what they say, but in reality they never really do anything to stop them entirely. The developers ban the hackers, but the hackers just steals new cd-keys, the developers gave us report options, but they don't act upon the reports right away, so all your stuff gets taken.\n\nIf you buy this game, do it because it's on sale.

I puchased early access for about 60% Survial and 40% Battle Royale, I wanted to play both modes.\n\nMy beef with the game is it seems to me the developers do not have their priorities set straight. If you're reading most of these reviews, it's true, the advertised "survival" mode is quite lacking in content. There are ALOT of players cheating, and again, THIS THIS THIS should be PRIOIRTY, NOTHING ELSE. It's been months and months and months and they are STILL lingering around, it gets to the point where you just get used to it, sadly. It's just, never dealt with, there are no great strides to deal with it, they still exist, after 9 months of the game. It's so demoralizing playing the game knowing they're in your game or server.\n\nI won't lie I've had fun playing Battle Royale, and sometimes survival with my friends, alot of fun actually, but I'm slowly seeing myself log out quicker and quicker from boredom seeking a new game to play out of the same problems not being fixed, seeing the same cheats and bugs everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday.\n\nIt's very silly that you pretty much have to set all your settings to off or very low to get decent frames in this game, even if you have a solid rig. I have a 960 GTX video card, 8GB DD3 ram, and a 8 core processor and I still had to change my settings. The game is NOT optimized, and hasn't been for a VERY long time, when it should have been done months ago. Even if you have a great PC, you'll have to to into USER OPTIONS and change everything to lower or you'll be at a disadvantage against other players that will have more frames. It's so disappointing, I really wanted to play the game with medium - high settings without being penalized. I enjoyed the game enough to want to see the elaborate art involved. Sadface.\n\nThere's this 1 second lag whenever you hit the "tab" button to open up your inventory, and it's really really annoying, and do you know there are actually players that will exploit it to desync around so you can't hit them? Sad? That's what I've been thinking months and months and months.\n\nHow LONG does it take to add a clan system to survival, so you can see your friends log in and click a button to invite them to group? Really? Every game has it, how hard is it really, how long does it take?\n\nYou want to use your skins that you get from crates right? Of course, who wouldn't? Well if you have a lot of skins you have to scroll down this super annoying and very sloppy list of skins to find the ones you actually want to use, and then apply each one individually, and you have to do this again every time you die, and you will die ALOT of this game. How hard is it to add a quick "loadout" so you can preset 6 or so groups of skins, push a hotkey, and it skins all your stuff? How hard how long? Apparently very hard and very long.\n\nPriorities, I tell you, I can go on all day.\n\nI don't know man buy the game I guess. But it's really truly not a zomebie survival game. Eventually you'll just get bored seeing the same stuff day in and day out. Bugs/cheaters/lack of content and QUALITY OF LIFE fixes (using skins, clans). You'll slowly get border and border each day until you find something new to play. I've gotten my $20 worth but I was hoping the game would grow more than it is.\n\nAnd remember this, everytime you see someone writing a positive review like this 1. Gathered sticks. 2. Made bow. 3. Bear killed me 4. Respawn. 5. Found gun and another player killed me.\n\nYES, everyone on their first few days experiences this, that doesn't make it a good game to positively review. As you play more you'll begain to see the core problems that's holding the game back. Hear the word from people that have 800+ hours.","November 6, 2015","false","361.9"," 111 of 126 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","111","126","9","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/minneapolis/recommended/295110/","minneapolis","Inferno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/minneapolis/","74 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nH1Z1 is a long incomplete, buggy game with one, simple gamemode that people have fun with. This novel idea is Battle Royale, which is Daybreak finally acknowledging that the only reason most people play any of these open-world survival zombie clones is to just kill each other and trash talk the corpse, like some twisted level of hell only escapable via the sweet taste of death. In Battle Royale, you spawn high in the air, and parachute down to whatever copy-pasted set of buildings you decide on, where you proceed to pick up gear to kill everybody else (AKA: hide until you are forced to fight) and avoid the shrinking circle of toxic gas around the map until you (and possibly your team) are the last one alive.\n\nTotally identical to every other "Day-Z clone", the regular PVE game is really just PVP with zombies (and even bears) to kill during the downtime between grinding ("looting") for weapons and killing other people. There is an interesting base-building aspect, but even that causes nothing but grief when, after spending huge amounts of time to grind for the building materials, somebody simply kills you and burns it to the ground or takes the base for themself. I'll skip all the regular reasons that part of H1Z1 (and every other one of these games) is, in their current states, awful and give you the rundown on Battle Royale, likely the only reason you'd pay money for this game.\n\n\n\n- The game's code is beyond spaghetti, its a Gordian knot covered in molasses and Elmers. Desyncs happen regularly; you will see yourself freefalling for 30 seconds and when you've pierced the earth's crust and continue to freefall through darkness towards Tartarus, you will suddenly respawn on the edge of the atmosphere as the ISS floats by. Landing with parachutes will have you praying to Robin Williams; often you will have what seems like a perfect landing, only to hit a patch of Flubber, bounce over a house, and barrel roll away from anything you could defend yourself with. Want to close the game and immediately launch something else or even simply enjoy the ability to do literally anything? Too bad; upon exiting the game your computer will instead freeze up for a period of time, like a drunk person trying, and eventually (much to your surprise) succeeding in not throwing up all over the shag carpet.\n\n\n- You can and will get sniped by "random" carpet bombs for no reason regardless of any camping tendencies you may or may not have. You will sprint across the entire map non-stop through miles of poison miasma for 20 minutes, bandaged up like a mummy, and die to a carpet bomb when you finally clear it. God help you if you find yourself in a forest or with a mountain between you and the bomber, able to hear it approaching but unable to see it's trajectory before its above you blanketing you with mortars. Since the bomber also happens to move at the speed of light, it will consequently bomb you with such force that you die before you hear or see an explosion, leaving a patch of torn, space-time in your wake while somebody nearby, who was directly in the center of a giant explosion, miraculously survives to dry hump your lootbag and let you know exactly how bad you are. Perhaps worst of all is the trauma inflicted upon your psyche every time you find yourself stopping for a moment to do something, only to have the area ahead that you were just about to walk into get bombed as Con-Air flies past, with Satan giving you a wink and the finger from the cockpit as he turns around to make another pass and maybe drop a googly-eyed Steve Buscemi and greasy, mane-sporting Nicholas Cage down just to trigger the PTSD all of the near misses (and past hits) have given you.\n\n\n- Grenades are barely useable; you will end up using only use molotovs and frags in medium-range fights to kill enemies hiding behind cover. You throw every type of grenade like youre underwater trying to throw a bowling ball onto dry land, against the current. Stun grenades dont work past a pitifully short range. Smoke grenades not only give away your position, but proceed to make the area simply look like Cheech & Chong just rolled through, rather than giving you a tactifully useful cloud of vision-obscuring smoke. To cap it all of, there seems to be a chance that any grenade you throw will be a dud and do nothing except make you feel like you've been cheated (which, if you paid money for this game, you have).\n\n\n- There is NO worthwhile reward for winning non-hardcore Battle Royales. You will win a game, open an "Elite" bag, and get a camo trucker hat or camo flannel shirt to go with your hard-earned, 3-cent Battle Royale shirt. It would be more rewarding if the game just opened a random, extremely low-rated Youporn video, fullscreen, while playing earsplitting SANIC music as a banner reading "THANKS FOR THE EARLY ACCESS $$$ NERDS" scrolled across the center of your screen.\n\n\n- Battle Royale will admittedly, inevitably, be pay to play, at which point future BR players will be paying money for merely a chance to win virtually nothing. If the old prize of a crate + key is brought back, then players will be paying money for a chance to win a chance at getting some new, garish gear that will get you easily spotted and murdered wherever you go, that you can't even sell on the Steam marketplace for something different because Daybreak CEO Simple Jack knows that the best way to increase profits is to upset and further alienate your playerbase.\n\n\n\nI can not, in good conscience and free of the influence of Lucifer himself, recommend this game to any sentient being I did not have a deep, personal loathing for. Having said this... I cant stop trash talking corpses.\n\nKill me.","October 13, 2015","false","146.0"," 202 of 254 people (80%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","80","202","254","65","10"

I'll have to say I don't recommend this game for multiple reasons.\n\n1.) Game breaking glitches / exploits that are still present since it's release a year ago. Examples being invisble wolves killing you, zombies clipping through objects like trees making it really hard to cut them down, wall clips where you can quite literally walk though walls, ect.\n\n2.) No ping restrictions, I can't tell you how many times i've encountered a player from a country like China glitch all across the screen and end up killing me because it's impossible for me to land my shots.\n\n3.) The absolute crazy amount of cheaters. Just recently there was a new hacked client created that's made cheating worse than the average aimbot. Duplication (which I believe might have finally been fixed) and Magic Bullet. Magic Bullet manipulates doors and vehicals in a manner where you can lock onto a player THROUGH MULTIPLE WALLS and damage them with any type of weapon. Meaning I could die in 1 shot from a shotgun from a player shooting a door 300m away.\n\n4.) Daybreaks customer support is almost non existant. Good luck actually getting a human reply from someone that works there.\n\n5.) There hasn't been any real progress to Survival or "H1Z1 : Just Survive" in a VERY long time. They've only polished certain aspects that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. Base building is very dull, the map is getting boring, as stated previously there's alot of bugs yet to be fixed, it really is a mess.\n\nThe sad reality is this game has so much potential, I won't lie and say I don't play the game at all anymore. I've been dealing with everything stated above and it's taking it's toll. I really like this game, but Daybreak seriously needs to kick it in high gear if they want this game to last another year. It's average playercount daily is only around 4,000 players. That's really sad for a big established company such as Daybreak.\n\nIf by some chance an actual H1Z1 developer reads this review, take my criticism seriously and consider what is being said. Not only for me, but on behalf of the hardcore fans / players of H1Z1 Just Survive.","April 16","false","654.1"," 115 of 132 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","115","132","6","0"

That was in Feb 2015.  since then its been basically Daybreak games.\n\nThis first review from people that worked in the company and who clearly have left for the most part - based their reviews on Daybreak as employees..\n\nNow please note, the earliest - and I mean earliest - post from the first posting was from an ex-employee on March 21st, 2015... So basically the following month since the change-over.\n\nhttps://www.glassdoor.com.au/Reviews/Daybreak-Game-Company-Reviews-E973097.htm?&countryRedirect=true\n\nFrom March, right through to last month, all the reviews have been negative recommendations, negative outlooks and a lot of opinions and experiences by these people who worked there.  It seems that Daybreak's take over this year has actually soured very poorly with how things are handled, really no positivity or anything since the SoE change over.\nThis actually fits in really well with my experience as a customer with literally no real satisfaction regarding how we're treated - especially if this is how a lot of their own employees feel.\n\nAnother post that hits the mark with my experience and clearly a lot of players who purchased H1Z1 (as well as Landmark - and trust me that was by the far worst purchase I've ever made - this company's product also) will relate to this post -\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/32u1yy/the_anticonsumer_shenanigans_of_daybreak_games/\n\nAs did a lot of the people who commented at the bottom on the reply.\n\nInterestingly, last month.. apparently there was quite a lay-off of staff because the company was saying that they wanted to become 'profitable'  (anyone relate to how Daybreak thrives on scams like Landmark, having to buy added power sets, storylines and content from games like DC universe and pretty much completely taking focus off H1Z1 regarding the survival element and working nothing really but their money-maker (the Battle Royales) as well as their ploy for finding some cosmetic/crates or buying em with real $$ as well as only able to BUY keys for those crates with your credit card?\n\nI found this post - http://kotaku.com/big-layoffs-at-everquest-studio-today-1685243961\n\nPretty much regarding that.\n\nI personally will not buy another of Daybreak's Games.  The company has bitten me twice and I'm sure DC universe will get wrecked in no time flat.  Already that's turned into another Pay2Win and again that'll become like the other two.\n\nI'm actually keeping a copy of this on my personal computer so I can actually further contact consumer affairs in Australia regarding the Landmark Product as well as the hacking issues and how they're pretty much not being handled in H1z1... this actually is a case of fraud and countries do handle them differently.\n\nHowever, my post here is basically to inform to you what I've discovered about the company since the change-over, my experience of those two products (Landmark and H1Z1 mainly) and for people to not fall into purchasing a product will in actual fact fail as so far this is the outcome apparently with Daybreak products.\n\nEverQuest Next is supposed to be coming out - (not sure if it still is as Daybreak fail dismally on customer relations and satisfaction anyhow) - but personally I'd suggest that being another one to add to your "Not Interested" list on the Steam Store.  I'm sure that'll decompose and turn into a play to win with minimal "free" content like Daybreak is known for in its early stages.\n\nOhh and I would like to leave you with one last link -\n\nhttp://www.bbb.org/sdoc/business-reviews/computers-hardware-software-and-services/daybreak-game-company-llc-in-san-diego-ca-11000350/customer-reviews\n\nGranted there's vew little in the way of reviews on this, but a lot of people hit this company's management and dishonesty right on the mark.  I think other than one (or maybe 2) reviews, the rest have been after the company changeover\n\nMy H1Z1 review -\n\nIn terms of a survival game, I enjoyed this.    However, what's really scored the game to go so thoroughly downhill is basically two things.\n\n1) the hacker/cheater status of the server has made the game virtually unplayable and definitely not enjoyable. Developers have said that they've put in an anti-cheat and so forth, however really its minimally noticable.\nYou create a base and really expect the following from hackers on both the PVE and PvP servers -\n\nESP (allowing them to see all items on a server, player names and where they are on the map and how far away they are)\nSpeed Hack\nAimbot\nNo Clip (allowing them to walk through walls and doors)\nFly hack\nAnti-Cheat\nSpecial Code keeps them from getting detected\nClean screen shot goes to Dev’s that doesn’t show all the ESP\n\nThere's software out there that hacker sites are actually giving away also adding to the gaming grief.  I've lost count with how many times my base has been raided on a PvE server - of all things.   I'd expect that with a PvP server as that's part and parcel, but a PvE is supposed to be for the laid back people who want to experience the survival vs environmental aspect of it.  Not have some a-shole get on and abuse mechanics to make your hours of farming wasted due to a hack, rendering or no-clipping.  This has gotten to the point that even my base door codes have been changed (and I was usually off less than 24 hours each session) to find most of my gear gone and codes had changed where I couldn't access the doors.\nOn top of which, stuff they can't carry, they just dump on the ground and you lose that.  This brings me to the next thing...\n\n2) A lot of the community really blow the "helpfulness" factor out of the water.  You get a few people who are genuinely helpful and nice, 87% of the others get off on trolling, belittling and griefing other players on the forums and I've noticed in game also.  Personally I'd say save your money here and choose another game, preferably one that gives you both the option of playing single player and online multiplayer.\nH1z1 doesn't give you the option of playing single player at all and there's no intention from the devs to make this possible as a single player local hosting server.  If this did go single player mode, I'd be more content to play this where I knew I wouldn't be griefed by players who couldn't f' up my game.  Even PvE is not safe - as stated - because even though players can't kill you (unless driven over with by a car), they will grief you out in other ways and will go out of their way to do so.  There are a fair few games out there with the single player option... I'd prefer those over this any day.\nSince the hacking is clearly not the developers top priority (as their latest test server update is introducing a suit, ATV, a new hospital on the map and whatever else), oddly hacking security upgrades or what-not in that area has not even been mentioned as - going by a lot of the forum posts - hackers have literally taken over the servers.\nGuess you decide, but I'm honestly just stating my opinion and that's really what the reviews are here - the experience of the game at hand of any particular individual who's spent quite a number of hours playing.  Mine's over 200 hours so far..\n\n*update since Jan 2016*\n\nYep, Daybreak you've thoroughly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of EVERYONE - congratulations you money-scamming bunch of pr'cks.  Split the game into two seperate games that require another purchase for the other half.  I'm sure there's something illegal regarding this.  I'm honestly glad to say that I've been right about Daybreak all along with both my review and about my perspective of the company.\nI really hope this turns into a court case and you guys get slammed HARD!","October 8, 2015","false","205.1"," 171 of 211 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","171","211","10","3"

It's a great game and the development has been moving along albeit slowly. In my opinion, this is the best "zombie survival" game out... but one of the biggest GAME BREAKING issues is HACKING....\n\nWhat's the point of an amazing game if it's so easily corrupted by a handful of hackers?  It's like biting into a delicious burger, only to find a wadded up ball of pubic hair in the middle.  Sure, the bacon was crisp, the bun was toasted, and the meat was delicious; but pulling that long curly hair out of your teeth is going to ruin the experience.  And in H1Z1's case, those pubic hairs are hackers.  In a game like this where survival is paramount, one hacker can ruin hours if not weeks worth of work.\n\nThe developers claim to be going after hackers, but they went back on their word to aggressively go after them.  Rather, they give hackers multiple chances to ruin other's games, and in most cases, simply get a slap on the wrist. They haven't taken a stance against hackers because they continue to pump money into the game, all at the expense of legit players supporting this emerging game.  It's truly a shame because this game is fun, and has serious potential to grow into something amazing... But when at least 25% of the time you're going to be killed by someone hacking, using ESP, or something else; what's the point?\n\nSo for now, I have to give it a thumbs down.  Maybe when they solve the hacking issue, or start going with hardware bans, then I'll recommend it.","October 18, 2015","false","415.3"," 199 of 252 people (79%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","79","199","252","51","4"

If you are looking for an action packed game mode called 'Battle Royal'. It is a game mode similar to the hunger games, players will drop down in the map and try to find weapons and get pushed together from toxic gas, as you fight to the death this is the game for you!! Since my time playing h1z1, I find that the devs of the game put out more skins and crates then fixing there bugs and glitches. There are easy glitches and bugs to fix, yet they ignore them and add more skins to try to make more money. I have barley seen any more features added into the survival aspect of the game. This is a survival game yet the DEVs are milking the BR money cow, now only giving you crates when you are in BR and not giving you crates in survival. I'v notice almost every BR server is on high pop, yet there are only 3-4 high pop servers in survival. The devs need to focus more on the survial aspect and not the BR. This game has so much potiental, but devs only care about getting money into their own pockets and not putting into the game. I know this game is still in early access but this game has raised so much money that it should be out of alpha by now.

I have found berries and woodsticks in the forests. No food, weapon, any other items to be found. Played on both PVE and PVP server. Found a group of people that were calling in airdrops and they said that is where they got all of their items as they were unable to find them anywhere else.\n\nIn the game's current condition, I would say it is worse than DayZ Standalone at the moment. But this is just early access and only been out for a couple of days now. There has been numerous patches to fix various issues, so there is still hope and devs are definitely listening to the players(unlike DayZ?). I think this game still has the chance to be way better than DayZ Standalone as it still looks promising with the new features they plan on introducing and the fact it has only been out less than a week(whereas DayZ has been out for a year I believe?). But in the condition now, I would say DayZ is the better game.\n\nEdit: Played a bit more. Found I was unable to craft buildings as your backpack size is not big enough to hold all of the items. Created a 1200 slot backpack and it was still not enough. Only way so far it seems is to create a storage to place your items inside(which is accessible by other player) and craft it that way.\n\nEdit2: Still not recommended. They should really remove houses/bases as a lot of servers are just occupied with people/teams with tons of gear. Really hard for someone new to jump straight into the game and get anywhere as you will just be killed on sight everytime. DayZ is still the way to go.","January 16, 2015","false","20.1"," 1,520 of 2,130 people (71%) found this review helpful 314 people found this review funny","71","520","2","314","0"

It is not a zombie survival game.  The developers of this game have focused entirely on their battle royale mode, which is just a wannabe Call of Duty game with zombies.  Unfortunately it is far more clunky and isn't nearly as good as any pure FPS game.  I'm greatly regretting my decision to jump into the Early Access for this game.  I purchased it many months ago and in that time have seen no improvement to the core survival game whatsoever.  That doesn't bode well for the future.  They've repeatedly reneged on promises and I wouldn't be surprised to see this game end up in the dumpster in 6 months.\n\nStay away from this game unless for some reason you want a more clunky shooter that happens to have zombies in it.  Save yourself the money.\n\nI should add, the video shown for this game is blatant false advertising.  It plays nothing like this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KaneTheStranger/recommended/295110/","KaneTheStranger","KaneTheStranger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KaneTheStranger/","55 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nH1z1 is a good game that has potiential to become something great.\n\nMy journey started off as I logged into a pvp server after playing around in pve for a few hours. I immediatly ran into a guy with a gun pointed at me. At the time my mic was not plugged in so I had to nod my head (yes and no) to answer if I was friendly or not. It was pretty obvious to him that I was new to the game.\n\nAnyways after about 45 minutes of me following him to his base he helped teach me how to craft, one of the highpoints of the game. I love the fact that you don't need to run into houses or the city to be able to defend yourself. Being able to make a bow from basic matierials and survive off black berries is great. The fact that you can build a base out while at them moment it is very buggy and only has a few uses I can see it being much improved in the future.\n\nAfter a few days we decided to move to the city because we were so far away from civilization it took a lot of effort just to get random supplies. The map size is perfect. Never was I annoyed with how far of a sprint the nearby town was. Everything looks and feels natural. Guns are not easy to find and ammo is scarce as it should be. Water can be purified and food can be found from the wildlife (which also interacts with the zombies something I found to be quite useful) Deer/wolves/bears.\n\nSpeaking of zombies they can be pushovers most of the time. Sometimes you can get caught and mobs and have to dash to the nearest car hop up and rain down arrows upon them. The zombies can also drop great loot. Something many other games lack. I actually have a reason to walk around killing them. Or Y'know run them over with a cop car or a jeep.\n\nCars are great to have. Besides the obvious bugs and the invisable bumps that may send you rolling upside down to a firery death they are a great addition. One issue (mainly in Battle royale which I'll get to later) is that running over other players does hardly anything to the car. It should cause a decent amount of damage to it so players don't just run down everything and everyone they see.\n\nOkay. So. Battle Royale!\n\nBattle Royale is an unexpected Gem in H1Z1. I have had so much fun with this. Being dropped down from the sky with up to 200 players in a Hunger games scenario where Toxic gas is deployed, air strikes from above and weapons literally everywhere is a hell of a time. I cannot tell you just how much fun I've had playing Battle Royale, I highly recommed this even if you arn't that big of a survival fan it is worth the 20$ alone for this feature.\n\nWell here is the part where I talk about the negatives. This game is in early access so bugs/glitches complaints about not having enough guns/clothes etc really are not needed. My biggest issue with the game are Hackers. Me and my friend who I met earlier and now are group of 7 people ran into hackers. We have a base set up far away. We had all our food stored up lots of ammo, a few cars and a greatly defended base. Then 2 guys flying above us immediatly killing us and then not even allowing us to get near our base without and instant death has really hurt the game for me. Yes (we have reported them/even got video of it sent in) I understand it's a tough issue for the devs and I don't blame them just the guys who like to ruin the fun for everyone else. But I really hope this is delt with in the future.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nH1z1 is a fun game with tons to do even in early access. If you are a fan of survival games this is a must have. Base building, Zombies all that good stuff. Battle Royale is by far the best part, I would buy this for that alone. Devs have been very vocal with the community and patches are done multiple times during the week. Hackers are my biggest negative and I hope they are delt with more in the future. I really look forward to seeing what this becomes in the future. H1Z1 is a great time and worth the 20$ early access fee. (Note: This game IS NOT P2W despite what you may have heard)\n\n-Kane","February 8, 2015","true","57.3"," 326 of 438 people (74%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","74","326","438","27","7"

ESP, noclip, aimbot, teleport, god mode, you name it, its in there, and its rife. the only methods employed by Daybreak are to email them player name (if you see it) or a 'Report last death' button, so they can review the death at some point. Not sure how quick they are on following it up as there are well known cheaters on some servers who seem to still be active for some days or weeks.\n\nBase building in PVP, and in some respects, PVE, is a wasted effort. All structures can be glitched into, and robbed dry, or abused by the map griefers who will just block you doors with other structures out of spite, preventing access.\nIt is possible to create a hole/ground stash, but those with ESP etc can see these clear as day (plenty of videos on you tube showing it)\n\nVehicles are limited to 3 at present, all require parts and fuel to run, are easily destroyed, very easily, and are bugged a bit\n\nThere are 4 guns in game, pistol, shotgun, AR and hunting rifle, and all are not balanced correctly. for example, it can take 3 headshots to kill someone with a .45 pistol, yet 1 shot with an arrow from a makeshift bow? go figure.\nAmmo can be found but dont expect large quantities, an ammo box normally contains 1-3 bullets in.\n\nCrafting isnt too bad. a few weapons can be made, knife, 2 bows, axe, spear. some tools can be made, structures and traps and couple food items. BUT, a lot of these items require raw materials first such as scrap metal. this can be found either in vehicles or from hitting vehicles with a crowbar. however, sometimes the vehicles 'container' ceases to spawn anything, and finding crowbars can be difficult sometimes.\n\nThe environment is a little lacking and deters from the game significantly. Draw distance and rendering is poor, and due to a lack of adjustments available client side, you have to live with it. minor adjustments can be made but i see no difference.\nThe game doesnt render the environment structures beyond a couple hundered meters, meaning that you believe your hidden in a bush out of sight, but actually to another player, your clear as day because the bush doesnt render, and your black sillouette sticks out like a sore thumb.\nQuality settings are high medium or low, no fine adjustment. medium and low make the game look pixelated, like playing minecraft from a distance.\n\nThe map is quite empty by comparison to DayZ, yes, DayZ map is vast by comparison so more in it, but even scaling DayZ down, theres more towns/buildings etc. There is a plan to increase map size, but with vast open empty spaces between the few towns its quite boring, becomes a walking simulator\n\nFor a zombie apocolypse, there arent many zombies, and the few you do find pose no threat. This means PVE servers are a waste of time, and are only good for trying out the few crafting abilities and building a base (but bases have the issues mentioned earlier with griefers/cheaters)\nThere seems to be a problem with zombie spawns, when they implement a patch, the server resets and everything seems good for a few hours, as zombies are killed they dont seem to respawn. Hordes are supposed to be coming soon, see how that pans out.\n\nThere are paid air drops in the game, which, sadly are a waste of time and money, the drop contents are random and have the risk of being complete sh.ite. The drop can be seen and heard by pretty much everyone, so if you think your going to recieve your drop, think again. all the honest players will try and ambush it, and all the cheaters will just teleport to it so they can kill everyone there. And dont think you can use it on a quiet server, oh no, the server must have a minimum number of players on before you can call it in, which i think is wrong. they obviously want a big fight to happen during airdrops, if so, these should be free, random and part of the game, not people paying for the pleasure of their own death, as such i dont see anyone paying for these in future, in fact i have never seen or heard an air drop in ages\n\nSadly, the game mentality is the worse aspect, even more so than the hacking. this isnt a game for lone wolves, you need to be in a wolf pack. It is a total KoS fest, probably down to the fact the environment being no threat and issues in the past with loot (which still isnt correct). It makes grouping with strangers hard as no one trusts anyone. I bumped into 1 person as a fresh spawn, had nothing, said hello, got an arrow to the face. rinse and repeat KoS\n\nI enjoyed this game for the first week, then the KoS and hacking started which has ruined it for me.\nIve given DayZ another go after a break for many months and many updates later, and its far superior.\nRegardless of how long DayZ has been out compared to H1Z1, if your stuck between which one, for £20, right now, id recommend DayZ. Its a game you play for a few hours at a time, whereas H1Z1 is 30 mins here and there.\n\n\n","March 2, 2015","false","133.2"," 154 of 195 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","154","195","8","3"

I'm assuming he's Taiwanese because I did a google search on his guild tag "TW" on Bloodscorn and sure enough, his name popped up on the forums and Reddit. Hackers use ESP a lot to know exactly where items, vehicles, and players are hiding.\n\nAnother incident happened in a town called Ranchito. I was logged in a three story apartment and the first thing I hear before I even move my character is... "Someone's in the second floor" from a player named "BloodscornM". I looked around and there are no windows to see me. I didn't make a sound from walking. I heard footsteps running towards my direction. I was taking no risk. I logged off right away like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ as a shotgun bullet was fired at me.\n\nI came back on and ran straight to my base after a 15 minute break. Guess who is chasing me with a truck? The same dudes... The dude BloodscornM was like, "No one can hide from me". I didn't die though. I used to be on the track team so I was gone.\n\nI sent recordings and screenshots to report these people since 5/1/2015 so we will see if anything happens. They are currently still playing every day ruining the experience for other players.","March 22, 2015","false","278.6"," 189 of 246 people (77%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","77","189","246","29","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/overslick/recommended/295110/","overslick","Morkel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/overslick/","540 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOh Boy! Another open world survival horror game that features zombies! Where have i seen this before? Lets see what we have here.\n\nOh wait. The servers are down. Everything is down. If you've been following this game like i have you'll know that its been delayed more than once. You would expect this kind of thing to be fixed in that time they took. Instead we get the virtual middle finger in the form of ERROR G99. In fact you would be lucky to even know that you got that error because the website that displays it is down. Regardless of server issues, we've seen this exact formula before on steam many times. The only game of this format that was successful was DayZ. And even that is debatable.\n\nDo you remember how hyped everyone was for Nether? Suddenly Déja vu occurs. That game had broken servers and errors on luanch too. It also had many hackers. And pay to win. Please H1Z1. Don't be Nether.\n\nI'm aware that it's cruel to critique a game for server issues on launch day especially when it's only for alpha. But we've had delays already, and one would hope that they used that time to make sure the game was actually playable when it was released.\n\nWhen the game actually works I'll update on whether this game is actually worth buying in early access. Right now don't spend your money on something that won't even display an error message let alone actually play.\n\nedit: I actually tried to play the game so as i could give an honest review of what its like excluding all of the pay to win crap and look at what the game has to offer. I wish i could tell you that it was a great game. I wish i could tell you that its a bad game too. I wish i could tell you anything about this game at all. But i can't. You know why? Because it still doesn't work. Not in the way you would expect though. I was able to actually launch the game this time. And i was able to play it too! However i just wanted to update that it's still virtually unplayable and as of yet i was barley able to play it. But here what i experienced while trying:\n\nThe server browser is still cancer. There is no refresh button, half of the servers are not available for no reason, and there are queues to get in to the servers. That is completely understandable that theres would be long queues because most people want to play on high pop servers. But here's the problem. For me, at least, when i joined a queue that was way too long for my tastes and backed out to try and join another server, I couldn't. Every time i wanted to retry on another server, i had to restart my game. Nice.\n\nGAMEPLAY?\nWell, the game is optimized about as well as i am for the bottom of the ocean. I was getting mouse lag on the menu, for christsake. I can assure you that this was not because of my computer. It's clear that even if it is for certain setups, the optimization is very poor. It could be something i'm doing wrong, but hell if i know. So because of this optimization the game is virtually unplayable. I turned down every setting i could think of to try and get it to work. Natta. I know my playtime indicates that i wasn't playing for very long, which is because i couldn't. But what i did experience was very laggy and i could not do anything besides walk down a road for a bit before getting quick scoped by supposedly christ himself.\n\nEarly access.\nPlease. I know this game is in early access and that it's stupid to be critizing it like it's a new Call of Duty or something. Most of this is pretty sarcastic with little regard that the game is in early access. I still hope to edit this with more on what the game is actually like when i can play it. But as of now, forgive me for being a bit bitter because i did pay 21 bucks for a game that the devs said would not have pay to win, was delayed more than once, and already showed many similarities to other bad games on steam. next time i update, I'll for sure have played it for a couple hours and actually have thorough experience with it. But right now, still do not buy what doesn't work 'til you here it does.","January 15, 2015","false","51.3"," 1,312 of 1,885 people (70%) found this review helpful 98 people found this review funny","70","312","1","98","10"

I was disappointed.\n\nFirst and foremost, The game is glitchy, EXTREMELY, The dev's claim to be working to resolve issues and yet it seems month to month they release new artwork for content or show off their 3d modeling which they've been working on. The glitches and or bugs remain a problem while they create new content and attempt to resolve some of the isssues with the new content before moving onto their next idea submitted normally by players to keep the game interesting.\n\nIf your like me and like to just play a game in your leisure time for a few hours at a time you'll have this game down within a week after resource gathering and attempting to find a vehicle for transportation you will be disappointed as was I. Your vehicle after you obtain it can randomly despawn even while stored inside your base, this has happened to me multiple times over the course of my 300+ hours of play time. It will say 275 on this but I also have 30+ hours on the test server. People also tend to hoard vehicles in mass "Incase one just despawns" they won't normally say this but after some time played and multiple vehicles of your own despawning you'll see exactly what I mean if you choose to purchase this game.\n\nYour vehicle can also flip over speed bumps and they do so QUITE OFTEN, even while driving ON ROADS. God forbid you decide to make your base offroad in an attempt to get away from the 20 abandoned bases within the cities within the game people will randomly creep around your base and wait for your vehicle to despawn. Or, while riding it and gathering resources to burn time cause you've already gathered them prior to building your base, your vehicle will more then likely get stolen as the ATV, Truck, jeep, and police car all have loud engines you can hear from quite a distance away, it is easy to hide and your vehicle is EXTREMELY EASY TO STEAL we are talking it will take them within 10 seconds and you can be locked out of your vehicle the moment they enter it which only takes a second to press E and your time spent seeking transportation is now gone and you have some jerk laughing at you and speaking badly of you on the in game channel.\n\nI do not recommend this game as it is a waste of money, I honestly wish I could return this, there is literally no way to contact Daybreak as there site is broken, there is no support email listed or contact number, the login to daybreaks forums or homepage will ask you to login only to not re route you back to make a ticket but bring you back to a home page where it shows you as not being logged in when you attempt to do so again you will find the same results.\n\nPlease heed my advice. You will regret purchasing this game within a month at max. It is not worth the 20 some dollars or whatever it is they are asking now.\n\nBest of luck to you, happy game hunting.","April 2","false","275.9"," 92 of 107 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","92","107","9","4"

Sit down kids grandpa is going to tell you a tale.\n\nOnce upon a time in the deep forest of H1Z1 stood a young man named Luther. Luther wanted nothing more than to survive the zombie apocalypse and started his search for food, water, and shelter. He started to follow the first street he could find and within minutes came upon a few peasants clashing fisticuffs this scared him. Stirred but not shaken Luther pressed on past the men and onward to new lands. However one of the men followed our young hero and proceeded to swing his mighty stick over and over missing with each swing. Luther skillfully dodged and made a swift escape. Luther continued his journey down the road more determined than ever to secure his survival. As Luther was searching a gas station for any valuable goodies a man by the name of BuckNastyzz The Great came asking for assistance to hunt down a man firing arrows upon him. Luther was more than happy to help kill a ruthless bandit. However the bandit was hidden away in his shack of invincibility and continued to mock our heroes. Finally Luther and Buck decided this was a waste of valuable time. Now stronger than ever Luther moved forth with buck at his side! They did everything together, hunted, forged for berries, stole rabbit meat from traps and even hunted bandits! All was not how it seemed however, After eating a nice meal of rabbit and berry juice Luther and Buck decided to move onward with their adventure. When out of the darkest three bandits appeared and decided we were on their territory. "C'mon buck lets go, we're out numbered" said Luther. Buck responded by firing arrows at the pursing bandits, "No, get your axe we can take them" With a sigh Luther spun around with his axe in hand and charged into battle. Minutes later buck was killed, with his last dying breath he said "Run" Luther ran as fast he could weeping in mourn of his best friends death, those bandits would not get away with this. "where is he?" said one bandit. "He got away" said another, little did they know Luther was hidden in the mist of the fog waiting to strike. Luther followed them down a hill and into their base made of three shacks on a Cliffside. Luther charged into their base, swinging his axe of vengence shouting "YOU KILLED BUCK" the bandits fired arrow after arrow at Luther finally bringing his life to an end. Luther had failed to avenge Buck.\n\nI'm sorry Buck\n15/10 Would cry over stranger again.\n\n\n*SpongeBob narrator voice*\n5 Hours later\n\nLuther was vanquished from existence and respawned within another forest. This time however there was a refuel station within his view, to his right was another civilian freshly brought back into existence just as he was. "Hello friend" Luther said. No reply, the man looked at Luther, whipped out his flashlight to get a better look at our young hero. Without warning he started throwing punches, "Hey what the ♥♥♥♥ is your deal?!" Luther said as he lunged into a full sprint. "Fighting will not help you survive!". This time the young lad answered, "I don't care about survival, i just want to kill" "Go play street fighter then!". The chase went on for what seemed like an entire moon. Out of nowhere a civilian came to Luther's rescue! "Friend!" he shouted. "Help!" "This peasant is attacking me!". "Friend!" the man repeated. Obviously this man was from foreign land and did not understand Luther's language. Luther looked for refuge with only thing in site being a Grocery shack Luther quickly made his way there looking for more help. Upon entering he noticed the Young man and foreign fellow were gone. A sigh of relief escaped his lips "Thank Gaben".  Inside two nobles were conversing in he corner, sadly their conversation was inaudible, Luther creped closer. "We're going to need more people to fortify this place one said" "Yea but everyone's hostile what can we do?" the other replied. This was a prime chance to show himself. Luther came out of cover, "Hello" he said as friendly as he could. "Hello" "Hi man". Luther and the two nobles talked about what to do next. deciding to move onward to find more supplies they all set out with bow in hand, Luther had made new companions to help him on his journey. After traveling for a day and a half the men came upon a work house filled with cubical work stations. "I heard this is a great place to find a gun" Cadem said "alright lets split and look" said anonymous. Once the placed was searched and nothing was found, our hero's met on the top floor trying to decide what to do next. "Hello" said a unknown voice. Two knights, one named Yoloysnme and the other Kenkoin  walked into the room and claimed to be friendly passerby's. Anonymous losing all control pulled his bow back and nailed Yoloysnme right between the eyes, shouting "IM SORRY BUT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SO LONG" Kenkoin immediately shot at Anonymous killing him instantly. Cadem burst into a rage "YOU KILLED MY FRIEND!" chasing the man with a branch down the stairs and out the building. Luther however had lost sight of the men and could not figure where the shouting was coming from. Luther was about to check outside when a horrifying death scream came from the right of the building he recognized that voice....Cadem!. Luther ran out as fast he could, only to find Kenkoin, blood stained and beat down, standing over Cadem's corpse. "Stand down and i wont kill you" Yelled the knight. "Alright alright" yelled Luther. "AVENGE ME LUTH" "CMON AVENGE ME!" Instantly a flashback of Buck appeared in his head. This bandit wouldn't survive.. this wont end like it did last time. Luther acted innocent and went behind a building. He then looked around the corner to find Kenkoin busy looting. Luther drew his bow, started to aim.. he had run out of time, Ken was on the run, it was now or never. Calling upon Buck for strength Luther fired.........Plunk. The arrow had landed and vanquished Kenkoin. "I GOT HIM!" "I DID IT!" He yelled as he came out of cover. Miraculously, Cadem was not yet gone. "Thank you Luther.." "Its alright Cadem you can rest easy now.." as if on que rain started falling from the cloudy sky "I love you man" Luther said as a single tear dropped down splashing down on Cadem's face. His friends were dead but he had avenged them and redeemed himself. Looking to the raining sky he whispered, "I did it Buck i.. actually did it " Taking ever last ounce of energy he had left from the miserable day he pulled his self together and looted everyone's stuff. Now suited with only the best gear Luther set off on his journey again. It didn't take long before a peasant came running up to him. "Hello" he said "Have you seen someone named Yoloysnme and Kenkoin? He asked. Luther's Gut turned to stone. "Uh...Yea...they were up in that building back there". "Are you sure?" he replied "i heard some commotion and got worr-" "Yea I'm sure, they were looking for you just keep going down the road and you should see em" "thanks". The man turned and ran down the streets trying to catch up to his already dead friends. Luther looked down at the shirt he was wearing, reached into the front pocket and found a picture of Yoloysnme and a beautiful women. Luther let in a small breath and let another tear roll down his face. He ripped the picture in half and threw it into the wind and continued his journey down the long road. He never knew surviving would be so hard.","January 21, 2015","true","49.7"," 566 of 810 people (70%) found this review helpful 529 people found this review funny","70","566","810","529","18"

Not in a good way either. First off, I would like to say it is a good idea in concept, not in production, at least not now. I have put 3 weeks (521.4 hours) of my life straight into H1Z1, and after all that time, I can honestly say, do not waste your money on this game, right now. Emphasis on Right Now. I will go over all the pros and cons now like a magic trick. WABOOM.\n\nPros:\n-Great game if you like grinding for a while\n-Looks pretty\n-Lot of items\n-Battle Royale mode\n-Skins?\n\nCons: Oh boy! Do I have some cons for this game!\n-A few game breaking glitches/bugs.\n-Uses one of the worst anticheat software to even exist.\n-Shotgun is not consistent. Doesn't do what it should do.\n-Cheaters. (You will see a lot getting banned, but IMHO, dont try hard enough to PREVENT it.)\n-Some more cheaters\n-Chinese cheaters\n-Russian cheaters\n-American cheaters\n-Martian cheaters\n-Servers get wiped when an update occurs that adds things to the game/map.\n-Big groups of 40 run around KOSing (Killing on sight)\n-Duplication bugs\n-Did i mention cheaters?\n-Horrid development process.\n-Devs focus on crates more than game. (Still true, unfortunately)\n-Fattest cash cow to graze in the Americas.\n-Development WAS focused on KOTK, and JS was left to die.\n\nTL;DR, This game, in its current state, is not worth 5 bucks. Unturned has better development and its run by one person. I honestly did like playing H1Z1 from the begininning, but now it has gotten stale and not worth my time anymore. $20 better spent on bleach. The last time I played this game, it felt more of a scavengy arcade shooter than a surival game. So honestly, if your are thinking about buying this game, save your money and wait until the reviews go up to atleast 90%.\n\nEDIT: I realize I haven't played the game in almost 1-2 months! I follow /r/H1Z1, but not all the complaints, I do check the changelogs everytime it updates. Also, I do not care if the devs can do anything about KOSing or not, it is just part of the game, and I put it in my review. Now, my point is, that some of these issues are going to be outdated, and maybe fixed, but I have removed them from the list after I went through the reddit's updates and see what was fixed.

If you want a real survival shooter, I would suggest Rust. It's made by the developers of Garry's Mod and they actually do significant updates on a weekly basis.

Unfortunately, the moment Sony unloaded SOE to DayBreak, all development teams were cut to nothing and stupid skins and cash grabs are all that's been added to the game.\n\nBattle Royale (BR) is all that they have worked on over the past 6 months.

I find out it's pretty hard to come across food and water.\nDay 2: Finally found a knife! I also made a bow and some arrows after finding some food and water.\nDay 3: Met someone. Said he was friendly, and we both traded. I traded ammo for some food.\nDay 4: I set camp in house inside of a town. I'm hearing lots of gunfire, though it sounds distant..\nDay 5: I found a pistol that uses the type of ammo I traded away.. Oh well.\nDay 6: I was ran out of my camp by a group of bandits that came in. I managed to get away from them after they chased me.\nDay 7: I managed to get a ride from someone in their jeep. They took me to a small pit stop area. Lots of people here, though they seem friendly.\nDay 8: I walk down a road to another town, this one looking safer than the last one where I made camp. I decide to set up camp here.\nDay 9: I met a man near my camp, pleading for help. I asked 'What's wrong?' before he screams 'F***ING RUN NIQQA' before getting shot the f*** up. I turn to run into a building, before a group of bandits say 'Put your weapon away, now.' I complied, sticking my hands up. They surrounded me before screaming 'ALLAHU AKBAR', shooting a bullet into my brain.\n\n10/10, would be killed by ISIS again.\n\n\nIn all seriousness though, the game is very fun. Contrary to what most people say how there are too many bandits, I've met over 20 friendly players and I only met 2 groups of bandits (about 3 or 4 players each). The group I mention above is the only group succesfully ending my charactor's life. H1Z1 has a very fun community from what I've experienced so far, unlike other games where it's players are all sociopaths.\n\n[Update: 2/17/14] Last night I was playing for a little bit, streaming the game for my friend to see. I went into Lone Pine Devopment, looking for loot before turning towards an audible voice. As I looked towards the noise source, I saw roughly 9 hostile people surrounding me, carrying bows and spears. I just f***ing booked it, managing to lose them in the woods after suffering with only one arrow hitting my leg. That was some Lord of the Flies s***, bro. Intense. Now I know to absolutely, postively never ever go to Lone Pine Development.\n\n[Update: 2/21/15] By now I have met a couple hackers in H1Z1 so far. On the server I play on, it's not too big of a problem though they have killed me and my friend's group. I cannot speak for other servers, but on the server I play on it isn't too much of a problem. It sucks a bit, though. I still rate this review as positive despite the hacking, as I expect it to fixed soon with H1Z1's active development.","February 16, 2015","true","65.0"," 248 of 348 people (71%) found this review helpful 208 people found this review funny","71","248","348","208","3"

There are about 3 modes now, which include upto: 20-minute survival, 50-minute survival, and my very favorite endlesss respawn mode.\n\nThe survival aspect of the game has been dead now for a very long time, ever since clan hoarding has become a thing.  Along with item spawns being complete trash, the AI are basically non-existant.  Sure a zombie may chase you around the map, you may escape, die to the zombie, or die to a player just killing players as if it were battle royal.. oh wait.\n\nThe survival mode needs a lot of work to be considered an entertaining casual game to play.

Just go buy The Culling on 3/8/2016\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEdit: I quit playing, go buy ARK. Life is much better.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPlayed the game almost 8 hours before and after their first patch.\nSo far it's a very big open world. Would take probably an hour and a half to walk north to south, so you'll find alot of interesting and diverse locations and zones.\nThe looting system is close to reference as 7 days to Die. You have to wait 1.5 secs to open cabinets, search vehicles, 3.5+ for bigger containers.\nThere is Hydration, Stamina, Energy (food), and obviously Health. This is well polished. These have been tweaked and are quite easy to maintain. You find best food is cooked meats from the wild game.\nIn which i've seen bears, doe, buck, wolf, and rabbit. Maybe more I'm not sure.\nThey use a unique crafting and "discovery" system. Say to learn/craft a bow you have to put a wood stick and scrap of cloth in disovery to Learn it. Then tab over to crafting to craft it using said materials. This goes with sheds, weapons, tools, houses, everything. Everything new discover something about it.\nThe combat is different for each weapon, Hand to Hand is very fluent well polished more than other weapons. Axes/machettes all are basic swing/click and zeds still manage to hit you once if you're not super duper careful. All of the firearms work as expected fine. But some animations are just weak (EA).\nDriving Vehicles you first need at least a battery and spark plugs... and a driveable vehicle. They have what I've seen 4 different vehicles, truck, off road, cop car, jeep. It's well polished, no rubberbanding, each car drives a bit different.\nMy experience recently with the game has me halted on the purchase of the game for others in it's current state. As I said I played for 8 hours after patch, they tweaked spawns and looting, not too bad. But I was basically 16 hours into loot, with bags and mats to the max. Weapons with ammo, used all airdrops. Only to fight one zombie and my game suddenly Freeze. Not crash or d/c like I'd hope. It froze with my character still in the server dying from a zombie with all my stuff. Not to say I couldnt find my house and remake a living. It's the principle of the matter. This had happened 3 times before but not during combat. And now when I try to log into my MEDIUM server. There is a 25min queue wait for only 15 people.\nSo I say to new customers, this game is amazing. It's as if Dayz, Rust, and Infestation had an intellectual love child. Support this game, But KNOW IT IS IN DEVELOPMENT STILL AND EVERYTHING YOU DO AND WASTE TIME FOR CAN BE GONE IN A SPLIT SECOND.

Be promised a MULTITUDE of times by the developers and the SOE / DawnBreak president himself through both live-streams and social networking announcements that there will be NO buying yourself an in-game edge with real life money.. Just to have the developers inject airdrops that you buy into the game (with said real money) to be full with weapons, ammo and backpacks (that are otherwise rare and difficult to get) into the early-access.\n\n2. Have GIGANTIC server flops at the game's initial early access launch which made the entire world cringe with awkwardness as SOE encouraged/paid armies of famous streamers to stand ready just to have their entire infrastructure collapse and be a yo-yo of lag and broken functionality for weeks afterwards, still ongoing to this date.\n\n3. Have the game be 'patched' about 4-5 times every day for a week with constant promises of fixes to the loot system.. Just to have it embarassingly break even more.\n\nThis continued for months on end until at this point today where looting still remains the most broken thing in the world with containers being empty 99.8% of the time (kitchen cupboards loot, anyone?) and guns being the only consistent thing you can find along with ammo, causing the game to become a complete shoot-on-sight death match simulator and It is only made severely worse with player-made bases. Impenetrable sniping out-posts where you shoot everyone on-sight while blocking off item spawns from other players that are a breeze to build and last literally forever like cancerous tumors until all the servers wipe. It looks like shít, It integrates into the base game experience like shít, It functions like shít and worst of all, It promotes the most cowardly, pathethic and disgusting grouping up / clan-baby social behavior I ever had the displeasure to see. To illustrate this point, here is a video that perfectly simulates what the current H1Z1 community is like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSrH-6YUf1g\n\nAll of this boils down to this game being impossible to play as a solo-player unless you play on an empty server / cowardly build yourself a base and hide in it 24/7. All of this wouldn't be so bad If it wasn't for the fact that the developers have shown to have little to no idea on just what to do with their game and the initiative from them to fix the currently hideously broken fundamentals things is nonexistant.

Once you have lost everything you've spent weeks farming it is then impossible to re-establish yourself on any server that i'snt dead as ♥♥♥♥. You have to get an early start on a server and get a base up and runnning as soon as possible before you get inevitably ♥♥♥♥ed by hacks. When you do inevitably get ♥♥♥♥ed, you may as well quit the game until the next server wipe and then hope to establish yourself once again whilst everyone is on the same level. I appreciate the game is in alpha but that doesn't quite justify the extent of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bugs there are in this game. Why do the devs insist on including new skins and various other ways to grab everyone's money instead of concetrating on some of the fundamental core issues with the game. The hit box is ♥♥♥♥ing unreal, if someone is moving, don't even try and shoot them as you will do nothing but waste bullets. Every gun in the game is completely obselete other than the .308 and the 12 Gauge.\n\nNot to say I haven't had fun on this game, when I had a base and your rolling with a squad, looting and getting getting into gun fights, it's all fun and games but I have't had any fun on this game since my base got ♥♥♥♥ed by hackers. Since then I have tried to start anew on at least 7 different servers, in various locations only to get ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥ the second I finally locate a backpack and some bullets for a gun.\n\nTo summarise, game is fun when you have established a base early on, when you get raided, quit the game. Various hacks and bugs have impacted experience massively. Devs are money grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who care more about the microtransactions than the core game.","September 13, 2015","false","211.0"," 182 of 251 people (73%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","73","182","251","22","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scaleskin/recommended/295110/","scaleskin","ScaleSkin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scaleskin/","135 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'll start with what I've gone through today, then dig a little bit of details.\n\nOn I8 sector I have a small shack as base of operations. I've been using it for a few days and today unknown to me, a sniper was hiding aimed at the door. So I return from scavenging and just as I opened the door the gun shots began. The sniper shot three times, he aimed to kill me while shack door was open but missed each bullet until I locked myself in. Now the fun part starts. I began burning a campfire and preparing cooking meat and purifying water, while this guy came to the door and on voice, started shouting.. No exaggeration no made-up here: "YOU SON OF BEACH MOTHER FAWKER, YOU SON OF BEACH MOTHER FAWKER, YOU SON OF BEACH MOTHER FAWKER". Ps: Steam please forgive this but that is the actual quote I had to go through for playing this game. Also I repeat it three times but this guy kept on shouting on voice for easy 15 minutes and maybe more. He also kept shooting the shack but shacks aren't easy to take down with bullets so .. meh..  Reason I tell this story is, that should at least give an opinion about community.\n\nH1Z1 is Early Access game that tells lies at each step. The trailer is fake, every player character is same as each other because there is no customisation. Animations are crappy, made in qanimator in 60 seconds. However worst of all is the game itself is not about survival, especially PvE servers. Although PvP is not survival either but it is death match. Other deathmatch games for example are not called survival games.\n\nThere are three game types and frankly to say I never played BR. That is not why I purchased the game at first place. Other game types are PvE and PvP. Now one important point is, in H1Z1 there are less number of zombies then active players. Unless you are in a city, your chances of meeting any zombies is 10% or less. There are wolves and bears but they are not difficult to kill even with the simpliest weapon. In the cities you can meet hordes of zombies but H1Z1 has, like three cities in total and running between these takes around half or one hour. Also you can outrun everything so if you enjoy running, H1Z1 is a perfect running simulator.\n\nAbout PvP servers the first example goes on all the way. You meet random people, first they kill you then they curse you as above. So far in 40 hours I've never seen any exceptions to this. It's a "meet people, get killed, have your mother done by several players, spawn at the other edge of map, run for an hour to your shack, eventually get killed, have your mother done by several players, spawn at another edge of map, run for another hour, repeat these steps." game.\n\n''That is how people are, developers can't do anything about that'' -   No not really; if the game has real survival taste, such as if the game actually had zombies spawning around and act like they do in movies, if the zombies were crowded, fast, smarter than they are right now; then players are given a reason to cooperate, group up and help each other. Even at these conditions there are going to be PvP fights, such as gang wars but this time it will make sense and the game will prevent unnecessary ooc violance or whatever it is called.\n\nThis is so far the only game I requested for refund but I already had 40 hours so it was sadly rejected. Personally I don't plan to play anymore because it is stressing. <ranting>The whole project is based on lies and fake presentations. You will never see anything close to that trailer. Then not only the game but what the game supports. The people, these players, that community. I'm looking forward to have fun here and enjoy the time i play, not to be harrassed by rednecks who keep swearing, shooting at my door, using words that I am ashamed to repeat here. For game's sake I could have a visitor at home, playing on speakers or maybe children in the same room. </ranting>","October 2, 2015","false","51.9"," 390 of 571 people (68%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","68","390","571","81","29"

Currently the game faces instability, several bugs that can break the game or cause a lot of inconvenience, and their servers are (supposedly) being DDOS'd constantly. If Daybreak Games would focus on the stability and optimization of the game instead of focusing on content, I feel this game would be more worth the investment. It has a lot of potential but currently faces the general stigma that some other early access games seem to be doing which is just the 'cashgrab' idea. At the moment I would say if you have not already paid for the game then I would wait and see how the game progresses. The game does need more content but I do not think it needs more skins. This seems to give the impression that the developers may need more money to actually finish their product or may just be cash grabbing.","January 1","false","454.7"," 108 of 141 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","108","141","9","0"

The game at it's current state is mediocre at best, it has multipule bugs, hackers and just gets plain boring after a few hours of play.\n\nPros:\n- It's easy to get into.\n- The discovery system is nice and adds some level of detail into the normal recycled crafting system.\n- You will have some great moments with friends.\n- This game has a dedicated battle royal game mode!\n\nCons:\n- Hackers\n- Bugs\n- Crashes\n- Total neglect of survival (THE ORIGINAL ♥♥♥♥ING PURPOSE OF THE GAME)\n- The devs do not fix problems but instead add more gamemodes to BR.\n- Zombies spawn places they simply should not. (ie, random cabin in the woods, random dam)\n- There is no legit sprint function.\n- Over priced clothing ($50 for a police outfit WTF???!!!)\n\nFinal word:\nIt's a shame that this survival game has turned into a battle royal game, that's not to say survival is dead, but it's really boring after a while. Ammo is to scarce and guns are to common, it makes no sence that there is random guns laying around the police station and two 45. rounds in a f**king case of ammuntion. They added a military base with out even adding anything to spawn inside of it. If you can't already tell, the devs have seemed to focus on two things, enhancing BR and creating more clothing that you have to buy to take out the immersion.\n\nI rate this game 4.5/10.

However there are a few huge problems with H1Z1 which urks the player base. Some of them are big enough that I had to give this game a negative review and seeing as how I watched this game develope over a year, I can safely say I doubt I'll be switching it to positive.\n\n1) Originally this game was supposed to be a zombie survival. Battle Royal came later in development as another optional game mode (which has become a huge success). Battle royal is essentially a game mode where players drop throughout the map which is loaded plentifully with guns, ammo, armour, and vehicles. Is it fun? Yes, is it zombie based? not at all. There is a mode called greendawn which costs tickets (extra $) which claims to have zombie spawns, but I havn't seen any yet. they have been putting so much time into patching and fixing BR that they have left the main zombie survival mode in a horrible state. They have pretty much done a 360 and turned this games main focus to something completely different.\n\n2) The devs released early access with price tag to support the development. They have a few benifits for buying in; early access, 3 event tickets (to modes like greendawn, you're able to get more by winning normal BR matches), and two keys. Is this not adding up? two keys are maybe $5 in value and the rest is worthless. It's bassically "hey will you find bugs and play an unfinished game for us? pay us $20 bucks, people with more patience will get a more polished game for free" I unfortunately bought this game earlier when they gave a few keys to the first crate, which has pretty much nothing of value (some 0.04 pants and shirts). The earlier supporters normally get a great deal for supporting a game as its starts. Games like Smite gave opportunities to get amazing limited skins unavailable to people buying after early access. I feel the dev team really could care less that people supported them when they were struggling in early development. Buying this game early has no value.\n\n3) Cash grabs. Yes crash grabs, micro transitions are plentiful in F2P games, its the only viable way to get money. But again, why are there so many cash grabs in an EARLY ACCESS (Alpha before), P2P game? as i mentioned before, this seems like a fair idea AFTER they finish early access and enter the F2P scheme. Also, why do they have modes that cost money (tickets) in early access? Here buy tickets (or win them but winning a BR isnt easy) to play a similar unfinished mode with a few tweeks and possible skins. Those 3 event tickets won't get you far, I've died 2 times instantly because some people dove a gun quickly; money down the drain for what should be a free mode right now. Only possible fix is to make the event tickets extremely easy to get right now or free, then change that when its F2P.\n\n4) Very slow development. I bought into Alpha well over a year ago now. It just entered early release last month and There hasn't been much improvement (and pretty much none in survival mode). They added a few more guns, a few more crafting recipes and some bug fixes.  Basically survival feels like its still in Alpha, BR the golden child is a lot further along.\n\n5) Shooting mechanics still feel clunky. There is no seen benifit to going first person and its worse if you look down the iron sights. Most games make it so looking down the iron sights makes you more accurate, to encourage people to use it; bassically third person ends up being by the far the best choice here. Half of playing with friends is watching them die and saying "What I shot him X ammount of times, and it says none of them connected". Now I'm sure the accuracy makes some sense, but there is no mode for people to practice shooting to get use to it. It would be cool to have shooting matches with your friends or some experimental mode to play with all the guns, figure out the effective ranges and the bullet drop offs (if they have any).\n\n6) Not much of a zombie game. I have to repeat this; zombies are marketed to be a huge part of this game, but right now they're absent in the most popular mode, and horribly done in survival. Zombies arn't much of a threat, you'll probably never have to or want to use your hard earned bullets on them. You'll just save the ammo for PVP. The Zombie AI is weak, they spawn usually sparcely and sometimes they'll spawn right infront of you.\n\nSome fixes? Make both BR modes free to play, have an extra mode that costs tickets but the only difference is the chance of getting exclusive skins. Fix the zombies. Fix Survival. Give us Alpha and Early Access supports some good s--- for supporting you, seriously we should be thanked for giving you money early on in whats supposed to become a F2P finished game. Some sort of sandbox mode so we can practice shooting for BR.\n\nTL;DR version. Indie zombie MP suvival game falls into same development hole that all indie MP survival games have to date. Can't deliver on promises, take as much money as they can.","December 8, 2015","false","81.6"," 66 of 81 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","66","81","4","0"

As how Daybreak Games goes, I have changed my mind.  When this game was first pitched the game was going to have alot of features that would make H1Z1 a game that would stand out from the games before it in this genre.  As they developed the game they would be in constant communication with the players with a roadmap and using twitter and reddit as a way to get constant feedback about the direction they are and will be going with the game as they are developing H1Z1.  This is what I paid to support, a survival game that the devs were so enthusiastic themselves to make.  Well as of lately it seems that energy has disappeared, most of the features mentioned at the start are not going to happen during development or even after release of the game.  The road map is dust in the wind and communication is down to little stuff from Battle Royal news to new crates to buy keys for or about streamers.  If the current build was the sales pitch for H1Z1, I would never have paid to support it.  It's like paying someone to make a new car design, over time they start changing all the features and they start getting quiet and after awhile they show up with what they made.  A motorcycle, which is nowhere near what they offered.  Sure, it has a motor, wheels, lights, takes gas and moves fast, but I paid for the car and I really wanted the car.  If the devs get back on track and start talking to the community like they use to and work on the game they pitched to us, I will then return to this game and continue to offer my support and feedback, because as of now I have unistalled H1Z1.  To me Daybreak no longer is as enthusiastic about the H1Z1 that they wanted to make and the Community that supported it.  So untill Daybreak Games gets back on track I can not support or recommend H1Z1.","November 30, 2015","false","220.2"," 57 of 67 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","57","67","6","0"

I have played this game fo quite a while and i am yet to encounter a single hacker in Battle Royal or normal game play.  Also the people you see complaining about having to pay for a game that is in early access to then complain it is buggy... ITS EARLY ACCESS.  The devs are constantly updating the game and new things are being added constantly.  The devs are also constantly improving the anti cheat systems being used.\n\nOne last point before i get onto the actual game.  The items you can purchase do nothing to really push you ahead of people.  The air drops you get are random in terms of content.  When the air drop hits the ground it spawns a large amount of zombies and leaves green smoke which is a beacon for other people to come and fight you for the air drop.  People complain that you can only buy cosmetics etc.  These are thesort of people that rather than go around and loot properly for weapons just want to be able to buy then or buy better weapons etc.  The game is in no way Pay to Win.\n\nRight... Onto the actual game.\n\nZombies\nRecently they largely increased the zombie spawn rate which has finally added some much needed tension to looting around other than players.  Before this it was basically just a giant pvp arena with the zombies being nothing but a distraction.  It is now so easy to get completely swarmed by zombies if you arent careful.  The looting is nice, you start with nothing except a torch and can find all sorts of weapons and other gear searching around houses and camp sites etc.\n\nOther Players\nThis is personally my favourite part about this game.  Due to the ingame voice chat that is available finding other players is extremely tense most of the time.  You can either try to become friends with them and team up or you could simply try and kill each other for loot.  Just so you know.  There will never be anything as satisfying as getting a long range headshot with the bow on a player.\n\nMap\nThe map is quite large and is still expanding.  Eventually the devs hope to have an even larger map in which players can actually take control of a town or building rathen than having to build their own base (makes sense for a survival situation).\n\nUpcoming features.\nThere are so many features still to be added to this game.  My personal favourite that i am looking forward to is the implementation of a merchant system allowing you to open up a shop and trade other players legitimately rather than hoping they dont just murder you mid trade.\nWeather and weather effects are being added for example if it is raining or snowing you will get cold and need to wrap up and warm up or risk getting ill which causes you to get hungry and dehydrate faster.\n\nBattle Royal (BR).\nOne of the best things about the game by far.  In a BR you are pitted against 120 players who are all parachuted into the map at the same time.  Food and drink are not part of a BR and guns/ammo spawns are MASSIVELY increased.  The zone becomes smaller and smaller as gas is thrown into the map bringing the playable area smaller and smaller until it is the size of one building! Whilst they are planning on making BRs pay to enter they have said this will not happen until all issues are sorted out and the hacking has been quelled.\n\nAll in All.\nA very fun game which is more fun if you are playing with others yet still amazing fun on your own. Hours seem to fly by as you get engulfed in the game.","April 16, 2015","true","300.6"," 593 of 905 people (66%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","66","593","905","59","39"

I had no loot, and as I had spawned near some shops, it seemed fit to go and search them. I made sure that I had crafted my powerful "Makeshift Bow" beforehand, and I was wielding it like a fierce barbarian. I came upon a shopping mall, and after checking the outside, decided that there would be nobody in there. I entered the shop. An eerie silence greeted me, followed by muffled footsteps in the backroom. I tensed. Slowly, I pulled an arrow to the bowstring, ready to fight any intruders. Suddenly, I heard running behind me, and to my dismay, as I turned I feel an arrow hit my back. I cry out in pain, but I am determined to fight back. After a tense few seconds as I swerve left and right to avoid his shots, I decide it is time to fight back. As I run round a corner, him only a few metres behind me, I pull an arrow to the string, tensing for the crucial shot. He runs round the corner, and with a cry of fear, he lay cumpled at my feet. He was dead.\n\nI was panting heavily, and although I had just beat my foe off with a mighty arrow, I thought to myself "What have I done. I'm a monster!" I feel ashamed at having killed another human being. What has my life come to? I suddenly fall down to my knees and retch, sobbing. After a long time, I manage to pick myself up, and force myself to think straight. I had to get used to it if I was to survive this zombie infection. I go over to the body, feeling a swell in my throat as I hold back the tears. I look over his body, and my eyes widen as to what I see. The backpack. The sacred backpack of 1200 space. Never before have I seen this. Before I thought it only a myth. I pick it up, and marvel at the quality and size of it. What could I not achieve with such a bag beside me? Inside I find some berries, arrows and water. I almost felt happy killing him. Almost.\n\nI move on throughout the rest of the day, things seemed to be on the up, as i manage to find a new hat and shirt as I continue exploring the forest. Sometime later on in the evening, I come across some houses. Not wanting to risk my mighty bag, I didn't feel like exploring them, however my hunger got the better of me as I steered towards the house. I walk inside. A shiver runs up my spine at the sound. Nothing. Not a single ruffle of the leaves or tweet of birds. I walk into the lounge of the house, slowly searching the drawers. "RUFFGH". I turn. Please. Please not now. I see a huge figure come out of the bedroom. It was a bear.\n\nThe next thing I know I was sprinting for my life, for what could I hope to achieve against a monster with such power with a mere bow? I'm sprinting, and then I see a figure infront of me. I shout "Ho' there! Run for your life! A wild beast approaches!" He turns to me, and sees the silhouette of the mighty monster bearing down on me. He turns and runs, however he stumbles and is not quick enough. I scream as I see it clamp its mighty jaws and tear him to pieces. The bear stopped, and then looked up at me and continued to chase me. He saw a better prize. He wanted the sacred bag. I panic, and slip, and in that moment the bear catches up slightly. I'm darting through the trees, trying to avoid this mighty beast. I veer to the left, and as the sound starts to fade, I thought I had lost him. Knowing it was still nearby, I hurriedly tried to log out. 10 seconds. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. I see the bear out of the corner of my eye, mere meters away, hunting me with those ravaging red eyes. 1. The bear hits me at full speed, I scream as its jaws close around my waist, biting into my stomach. The bear had won.\n\n#♥♥♥♥theHaters and yes, this review is a joke, I'm not some ♥♥♥♥ing storyteller.\n\n10/10 Love dis game.","January 25, 2015","true","267.0"," 234 of 349 people (67%) found this review helpful 179 people found this review funny","67","234","349","179","11"

There is no point to spend your money and your time ofc to such a failure!\nI will give you 7 reasons why this game is broken.\n\n-Daybreak is making more skins for cloths and weapons than improving their game. H1Z1 is more than 2 years in alpha.\n\n-Survive in a zombie apocalipse they said... Must be fun they said... No! Zombies are broken and they can run faster than a car, attacking you from 10m. away, making tons of damage even when you have body armors equipted and ofc... Some of them can fly ! WTF ?! They even try to add new type of zombies when the rest of them are a total mess.\n\n-No matter what server you will choose to play, you are about to face cheaters! They get in your base with noclip, watching you behind the walls with ESP (or checking if you are online at your base so they can raid) and ofc killing you 10 cities away with one shoot. BOOM aimbot.\n\n-Daybreak is all about the money. All the past moves were just to gain money and making people believe that one day this game will be improved. H1Z1 is now 2 games and you need to pay for each one. Smart move right ? That move called "improvement".\nThey don't even have an anti-cheat (they got one really bad). There is an announcement at the top of your screen, in game, that says who is getting banned. Guess what. Every 2 hours someone is getting banned.\n\n-Developers are really bad and the game is full of glitches. People are using exploits. The funny part is that.. THERE IS A TEST SERVER! Before they change something they should try it before releasing it in the official servers.\nCars are broken as well. If you found a car there is no way to secure it. Maybe you can from enemy players but you can't protect them in general. They explode for no reason, they fall under your deck foundation (base), sometimes they just vanish..\n\n-It's really simple. Crafting system, building system and even colleting stuff is really easy to do. To be honest i think the word "survival" game or the word "crafting" game is wrong.\n\n-There is nothing to help you protect your loots. If you die inside of your base you will respawn randomly in the map and you need to go again back to your base with NOTHING. If you get killed by raiders your base is gone.","April 26","false","281.7"," 63 of 80 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","63","80","9","4"

This makes looting items in the game world painful. It can often take up to 3 seconds to search a single object. In a building with dozens of objects, playing this game from Australia is basically a "searching filing cabinets simulator".\n\nThe airdrops have been modified to include guns 'less often', but they still have guns and they still introduce weapons into the loot economy of the world. You pay, and someone wins. That is pay to win. Semantics don't change that.\n\nI understand the reasoning behind Airdrops, but it's based on a flawed understanding of the mechanics that make these games fun. It creates a hostile environment where killing is the primary option, turning the game into a large map deathmatch. The idea behind airdrops is that it creates a point of interest for players on the server, so they'll flock to the drop to attempt to get whatever is inside. Because social interactions are at the core of the survival game experience, this seems like it would be a good thing.\n\nThe thing is, anyone can make a bow and arrows with the items they have when they spawn, which means anyone can attack from range basically immediately. This means that airdrops are a bow and arrow deathmatch arena. This is a mistake, because survival games are supposed to be about valuing your life, not throwing it away for the opportunity of some gear that shouldn't exist in the game world as it is.\n\nAnyway, this still isn't a review. It's an early access game and there's still room for improvement. It is my recommendation that you don't buy this game in Early Access at this point in time. I'll update again some other time.\n\n\n\nPrevious Review Below\n\nAt this stage I wouldn't recommend you buy into this game.\n\nWell it seems you can use real money to buy airdrops that give you guns and ammo, which is pretty much my definition of pay-to-win even if these airdrops will at some point be 'contested'. It says I've got "2 hours" on record, but I've spent all day trying to get into this woefully broken game without success.\n\nThe one time I did get into the game I alt-tabbed out to work out why Shadowplay wasn't working and the game promptly crashed, but crashes and bugs I think come with the territory of an Early Access game.\n\nStill, you'd imagine a company like Sony Online Entertainment would at least get a game to a basic level of quality before charging money for it.\n\nThat said, I don't agree with the idea that this is a review. This is simply my initial impressions of a game that doesn't really work much and also appears to contain some terrible pay-to-win elements.\n\nI wrote this more as a warning for all my Steam friends.","January 15, 2015","false","5.7"," 289 of 441 people (66%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","66","289","441","13","2"

I use to recommend it to anyone and everyone.  That is no longer the case.  There were roadmaps that had plans for exciting and new features, these have been scrapped entirely because they were not meeting their goals repeatedly.  The way they have handled communication with their community regarding their game is not acceptable  from a business standpoint.  The focus has gone from survival/battle royale (two different game modes) to mainly BR.  New content worth mentioning beyond a few new guns and some different points of interest are close to none since launch.\n\nThis is a letter from the John Smedley (Ex-President of DBG  - formerly Sony Online Entertainment).  This was the selling point for many people.  If you are hoping for many of the features listed below, you most likely will be disappointed.\n\nThe letter regarding the future, to the players\n\nI wanted to let you all know where we are headed as a team. The H1Z1 team continues to grow and we're concentrating on continuing to fix bugs, add new features and gaining the upper hand on cheaters. We're making good progress in all of these areas I'm happy to say.\nWeek after week we hope you're seeing the game get better. Sure there are the occasional setbacks, but we're going in a very positive direction and we're doing our best to communicate with the community on a constant basis. I hope you're feeling that and it's our desire to keep that going and make it even better.\nWe're trying to be as transparent as humanly possible while still keeping a sane schedule. I'm proud to say this development team has a life outside of work, and we're striving to keep that balance in the right place. We love making this game and we love playing it.\nWe have lots of very large features coming. Very significant improvements to base building are coming... including Guard towers, catwalks, 50 cal gun emplacements... windows.... and a whole lot more fun things. We're also going to be concentrating on making bases more secure and making the building process a lot easier.\nWe're also going to be spending a lot of time improving zombie AI and you can expect a lot smarter zombies and different types in the near future.\nAlso you can expect weather to come back in the near future. It's not on the roadmap because it's a larger task, but it's coming.\nWe're not ignoring the bugs we have and the usability of the game in general. We're not using the excuse "It's Early Access Alpha".. we play the game too and the same stuff that annoys you annoys us as well.\nWe also have Professions coming later this month. Those are going to be a game changer because it's going to allow for more character development and a much more unique set of skills that can allow groups to really come together in far different ways.\nWhat is the future of H1Z1?\nOur goal remains to have a massive world. We're doing that with Forgelight 2, which has been in development for quite a while now. We'll be able to show stuff to you soon, but needless to say we're super excited by what we're seeing. It's truly going to give us the 16,000 square kilometer world we've been waiting for. We want the world of H1Z1 to truly be a world. One where you can build your own cities and settlements, or take over one if you can hold it.\nWe want it to be a hostile world where the threats come not just from zombies and wildlife, but from other players as well.\nThis isn't a pipe dream. Everything we're building has been towards this goal. All the features we're adding are being added with an eye firmly on that goal.\nWe're adding more people to the team to accelerate our progress. We see the realities of the commercial world we live in, and it's too easy for Early Access games to go the way of many flavors of the month. We're in this for the long haul and we're putting the resources behind the game to make sure it's clear to you too. When we see other games come out and take the wind out of our sails sometimes it just makes us redouble our efforts. Don't think for a second we plan on laying down. Quite the opposite in fact. It inspires us to make our game better. That's not just rhetoric... we're trying our best to demonstrate it every week. We're not slowing down for a second.\nWe also have some exciting announcements coming soon about what we're going to be doing with Team BR (which is coming towards the end of the month). We see this as an important part of H1Z1 and we are doubling down on that too.\nPlease know this game means a lot to this team. We are trying to give you a lot of value for your money, and we hope you see that week after week the game improves. Not perfectly. Not without mistakes and bugs, but we're spending time trying to fix them and that effort will continue, as will the fight against the cheaters.\nWe now have 100% detection of most of the major cheats. We'll be turning on auto-banning and you can expect some new weapons to be unleashed in this war, making it harder if not impossible for them to return to the game, something that's long been a problem for PC games in general.\nJust wanted you to know we're running an ultra-marathon here and if you leave to go play another game, poke your head in a few weeks later and see what you see.\nCheers,\nSmed\n\nWhat is being scrapped/not implemented\nMap size increase (This has most people ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the most as it has been sold to us up until recently)\nAnti-Cheat.  They are still banning by hand after someone is reported enough or there are suspicious logs.  If you are having problems with hackers I suggest tweeting "The Great Mutato" who is a dev and he actively seeks out hackers and bans them based off reports.\n"Very significant improvements to base building are coming... including Guard towers, catwalks, 50 cal gun emplacements... windows.... and a whole lot more fun things. We're also going to be concentrating on making bases more secure and making the building process a lot easier."  The only thing true about this snippet is the guard towers.  Where the heck is my .50 cal!?\n"Also you can expect weather to come back in the near future. It's not on the roadmap because it's a larger task, but it's coming."  They have added some fog and rain/clouds but snow and other exciting weather systems are still not implemented.\n"We also have Professions coming later this month. Those are going to be a game changer because it's going to allow for more character development and a much more unique set of skills that can allow groups to really come together in far different ways."  Still not implemented but they do have plans for this.  There are 3 professions which have been made public."\nCheating is not improved but gotten worse.  After they do a massive banwave this improves for a few weeks and then the hackers take over again.  DO NOT buy this game to play survival if you cannot handle dealing with your base being exploited by noclippers/teleporters/etc.\n\nConclusion\nIf your main selling point for this game is BR, I think it very well could be an investment worthwhile.  I know this investment was worthwhile for me because I knew going into this what it meant to be playing and testing an early access game.  I personally feel this has been abused to the point where I can no longer support this company or title. On that point, some of my FAVORITE gaming moments have come from this game and I have been gaming for 20+ years.  Hope this helps you make your decision!\n\nLaidback\ntl:dr Daybreak formerly SoE has done a TERRIBLE job communicating with their customers and have led them to believe many things will be implemented which have now been scrapped with no plans to implement them in the future.\n\n-edits were typos and some opinions/statements added to the intro.","September 8, 2015","false","169.5"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","49","58","6","0"

Yes, they do offer an advantage but air drops are LOUD as hell, they can be heard from a long distance. Also, you see the crate dropping so you can go to it. And lastly, it does not garuntee good items. You can get absolute crap. And did I mention that air drops only go around the player's proximity and not next to them? To be honest when you do an air drop you are just paying for a server event to happen. Air drops are not GARUNTEED to the buyer, they actually have to go to it and any player near the area could be able to go to it and snatch it.\n\nNow we got that out of the way, lets actually talk about the server issues and what not. So it seems that any online only game has a terrible first day *COUGH* DIABLO III *COUGH* SIM CITY *COUGH* ANY WOW EXPANSION. And this game isn't anything special, the first 2 days were riddled with server issues and constant crashing, but SOE has done a great job in bug fixing and getting the game up. So far, the servers seem to have been fixed and they're running very smooth. The lag seems to be kept to a medium/low level and I think the game is very playable.\n\nLet's Compare this game to DayZ, the godfather of Zombie Survival games.\n\nDayZ :\nThe Bad\n\nZombies noclip through walls (Although they kinda fixed it, it still happens sometimes)\nSpontaneous Leg Combustion (Your legs break as if they were made of glass)\nPerformance Issues (Game is laggy, you need a NASA super computer to run it at 60 FPS)\nGlitches (Teleporting through walls, ladders of death, inventory not picking items up, etc...)\nWalking Simulator 2014 (Make sure you have patience)\nClunky Melee System (Play to find out)\nSLOW ♥♥♥ DEVELOPMENT (Yes, I know the DayZ team is not the size of SOE but it's been a year and Dayz hasn't really gotten any major updates other than the ONE new car they added and hunting.)\nCrafting is annoying (You sometimes have to drop the item to craft it and sometimes the earth swallows your item.)\nItems sometimes dissapear when you drop them (read above)\n\nDayZ:\nThe Good\n\nVERY Immersive (Whenever I play DayZ I always feel like i'm actually in a survival situation.\nGigantic Map (Chernarus is f***ing huge)\nBeautiful Scenery (The game may have performance issues but it does look pretty at max settings)\nRealistic Actions (You actually see your character do his/her actions like drinking, bandaging, etc...)\nIntense Fights (When you get in a firefight in DayZ, your adrenaline will start to surge.)\nMore items to loot (DayZ has many more items than H1Z1)\nCharacter Customization (It's limited but at least it exists. H1Z1 will get a character customization feature down the road.)\nGood inventory System (Works decently)\n\nNow let's talk about H1Z1\n\nH1Z1 :\nThe Bad\n\nBarely Any Loot Spawns (SOE said they are fixing it but it is pretty annoying) *THIS HAS BEEN FIXED SINCE THE REVIEW\nMap is small (Well, it's a decent map but no where near the size of Chernarus)\nThe way zombies aggro is weird (Sometimes you wan walk by them and nothing happens other times they will go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)\nNot as immersive as DayZ (This is kinda of a subjective one but I just dont get that same survival feeling as DayZ)\nUnrealistic Actions (Instead of actually drinking water and stuff like that, you just watch a circle with a cooldown.)\nNo character Customization (Yet, it was announced though)\n\nH1Z1 :\nThe Good\n\nCARS! (Yes, DayZ has A car, but it's a piece of ♥♥♥♥. And did I mention it took them a YEAR to add it?)\nNo known performance issues (I have great FPS and it runs smoother than DayZ!)\nNot many glitches (I haven't teleported through walls yet, so that's good. But I have experienced some minor glitches.)\nAmazing Inventory System (Very easy to use and fast)\nCrafting/Discovering is fun!\nOkay Melee System (Better than DayZ that's all I can say.)\nYOU CAN BUILD SHELTERS/BASES! (They are basically like the ones from Rust)\nHunting (I know DayZ has hunting but it was added much later since the release.)\nVery Intuitive Inventory System (Very fast and easy to use! Better than the DayZ one IMO)\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nI think for $19.99 (Plus taxarino) you get a really great game. Sure, it had a shakey launch but it's a very fun game. As a person that has been playing DayZ Since the mod, I have to say that this game has potential. It already has vehicles, runs great performance wise, and the development team seems to be very passionate. I would recommend this game over DayZ any day, DayZ may have more items and a bigger map, but at least in this game your character can't magically die by going through a wall, which has been an issue since the DayZ mod. SOE seems like they really want this game to be something and I am willing to support them.

Some of you will argue, and that is fine. You have a right to your own opinion. Neither mine or yours is right, but I am still allowed to have mine and you can have yours. Insults or telling me I don't know anything just proves how small minded you are and how little you know of me and my Background in the gaming community.\n\n\nGood Luck, Have Fun, and remember everyone has a right to an opinion. Just because you disagree with it does not mean it is wrong. We all have our ideas of what we want in a game......we all have different tastes in games.\n\nEDIT: Side note.... Over the life time of 7 Days to Die a little over 2600 Negative reviewes. For H1Z1 on the first day for negative reviews a little over 2300.\nLoL wow\n\nEDIT (pt 2): I do not usually remove or delete repsonses... however if you feel the apt to insult or call names. Or tell me I don't know anything, then I will simply do so. You have your right to an opinion just as I do mine, but don't sit there and try to insult me to make yourself think your right.\n\nEDIT (pt3): I love how people ONLY mention the airdrops and tell me it has been fixed, the other problem.  crates, those get dropped right in front of you. Cost more, less chance of something better but still pay to win. Crates & Airdrops are 2 different purchables.\nThey aren't selling guns or things like they directly, ok they put it in a box??....NICE!!! So they wrapped it up for you like a present! XD (In a box or in a  bag, makes no difference you are still paying for the win)","January 16, 2015","false","37.9"," 1,585 of 2,524 people (63%) found this review helpful 195 people found this review funny","63","585","2","195","40"

Probably not. Not at this stage at least\n\nLet me explain, and why I decided to give it a try.\n\nI saw a queue suggestion on my steam account about the H1Z1 Early Access.  I watched a game play trailer, and read several reviews by other players who were currently playing the game.\n\nI read the disclaimer about how the game was in development, and changes were very frequent, and that it was early alpha stages.\n\nHowever, I never really understood what the designers “Intent” for the game was.  Based on the game play trailer and some other player reviews, I understood the game to be a survival based game set in a zombie apocalypse.  What really drew me to the game was reviews about the crafting nature of the survival side of this.  (EDIT:  I should mention here, that i'm new to the survival Genra, i've never really been drawn to this area before)\n\nThe price was right, and jumped in feet first into a premium account.  The first couple weeks of game play was exactly what I expected.  Allot of fun, some minor issues with bugs and client crashes and a world littered with players exploiting in game mechanics.  I get that.  It’s alpha, very early stages.\n\nWhat has really soured me over the course of the last few days, are the changes to loot, and scavenging.  Sure I suspect some things are not working quite right (EDIT: Confirmed by developers they are working on loot issues), but the part that has really soured me, is the communities response.\n\nOn reddit over the weekend, many users begain to report issues with broken loot, and in most of these posts, other players would respond with the following\n\nIt’s working as intended\nIt’s not supposed to be easy\nIt’s not a shooter\nGuns are supposed to be rare.\n\nWell that got me wondering, really?  Because that wasn’t the impression I got from the game play trailer.  In fact watching the trailer again, is shows players banding together to fight off zombies with MOSTLY guns.  In 2 scenes, it shows a player with a bow.\n\nNow I can look past the unfinished aspect of many of the games systems.  Base Building has a long way to go.  Zombies have a long way to go.  Crafting has a long way to go.  PVP is a KOS fest.\nBut the fundamental design concept of super rare loot, in an environment that offers no in game protection of loot once acquired, has really soured me.\n\nI don’t mind starting from nothing.  I don’t mind incremental progress that could all be lost.  But what I don’t see being fun, is scouring the country side for hours looking for mats to cobble together some very basic items, only to have said items taken once I logout.\n\nIf LOOT is going to be so RARE that it encourages taking from other players over from the environment, I just don’t see that as something I wish to play. (EDIT: I want to clarify here.  IF your idea of PVP is reswapn, craft a crude bow, spear, hatchet, knife, hunt down other players for loot, die, rinse repeat.  then this game is for you.  I dont see any fun in that.)\n\nIn the state the game is currently in, and based on what the devs have tweeted and what players who have been following this game since before EA have said, it’s becoming clear that the intended game design, does NOT match up with the game play trailer I watched.\n\nSo all I offer here, is a suggestion for other players who might be considering this game.  Please do some more research into the intended game design before making any decision.  Because I don’t think what is being marketed right now, really matches up with, what is being developed.\n\n\nEDIT\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nLet me clarify a few points people are making.\n\nI have no problem what so ever with PVP, i enjoy PVP.  but i DON't enjoy PVP if i'm spending the BULK of my time trying to find items to be competitive with, to in fact PVP.\n\nmy Main point about rarity of guns is this.    IF they are so rare as to make them have MAJOR value, that encourges hackers to steal from storage containers, there is no chance for real world PVP to develope.  it's just a spawn kos fest.  HOW much fun can it be to pvp with chars that are litterly 20 mins old.\n\nrespawn, make a bow, hope for scrap metal, make a spear, go pvp,\n\nrinse repeat.\n\ndid i even mention a gun there?   3-4 days ago loot got so bad as it wasn't just GUNS that were missing, it was actually difficult to find your first few scraps of METAL after a respawn.\n\nclearly loot is not working correctly, the developers have since posted to that, again if you read the review, i said my problem wasn't with the game or the developers.  it was with other people playing the game who WANT loot to be this way.\n\nThey think it makes the game HARD, and they like to stroke there ego by thinking they are HARDCORE.\n\nit's an alpha game, nothing about it is going to be HARDCORE yet  get over yourselfs =D.\n\nmy review was my way of just informing others that they MAY want to do a bit more research on the game than just a casual glance.\n\nthe developers still haven't posted the ROADMAP, nobody knows what the design goals even are at this point.\n\ni was willing to give SOE the benefit of the doubt, but now i'm not so sure.\n\nnow regarding pvp ♥♥♥♥♥ comment.\n\ni've been playing FPS Shooters since the early days of Doom2, i ran a BBS out of my bedroom with 4 modems so me and friends could play deathmatches.  I loved pvp in ultima online.  i've played every freaking game you can imagine in the last 25-30 years.\n\nI"M pretty sick of PVP.  it gets freaking OLD.","February 10, 2015","false","246.4"," 653 of 1,035 people (63%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","63","653","1","65","57"

The game is pretty fun but the main focus of the game being survival is plagued by bad decisions by the developers such as having to constantly update the amount of loot in the game as at one point there was too little which was combated with too much. The survival is completely overridden with Hackers and Cheaters which ruin the fun of the gameplay even though the gameplay and survival aspect has a lot of potential. Currently, most of the games population play Battle Royal which is repetitive and boring after a few games. The developers decided to try and cash out on the game aswell by introducing an unboxing system, similar to valve games such as CS:GO and TF2.

I enjoyed several hours of fun scavenging through zombie filled towns for  loot with the random person here and there. Many were friendly and some would introduce themselves with an arrow to the back of the head. This of course is what makes the game fun. There is danger around every turn and you never know what you will run into next. Loot has been a problem in this game since much of the places seems devoid of any useful items and finding the right materials to craft any weapon better then the starter bow can be difficult. This is a gripe that the devs are working on and shouldn't be held against this game too harshly. However, the reason I would NOT recommend this game is for the fact that Sony cannot deal with hackers on servers they themselves run. This is very similar to Rusts earlier versions that were full of more hackers then regular players. Nothing takes the joy out of a game more then spending hours and I mean HOURS of scrounging for loot only to have it ripped away from you by a teleporting gun toting hacker. Come on man how can you be sure it was a hacker and you're not just a huge nub? Great question! I know because I saw him fly down the street and through the wall to appear clipped through the cover I was hiding behind to put a pistol in my mouth.\n\nBottom line: Game is fun, environment is interesting, hacking is rampant.

They don't understand why the sandbox survival series became popular and how to emulate it.  We all know that this game (and many others) were popular thanks to rocket making DayZ.  I don't mind people trying to emulate it, the games are really fun. But SOE completely dropped the ball on this one and did not understand one bit of what made DayZ so popular.\n\nIn a harsh survival sandbox, the fun of the game comes from how brutal it is and how close to real life it emulates in a hypothetical situation/enviornment.  The immersion comes from the fact that the games mechanics come very close to portraying how real life would play out in a made-up scenario.  This is where h1z1 falls flat.  Being able to buy your survival completely destroys the atmosphere and realism for the vast majority of players.  SOE explicitly said they would not do this and -lied- to their loyal fanbase.  Im sorry SOE, you cannot rationalize airdrops NOT being pay-to-win, especially in a game where the fun comes from trying to aquire those items in a brutal enviornment.\n\nIt truly blows my mind that virtually everyone EXCEPT the developers understand what constitutes pay-to-win.  If I had known this prior, I would not of purchased this game.  I would of happily paid $60 + tax for this game had it not had this incredibly stupid feature.  Pay-to-win is dumb in any game, but in a survival game it completely destroyes the entire point of playing.","January 15, 2015","false","54.3"," 159 of 246 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","159","246","8","4"

H1Z1 has become a cash grab instead of developing a fun game to play.\n\nThis review is from the perspective of someone who LOVED DayZ Mod Epoch and was hoping that H1Z1 would be it's natural successor.  DayZ Mod Epoch was a LOT of fun and we played it for years.  Towards the end the gameplay got kinda stale and the server lag when 40-50 players were in, put us on the search for a new game.\n\nFirst 4 Months of Development:\nIn comes H1Z1 with TONS of hype.  The developers actually TALKED to the community, LISTENED, and IMPLEMENTED the things the community wanted.  Quite literally on a weekly basis there was something new, and I could see TONS of ideas from their Reddit Community being implemented.  That awesome period went on for about 4 months while H1Z1 was owned by SOE (Sony Online Entertainment).  Sure there were bugs, sure there were problems, but the positives FAR outweighed the drawbacks.\n\nAfter the First 4 Months:\nThen comes the evil money hungry venture capitalist firm Columbus Nova.  They purchased SOE and renamed it DBG (Daybreak Games).  That's when the trouble began.  Content slowed down significantly.  When the new content did come, it was full of game breaking bugs, most of it not even related to the new content (so they'd add a new gun type, and break the ability to fill water bottles, wtf really how are those two things even related in the code?).  The focus of the game shifted from GOOD CONTENT to MAKING MONEY.  Skins, tournaments, game sales, nerfing their steam marketplace, etc, etc ,etc.  It's gotten to the point where it seems game development seems to reside 75%+ on making money, and 25% or less on making the customers happy with cool new content.\n\nDayZ Mod Epoch was epic, and we loved it.  H1Z1 was epic, and now we don't play it anymore.","November 5, 2015","false","873.8"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","41","51","2","0"

İlk başlarda büyük ölçüde bazı buglar vardı. Bu buglar yüzünden oyuna kötü yorumlar yapılmaya başladı. Ama bu buglar o gece içinde çözüldü. Oyun ilk çıktığı günden itibaren kaç aydır uğraşılan diğer survival oyunlarına fark atıyor. En büyük özelliklerinden biriside oyunda daha erken erişim aşamasında, araç eklenmiş. Hemde hiçbir hatası yok. Crafting özelliği zaten oyuna ayrı bir zevk katıyor. Sony ekibi gayet başarılı bir çalışma yapmış ve yapmayada devam ediyor. İlk 2-3 gün büyük hataları düzelttiler. Şuan oyunda öyle hata var diyebileceğimiz çok bişey yok. Yakında avrupa sunucularıda açılacakmış. Erken erişimde bu kadar fiyat verilmez diyenler oldu bu fiyat , bu oyuna gayet normal bence Sony gerçekten sağlam çalışma yapmış.

In the beginning, there were some bugs greatly. Started making nasty comments to the game because of this bug. But these bugs were resolved in that night. The game is several months since it was first released to the deal taking notice other survival game. One of the largest properties in the access at an early stage in the game, means added. And no mistake. Crafting feature already adds a pleasure to play. Sony team has done a very successful work and continue yapmayada. The first 2-3 days were correct major errors. Currently there are no errors in the game so much I can say. Servers gonna soon be opened in Europe. Early access so I can not say who the price was given this price, I think this game has done quite normal Sony really solid work.

I dont think it's even possible to count the hackers on this game. Just got done playing with my buddy and we were in our base, 5 minutes later someone its shooting us with a sniper from the ouside, he just so happens to know there are people in this base and where tha base is. Then another one just No-Clips through the walls and kills me and my friend and ends up taking everything. We switched from 7 diffrent servers in hopes to evoid hackers or to find that one hacker free server... but NOPE hackers are everywhere. Sony doesnt know what to do about this, they act like they are fixing it when they are not. They just aded a Boradcasting system that says when someone gets banned...

The ♥♥♥♥ing DEV's and I'm sorry to say this are ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to survival. IF you want to play this game your buying it for the battle-royal aspect, this "Sony" company that is a multi-billion dollar industry can't have active devs to sit on a server and ban the blatant cheaters that decide to ruin the real players who want to play the survival aspect of the game. It's almost sad seeing another good game with such good qualitys slowly degrading to waste because the deveolpers of the game want to focus on other matters and not what is part of there crucial player base. The main reason why I am writing this report is because of cheaters on the most populated server (Abomonation) just roam around speed hacking, or possibly flying around for countless hours with any punishment. It amazes me how such a big company can't put together there smart "brains" and counter this issue that is effecting so many people. Battle Royal 9/10. Survival -9/10.

You cant connect foundations and people can walk through your doors and walls without opening them to steal your items.\n- there is no support for clans, so unless your group is small, you cannot get any functionality in game to help you with your group\n- Public survival servers are unplayable because there are tons of hackers and daybreak thinks that by banning half a dozen every day they will eliminate them. Its a joke because they only want to ban lightly, so people just buy again and keep going.\n- Some bases are invulnerable due to glitches\n- you lose ownership of your doors after two weeks, this is a glitch\n- each update contains the same thing just painted different colors.\n- They always update ways to cash in on microtransactions but dont try to fix the game. Instead of fixing any of these bugs, they just release a new crate for skins people can purchase\n- cars disappear or explode for no reason\n- there is consistent desync. That means you will see something differently than the guy standing next to you\n\nI could go on and on. Avoid this game. They abandoned the community, removed the roadmaps, gave up on survival mode, and battle royale is only entertaining for a few matches before it gets too repetitive.\n\nUntil they can solve all of these problems and get rid of hackers, they should let players run their own servers. Since that isnt happening, save your money for a game with devs who are more active","November 6, 2015","false","234.4"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","0"

The updates were coming in pretty steadily earlier in the year, and into the summer.. THEN, it ALL changed! It went from new items, survival bug fixes, crafting updates into BR fix this, BR fix that, ect..\n\nI'm truely sad at how this game has fallen apart, and turned into nothing more than a mediocre multi player shooter game. It had amazing potential as a zombie survival game. Now, it's just plain boring. Base building isn't horrible, but it isn't amazing either. Just before summer they threw in some pretty cool base building parts, but they were still pretty buggy. They never got fixed, like many many other survival things, and the whole focus just went to BR.\n\nIf any developers are listening, know that you still have a chance to FIX this and make the game great again! But the ball is in their court... We shall see what happens. BUT at this time, I highly reccomend not spending your money here. Hurtworld is sooooo much better even in it's early stage as a pure survival game. Go there for now.

The Lone Wolf roaming a post zombie apocalyps society, Sure I was surprised at first that it was online multiplayer only. I totally missed that, but that's my fault, how bad can it be. Heck, I even got my gf an account so she could play by my side since she's really into the zombie genre.\n\nI started on a PvP server, but given that everyone kills you on sight, it's really tough to be a complete newbie at the game. The game seems to be suffering from an insane amount of cheaters as well, so that kinda ruins it.\nSo I switched to a PvE server. I ran around, killed some wolves (there are way too many wolves around). If I met the rare zombie in this zombie survival game, I kinda liked it, it was doable, you could outrun them if needed, but for the sake of eexperience me (and my gf) always tried to clear areas before we searched for loot.\n\nWith recent patches the zombies became faster, and do a lot more damage. This kind of made this game feel more like a 3rd person/Ast person shooter instead of the survival game it was when I bought it. Some zombies have gotten some (non-original) tweaks/mutations, like screaming to immobilize you, a toxic gas cloud when you shoot them, they explode etc. Pretty much the same old from a lot of zombie shooters.\n\nBut the absolute low of the game comes from what they call "griefing". By building bases on specific points on the map the other players can deny you access to certain points on the map. Which is really insane, because you kind of want to play the game right. And when asked on reddit, the most common reaction is "It's a sandbox game, so everything is allowed". This totally killed my game experience. I've played it for 170 hours at the moment of writing this, and there are parts of the map that I have only seen once at most, just because other players deny you access.\n\nTo make things worse, in PvE there is nothing you can do against "hoarding" all the vehicles. So basicly players lock up all the cars in the game, and since in player vs enemy your structures are kept safe from harm, no other player can actually do something about it. So all in all, 170 hours in and I still don't have a car, on a server where in all the hours played, I ran into max. 10 different players over the course of it all.\n\nUnfortunatly I payed for the game, so the joke's on me. Don't make the same mistake I did. Move along. I'm pretty sure there are better games in this genre.","March 18","false","357.5"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","0"

Yes I have tried DayZ/Rust/WarZ and a couple others, but this is really the one game in the end that I think is really going to actually do it. Wtf am I talking about? These things:\n\nPros (compared to DayZ/Rust/WarZ):\nPlanetSide 2 Engine (supporting thousands of players a server.)\nBase Building (Rust is the one game that does it good as well.)\nExtensive Crafting (other games may have that, but can you even make moonshine in them? Don't think so.)\n90% of players are friendly. One instance me and 20 other randoms started a village. (this may or may not change in the future.)\nGreat Framerate. (Sup DayZ?)\nReally fast updates and developers being transparant about the games development.\nThose are just the few good things I can think of right now... of course there are the bad things which  DO  include stuff that will be most likely be fixed due to the game's short development and being in early access:\n\nZombies don't seem like a threat at all ATM (this is a problem shared between this and the other games. Although H1Z1's zombies are the best with them actually grouping up and trapping you in the buildings if you stay long enough).\nFloating arrows. Floating arrows everywhere.\nLoot seems weird. It does really feel like a realistic apocolypse when I get excited to even find a can of food. So this could be a pro or a con really.\nCan't change key bindings.\nOne thing I want to say is that when the game was out on day one a lot of people were screaming "P2W! WTF REFUND!?!1?! GAME IS SCAM KK" and stuff like that. I personally did not think it was P2W as every air drop I went to had at least 5 people running around cave man style punching anything and everything just to get at the crate. Now they did update the air drops and people seemed to be happier with it. You basically pay money for a small chance at whatever happens to be in that crate with whatever amount of people who decide to run to it as well and take it for themselves.\n\nAll in all. If you're looking to buy this after having played DayZ/Rust/WarZ and everything else, then I recommend it. I did and I'm very happy with it.

All servers are filled with hackers. Everyone kills you in PVP no questions asked, that gets old real fast. Don't bother looking for anything in PVP, you won't ever get hungry or thursty enough to drink or eat. No need to craft in PVP either. PVE is a ghost town. They need to add something to do in PVE. Guns  are pointless, you never use them because you don't want to draw attention, then you realize there is nothing to draw attention too if you are in PVE. Bows are pointless too, use a lot of space. Using a knife works the best, its light and bandages can be made very easily. Make a bunch of bandages. There might be zombies in the game, you see them once in a while. I never saw a point to building bases. No point in having a base to store your items when hackers can get in and you can find everything by scavanging fairly quickly so I scavange all the time. There is no point to the game, just scavange, there is not a lot to do to be honest.  It won't take very long to fill your inventory with water and food to last days and you just kind of stand there like, "now what?" Nothing, thats it. At the end of the day, it is a boring game. Battle Royal is the only thing going for it, other than that, such a waste of money. Wait until it is free.

You will work for days to gather and build, but all that work can and will be destroyed in a matter of seconds to a hacker. Most of the time they can fly, teleport, walk through walls, ESP, Aimbot, and have super speed. There is nothing you can do but take it in the butt until they tire of trolling u which will never happen. Most of them are Asian too which would be a simple fix to region lock servers, or even set ping limits. But we are forced to get pounded in the rear by people on the other side of the world, who only inspire more people to cheat because the game is at a point where its required. I will keep my fingers crossed for more effective anti cheat, but for play ability  in its current state 1/10. Game content and frequent updates 9/10. Solve the hacker issue and you will actually have a game people can play.\n\n\nUpdate 5/29/2016\n\nMany of the past issues regarding your base being raided have been solved. You now need to blow through gates and doors before accessing someones loot chests. This is a plus.\n\nHowever there are still plenty of hackers out there probably more than you think. Most will simply use ESP aka wall hacks to see where people are. This is much harder to be detected by anticheat and is unlikely to ever stop being a problem. You will also see an occasional troll hacker fly by or doin stupid ♥♥♥♥ though.\n\nWorst of all after making their game two different versions and charing $20 each for them, They still microtransaction the ♥♥♥♥ outta you. You cant even trade or sell the skins on the market anymore either. Only way to get the newer skins is to pay $2.50!! a crate. At least CSGO allows you to sell or buy them like wtf. Just really milkin it huh guys.\n\nOh and there is still only 4 primary weapons in the game which makes looting pretty boring picking up the same ♥♥♥♥ constantly. Most of which is useless stuff which must be broken down or thrown away.\n\nZombies are still broken as hell, most of them get stuck and dont move.

It is 100% Kill-On-Sight.  There are no community events, there are no player interactions (other than shoot or be shot) and the zombies are a joke.  They are lumbering and are absolutely no threat to anybody.  This leads to absolutely no cooperation to take down a target other than another person and people are too busy killing fresh spawns to actually do anything enjoyable.\n\nAlso, the PvP gamemode "Battle Royal" is a joke.  It's a poor man's Call of Duty with terrible gunplay and a very, very slow playstyle where you will place top 10 just by sitting in a bush and waiting.  That's it.  You never have to fire a single bullet.  I got first place in my third match and I didn't fire a single bullet until I killed the guy in second place.  That is not a joke.\n\nI do not recommend this game to anybody.  I forced myself to get about 30 hours of gameplay just to make my $20 purchase easier to swallow.

It is fun at first, you will enjoy it, but there are many things wrong with it.\n\nAlso, please keep in mind while reading this that the game has been out for nearly a year.\n\nBiggest issues I have:\n-Cheaters. On average, I encounter a cheater in one out of every 3 games. In certain Battle Royale types that offer rewards, like Green Dawn, they are in excess.\n\n-Connection stability. There are numerous causes for crashes in game, and many of them have yet to be fixed. I crash one out of every 4 games, on average. To make it worse, after the game crashes, steam still thinks the game is open, so I have to restart my steam client. These crashes have survived patch after patch.\n\n-Teamers. This does seem like a great added survival aspect in Battle Royal, but there is nothing more upsetting than coming across a team of 3 in Battle Royale that you have no chance against. Also, in Green Dawn, people team an extreme amount, simply for the rewards.\n\n-Game balance. Of course, it is difficult to balance a game, but that's why you test with patches and keep trying to improve, right? Well, Daybreak apparently doesn't think so. The AK-47 is the most powerful gun in a fight, and it doesn't matter how fast or accurate you are with the other guns. If the other person has an AK-47, you lose. It has less recoil than the semi-automatic AR15, and can be tapped at a certain frequency to fire even faster than a fully-automatic rate. In the months it has been out, there has been little work done to it.\n\n-The community. You all are great people, I'm sure, but almost every single person who kills me / I kill is completely toxic. If you don't believe me, go find a youtube video of the pre-lobby for battle royale.\n\nInstead of fixing all these things, Daybreak has opted to host tourneys and merchandizing their game that is still stuck in alpha. They even considered making battle-royale pay to play, despite the incompleteness of their product.\n\nDo not buy this game, for the sole reason of showing Daybreak that actually finishing the game should be a priority over marketing it.\n","November 22, 2015","false","415.6"," 48 of 68 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","48","68","4","0"

The game is full of bugs, hackers , cheaters and teamers who team up in a solo competitive environment ruining the fun. Their latest "masterpiece" is a game mode called Green Dawn wich is a solo Battle Royale mode, but everytime you end up dying from people teaming up in order to win the skin prizes making it very hard to win.\n\nThe only reason the game is "early access" is that they have an excuse for not fixing the bugs. I don't think this game will  get out of early access anytime soon , since they are already selling it and grabbing money from skins.\n\n\nP.S Survival mode is garbage","December 1, 2015","false","326.0"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

Seemingly endless forests, abandoned fields, and deserted towns make up the huge world of H1Z1. This environment is incredibly immersive with a day/night system and changing weather. The gameplay is as realistic and unforgiving as it gets and there is a great crafting system with tons of items to create. Hunger and thirst are deadlier than zombies in this game, but other players seeking to steal your hard-earned supplies and weapons are no doubt the foremost danger. It is this simple fact that makes this game so amazing. Interactions with other players are always unique, to say the least, and that makes every time you log-in a different experience. While playing solo can be fun, I recommend playing with a friend(s) or looking for a buddy to play with. Playing in a group just adds so much depth to the game and having some team-mates to watch your back will definitely come in handy when ♥♥♥♥ inevitably hits the fan. Keep in mind that you will more than likely run into a few annoying bugs as the game is still in development. However, I haven't experienced anything game-breaking and like I said before, it is consistently updated. Overall, H1Z1 is an amazing game in the making and if you enjoy zombies and survival, you have to check it out!","January 19, 2015","true","253.2"," 209 of 344 people (61%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","61","209","344","18","0"

I had hope that one day it would become the amazing zombie survival game we've all been looking for. So many months.. so many empty promises. I finally give up. This has become a cash grab for daybreak games. All they care about are streamers who play battle royale and their rehashed clothing in the crates you have to pay to open. On top of that, you can no longer sell your unwanted skins on the marketplace because they want to be the only ones making money.  Bugs pop up, they fix it for two weeks, then they fix something else and the old bugs come back. Building is still stale and boring. Hackers are all over the place and nothing keeps them from returning with new accounts over and over again.

There is also no point in building a base since hackers get by all the safeguards in the game such as locked doors. All they do is set in their cheat program (tmcheats) a smaller teleport jump instead of jumping across the map.

I can't because the servers are down or I get the G29 error or I get my face hacked right off by a hacker-low-life-scum with nothing better to do then grief honest players by walking through the walls aimbotting, and teleporting around. Yep, I get it, this is early access...but I've given enough hours to this game to understand exactly how it's improved or regressed in the past year.\n\nImprovements Section: Now remember this is based on improvements since a year ago, not an overall evaulation in this section.\n\nBattle Royal- (If you literally have no other fps or 3ps to play) for some strange reason DayBreak decided to spend endless hours on this mode instead of focusing on Survival Mode which is what the game was originally intended to be.\n\nCrafting- Crafting has improved dramatically, much easier to use pretty straight forward, and lots of different items to craft.\n\nBase Protection and Management - This is just a recent patch that really improved these issues, but until the last patch you couldn't protect your base from hackers just walking through your walls and stealing all your hard earned items out of your containers. NOW there is a permission system, that allows the creator of the base foundation to give permission to whomever he wants to be able to use items in the base, build or destroy. Very handy to stop hack looters, if you don't have permission you can't do squat to the inside of the base until the CLOSED gates of the base have been destroyed. So, basically look at it like this as long as your base is complete no holes or gaps and your gates are in the closed position your base can't be messed with until your gates are destroyed or left open.\n\nNow that VERY short list of improvements are the major bullet points for the year, maybe there are a few other things I didn't list but that's okay. You get the point that there weren't many.\n\nRegression/Stagnant Section: Honestly I don't even no where to begin on this section. The list is long, so I'll just cover the major issues.\n\nHacking- UPDATED: 1/14/16 Battleye is complete trash. Same amount of hacking going on as pre-Battleye. Words of wisdom on this, don't be surprised if you get killed by an aimbotter or hacker jumper (can basically fly).\n\nBase Building- Now I did mention base related improvements in that nice section up top ^^^^ but, I want to address the unprecedented amout of bases and mega bases all over the map. It's just ridiculous, any person can create any amount of bases if they have enough materials. So for instance cities with lots of loot, are covered in giant bases that fill the streets and roof tops making it nearly impossible to venture there without dying instantly. Not to mention a lot players have giant groups of people they play with, good luck if you are 1 person or just a few people playing together. You can't compete with that. If you are a person with a large group of friends then this game is for you. Honestly, the number of bases one person can build needs to be limited. Once the game is officially and supposedly out of early access there won't be server and player wipes often or if at all. So there will be an entire map filled with decaying bases. Yippeee! Fun!\n\nCombat System- Honestly I hate this, the third person view while trying to fight enemies is a joke. You can't tell when rocks, walls, cars or anything like that is in your line of sight while shooting a gun. You think you are shooting over it or around it, but nope you sure aren't. Then you take a bullet to head because you couldn't see that you were shooting the hindrance in front of you. Just the combat system in general is no good. I feel like everything is on a delay, or you are covered in glue unable to maneuver as you might think. Really, the combat system from ISS (WarZ, War Inc.) is much better. That's the only time I'm going to reference that game, I swear. As far as melee combat, jeeez I feel like that is a cluster ****, you can swing 3 times at an enemy or zombie and you will miss. Somehow your weapon will go right through them and meanwhile you get killed. MAYBE, this is lag... but I doubt it.\n\nThe Map- Well we were lied to, ALOT. All SOE/DayBreak said and still continues to say was that this map would continue to grow in size with each new update they would add on to the map, blah blah blah. Well since release, they've added very few things. Like the hospital, some police stations, and the military base as a few minor examples. NOT once has the map increased in size. And again, I'm not saying the things they have added are bad. I'm just pointing out that, they have not done what they said they were going to do.\n\nVehicles- Well good luck, unless you are on a low population server you probably aren't gonna see many of these and if you do, you probably don't have the parts to use it. IF and this is a big IF, if you manage to acquire a vehicle and secure it in your base. Well it'll be gone shortly after you log off, so many things can destroy it. Hackers, gas grenades, arrows, uneven ground, the wind, farts, really anything and that's for the average joe. Now for the professionals who are F****** vehicle hoarders, they can build these giant bases that only hackers can get in, nothing else can destroy those vehicles because you can reach them. So if you are on a low population server, and can't find any vehicles you might have a vehicle hoarder on your hands.\n\nTime Consumption, Fun Factor, Making Friends and End Game - There is no easy way to put this, but once you have a fully functional base there is nothing left to do. It takes maybe 15 hours depending on the number of people playing with you to build a complete base. The only thing left to do is go find more of the same thing and kill people while you do it. Unless of course, you are not a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you like people then your end game is pretty much finished. It's fun until then, and it can be time consuming but after around 30 hours you just look at your base and think well I'm bored now. There are no quests, no events, no rare things to collect no real reason to leave the comfort of your base. You can't trust people in the game, they'll stab you in the back and take your gear. So making new friends to extend your fun factor and game play are not likely.\n\nPVE Servers- LOL, why just why. If you did read the things above and find them atleast slightly interesting or intuitive then you will not find Player Vs Enviroment satisfying. OR you might be just perfect for this super boring mode for H1z1, nothing to do on this but build a base, loot, kill zombies... that's it. I mentioned no objectives, nothing to do what so ever. Who cares about this mode! I'm sure someone does, it's not me nor should it be for DayBreak.\n\nSo, after taking far too long to write this entire analysis on H1Z1, I will leave you with this piece of information. I did not cover all the pros and cons of this game, I just touched base on a few of each. So please feel free to dig in and learn more, but with all of that being said. With everything I've seen in the past year, I have to say this game is descending and plummeting into the Early Access abyss, which means it may never leave Early Access but they will still take your money and promise us the world. Why? Because so little has changed, so many things are virtually unchanged after an entire year has passed us by. I feel like so many excuses can be made for this game, but little warrant a valid excuse for such unexplainable lack of growth. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE ANGRY ALL THE TIME AND HATE YOURSELF! Choose wisely, because we have all seen how choosing poorly turned out. Cheers! -Speirs\n\nP.S.

Do you want to purchase this game?\n\n\n1. There's hackers. Every game has them when they start out. Play on a low-medium pop server and you will be fine (don't buy it for battle royale though....that ♥♥♥♥♥ bad) It will obviously be fixed eventually and people are constantly being banned. There aren't even THAT MUCH HACKERS. It's one of those games where people get outplayed and call them a hacker. Honestly, if a game like LoL even was 1% hackers we would be led to believe that 50% of the community are hackers. Face it, people are better than you. Quit your crying.\n\n2. It's alpha, but it's amazing. If the searching/building/surviving aspect of this game excites you, buy this game NOW. We have a couple problems i'll talk about that are currently game changing. Storing items. We have a little problem here that isn't gonna get fixed for a couple months at least. There is no way to keep your items safe 100% and your inventory space is limited. You have to find a place in the middle of no where (better be a damn good middle of nowhere) and hide all your ♥♥♥♥. ALL YOUR ♥♥♥♥. ALLLLLLL OF YOUR HOURS OF WORK IN ONE HIDDEN BUSH! why? because you're fixing to go search for scrap metal for the rest of your days, then more hours are stored in a hidden bush. If you hate starting over, leave NOW. There are constant server wipes. Base building is fun, but is a rough draft right now. We have premade stuff with not a lot of creativity. There is so much content in this game already and it's not even 1/10th of what's going to be added. Creating massive bases with hidden chests is not viable at the moment due to people being able to bomb your walls and jump in, there are no roofs currently. The map is very big which makes it hard for finding friends and getting to where you want to. They are going to make it a lot bigger.\n\nOverall this game is freaking amazing (can I cuss in a steam review?) and it's not even close to what they want it to be. I hate buying alphas but this was completely worth it. There are so many things to do all the time for weeks and months if you love the game. Oh, you want to quit? It's alright guys, in a month our game will be x2 as cool as before. I god damn love the team, I hope they don't give up on this game.","May 17, 2015","true","139.9"," 81 of 128 people (63%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","63","81","128","14","0"

AND I WILL OFFICALLY WAIT FOR IT TO BE FREE TO PLAY SINCE WE CAN GET REFUNDS TILL THE END OF THE WEEKEND!\n\nAfter noticing air drops is what makes this game a p2w type i quickly started to worry.  The people that spent 40 bucks on this game are the ones i deeply feel sorry for. Knowing that they were the ones to get scammed of the money for these so called crates, keys, event tickets, and a hat.. SERIOUSLY!! 40 bucks and you get a hat. 20 bucks doesnt get you a hat... FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! I SUPPORTED THIS GAME I SHOULD GET A HAT TO SHOW MY DEDICATION!!\n\nLINK FOR PROOF ITS PAY TO WIN\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCwapk30bDE#t=395\n\nPros\n1. buildings and objects nicely placed\n2. Map is nicely done\n3. YOU CAN DRIVE CARS take your spark plugs out or battery out so no one else can steal it\n4. Has a nice day/night system (just terrible animations)\n5. Almost every door is accessible\n6. You can hunt animals\n7. Items in every building. Dressers, tables, cars, garbage cans etc.\n8. Can take batterys and spark plugs out your car so NO ONE ELSE can drive it unless they have one of the following items\n9. chop trees down making you able to craft items\n\nPLEASE NOTE: SOME CONS ARE ALPHA BUGS THAT IM SURE WILL BE FIXED!! This applies for 2,3, and 4\n\nCons\n1. Pay 2 win...NO SUCH THING AS  A COSMETIC SHOP MORE LIKE BUY CRATES AND GET GUNS, AMMO, BACKPACKS, and MEDKITS\n2. Lags too much\n3. Your person gets stuck in one position causing you not able to do any actions\n4. Weight limit scale is messed up\n5. Pay 20 or 40 bucks for ALPHA EVEN THO the true game will be FREE TO PLAY\n6. Terrible launch date, couldnt join servers.\n7. Developer says "the problem will be fixed soon" after 6 hours it is fixed\n8. NO MENU SETTINGS! Your menu IS THE SERVER LIST! LAZY DEVELOPERS\n9. FREE TO PLAY NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OFF H1Z1 ON STEAM STORE UNTIL ITS RELEASE! False advertisment does make me wanna say "SOE this is the last game i will ever purchase from you"\n10. Theres about 12 different buildings. Every other building is literally a duplicate. the apartment complex is what gets me. all 4 floors are different 5th and 6th floor are blank nothing iin them. SO every other apartment complex you will go to 5th and 6th floor is always blank. nothing is there just a plain room.\n11. THE BIGGIEST DISAPPOINTMENT: NO MENU! Once you start game you are on a server list. I expected much more from SOE. Much more.. I understand this is a early access game but from a good company and a very well known one i expect a lot more.\n12. graphics are ♥♥♥♥\n13. AI zombies do NOT WORK\n14. YOu can drop or delete items you find! TROLLS AND FUTURE HACKERS WOULD LOVE THIS TACTIC.

At this point, I don't care which. The game has too many game breaking issues that make some of the most simple aspects of the game intolerable.\n\nA game that is designed with building in mind should not have flaws that prevent you from correcting a mistake you may have made yet this game has many.\n\nLoot, skins....seem like an after thought in the game. Cheap and cheesy. And again, too many flaws. Game breaking flaws.\n\nI have 1500 hours logged in this game. I have faithfully stood by this company "waiting" to see what "awesome" changes were to come over the past year and it is painfully obvious that someone high up on the food chain in the company absolutely isn't a gamer yet has the most power. The decisions being made at this point are screaming "We are a cash cow company and don't care if the game actually works correctly as long as we can make a lot of ♥♥♥♥ that people will buy, even if it doesn't improve the game."\n\nBattle Royale, now known as King of the Kill....is a great concept and could possibly be the highlight of this game if the Development team would pull their heads out of their asses and start working on the game breaking issues instead of things like exploding zombies....which do nothing to fix the game.\n\nHeads up for you Day Break....gamers game to have fun, not to struggle and be frustrated.\nMy money and time are valuable to me and I for one will no longer support your company with my time or money.\n\nAt this point, I seriously doubt your team even has what it takes to correct the issues....even if you took the next 5 years to try.","February 25","false","536.7"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","1"

After 2 hours of trying to join and play i thought about writing a negatiev review and asking my money back because of all the problems.But then i thought to my self '' I can't give up so easly and just give a negative review about this game because its on its second/third day of realese'' so i kept trying and trying to join a game.. and finally after 2.5 hours trying i joined a game and i started my survival adventure.I came across many people most of them were friendly but some weren't and tried to kill me or they DID kill me . I teamed up with 1 guy but then he got shot and died i had no contact with him anymore so i was alone again.. Then i met another dude that im playing with and its awesome to survive togheter.\n\nWell about the Pay 2 win thing...\nI don't think that the pay 2 win  did affect me in those 9 hours i played the game i have come across many people with guns but they did NOT have any ammo on them.\n\nWhen it comes to all the people that rate this game as negative. I think you should try to play the game more and then start rating it. I see many people rating this game negativ because of the launching problems or the p2w option but i dont think you have to look at those reviews if your considering to buy this game cause they just litterly wont help you out with buying this game.\n\nHere are some things i liked or disliked about this game:\n\n+Graphics ( In my opinion they are nice)\n+Crafting ( There is much crafting in the game)\n+Optimalization\n+Community ( Most of the people i came across were friendly)\n+Cars\n+Not many buggs\n\n- There has to be some more loot spawn rate in this game cause after a whole day playing i couldn't find any loot.\n- The zombies are some times a bit laggy or they are just standing around doing nothing.\n- 1 bug that really was annoying was that when i pressed E to pick something up the game lagged for a sec or more depends on how much times i clicked.\n\nWell i think that's it thanks for reading and stay Awesome !! :)\n\nPS...\nIf you consider to buy this game and you join a game ... Pick up all the black berries u can get.\n\nStarted to play..after some time...\nHad 0% energy and 0% thirst\nAte 50 berries..

You will spend 40+ hours in a few days playing PVP to get your base raided by a kid glitching with cheats and lose everything it took you hours to attain in seconds. The game is RIFE with hackers and cheaters, across ALL game modes: PvE, PvP, and BR. I have enough hours logged across all three to know. The game, at least across PvP and BR, if it isn't decided by hackers/cheaters, it's decided by the sheer number of people per team: if you decide to join a server with 2 or 3 friends, and there is already 10-20 kids playing together on that server, you lose; there is no point in playing on that server. You should not be able to dominate a server in any video game just by running around with 40 other random people, more than half of which are from Europe playing on US Servers (another problem).

The negative reviews come from people who played the game for a couple hours when it was released, raged at the flooded servers, the shortage of loot, and the airdrops, and immediately got a refund. The airdrops AT BEST give you mediocre gear. The best gear in the game comes from killing zombies, finding keys, and finding the corresponding loot cache on the map for the key. The gear you get from these far exceeds the quality anyone will get from an airdrop, as airdrops hardly even drop weapons anymore.\n\nPeople complaining about lack of ammo are the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on DayZ who camp Cherno. They are not concerned about the survival aspect of the game, they just want to get their fix of killing people. However, the lack of ammo in the game keeps encounters fairly civil, most of the time people you find will actually talk to you rather than attack you immediately. Sure, there are some bugs, but that can be expected coming from an early access game, and the most serious bugs have already been patched out in less than a week from release.\n\nBottom line - this game is definitely worth $20, that is all I have spent on the game and all I plan to spend. Compared to games like DayZ where vehicles are just now being implemented after so many years of development and still plagued by bugs and hackers, this game is incredible. I would say it takes the best qualities out of both DayZ and Rust, and I personally cannot wait to see where this game will be when it gets released.","January 20, 2015","true","968.8"," 131 of 219 people (60%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","60","131","219","17","0"

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."

My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

It generates random names and random ban messages for people to think the anti-cheat work. (confirmed several times) Players still aimbot, teleport, airstrike other regular players.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nORIGINAL FIRST REVIEW\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis game is officially pay to win. Devs lyied in streams and official announce that "We will NOT be selling Guns, Ammo, Food, Water... i.e. That's kind of the whole game and it would suck in our opinion if we did that." then they made AIRDROPS for real money plenty of guns and ammunitions. An early fail and an early crap. Thought DayZ was dead with H1Z1 ? Sony has fail on all points! Let's start with the CONS, and yes, THEY ARE CONS!\n\nCONS:\n* Airdrops with real cash contains Weapons/Ammo/Backpacks/Medecines etc..\n* Fail of the release "players brutalized our login server" Our fault ? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n* Error G99, Error G29, Client closing, Client crashing, etc..\n* No keybinds customizations\n* Animations of the character sucks\n* It's graphically UGLY, omg it's 2015 and this quality is BAD, so BAD..\n* No avatar customization, no gender, nothing...\n* Zombies hits you through walls\n* Zombies runs and hits you 10m behind you\n* Knockdown zombies continue to hit you\n* 10 headshots with hatchets don't kill zombies\n* 1 headshot with gun don't kill zombies\n* No loot respawn (if a player loot a city, you'll never find something)\n* Lags, lags and lags, even when you press "E" to interact, the client freeze\n* KoS, never expect to survive in PvP server, grab a weapon and kill them all\n* Servers are low capacity and run with queue system\n* Queue system is 10 mins wait on medium population, 2/3 hours on high population\n* Sounds are horrible (and royalty free for some of them)\n* Turn off music if you don't want your ears bleeding\n* Game content is poor, same objects again and again\n* House variations is poor, same house interior again and again\n* Flat map City (slackness of the mapper)\n* Don't expect to craft without a disconnection (even a simple campfire)\n* Force to open your inventory to craft, eat, drink, ♥♥♥♥, pee, whatever..\n* 19 euros for this ♥♥♥♥ is insulting\n* This game will be Pay to Win, yes sony said they will be no weapons/ammo for sale, but AIRDROPS that you can buy with real money contains GUNS, AMMO, etc.. sons of chickens SOE!\n\nPROS:\n* DayZ looks good now, even with all the bugs\n* Bears and rabbits\n\nConclusion: Sony has made what they are good for, a money game with a LOT of advertises to sell this crappy game. Like Planetside 2 and many other SOE games, you'll pay, more and more without a simple consideration has a human being. You DO NOT deserve to make video games. WE ARE NOT money and JUST money. This game is an early access, yes, but at this point of dev and all the advertise made around this game, you gonna refund MANY copies before you'll start making money. It's bad, really bad to see this kind of game. Independent studios make better games on Unity. From a big compagny like SOE, we should expect better than this early fail without any content and disrespecful lack of development. They just released they WILL sell guns and ammos, after taking our money for sure... it's SOE :)","January 16, 2015","false","137.6"," 40 of 59 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","40","59","2","4"

I hear the game is actually going to be free when it's released, and you're just testing it for $20 so I ask you, why waste your $20 in funding a game you'll later play for free?\n\n2. The in game chat feature needs a few fixes, one being the voice distance, it's great however it's a dead give away you and another friend or random player are conversing when your name appears with a mic symbol on the side of any players screen within range further than the ability to actually hear the player. This gives anyone ample time to run and hide if they want to gank you or hide from you and log out.\n\n3. Vehicles, Why have these always been the #1 problem with every f-ing zombie apocalypse game? DAYZ anyone with a car gets shot there is no friendly. H1Z1 is entirely the same way, however the worse part is when you finally find the pieces to fix up a vehicle, either you're horded by zombies or players, OR and this is the kicker, you drive it and somehow the vehicle flips over... randomly...even the smallest bump has flipped over friends / my cars we've tried driving to the point where we give up on these pieces of ♥♥♥♥.\n\n4. Loot and crafting. Great amount of crafting recipes to start with can't wait to see what will be added, but it's a bit ridiculous to discover 1 recipe (like storage box) that has 4-5 other items crafted the exact same way without being given EVERY recipe in that combination. Also why do you have to re-discover them when you die? What's the point? It's just a waste of time. The guns are in a small variety atm which is good, pistols, assault rifles, shotgun, sniper rifle, good variety to start with just messing around with however... the sniper rifle's breath holding time is very low making it very hard to scope players or zombies etc. The preferred method of use is actually no scoping which makes it 200% more accurate to almost every player it seems to defeat the purpose no? AR15, hardly used it but when I did I could only get it to fire 1 shot at a time semi-auto perhaps I hit a button making it that way? More testing on my end to be done. Pistol is good, it's what you would expect.\n\n5.  Zombies, need a bit of work but by far much better than DAYz's derpy ai's. Improvements I'd suggest adding more honestly a lot more regardless of how hard it makes a server work loading them there is no challenge for players (i've seen slightly more amounts recently which is good) roaming AI hordes would be amazing too, but not like groups of 4-5.. I mean legitimatley hordes like 20+ / 30+. There is no current PVE surviving apart from other players raiding your ♥♥♥♥. So having 2-3 zombies or wolves or bears come along and be in your area.. who the hell wants ot play a PVE like that?  Add some more types of zombies too, crawlers would be fun to have harder to see, some missing limbs anything apart from the same 3-4 types of skins in low quantity.\n\n6. Hackers Why? Already? Really? Those are the most common remarks made about the hackers, SOE has done good on hackers in the past, I hope to see a anti-hack program in place soon preferably one that works.\n\n7. Fog/mist time of day, roughly the environment will change from sunny and bright, to dark, to just plain foggy/misty during this time of day (this might just be my complaint because I wear glasses) I can't see almost anything, players zombies alike. It is really hard on the eyes, it makes it a lot more challenging, but the frequency of this occuring during the day is high making it hard for me to play a lot. Others may share the same problem. View distance happens to be an issue too you can see a great distance, but somehow it feels lacking like I can see this shrub, but I couldn't see the zombie beside it kind of example.\n\n8. This is my final reason you should not get the game until it's free, or later during more patches which would be: The DAYZ community is currently flooding in, What does that mean to those of you who don't play DAYZ or never have,  The dayz community (at least the majority) are rude, they kill on sight, they trash talk you as if you're playing a PoS game like Call of duty, and almost never will they legitimately just be like I'm friendly I'll let you live hwen you turn you die.  Suprisingly enough 7 days to die doesn't have that kind of community I've found almost all players I've encountered have no real problem letting you live and walk away even if you have a gun in your hand. In this game if you have even nothing (like dayz) you're going to be shot at by someone why? There is currently no real PVE challenge with the zombies. You can make a bow and arrow with cloth and stick and then make x amount of arrows with however many sticks you find, 1 shot zombies in the head and when all 3 of the ones following you are dead there's no more until more get attracted.  Please add tons more it makes the loot feel worthless it really really does.\n\n\nYou want it? Get it, it's fun for what it is some players have a better experience than others obviously, but I definitely reccomend waiting a while until there is much more added in as the servers go down quite often (as of the last 3 days i've noticed) for 2 hours at a time for maintenance updates etc, so if you log in at the wrong time you arent playing.","February 3, 2015","false","214.5"," 153 of 259 people (59%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","59","153","259","16","25"

Now onto what i like more than in Dayz\n\n1. PvE Servers\nPvE servers are high on my list because when i was playing dayz i would get tired of being Killed on the spot 100% of the time.  Now with PvE servers you can Get the basics down learn how to play and make friends to team up with on PvP servers\n\n2. Over all the game is much smoother than DayZ this is no doubt because of SOE's assets. and this will only improve with time.\n\n3. Crafting\nhave you ever played DayZ and spent 5 hours running around only being able to hold a hand full of items? well in H1Z1 you can craft a small and simple backpack with 6 cloth (which can be taken from zombies) there are lots of stuff to craft on day 1 and they said that they plan to add new things all the time.\n\n4.discovering recipes\nwhen you go to your inventory you will see a Discovery Tab in this tab you can experiment with items you have in you bag to find new recipes, Recipes persist through death unless serever rules say otherwise\n\n5. A Filled map\nThe world in H1Z1 is full of little towns, citys and farm houses in the country, unlike Dayz where you could run for an hour and not see a building. ( The devs have said they are going to upgradi the map size and add new houses towns and stuff over time)\n\nNow to further adress how some of  payed items work.\n\n1. Crates.\nCrates are account items that are earned through playing the game and require a key to open. when you open a crate you will get a random cosmetic overide ( for example i got a Camo backpack skin). You will never recive a weapon or anything of that nature from these crates. ( its also worth noting that these skins are not consumed on use)\n\n2.Keys\nKeys are used to open the crates i mentioned before and can only be obtained through the market place for 250 station cash ($2.50 each) you may also beable to get them from ranking high in Battle Royal event arena ( ill cover this next)\n\n3. Tickets\nTickets can be earned by playing the game or purchased for 100 station cash ($1.00). tickets are used to play on event servers such as Battle royal and give rewards depending on your rank in the event. rewards can be Crates more tickets and i think keys can also be earned this way but im not sure.\n\n4.AirDrops\nThis is the source of the P2W myth. Airdrops cost 250 station cash ($2.50) and cant be obtained any other way ( might beable to get them as a reward on a event server). the following is how they work\n\nyou call in the airdrop and a plane will drop a crate in a random area based on your location but not close to you. everyone that saw the plane will likly look into tracking it down before you. and the drop sites tend to spawn a good amount of zombies with it. These crate rarly drop guns or ammo ( and the devs said they are working on decreasing the odds even more)\n\nNow onto the highlight of my first day in H1Z1\n\nme and another guy reenacted how Men work... Man meets man, man wonders about other man... shows other man stick.. other man shows man a bigger stick. man gets upset... man and other man find something difrent than them (in this case a car) and beat it up because man dont understand","January 17, 2015","true","12.7"," 508 of 888 people (57%) found this review helpful 107 people found this review funny","57","508","888","107","17"

The game looks and feels a bit like WarZ mixed with State of Decay but with a more in depth menu and vehicle system. I will update this as the game goes along alpha, but I highly suggest waiting until this game is free to play.\n\nCombat is sluggish, zombies take multiple head hits... with an axe. They also (when actually active) hit you while you're behind them. PVP mode is a deathmatch, the map is too small (although will grow soon hopefully), and environment not hostile enough to force players to work together.\n\nRecent patches have made the crates land farther away from the player that called them, and more easily identified to other players, in addition to spawning zombies around them. While this is still not my favorite feature, I believe it is much more balanced now.\n\nEDIT: I was asked to put some points on here that are not on reddit already, so I will. See below.\n\nI find the overall survival mechanics to be shallow, the cars have more health detail than the players in the game do. You cannot break bones, you cannot go unconscious, you cannot restrain or loot other player unless they're dead, you cannot bandage other players, and you cannot check the health of another player. You can, however, still see the name of the player.... which is the one thing that shouldnt happen in a "survival" game.\n\n\n*******************************************************************************************************************\n\nDevs are offering a refund now for those who have payed and feel the crate drops are unfair, I asked for a refund.  THIS IS NOT A BAD GAME! I just regret PAYING for it in the current state. I will play it again, and create a new account after it is free to play... with hopefully a much larger map and elemets that actually encourage players to survive together instead of turning into battlefield zombies.\n\nREFUND UPDATE: My friend returned his game and DID NOT have his IP blacklisted... There is a safe return here folks, and you'll be able to come back totally safe when the game is actually free to play.\n\n\n\nI got a refund on this game.

I spent 4 hours in the woods doing nothing because I could not find road or people. It took so long to die I wanted to just turn off the game and uninstall it. The devolpers of the game said it wont be Pay to Win but if you pay you get an air drop with Guns, Ammo, Food, Crafting materail.

Daybreak claims they think Battle Royale is polished but it still suffers from netcode issues, crashing and some game breaking bugs that require a restart of the game frequently. The company continues to hide behind a "it's just alpha" mindset while making money grabbing updates. For example, they continue adding more skins/crates so you'll spend money on keys to open the crates and now a new game mode called Green Dawn that will take event tickets that cost almost a dollar each. Do not recommend if you want a Survival game, and barely recommend as a PvP game.","November 5, 2015","false","133.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

I have not paid for a single air drop but I was grouped with a few people who had and one air drop contained glass sheets and a wooden bow and the other contained a spear and some random stuff. So both drops I have seen have been no gun and no over powered anything. I played 4-5 hours without dieing and I did not have a gun.\n\nIf you wish to play a survival game with friends then this game is amazing. It has in game voice chat so all users near you can hear you and its perfect for role play. Though don't expect all fun and games because some people are just out to hunt you and your items so be careful.\n\nThis game is not P2W because you don't keep these items upon death. Let some guy put $25 more into the game for a gun and then when he dies he will be back to nothing. Enjoy the game and test it yourself most reviews have less than 5 hours and haven't played long enough to have tested the game.\n\nExtra Notes:\n\n1. Air drops can be taken by anyone. It does not instantly spawn at your feet. It allows time for users in the area to make it to the site and kill you before it lands. They can also open the air drop crate for free and take all its content.\n\n2. Even if a user has a gun and ammo once he runs out he must hunt for more ammo so keep in mind that guns are only good if you have the supplies to use it.","January 18, 2015","true","31.8"," 126 of 214 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","126","214","6","8"

Guns,kits,ammo,food,Great gear,He taught me the way of living,Crafting and ofc surviving, We also killed some russians <3 and stole people's loot. after all that short fun, he told me that i was ready to see his base,so i followed him to the jungle and all of a sudden Randy turned to me, faced me and killed me with his rifle.

But as this game is now there is no point in paying for this. It is full of hackers both on the PVP servers as well as the PVE servers. Base building is utterly pointless in this until they add a form of plot pole (like arma) or just implement building restrictions around objects you build so others can't come along and place deck right up against yours just to hop over your walls. I currently have Screenshots of the hackers speedrunning, placing objects where they should not be able to be placed and on top of that they are some how able to place inside others bases using shelters to block the gates in and out of said base. People glitch right through your foundation and steal everything you've gathered and stored in your "secure" base.\n\nPros - game runs pretty smooth for the most part\n\nCons - Hackers, Hackers and more HACKERS\nglitch exploiters,\nlack of any type of building security,\nlack of in world objects to find ( 4 guns, 4 types of pants, 4 shirts, a handful of hats and 3 bike helmets)\nUNLESS you PAY for a chance to maybe get a different skin for one of those objects.\nD/C deaths, falling through the framework under the map (twice in the past week only fix is to delete the character)\nPVE- landmines, IEDs and fuel can explosions do nothing to anything but yourself if your too close\n( They wont damage cars or base buildings )\nPVP- Most ruthless player base in any survival game Ive played (arma,rust,infestation,DayZ SA)\nYou will die more times as a fresh spawn then I have ever experienced.\nEVERY patch or update fixes a minor issue only to cause something worse to happen.\n\nI could go on and on with the massive list of problems this game has but I wont.\nUltimately the game is fun for maybe 3 days to a week tops then you'll get bored and move on.\nI can not recommend this game in its current state and truthfully I feel bad for asking and mildly pushing my friends to pay for this.\nIf you are interested in H1Z1 WAIT for the full release and maybe just maybe SOE will have adressed and fixed the ever growing list of issues with the game before then.\n\n","March 21, 2015","false","263.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","0"

Zombies do not spawn fast enough, if at all.  Most areas are completely open with little to no zombies present.\n- Item drop is incredibly low.  I've opened about 300 cubbard only to discover a single syringe\n- The game reminds me a lot of LoTR.  A lot of running through woods, and little to no fighting.\n\nHere are some things this game does right.\n- Graphically, this game is amazing.\n- Shooting/Bow mechanics have appropriate/accurate drop/speed mechanics compared to weapons of their class/type.\n- a sense of urgency constantly reminding you that (at any point) something (or someone) is trying to kill you.\n- This game plays great with a team or group.  If you are trying to lone wolf this stay away.  This is not going to be an enjoyable experience for you.\n- Vehicles(while available in the game) are extremily hard to maintain and come by.\n- Vehicles are not unstoppable and will break down regularly.\n- Vehicle spawn rates are low to the point where the game does not turn into a "need for speed hot persuit" style game.\n- Unknown recipies.  You have to discover how to make stuff as you obtain the resources.\n- P2p is not pay to win...I actually enjoy it when I see someone pay for an air drop..it makes a nice homing beacon for a group of people to go toward, and obtain their loot, whilst bringing together other factions to fight over loot crates.\n- Just because you pay for the loot crate does not mean you will keep the gear/item.\n- Stable servers\n\nFeatures I would like to see\n- Clan/Survival guilds\n- Speaking in "Teams"\n- A tutorail that goes over some of the basic move/key bindings.\n\nOnce most of the issues noted above get ironed out, this game will be quite enjoyable.\nAs any game, before you pay for it, I would recommend looking and watching people stream it to see what its really about.\nIf you want a heads up, know the map, and have a better idea of where things will spawn before the final release, its worth the money.\nIf you do not want to play something that has glitches, wait for the glitches to get ironed out and play it once it changes to F2P.","January 21, 2015","true","30.2"," 174 of 302 people (58%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","58","174","302","18","0"

I remember looking at the H1Z1 twitter just about every 3-4 days, just to see if they tweeted out a hint about the release date.

I really hated SOE for that. When I was able to play the game, I started on survival. I kind of enjoyed it at first, but i slowly started to not like it. It felt boring and like nothing was happening most of the time. Now, the only thing that is fun to do on H1Z1 is Battle Royale....A gamemode that the company DIDN'T EVEN MAKE.

Thats out of 109 games. I dont have much time in it yet, but from what I have played, its just terrible. Terrible in every sense of the word. The community is toxic and irritating. The servers are slow to respond. The hacking and exploitation is some of the worst i've ever seen. Also, this isn't a very good survival game. In fact, it is pushing the boundaries of a survival game in the sense that many servers have no zombies, and very few players. Only one of the servers is actualy heavily populated. The battle royale is the only appealing mode in this game, and it really isn't all the cracked up to be. I died once when an opposing player glitched/teleported through a fence I was in front of. I really, really wanted to like this game, but its difficult to like when you run around looking for zombies/players for half an hour and only find someone who wanted to sell me ♥♥♥ tunes, which according to him is like some sort of singing toothbrush called tooth tunes. I must admit I laughed pretty hard at this, but that is off topic. I just cannot find any redeeming factors in a game with two modes, one heavily depopulated (is that a word?), and one so overpopulated, its not fun, and extraordiary (think I spelled that wrong) laggy from a server perspective. It also looks like an Xbox 360 game from 2006, but runs worse than my grandma. My PC isnt great, but I have a gtx 750 ti, and is a bit appauling for a game developed with PC in mind. I will definately play more, and IF, emphasis on the if, I find something relatively (I hate grammar) fun, I will change my review.\ntl;dr\nBad as a survival game, mediocre as a battle royale, bad servers, too many hackers, toxic players, a pretty bad PC port, and over all completly (Im not very good at this) unfun","January 14","false","1.2"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","31","46","0","0"

I have played DayZ, Rust, and numerous other survival games. This game is by far the worst. It is actually pretty well done - excluding the microtransactions. The issue is not with the game per se, more with the community. It is the most toxic community of players I've ever seen. KOS is more rampant in this game than any other survival game.\n\nI am realistic and I know that KOS is part of it, but I got on a "low" pop server on a sunday night and couldn't even make it to a town without being shot by a band of fully geared guys. It's just a really, really stupid community.\n\nAlso, the microtransactions are so stupid. Why do game makers keep making incomplete piles of grarbage and throw in game purchases in them until the cows come home.\n\nI would say the most fun part of this game is battle royal, but even then, some how the community finds a way to make that terrible too. In my 4 games of battle royal, I was killed 2 times by teammates.\n\nI would strongly caution against wasting your time and money on this pile of junk, it is truly one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing.

It has all the hallmarks for a game still in Alfa Fase. Of course this is only one players opinion but let's take a look at the "Pro's and Con's" thus far.\n\n1. Open World.... Check. Well balanced and of decent size. Most of us would love to see a world as large as the planet but H1Z1 is of a fairly standard size for this play type.\n\n2. FPS-Sandbox....Check. Each server has a limit granted, but for the servers that are populated it is a good balance. There tends to be a ton of Battle and KOS when there is a high player count and this helps send some packing, leaving the remainder to become the ones that will populate and dig in.\n3. Zombies......Check.  Many of us are wondering why there aren't any female zombies though.  And although sometimes the Zeeks will "Walk through walls", and even suddenly become elevated to roof tops, we understand it's a Alpha game and this will surely be fixed.....Right?\n\n4. Weapon Variety......Check? Yes there are a decent amount of ways to kill or be killed but frankly I think most would like to see more choices. And even though a 50Cal might be OP'd that doesn't mean there aren't other more suitable options. And Most of Us would love to be able to "Build All Weapons".\n\n5 Base Survivability....CHECK!!  It is frustrating to be the aggressor and find that 10 IED, and 5 land mines wont open the door, but from a "Play Time to Construction Ratio", if the bases were able to be breached easily, it would ruin the sense of survival and success. There are many titles that have construction, and after building your base you find it obliterated in an hour...... so on this note..... Thank You H1Z1.\n\n6. Cheater Banning......Check.  Either through manipulation or honesty, the devs are in Hot Persuit of Cheaters. Although it is painfuly obvious that many of the "Public Announcements" of banned players are DEV Created plants...... I mean come on with the coy and punny Bans that pop up. But none the less, KUDOS to you for being active in the persuit of a balanced and even playing field. Good On Ya!\n\n7. FPS Frenzy Mode.....Check. Or Battle Royale, Giving the COD'ers a place to vent and feel welcomed...... Nice. It is a great distraction to jump in and go Hunger Games for a bit.\n\nIn closing, there are many aspects that still need the Hammer put to them, but over all....... Keep it up Guys.... She's Comming Along.\n\nThings suggested by friends and myself:\n\na. Police zombies, Firefighter Zombies, Military Zombies, Female Zombies. And Unique finds on each type.\nb. More seletion of, and higher numbers available of vehicles.... Motorcycles, vans, sportscars, Hummers. Or perhaps Home built types that must be rersearched and developed by players. Weaponized options.\nc. Player made Crossbows, Sniper rifles, grenades.... etc\nd. A better HUD system and a more realtime interaction system, there is nothing more annoying then making something or lighting a fire and having to scramble to get the screen back to play mode when someone or something approaches.\ne. Stability of vehicles. I have noticed that the rigs will flip WAY TOO EASILY and this Must Be Fixed. One time a truck was in front of my base, I opened the Gate and it caused the truck to spin away and flip. Funny?  Yeah, but also not cool.\nf. Camo for bases, vehiles, players. As in using brush perhaps? Etc.... One thing that is abused is if you lower your graphics either by choice or necesity, you end up being able to see players in the distance even if the player is shrouded. Not Cool.\n\nIf any one else has suggestions, please leave your comments and together we can Help the DEVS make H1Z1 a great game.","June 29, 2015","true","297.9"," 41 of 65 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","41","65","2","3"

Immediately shot to the #1 spot on steam due to hype alone. The developers stated multiple times it would not allow the purchase of weapons as that takes away from what the genre is supposed to be about.\n\nSo why is it especially messed up in this case? Well because they announced NOTHING about buying weapon crates until they went live with the sales. They let everyone think there would be no such thing and as thousands of people paid $20 or $40 for it, they finally put up this developers letter.\n\nThis is flat out wrong. Don't buy this. Hell, I wouldn't even buy it if they went back on the decision to sell guns. Obviously it's a money grab.

Hands down.\nH1Z1 currently is in a lot, LOT better state than DayZ is, considering the fact that DayZ has been in a early access alpha state for a year already, and H1Z1 was just released.\n\nH1Z1 is totally playable and also it runs quite nicely even though you might not have the latest hardware inside your computer case. But do remember that this game is in alpha state, but so far it has received many updates already.\n\nThis game also includes a micro-transaction system in it. You pay real money to receive some little things that this game has in it's marketplace, but H1Z1 isn't Pay-to-win at all, the things that you can buy from the marketplace either give you\na little advantage, or it's just cosmetics. NO WEAPONS, but airdrops that you can buy when it drops down it has a small percentage chance on dropping a weapon, neither is it guaranteed that YOU get the airdrop you called in, all the players are eager to get near the dropzone, so be careful!\n\nTL;DR: For an early access Alpha, it's in a pretty good condition and is totally playable. 8½/10","February 23, 2015","true","33.8"," 70 of 118 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","70","118","8","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kevington/recommended/295110/","Kevington","Kevington v1.4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kevington/","256 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me preface by talking about the "pay-to-win" airdrops. If you play smart, loot thoroughly, and communicate well with others, you shouldn't need to buy them to get good gear. That said, I'm not particularly excited about airdrops because they don't really make sense. All you have in your inventory is a strip of cloth, a stick, and a handful of blackberries, but you can somehow summon the army or whatever to drop a shipping container. I'd prefer having to find a gps and walkie first so you could radio for coordinates to hidden supply caches. Just an idea. Also, $1-2 bucks would be reasonable, nearly 4 dollars a drop is pretty steep. I've seen people get next to nothing in their shipping containers. Even though I don't see it as game breaking, I'd prefer microtransactions to be solely cosmetic.\n\n\nOverall thoughts:\n\nThis game shows massive promise in it's early stages and has managed to make me more excited about the genre as a whole in my short time playing and watching streams. The game mechanics are smooth, the crafting system is intuitive and interesting, and the interface is easy to use. The same can't always be said for other sandbox survival sims in my experience. While the comparisons to DayZ can't be avoided, all I'll say is where others in the genre have frustrated me, H1Z1 absolutely delights. I've encountered no substantial bugs yet. I'll never forget some of the demoralizing deaths I've experienced in DayZ, like dying from walking up a flight of stairs backwards for example. That's always a great feature in a game, you know... non-lethal stairs.\n\nH1Z1 allows for interesting strategies and playstyles. For instance, I like to hunker down low and creep around patiently while looting cities and housing developments. Sometimes people walk into the same house or building I'm in, but they never even know I'm there because of cleverly implemented hiding spots. I've even managed to remain perfectly still and silent for up to ten minutes while groups of bandits ran within feet of me, looking for the loot I've already snatched up. Most players will instantly try to kill you so the tension is remarkable. When I'm caught, I typically scream something like "PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!" and run away as fast as I can while arrows and bullets whiz by me. Sometimes they just laugh and let me go. Remember, self-respect or huge balls don't mean much when your corpse is being teabagged and ransacked for the gear you spent hours collecting. This playstyle has increased my average survival time from an average of 20 minutes, to around 8+ hours. Even when loaded with weapons, I won't kill unless I have no other choice. I like to think I'm one of the good guys. If you find me (I go by KevinoftheCosmos and play in the Blackout server) lurking in a bush, a closet, behind a door, under a desk, or in a rock crevasse, remember to say hello as I sprint away frantically.\n\nThe game will eventually go F2P but it's undoubtedly worth the $20 cover charge if you enjoy this kind of game and want to be ahead of the curve. Overall, I have faith in it.\n\n\nAdditionally, the loot system was tweaked during the recent server down-time and it's now possible to find a gun and other crucial items, making airdrops even less of a necessity. Since it's an early access review, I'll add to this wall of text as changes develop.","January 27, 2015","true","122.6"," 77 of 131 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","77","131","7","0"

Otherwise it could ruin the game experience for you. If you don't mind the hackers running wild or the Glitch's that have been around forever and are still there.  Plus when they update 20 more show up on top of them.  The devs do a good job fixing the major ones, but the minor glitches that can get so annoying that you're pulling your hair out, they just put on the back burner and forget about it for awhile.\n\nThe last update really messed up the game.  Camera angle in 3rd person will make you sick after awhile.  Passenger seats in vehicles are just annoying to sit in, go into first person for that. The invisible player glitch is back again, which makes the game alot more interesting when you die to someone that you didn't even know was there. There was a glitch where you can get onto rooftops of 3rd story buildings and their fix was to take the doors out instead of finding the problem.  You can now Just run up on someones base and face plant against it and see inside.  Oh, and the wolves,,,,,,well lets just say that on survival you dont have to worry too much about zombies or players as you do wolves.  the spawn rate for them is insane.  Molotovs to this day still crash the game on alot of people, been 3 months i think since the glitch showed up, all they did was take molotovs out of br and went their way.\n\nThe game itself is a fun game to play, most of my hours are spent on survival.  Only got a couple hundred in BR's.  The best part of it is the social experiments you can play on others. RP is a blast itself, and you meet some great people along the way.  But that being said the game at this point and time is starting to die at least on the survival side.  Not enough is being done on the development side towards survival.  So if you want to just have fun and kill people, get king of the kill.  Don't waste money on suvival till they actually start working on it more.\n\n5/10 and dropping.

I had mix feelings about this.  I like that it was easy to find my buddies but usually when we would find our friends we would just get destroyed by players who have been playing who have had guns.  Battle Royal is pretty fun.  I didn't see many issues with that.\n\nThe Bad: This game is just.......really bad in my opinion.  I commented liking the map size, what was good is that most of the time it was easy to navigate through.  The bad was that usually after twenty minutes of walking youd just die from another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ player who has played way longer than you.  Another major problem with the game is remembering its a zombie game.  The only issue is that there are bairly any zombies at all.  None in cities, houses, anywhere.  This just seems like a giant game of Call of Duty including the Call of Duty fan base and little to no survival aspects.  The little issues I had was how repetative it was.  There are only about three types of weapons and you can never find them.\n\nGoods: Map size, Battle Royal, and Simple controls for a survival game.\nBads: No Zombies, other players, bad gameplay, no desire to keep moving forward.\nin conclusion if you are looking for a good survival zombie game id say just get Dayz.  It has many different types of game modes and servers, the followers aren't too bad, and the map is massive.","August 26, 2015","false","33.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I'm not even sure I've written a review for a game on Steam before but here we go. My girlfriend and I kept on eyeing up the survival games (like Forest, Rust, 7 Days to Die, Day Z, etc) and nothing was really ticking enough boxes to make us commit. Day Z was receiving an enormous amount of bad reviews (here on Steam) and that put us off. They were well constructed and explained why people were unhappy.\n\nSo, hopefully you've read the user reviews about how H1Z1 isn't Pay2Win and they're right. Whatever the initial trouble was has completely gone. Add to that that we don't hear many airdrops anyway.\n\nWe joined a quiet UK (EU) server and it's been riveting stuff. A quiet weekend morning meant that I had my pick of loot. Good to keep in mind. However, when it gets a bit busier things become more dangerous and potentially more rewarding. Sure, you're going to get caught out with the KoS (Kill on Sight) brigade but stick with it. Rule of thumb: if they don't reply on comms with something "normal" sounding within two seconds, be prepared for the brown stuff to hit the fan. Fear not, though, as there are friendly folk around and we've met a good handful or two on the server.\n\nIf you go to the towns, things are going to kick off but the tension is wonderful as you sneak through the streets avoiding anyone who's managed to secure a working vehicle. Damn, it's exciting stuff when they're patrolling the towns looking for trouble.\n\nGet to know your surroundings - it will take some time - and 'Craft' yourself to be a more serious threat. If you're playing this on your own, I'd definitely recommend trying to befriend people. If you're with a few online chums then dive right in! So far, so heart-thumpingly good.\n\nNB. It's in Early Access still so be prepared for folks to employ some sneaky workarounds that will give them an advantage from time-to-time. Thankfully, it hasn't stopped us having an absolute blast.","January 25, 2015","true","67.9"," 38 of 61 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","38","61","2","0"

However it falls flat exactly where every other zombie survival game does; the hackers. Countless times I've seen people run through buildings, teleport, go invisible and punch/slash my whole team to death, use bottomless clips. I'd personally stay away from this, as that was my original intention, but decided I'd give it a shot because it's only 20 dollars and I had just gotten my paycheck. If you are looking for a new game in this genre because of the hacker problems in the other games, just avoid it. If you are looking to make this your first dive into the genre, also avoid it. Hopefully with any luck they will find a solution to the hackers, but right now it's just getting worse and worse. If you do decide to get it, play during the day on a medium population server. There are far fewer there, as they get to "troll" less people.","March 18, 2015","false","41.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

This is a beautifully created game, the graphics are what you would expect to see out of most games for pc in 2015, (even with being in alpha) the early game is a blast and getting to know the game is very enjoyable. However, when you start to actually get into the game and try to get into cities, resident areas, or even attempt to get a car you will instantly find yourself wanting to flip tables or ruin your pc. Why? First some areas you cannot even get into because players that have been on the server you choose, have already placed building with codes on the front door so you cant get in. Then you have hackers. On multiple occasions i locked my items in a building i created only to come back the next day for everything to be gone, thinking that I maybe had mistakenly deleted my character i tried again only to have the same thing happen to me again. Finally the players you run into are typically bad mannered children, people with mics from the stone age, and people spamming music around cities following you. I wish i could recommend h1z1 because this game has the potential to be a award winning game, but its headed in the exact same direction that day z went. Try it for yourself if you dont believe me but you will realize that you wasted 20 dollars in hopes of a terrific game but have you dreams crushed by hackers and children.","March 23, 2015","false","13.7"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","16","21","3","1"

I put 6 hours into it based on the hype of a friend, but it killed me in that time. Even gave meserious headache pains too. So let's start with the pro's\n\nPro\n\nSurvival aspects include food and hunger\nScavenging System\nCrafting System\nCan tehcnically build bases\n\nCons\n\nSurvival is a joke, as everywhere you go are millions of berry bushes. These regen food and water, and are infinite.\nScavenging rarity means that scavenging is more effort than reward. You'll have to wait 1-4secsonds to open everything, only to constantly see nothing\nCrafting is pretty dumb, as the items make no sense, and there is a really limited range\nBuilding bases doesn't work at all as you can't set spawns, and while doors can be locked with codes, anyone can break them down... with FISTS if need be. You also can store items within, but they will be looted within 10 minutes. There are bases and shacks "everywhere" including stupid places like middle of the roads, making the open world seem cluttered and strange.\nEvery player you meet will kill you, no matter what you say. Instantly ending what has been 2 hours + of scavenging, leaving you to randomly respawn somewhere.\n\nPlaying with friends seems fun, but you cannot group up or set spawns, leaving you to use a co-ordinate system, and trek for 45 minutes to find each other. As soon as you get close, someone will kill you while you're reading co-ords.\n\nCombat is poor. Bows are a one shot kill, and can be made from twigs from trees and the clothes you start with. Melee is pointless as you can all sprint at the same speed. I.e. Sprint away, reload bow, shoot, sprint.\n\nIf they have a gun they will auto-win instantly, and while guns are super rare, ammo is NOT. Meaning those with guns can dominate forever. Though they never loot any good rewards from people obviously.\n\nStealth is borked, as whether you crawl, crouch or run you make the same noises to people, and since the render distance fades, a person crouched in bushes 300 metres away, to you is a player crouched on a BARE mountain with no grass rendered... sticking out like a sore thumb.\n\nZombies are rare, trivial and offer no threat. Kill 20+ with your bare hands. No infection/virus or anything.\n\nAll in all this is a game of rock paper scissors. Wander round, find someone. Are they better armed than you? If yes, die. If no, they attack you ANYWAY, and you kill them. If you kill, they have no loot worth having... repeat until someone has better gun than you. Die. Respawn, repeat.","February 1, 2015","false","6.7"," 355 of 644 people (55%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","55","355","644","53","20"

I will admit I had some fun times on this game, but this game became a huge disappointment long before it split in two seperate games. It mentioned hoping to be finished by the end of the year in 2015 and look where we are at now. People who don't own this have to pay DOUBLE what we originally paid. Now, lets focus on how they update each game. Just Survive hardly becomes updated and most likely will become the game the developers will hardly pay attention to. "King of the Kill is where its at!" is probably what the developers are thinking, which I believe is pathetic. This game is a zombie apocalypse, not a battle to the death with friends. If you want a battle royale game, get The Culling. It's cheaper and way more ahead in progress than this wasted excuse of a zombie survival game. If you don't want a battle royale, literally any other zombie survival game is better than this money grabbing garbage.

Only decent.\n\nThe open world survival is a great idea. Enterting interiors, boarding up, and making outposts is actually pretty entertaining.\n\nThe actual mechanical aspect of this game is awful.\n\nFor the TTK (Time To Kill), I believe it has to be drastically raised. Melee is pathetically weak. If I'm equipped with a combat knife or a machete, it will make a lick of difference when I get the drop on someone with a shotgun or a pistol. I believe that getting ran through with a blade, or chopped with an axe should be a quick death, as quick as getting shot in the head with a bow or getting hit with a shotgun. PVP should be risky and must hurt no matter who's armed with what, and people should have a reason to consider caution when entering a melee situation, a gun fight, or entering a building that someone may have entered.\n\nThe looting is 'eh' at best. It fills your inventory with insignificant clutter, which makes sense because most people don't build their homes to be fortresses. More food, medicine (cold medicine, bandages, what have you) and water would be more appreciated.\n\nMore weapons and ammo would be appreciated. I'm not sure where H1Z1 takes place, but I assume it's in a place with loose gun laws prior to the apocalypse due to the weapons you can actually scavenge.\n\nWildlife is boring to hunt and is not threatening in the slightest. Even a bear you can take down with relative ease.\n\nZombies do no significant damage to warrant using anything other than toss-away weapons, thus rendering the need for said weapons completely useless. Even with headshot only servers, I was more concerned if I was going to find more loot in the trailer I was looking at than the amount of zombies that were chasing me in the night. For zombies to be something to consider running away from, they should be able to kill much more quickly, and should gain the ability to sprint faster than the player at night.\n\nMaybe they'll do better once they reach public release, but until then, if there is a zombie game you want to buy, keep looking, this is not one worth money.\n\nMaybe worthwhile when it goes free to play.\n\n","March 13, 2015","false","12.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I've walked away from this game 3 times from being turned off because of that same exact reason. Being, if you die (even in PVE) there is no chance of getting your stuff back. Every time I play this game, I come back to it, see whats new, enjoy playing for an evening or 2 getting gear and starting to have fun and feel like a bad ♥♥♥. Just to get stuck on some BS and get pushed into a corner with no chance of survival no matter how good of gear you have. Just to die, spend 20 minutes treking back to where you were to find all your stuff gone. I know the point of this game is to survive, but its really no fun when you really feel cheated almost every time a zombie kills you because it's usually caused by getting stuck on a door or a ♥♥♥♥ing lamp or something stupid. I was looking forward to playing this all day with my friend after we started playing again last night. We were litterally in game for not even 20 minutes before we were both cornered and after a group of zombies some how made it into a house behind us as we closed the door. I HEARD IT CLOSE. I turned around to find it wide open with 7 zombies surrounding us. If they ever fix this game so you actually have a chance of getting your stuff back (at least in PVE which is what I play to avoid getting KOS every 5 minutes) then I might change my review. So far this game has only been a money grab and the most rage enducing game i've ever played.","January 7","false","18.6"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","21","31","5","0"

The game is very boring which starts you out in the middle of woods with basically just a flashlight.  The point of the game is survive, but you are basically in the middle of nowhere.  I finally found some homes and gas stations, but no npc or other players in sight.  You randomly get attacked and killed by bears which is pretty lame.  The game gets boring real quick and isn't even fun if your looking for a sandbox.

We then set ourselves up with a car, guns, food, ammo, and we had mastered the art of survival. Then we met a man. A friendly bloke. Called Walter White. We asked for meth, he met our demands. We had made a friend. We then drove of without poor Walter. We were chopping trees along with a mix and Walter and his mate rocked up along us. We told them how we were going and what we had then we all talked for a bit and gathered ♥♥♥♥ among us. He was showing us some cool tricks where you can raise your hands but Walters friend wasnt too interested. He then shot my friend i cryed, so then I shot Walters gay friend. Then walter ran away as he had no weapons. So I blastered him with bullets. He almost died and was severly bleeding. So was I as I had been shot multiple time on my ♥♥♥♥. I then tried to use my bandages but I had to take care of Walter. He said "baby don't hurt me, no more" So I shot him with an arrow in the head. He died. I was safe. But had 1% health and I died.

Maybe require some sort of knife or took to create them.\n- Zombies running even after an arrow lands between their brows. (very rarely ran into this problem but it is there. )\n- No way to set spawn. Yes, I get this can be exploited heavily but there's gotta be a way to make a spawn marker inside one's own base. I'm sure that can be done one way or another.\nOverall it's a fun game, once these issues have been fixed I'll gladly flip this around and give it a thumbs up.

DO NOT BUY H1Z1. It will be a waste of money. In the begining, the game was magnificent. And in certian aspects it still is. However, when the developers realized how many people started buying tickets for battle royal, a deathmatch game mode where the prizes are very good, they turned into any classic F2P game. It turns into a Pay to Play, or you get nowhere in the game. And im sure as most of the experienced players on steam know, as soon as F2P game developers get a Phat Wallet from micro purchases, they look up to Donald Trump. Penny pinching, lazy greedy tycoons who want your money. And what happens to F2P games that turn to The Dark Side? Look at Fallen Earth, Face of Mankind, and The Repopulation for example. Great games for sure. But after 2-3 years of sucking every penny that you, the player, are willing to give them, THE GAME DIES. Think of it like an exponential graph. At first, a few people here and there stop playing. But the amount goes up dramatically until all that is left is the players who spent $$$$$$$$$$ in the game. But eventually they stop playing because nobody else even looks the game up. Moral of my review? F2P games are good in the begining, but dont expect them to last for long. My advice is to find a game that isnt F2P, you pay $30-$60 to buy it, and enjoy. Because in the end you will spend less money. This is all just my own opinion, however, if you will notice, the user review is mixed. about 6 months ago, it was very good. Take a look at all the review, not reading them but looking at the thumb up/down and see from the begining how they go from blue to mixed to red.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuantaShift/recommended/295110/","QuantaShift","Aiden Pearce the Hackerman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuantaShift/","160 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI don't do reviews and this in a way this isn't one, it's more of a piece of advice: uninstall this game.\n\nBetter yet don't buy it.\n\nThis game has been broken for over a year, and with what patches have been made, it only seems to become worse. This is likely because the game developers upload an older, more stable version of the game with a new patch as an update. With each update, the game simply becomes worse and worse and I legitimately fear that one day it will be at a point the game is downgraded to the point that the game is only half-textured. There is no hope in sight for this game at all. The only noticeable feature added since it's release is a 'comfort meter' which based on how full it is, will reduce regeneration of health and energy by unoticable amounts.\n\nMore on to what the game it is itself. If you are a hunter of hidden-lore in open world games that don't otherwise have a plot, you will not find that here. If you are looking to make friends in game to create a clan and survive together, pooling resources and effort to create a strong community, you will also not find that here. What you will find is a game that is so broken you will honestly find it laughable. You will also only have fun with two friends who have this game or more, but if you don't know anyone who has it, save yourself the bad karma and don't encourage them to buy it. I repeat, do not in any case purchase this game to play by yourself. You can maybe meet some people on PvE but since there isn't any risk to playing that mode there isn't any point. Not to mention everywhere in PvE is looted by campers and you will generally just find yourself mind-numbingly bored. In PvP, it's a typical risk against players but what's bad about the game is that the concept of it, zombie-survival, is broken. Zombies simply aren't a threat. You will rarely die to them unless you are new to games in general. You will die most to players and animals. There is hardly any variety to anything in this game and such a lack of customization.\n\nDaybreak have lied so much about this game and have promised so much. This game was also supposed to be 'free-to-play' but instead it 'evolved', seperating the game into two worse games, splitting apart the mechanics from the base game. "Just Survive" and "King of the Kill" (inspired names, I know) were part of one game that cost the price of well, either one of these 'two seperate' games now (£15). In "Just Survive" you will have a lot fun [insert sarcasm here] doing just that. In "King of the Kill" you will be pitched against a hundred and fifty or so other players in an open-world map that slowly becomes lessa and less open as it becomes choked with gas; it's a fun concept I haven't played much with but it simply isn't zombie-survival (what I was looking for) at all.\n\nThere are of course, microtransactions as well. Yes. Microtransactions for a broken, early-access game. As if you didn't waste enough damn money.\n\nAs I mentioned, this 'game' has been broken for a year, to demonstrate this point, here's a paraphrased extract from a farily recent update:\n\n"Gas grenades will no longer damage vehicles."\n\nThis game is not worth the price tag. If it was maybe £3-5 it would, but still, only if you had a small group of friends playing with you. This is not a game that does the "so bad it's good" trope at all. It is honestly so bad you will just find yourself gone insane from frustration and consequently laughing like the lunatic you've become for feeding the cancerous corporations money fuel to perpetuate the production of broken, half-finished, never-to-be-finished, 'games'.\n\nI hope this review passes as a testament to the absolute greediness of people and companies such as Daybreak. You might think: "Well, not all games can be good because they don't have enough funds", but believe me, with the amount of money Daybreak received from the original hype of the sales, they easily have enough to fix this game. Not tweak it. Not fine-tune it. But fix it. No, instead, with the money they have gladly received they plan to port this game to consoles. This game that today, when I opened it up on high graphics, I legitimately assumed I was playing on very low since I set typically have to set it to that since H1Z1 is so poorly optimized, which is another point. If money is no object to you, then I am sure time will still be of some value to you. Because regardless, fifteen hours waiting for something hilariously broken and not frustratingly broken to happen with a friend just really isn't worth it. Just go watch a good comedy like Seinfeld. Buy it all on Blu-ray if you have a need to spend money, just don't spend that money on Daybreak or anyone else just like them please. People need to stop paying the wrong people money. If you buy this game, play it for a few hours and you are so very unhappy with it, you have no right to complain because you are only allowing games like this to exist. I'm only complaining for the sake of anyone else thinking of purchasing this game but also I really just don't want the future of games to be broken in early-access. This doesn't have to happen. Just stop giving them money. If you're thinking of purchasing something early-access, make sure it's either indie 8-bit (because for one, independant developers actually have genuine care for their game or games and two: you can't go wrong with developing an 8-bit game). But if it isn't, make sure you look at a few reviews and some gameplay first.\n\nTo summarise:\n\n- Do not buy this game\n- Do not give Daybreak or similiar entities or people any money whatsoever, do not endorse them, condone them\n- Spend less money on a better game\n\nI hate you but I do love you, H1Z1. Regardless, you simply deserve nothing better than to fade away from existence, along with all the greedy producers who spawned you.","March 18","false","65.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Whatever it is you'll need, wherever you'll have to go, they will be there waiting. Time is on their side.\n\nYou might find yourself hiding in a car or buidling. You may not have enough ammo or weapons to fight your way out, and even if you did - there's far too many to take your escape for granted. You might make it out alive, but chances are high that you are going to die trying.\n\nBut do you have a choice? No. You are going to run out of food and water sooner or later and you will have to make your move. One last deep breath before you thrust open the door and fight for your life.\n\nIn the zombie apocalypse, every survivor you meet is a potential ally. Each cooperative soul will increase your chance of survival - and theirs. There will always be thugs and murderers. But even these are in the same situation as you: alone, hungry and scared. Yes, there will still be murder\nand mayhem, but only if the situation allows it. You'll find yourself shoulder to shoulder with fellows, you'd never help in normal life.\n\nWhen you're among the few to still survive, you'll have to choose very carefully, who you'll try to kill. Your world is already full of predators. When threatend adequately, whatever is left of mankind will be forced to close ranks, stabbing you in the back when you least expect it.\n\nSadly, this is not what H1Z1 features.\n\n\n\n\n<TL;DR;>\n\nZombies in H1Z1 are mere decoration.\n\nThey are  the poor excuse to call H1Z1 a zombie survival game. Currently H1Z1 resembles what Rust used to be - and they ended up dropping the zeds alltogether. They simply didn't matter.\n\nH1Z1 is a dog eat dog, player versus player, KOS repeat of Legacy Rust.\nZombies are mere walking props, neglectable in PvP and outright boring in PvE.\n\nWhat this game needs is indeed 2000++ people  per server.\n... but make that 1900 zombies and 100 players.\n\n\n\n\n+ Great map map size and design\n+ All buildings accessible\n+ Deep crafting system\n+ Great "discovery " of recipes\n+ Hunting & Looting (the latter has been improved with the latest patch)\n+ Great performance considering its current state\n\n\no  PvP KOS festival\n\n- Prop zeds. It's not a zombie survival game.\n- Awfully boring PvE\n- Lots of noise via VoIP.\n- No respawn at base or close to friends\n- On the verge of P2W\n- Resembles Rust Legacy without the construction possiblities.\n\n\nLine breaks seem to appear different in the editor, than later.

The servers and the game itself are very unstable and it may take you some time before you even get to play.\n2. Its pay to win and do not be misled by the clame "Aircraft drops are very hard to get". They drop on the player and you can get stuff like guns and ammo (For example i got shot by a dude with a m16 in 10min or so)\n3. Most places dont have any loot at all. Its kinda like in the warz alpha where  most spawn points just were not added.\n4. Zombies are broken. They wont attack most of the time. The best they do is they run to your last location and only attack if you hit them and stay very close to them.\n5. Most of the things like animals and ect. are just the same as the zombies.\n\nI am sorry but when you use an early acces game to drain money from players with microtransactions there has to be something wrong with you. In short you pay for stuff that prob wont work anyway just so you can lose it. This type of plan doesnt go well with survival type mmos.\n\nI even remember an interview with the devs . They went on and on how you wont be able to buy guns and ammo.....\n\nAnd pls do not be misled by all the positive reviews.

If you're planning on playing on any other server, but Battle Royale servers, you won't survive for very long and the person that's gonna kill you will insult you and your extended family.\nYou know how freshspawns are often left alone in DayZ because they don't have anything? Like if two people come across each other and they both have only melee weapons, the chance of them attacking each other is slim. They might start hitting each other for a while, but most of the time both will realise that it's a waste of a time and that there's nothing to gain.\nNot in H1Z1. A naked man with a bow will chase you across the universe only to kill you for no reason, scream insults at you, play bad music and make you lose faith in humanity.\n\nThe FPS is good and Battle Royale is fun. Other than that I'll stick to DayZ and DayZ Mod. Base building is also a joke, stick to Rust if that's what you're into. Also don't use the female character to play on any servers, it will make the insults a million times worse.","June 10, 2015","true","25.0"," 60 of 104 people (58%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","58","60","104","25","2"

You do not need to play 200 hours to see where this game is headed. I am ashamed that a big name company like Sony has the nerve to put a game out in "early access" then charge an extra monthly subscription to play the biggest reason people like me have even played beyond the first couple hours, Battle Royale. I for one will not be buying an early access zombie title again. To all those people that say "this is alpha its going to change and get better" I will change my review when they revoke the pay to play of battle royale and the hacking is fixed. Until then I say goodbye to this game and try my best to warn people about this game. $15.00 for early access from Sony is rediculous and asking for more money is even more.

First off, do NOT buy this game if you want an actual survival game. Base building is grindy, PVP is broke, raiding is easy, etc. If the game did not split I would highly recommend buying the game with your friends just to have fun on together. I've played this game in different ways, building huge bases, running around killing people with a bow, blowing cars up with explosive arrows, etc. The game is fun, it's a great idea, but the dev team for survival is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. This game is just trying to get big by BR's and not surival. Once again this is my own opinion but unless you are prepared to spend $20 on half of the game, don't support this dev team or game anymore.","February 21","false","639.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The Developement team\n\nThe Developement team is constantly on doing what they can to make H1Z1 a better game for the community. Almost every day or week you will always hear from them. Whether is it's through Social Media or Live Streams, you know what's going on next with the game. They even have a link to their site where you can view the progression of this game.\n\nhttps://www.h1z1.com/roadmap\n\nAnyone who thinks that this is a game where the developers doesn't listen to their community is wrong.\n\n\n2. Pay to Win Accusations\n\nLet me clear this up. I am someone who has dedicated 600+ Hours to this game since upon release and maybe there was possibly a situation where you could "pay" and get airdrops, but aidrops are random. You're not garuntee to get your airdrop unless you possibly have a sweal clique of friends. Also not to mention they took out all the guns in airdrops so you don't have anything to worry about. I promise there is no p2w. You can buy keys for crates and clothes off the market which are sold cheap, but there is nothing you pay for that you will get an advantage over any player in this game.\n\n3. The Hacker Situation\n\nAt first there was an abundance of hackers which was unplayable at first because it would be, you'd spawn... walk down and the street and get found by hackers. Hackers were pretty ruthless. They would even fly inside your base and steal all your loot or esp to you and kill you before you would even know they're there. Today, hackers get swatted like flys so now you hardly ever see them. Hackers are a dying breed now. You'd be lucky if you encounter a hacker and if you do... they're usually banned within the first hour of you encounter them. Hackers will most likely be a thing in the past with the automated anticheat system coming soon. So if you have any hackusations against any players. Don't be scared to report your last death.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OimzDPqDiA\n\n4. Battle Royale\n\nBored of Surival? Mad after farming for hours and losing all your gear? Queue up a Battle Royale where all that is irrelevant! Battle Royale is something completely new to any survival game I seen so far and the queues are better than they are since day one.\n\nThe REAL Final verdict?\n\nYou should buy this game if you enjoy survival horror games. You should by this game if you saw battle royale on someone's live stream. I promise you that you will find this game at the top tier compared to any other survival horror game out there on steam. Once again... I am someone who has over 600+ hours in this game and hopefully that is enough to gain your trust. Hope I could help clear up anything for any of you guys.","June 30, 2015","true","996.2"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","30","49","2","0"

Wether you're a friendly traveler or a armed to the teeth kill on sighter. The opportunities are endless.\nI've met quite a lot of players who were hostile, of course. The game could be fun wandering through the woods alone.\nBut it's way more fun if you're playing it with your friends or with players you've met on the road.\n\nThe interactions with other players are hilarious at some times. For example the weird things said through the microphone, they could have you laughing out loud and resulting in making a new friend.\n\nHackers?\nI've heard some things about hackers. In the game and read it on reddit (www.reddit.com/r/h1z1).\nBut I haven't seen someone seriously hacking. At least, not that I was aware of.\n\nBugs and exploits?\nThere has been some "Duping" bugs and exploits. But the developers are seriously working on these bugs and are punishing the ones exploiting those bugs. The developers of H1Z1 are great in this.\n\nPatches and fixes?\nThe game patches quite often, they happen to fix bugs really fast.\n\nIs it worth it? Yes it is! It's totally worth the money, since you're helping the developers improve the game.\nI didn't regret a bit of my twenty euros spent on H1Z1.\n\nBattle Royale, Fun?\nFor the ones who are unknown with Battle Royale. It is a gamemode within H1Z1 which could easily be described as Hunger Games.\nBasically you get dropped in the sky with a parachute, you're getting yourself a gun, kill everyone on sight and the last survivor wins.\nI did manage to win once. But yeah, it wasn't easy.\n\nPay to win????\nI've heard quite a lot of complains about H1Z1 being Pay to win. This is absolutely not true.\nOfcourse. You can buy yourself a Airdrop ticket and call it in. But the downside of this is that you'll be flooded by other players with most of the time not even receiving your own called in Airdrop. Quite unfair but yeah, it happens.\nPart from that, the crate which being dropped is random. You could even end up with total crap. Totally not worth the 5 euros.I suggest not to buy airdrop tickets.\n\nI hope I'll see any of you guys in the game ;)\n\nKeep rockin' bros","February 7, 2015","true","225.7"," 52 of 90 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","52","90","5","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vanillascout/recommended/295110/","vanillascout","Nerfed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vanillascout/","386 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you have any interest in this game, I suggest you look the other way, ignore all the hateful spam on the forums, and see where the game is in a few weeks-months from now. The only reason I'm NOT recommending this game, is because it's simply too early to say whether or not your money is well spent in the long run. And hell, if you wait long enough, you'll even be able to check this game out for free.\n\nFirst of all, this game is in early access. Now, hold on, I know what you're thinking; "oh my god stfu with the early access thing, IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE!", and you're completely right about that! Early access means you should EXPECT issues, not EXCUSE them. And this game has some glaring issues at the moment, all of which add up and make the game pretty much unplayable. As such, it's best to wait a while, and come back when they're fixed.\n\nSome of the issues include;\n- Poor performance:quality ratio. I've had many games both looking and running far better than H1Z1 does.\n- Lack of graphics settings (1). The only settings are overall quality presets, and pixel resolution.\n- Lack of graphics settings (2). For some reason, using the medium, low, or very low quality preset, turns everything pitch black. What's supposed to be a sunny day will look like the darkest night. As a direct result, everyone is forced to play with at least the high preset, and the only option to improve performance is to downscale by setting the pixel res to very low (which only runs slightly better, at the cost of looking like absolute ♥♥♥).\n- Inconsistencies and oddities. Just about anything in regular servers is a loot container, from broken cars to random cabinets and fridges in buildings, you can open and loot them all. And you need to, in order to find supplies and survive. In Battle Royale however, the only loot to be found is clothing, guns, ammo, and healing items (your hunger/thirst is locked to 100%, so you don't need food). It's quite odd; if your first experience with the game is BR, you'll have a very boring time, because you'll be looking around, seeing all these cabinets and whatnot, and thinking to yourself "why can't I loot any of this? wtf is wrong with this game??".\n\nAll of the above, and all the other issues I haven't mentioned (and trust me, there's LOADS), will likely be improved over time.\n\n\nAlso, the community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ itself over airdrops and whether or not they're pay 2 win. If you're caught in the mass confusion on that subject, this will probably help; they're more like pay 2 server event. While it is pretty bad that you can pay for a chance at great loot, bear in mind it's delivered by a very loud, clearly visible plane, and the drop itself is a huge container with bright blinking lights on it. Anyone with decent gear or nothing to lose will come running, so you'd best be prepared if you actually want the items! In addition, it takes 10 full seconds to actually open the crate, even after you already opened it before (so if you open it, close it to quickly look around before looting, and try to open it again, you'll have to wait another 10 seconds). An awful lot of death can happen to you if you're standing still for 10 seconds! They're also quite expensive, clocking in at $5 a drop. Is that really worth it, for a bunch of RANDOM items which you WILL eventually lose if you continue playing with that char? It really seems like the only reason for airdrops is literally to start a server event, a small-scale war over the crate contents.","January 16, 2015","false","4.3"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","16","23","4","0"

I play on ~200 ping from Aus, and the melee isn't even that painful for me. Compared to Dayz melee, it actually works.\nThe sounds in the game are excellent, when you go inside a building with the rain, the sound changes. The sound in this game creates a truely immersive survival experience.\nZombies - holy ♥♥♥♥ zombies are dangerous and scary. I have played this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s for 2-3 days now, and wow they are still scary. They're actually a threat, I love it.\nThe games actually fun. Wierd eh, its fun to not have to worry about doing all the annoying as ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ in Dayz that just kills the fun.\nCRAFTING is amazing, it actually works. Everything in the game has a use, and the crafting list is truely huge, really cool ♥♥♥♥.\n\nCONS: Similar to Dayz, grouping up with friends is hard and tedious. Towns aren't super distinctive and landmarks aren't very obvious, so you'll have to use roads to find friends, but luckily roads are very consistantly labeled and can be used with a map to meet up.\nThere is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of places to search in a building for loot, this is good, but to search and entire building takes ages and often doesn't have a lot of loot in containers(they are gonna patch that today though)\n\n\nAIR DROPS PAY2WIN THOUGHTS.\nShut the ♥♥♥♥ up you morons. This game has an excellent engine, things ♥♥♥♥ing work, there is a lot to do and its not even that buggy. Little things like nameplates and air drop tuning can be fixed over night. Stop ♥♥♥♥ing QQing about things that can be fixed overnight, and appreciate the fact that this game is built around a basis that is already EXCELLENT. People looking to buy this game stop and realise what people are complaining about. If this is what people are complaining about, things that can be tuned and fixed (and are/have already been done so) rather than core bugs and gameplay issues, then you know this will be good.\n\nMy 2 expereinces with air drops.\n1) I see it land on mountain, I run up and 7 zombies are standing around. I go full hulk and beat a few to death with my fists of justice, then a Russian man walks up and teams up with me. We fight hand combat taking down zombies, I almost die, so I strip naked, rip up my clothes to make bandages and heal up. We clear out the zombies and he starts to loot the crate, so naturally I beat him to death. He abuses me in Russian english and I check the crate, it has 1 m1911 (pistol) a few ammo and a ♥♥♥♥ing pipe. I have no inventory to take anyhting other than the sidearm as I have no clothes on, then I die to bow.\n\n2) I use one of my air drops, same ♥♥♥♥, kill the zombies with a bow, walk over to it, get hit in the head by arrow. Didn't even get to look inside it. Yeah pay to win.\n\nThe crates aren't guaranteed loot, the stuff inside is ♥♥♥♥ and you're most likely gonna die. But they're fun. They are extra events taht happen in the game that make it feel epic.

I play this game on and off as I genuinely enjoy the survival aspect of this game. After a 3 month binge on fallout 4 and Witcher 3 I finally decided to come back to this game, and I genuinely enjoyed it for the most part despite being beta. Unfortunately, What I encountered was a game that was even more broken then when I first started this endeavor.\n\nA few hours in, got my backpack crafted, got water situated, and my foundation started after meticulously finding a proper spot. I walk down the side of the hill – the game freezes, I have no choice but to crtl+alt+del and end game. I log back in and find myself starting with a brand new character. In addition to this with the new changes I often have to force close thew game as it does not always load when attempting to start.\n\nUnfortunately this is not an isolated incident, neither is logging in to find your character has just died. I takes a bit of time and energy to get things going in this game, so when you die it can be quite frustrating. It’s one thing to die because of cheaters, but when the game is set up to fail due to bad design it’s another thing.\n\nI know this game is intended not to be perfectly running, as it is still in progress, but the whole point of beta testing is making the game at least somewhat playable to some degree so you can actually test it. Back in my home town I recall hearing the phrase “ If you want to help a panhandler – don’t.” Well… I believe this applies to daybreak games; while it may be considered a somewhat not finished product, it isn’t playable. The problem here is bad coding, not enough testing etc... My advice is-: don’t give them your money until they at least have a product that is polished enough to be playable for testing.\n\nI love the game, the premise and the basic idea, but if I have to start a new character at the whim of a random crash, then this game is not only frustrating, but unplayable- don’t give them your money until they make things right.\nShould this game be fixed I will update my review.\n","February 6","false","308.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

While some devs are able to not only meet their original goals and deliver a game beyond their users expectations, it looks like the devs at Daybreak Games will instead join the never ending list of "failed EA games". At least when it comes to the users that paid for and expect much from the survival game play. (Maybe even too much at times,)\nI will admit that Battle Royale is a fun mode, especially with friends. But that is not the game originally pitched by the devs. BR was, in my opinion, pitched as an alternative game mode and NOT the main focus of the game.\n\nWhile the survival mode takes a back seat to the increasingly lucrative BR mode and the micro transaction system, I cannot reccomend this game to anyone looking for a serious zombie survival/♥♥♥♥♥♥me.\nPerhaps in the future this will change.","November 5, 2015","false","105.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

I'd been keeping an eye on it ever since it was announced.  Figured I'd get it and try it out.  I liked what I did play of it.  However, as time went on, DBG focus shifted more and more towards BR mode, and survival was left in the dust.  I pretty much gave up on it.  So as a survival game, I definitely do not recommend it.\n\nIf you're looking for a zombie survival game, look elsewhere, this isn't it.  Get Project Zomboid or something.  If you watch Twitch streams of this, most likely all you've seen is the (in my opinion) ridiculous BR mode.

But unfortunately I cannot play for more than hour without being hacked. Being hacked on this kind of game is worse than any other game. You cannot just change servers and pick up where you left off like in FPS games, as it is a horror survival game that requires you to scavenge and collect. I dont mind losing my progress because another player or two bested me, you just respawn and start over, but when a hacker shows up every night you play the game and essentially steals everything youve worked for in the most unfair way , and the people who develop the game do not care it is utterly pointless to conitinue to play. The developers also try tweaking the base building, but ALL this is fixing is the glitching into the bases, they are not addressing the real issue of people ONE SHOT hacking to destroy the base and take everything you had collected which can be upwords of 50 hours of work.

There is no way to group with friends because every time you die you could spawn anywhere and spend hours trying to locate your old base (If you find it at all). By that time it will most likely have been raid and your stuff gone. Secondly, no matter the argument this game IS Pay-to-Win. The definition of "Pay-to-Win" is anything that someone can buy with real world money that would give them an advantage in the game. The Airdrops are the prime example of this. You get weapons drops, IED's, and the like. That my friend defines pay to win. If the normal person has to start out in the middle of nowhere with next to nothing and has to venture in the cities (which are crawling with people with guns) to get any decent weapons themselves, that gives the normal player a very big disadvantage.

But now.. now the devs have finally showed their true colors and their lake of loyalty toward their customers and their own promising game and has taken full advantage of the early-access system.\n\nPlease avoid this and all other games that are in early access so we can finally go back to buying games the way they were meant to be purchased. COMPLETED. If you want to have an early access, then you have to make it FREE with donations ACCEPTED. And then allow the customer to purchase the game once the devs have proved their worth and finished the game rather than have it in early access for 5 years and abandon it with 100 unfished promises after they earned their money for half the work.\n\nThis game and it's development team is a disgrace and I am very disappointed in the way this industry is going. I will never be purchasing a game from DayBreak every again and I hope everyone else follows suit. This needs to STOP.","February 22","false","72.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Kill people, regardless if they're fresh spawn or not.\n\nRuining people's experience is something that shouldn't be tolerated, and before I get comments telling me to go onto a PvE server, the answers no. PvE on H1Z1 might as well be removed as a whole because of how bland, uncreative and downright boring it can get after 5 minutes. Survival simply isnt a factor when it comes to PvE.Why not at least add some AI Scavengers? Something that can fight back and isn't programmed to be a child. I'm certainly not one to spend this many hours on a game, to then have pretty much everything I worked on disappear when I next log on. I love PvP in many games, but when it's this diminishing, I'll pass.\n\nIf you're in a group with numerous friends and are enjoying the game, good on you! It's great that some people are having a blast on this game, I'd have loved to.\n\nBase building is quite simplistic, gather metal and cut trees down, pretty much it. Spend countless hours building a base only to wake up the next morning with the gate missing and all your hardwork and hoarding gone. Second day after wipe also. You're best of being part of a sizely group or just building small shacks around the map, that or dig holes and note down their position using /loc.\n\nTL;DR:\nA community more toxic than LoL, PvE is a pointless tack-on and shouldnt even be played and the Developers give zero ♥♥♥♥♥ and would rather throw in more RNG crates.\n\nH1Z1 - Because ♥♥♥♥ you, give me money.","February 20","false","97.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Unfortunately the damage was done and all the troll reviews from the first day of release have already left their negative mark.\n\nThe majority of the reviews for this game are completely FALSE and NOT relevant to the actual quality of the game because they are reviews for a version of the game that existed for less than two days. So PLEASE ignore them and look up a proper RECENT review of the game.\n\nThe reviews for this game are a perfect example of why allowing the average person to review an Early Access game causes nothing but misinformation and false negativity. If Steam is going to allow reviews of an Early Access game the reviews and the review score should be associated with only that particular version model of the game and should subsequently be archived, away from the main page, every time the game is updated and the version model changes. This would be extremely beneficial as new buyers could compare the complaints in the older version review to the patch notes of the newest version to see if the developers are solving or looking into problems the community is complaining about.","February 11, 2015","true","27.4"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","24","39","3","0"

On a medium or high pop server, it's often near impossible to aquire a gun and ammo. Guns are a rare spawn inside the buildings in large towns. You can try looking for one, but you'll often get killed by other players who already have some. Suprisingly, ammo is even more rare than the guns themselves. You can struggle looking for the correct type of ammo, or go through an inefficient process of turning other ammo into the kind you need. This problem would be easily fixed by implementing a way to craft bullets using scrap metal; and by making gun spawns more common.\n\n- Bases are too easily raided. Considering how many resources it takes to build a base, you'd think it would be difficult for people to damage it. By using a little ethanol, you can easily destroy any base within minutes. All that hard work gone to waste. Bases should take HOURS to destroy; not 5 minutes.\n\nIn conclusion, survival is very fun once you get decent gear and weapons. But after you die or get raided, you'll find it's nearly impossible to get back what you had.","March 4","false","151.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

FINE, refund at your will because SOE will give it back to you without asking why.\n\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n- The player animations, they don't feel right, but they said they are also not satisfied and expect a major change in the future\n- Needs more EU servers (getting a 4h queue time is not fun and most cases people wait for it, and h1z1 closes it self.)\n- Sometimes the inventory bugs out\n- Airdrops needs to be more visible\n- Sound needs improvement, impossible to pinpoint\n- Loot at this stage is almost scarce\n- The "energy" and "water" depletes too much fast making it more time consumption to hunt for berries.\n- Lack of variety of clothing items\n- Lack of customization in the character, at this stage it doesn't exist, character is dull and not appealing.\n- Sometimes there are objects (shelves that we get inside of it, and there is no other way to get out, but if you have a bow and arrows, shoot an arrow to the ground and climb on it [temp fix].\n- Wild life and zombies are still massively lagging, mostly because of the servers overload as of date.\n\n\nThe game is going in the right direction, now they just need to improve and add more cosmetic options, clothes, items.\n\nNOTE: Unrelated coments dropped in this review will get deleted without notice, game needs feedback; not stupid stuff from people that do not understand what an EA - Alpha game is.\n\nThank you for reading.","January 16, 2015","true","226.9"," 111 of 203 people (55%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","55","111","203","17","4"

Time gaps where nothing eventful happened. The only gameplay is on PVE servers as I only want to play the game itself not worry about other players/trolls/hackers who just want to f$%# with people.\n\nDay 1 - Install game.  Find server.  Start game.  Play for 3 hours, find AK47 but no ammo yet.  Finish the session with a new friend in Zimms Hardware Store.  Log off.\n\nDay 2 - Decide to play in different server because new friend had a base already on said server.  Spawn again, but this time use the "shred pants to make a bow and arrows" gimmick, makes the first hour easier when I get attacked by a wolf.  Friend gives me backpack to make resource gathering for my own base easier.\n\nDay 4 - Find unclaimed ground tamper, claim and begin building base.  Now fully equipped with military backpack, recurve bow, night vision goggles, and laminated body armor.  Also have shotgun.\n\nDay 5 - Internet connection times out in Romero's parking lot, die without knowing what killed me.  Respawn and make my way back to base.  Thankfully, friend found my corpse and saved as much of my equipment as he could carry while I made my way across 7/8 of the map with no pants.\n\nDay 7 - Base almost finished, upper wall half completed and have two lookout towers.  Full setup including workbench, rainwater collector and barbeque. Lots of equipment and supplies stored in base as I am beginning to think my character just might be able to survive the apocalypse.\n\nDay 8 - Find car.  So happy as I carry around a car battery and sparkplugs when exploring just in case I manage to find one.  Get Jeep running and take back to base. Car is parked in base.  Inside my shack getting more biofuel for Jeep and resupplying for expedition to Rancho Taquito (I've never been there as I didn't want to go on foot) when suddenly another player starts lobing grenades into my base.  Before I know it the vehicle that I had spent over a week trying to find was destoyed after being in my posession for less than 20 minutes.  I followed the player across town in an attempt to ascertain why he felt the need to destroy my Jeep, seeing as if he had just asked I would have taken him for a ride with me wherever he wanted to go.  But he stopped on the first safe ground he found and logged off without a word.\n\nDay 9 - I will find a new game to play, because when I play a game I play for the experience/story, and chalk this up to another reason why I usually do not buy online-multiplayer games.  Because for people like me, it is gamers who ruin games.  If H1Z1 becomes a offline standalone game, or gives players the option to create a host/closed server for friends only, I may reconsider my opinion of this game.  As it is, I cannot recommend it in it's current state because I do not think it is fun/entertaining to spend a week trying to complete a (albeit self-assigned) objective, only to have some          a-hole destroy it the minute I complete it, for absolutely no reason.","July 31, 2015","false","103.5"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","13","19","2","0"

It's just a copy of a regular survival game like the others in the world-wide internet. the game completely copied by any way from few species of games, which means that you copied some ideas that I've been seen already. and I don't mind. really. the only funny thing in-game is the Battle Royal. but everything else is just useless. PVE has a bad performences, and everything seems like you just wanted to create a game and release it. game performences by the engine sucks, what means most of the people uses config to lower their graphics to match your "requirements". Although. there is alot of thing that is missed in-game such, and here is a List of few of them.\n\nEngine Performences:\nSince you are formerly SOE I hoped atleast you to have better server and game performences. why so? because thing about that people such as casual gamers who attend to play in your games every day, throw money on you everyday for exclusive items, but what people want. just a smoothly well done game. I'm not talking about EARLY ACCESS because I've been experienced alot of games who been in "Early Access Session" and they still on it. but they keep to work on the engine performences, and why? because they want people to have the best. for an example. even with Titan X you can't run H1Z1 smoothly, why? because you get FPS Drops every five seconds. in city, in forests and so on.\n\nVisual Scripting:So-.. It really looks like you haven't put much effort on the game. and I'm not talking about that the "case" things copied from somewhere else, or having bases which came from somewhere else. but I know "nothing is reserved" when it comes to systems in survival games. the car mechanic sucks, whenever who has speed as a porsche with a small jeep, the turning directions are too sharp, you must have to work on the game vehicle technic itself.\n\nUnique Ideas: So the only thing that has pop on my mind, is that "Battle Royal" or as it called by it's genre "Last one standing" mode. is the only thing in-game that makes it more unique, and why so? because the maps in-game. or I most say "the whole map" is too small. which means having 200 players in a session, fighting eachother in frustrating situations. the mode is kinda fun and I think it's the only thing that makes the game unique from the others.\n\nMods:PVP / PVE - So-.. from the short time I've played this game  and I have been played survival games for years  this mode sucks. why? because the materials spawn rarely, crafts are unable to achive since every person can camp in somewhere and hunt your ♥♥♥. and I know it's survival. but having outposts for every player it's a bad idea. since there is some people that can abuse it, also I don't see any difference and whats makes you unique from DayZ or ArmA III or any other survival games that comes up. Let's take a look about the looting system. most of the "materials" are hidden in cars, which is sucks, which is a result from laziness, and why I say so? because SOE. really in DCUO you put much effort than all the games in your company, and I played DC and I saw that everything , even the little ones you put effort on them. and thats what I like. what I see in H1Z1 is just a result of lazy programmers, who developed the mods boring so people can stick up to Battle Royal and get bored every hour or two.\n\nForgot to mention, would you like please to fix the "unconnectable server issue" that I can't patch my game or just click player?  Thank you.\n\nThats all. it's a long review. but I think thats everything I said by playing some hours ingame.","September 29, 2015","false","30.1"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

How dare they try and experiment with interesting sources of monetisation after they present the most well polished and detailed open world we have seen in Multiplayer videogame history\n\n3- HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW THAT ITS PAY TO WIN?!?!\nNow this might blow some of ur zombie fukn sheep brains out of you skulls but.\nGame is in alpha correct?\na) Loot spawns seem to be glitched or cannot cope with the high population of people in the game making                       finding guns\nb) Doesnt it seem like the plane flies too high, clouds are too thick and flashing lights are not bringt enough?\nTaking these two points into consideration it is completely possible that maybe SOE did intend to make Air Drops contestable but due to buggy item drops and a lack of playtesting, made it impossible to fight for an airdrop. Now that is no excuse they should have improved this by\n-Making air drops more visable\n-fixing item drops in towns (which isnt really their fault considering its the 1st day of playtesting on a mass scale)\n-Making the drop fall further away from the calling player and making the package fall slower, giving other players a chance to steal another players airdrop.\n\n4- I doubt you have got this far but...\nIs it really that much of a disadvantage? People can pay all they want but in the end all it takes is a slight mistake to cost them their beloved dollars woth of airdrop gear, The m1911 seems to be a 1-2 shot instakill with headshots and open world survival is more about the timing and strategy behing fighting than the actual firepower of weapons.\n\n5- Pay to win in a game without winning! What defines winning in such a genre? Is it having the best guns or sickest base?! In a game with no set rules who can define what "winning" is? Are you really that much of a nihilistic dunning krugered autist that you beleive you have to win in order to have fun?\n\nFeel free to argue but most importantly never let a person or group of peoples unified opinions be absolute, Just becuase reddit,4chong,pcgamer,steamreviews,ur best mate,streamers,youtubers and whateverelse are telling you somethign is either bad or somethign is good doesnt not mean it is. All in all its a game and ur in it to have fun, you have paid for it enjoy it and quit crying.\n\nps. I dont endrose this game becuase of the high levels of autism it has induced the community devs pls rethink ur decisions acknowledge you are dealing with some of the highest lvls of asperges in any entertainment community ever.\n\n8/10 pretty good game indepth crafting system something that is lacking in othergames of the genre, Basebuilding and vehicles are also nice, since they are present int he game and not 2 years late and actually function quiete well, The quick degeneration of hunger and thirst while it can be annoying at times also makes the game more intersting as you are always on the lookout for food and water.","January 16, 2015","false","65.7"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","14","21","3","0"

So in a sense if you pay for a drop theres a good chance that it will be someone elses drop lol. So by haveing that aspect this is not a pay to win game.

At the moment I am enjoying this game and I would say to others that it might be worth a purchase, but if you're patient wait for it to be free. You also have to remember when you buy an early accesss game. You're really paying for development and deciding what you want in the game because you think it has lots of potential and looks awesome and you would love to help assist in its production.","January 17, 2015","true","87.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Yes this is early access, which means the game isn't finished. How ever all this game offers now a days are Crates, Skins, and point of view angle changes. We have BIGGER issues like hackers and combat systems that need immediate attention. People can fly around, one shotting players from a mile away, and walking through walls. Melee weapons can't hit wild animals and cars disappear.\nYet what developers are working on is splitting the game in two and charging double for it, Then chit out these half azzed updates on worthless pov angle changes and spewing out these crates, more crates and skins to spend more money on!!! Buy the game Twice and Buy MORE keys.\nThis company is using 'early access' to churn out quick cash. When they are done they will be shut down, collected all the last drop of money they can squeeze out of these crates and retire, while players are left with azz probing hackers and sewage .","May 8","false","453.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There is crafting, base building, freaky music, and stuff creeps up on you which actually sends chills up my spine when it happens. The game has the potential to be a hit. I would say it already will be except for the one fact that all of us know so well in any multiplayer game. It is INFESTED with scripters! The internet is literaly covered with cheat sites trying to pump their hack programs into the circulation. And you of course fall victim to it in game. The most simplest of hacks people use (i have seen sites giving this particular hack away for free) is the esp hack. Which means you can not hide. A scripter can see all your items, any land mine that is placed, and wherever your hiding. It is outlined in a colored box for that scripter to see. Just check out youtube and you will see what your up against in this game. The esp hack alone is game breaking to the honest player in my opinion. Need not even go into much detail on the flying, aimbot, no clip (allows you to enter a base as walls mean nothing) With all this being said, I would say they did a AWESOME JOB creating a game with a good grasp on creativity and fun, but unless they can make guarentee this game will not be hacked, I would say do not look forward to this game. At least not on PC. It is hacker haven and the countless hours and days you devote to farming a arsenal can be lost in a blink of an eye thanks to this.","March 18, 2015","false","441.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

H1Z1 was on a good track back when it was owned by SoE but ever since the game was sold to that investment company it's been downhill. Survival the games main focus was neglected and forgotten in favor of battle royal along with everything else not directly related to BR. The building system is still basic, the zombies are completely nonexistent and worse off they even put in a CSGO and TF2 style crate system and keys because why not right?\n\nThe only reason to buy this game right now is if you want to play battle royal as much as you want for 20 dollars, in the future BR will have a cost attached to it because the devs are now controlled by a greedy investment company who seeks to milk everything they can out of H1Z1, if you buy it for the survival mode you will just be bored and upset after 10~ hours of walking around the super tiny map.

This genre has suffered plenty of embarrasement since its conception and I feel it continues to do so here with H1Z1.\n\nDo youself a favor, save your money here and don't waste your time rewarding greed and lazyiness.","February 8","false","78.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I probably have more hours on it then most. I can genuinely say that if you're looking for a zombie survival game, this is the one to choose. This game has come a long way since first opened to early access alpha. And might I say, it has impressed me all the way. From the GM's to the producers over at Daybreak, they all have a very great idea when it comes to improving and creating a zombie survival game. This game is completely replayable and it will keep you hooked for a long time. Yeah sure, there are bugs and glitches, but I've been there for most of everything so far and I am not disatisfied with the way Daybreak has been handling them. Thank you guys for putting together an amazing game as well as the fact that you maintain and continuously update it. Oh and this game does not require microtransactions to play. The only microtransactions involved in the game allow you to make your character look different by purchasing skins. (Completely optional) and playing the Battle Royale gamemode, Green Dawn. This gamemode is pay to play because by winning, you recieve weapon skins and other special prizes. But you pay event tickets that can be earned just by playing the game so you don't actually have to purchase the tickets to play the gamemode. Between the hours that I have played, I would say that 500 of the hours were devoted to servers and playing with a group of friends in the survival gamemode. The rest of the hours we devoted to playing battle royale. I have won over 30 myself and even more with friends. The game is extremely replayable, as I said before and it is an amazing game.","January 4","true","885.4"," 46 of 82 people (56%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","56","46","82","15","15"

Game images almost all consist of displaying the game showing zombies being included and Game describes itself in steam as follows:\n\nThe H1Z1 virus has destroyed humanity, will you survive? Craft items, scavenge for supplies and build a base to protect yourself from the zombies that lurk in the world. Play Battle Royale to test your skills against 175 other players for rewards and bragging rights on the Leaderboards.\n\nSince the game was released, very little has been done to actually improve the survival aspect of the game that has been evidenced to the community. Base Building is still mainly the same, zombies still the same, map is still the same with the exception of a couple of updated areas.\n\nThe patch ratio between patches that improve survival, BR or are crate related are i'd say about 1:3:3. Any time survival is patched it is mainly only done so as said patch will also benefit the BR aspect of the game. Key examples of this are the lackluster development of the Base Building mechanics (please see ARK & Rust for examples of how base building should be developed) as well as this absolutely no development of the zombies in the game they are all the same aside from visual appearance (again see ARK as example of expanding variety of computer controlled creatures).\n\nLimited map size means that all high loot areas are actually too close together and clumped up for it to be possible to have a chance of survival without overcrowding as everybody builds in close proximity to each other around each high loot zone essentially camping all the resources from anybody else who wishes to access them which essentially ruins the ability for any but a few groups of players to play consistently on a server from wipe to wipe (please see dayz for example of bigger map size which, although may be too large for a faster paced game like H1Z1, gives you an idea as to what kind of map most survival players have in mind for these games. To keep things interesting you could even randomise the maps on reset like you do in rust to keep variety in the game??)\n\nAs per the above, without any focus on what I consider to be three of several important aspects (to list them all would be boring and tedious, please just take my word for it) and an almost exclusive focus on the stream heavy and micro transaction aspect of the game I have taken the time to write my first ever game review on steam, that is how much I would not recommend anybody purchasing this game because is it just mediocre in both aspects. If you want survival please buy either rust or ark, if you want BR please go play arma and if you want skins try TF2 or CSGO i heard those have a lot of them too.\n\nEvem if daybreak were developing the survival aspect, they have said nothing to the survival community so for all intents and purposes they may as well not be and in the end their inability to connect and communicate with a large portion of their playerbase is going to kill their game.\n\nTLDR: please please don't buy, there are better games our there for all aspects of the game.","November 6, 2015","false","639.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
