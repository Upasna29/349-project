Having only one level really exacerbates the weak components of the game. I don't know if this game can be salvaged even from early access. I really struggle to see any positive elements this title has to offer.

Once time runs out, you can either exit to main menu or replay level.\n\nAnd even that little they managed to mess up; there are various bugs regarding clipping (you can fall off map quite easily), objects physics don't work properly (all objects fly off in same direction, now matter from which side you push them), rat's just randomly walk around or stand still (they don't try to escape from your to give some challenge)\n\nAnd worst of all, THERE IS NO CATS IN THIS GAME! Only cat you see is one on main splash screen and that's it! Occasionally in game you can hear "maow" sound, but beside that, there is no other indication that you play as cat.\n\nDon't waste your time with this POS, no matter how much you like cats!\n\nP.S.

May become better as it develops but at the moment there is one lvl and you knock things over, which would be more fun if there was better sound, I dont even think it has music, and when you knock something over it already has a pre-determind way that it is going to fall, so when you walk into a book to push it over it knocks you off as your in the way(most of the time) and from what ive seen there are no leaderboards or anything. Don't buy it at this time unless you have lots of faith in this game and want to get it for a cheaper price, as there is almost nothing to do.

It is worth noting that developer isn't doing anything illegal by doing this but it would be nice to see if they had added onto the assets for a bigger and better map.\n\n* Multiple times throughout my own personal playthroughs I found that my "cat" would fall through the floor that required a restart to play again only to fall through again.\n\n* In its current state the game is extremely boring with the small level and lack of content beyond some books, a couple rats and cups that frequently knock your "cat" over.\n\n* The developers don't even care enough about the game to fix the skybox's black dots, an issue that is apparently easy to fix and shows how little attention to detail the developers had given to this "game".\n\nOverall I would steer clear of this game as it will most likely never leave early access in order to justify how little content and nemerous bugs are in the game. Do not buy it even on a 95% off sale.","February 15","false","0.1"," 163 of 179 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","163","179","4","2"

With Cat Simulator you get to be cat and knock stuff over! That is literally the goal of the game!\n\nWith that being said, I do have to say that the game will need a lot more work and polish, I think it has potential to be one of those off shoot fun timer waster type games that you hop in and play for a little bit to relieve some stress. But I would not buy it in it's current state.\n\nPros\n- Interesting idea for a game, could be fun!\n- You're a cat\n- Low price and small download size.\n\nCons\n- Controls need a little work, sometimes when you jump you will end up hitting an invisible wall and not go where planned.\n- Only one level, since it's in early access, they will probably add more, but right now it's only one.\n- Breakables don't break, I would really like the pottery to break when you knock it off :-)\n\nI did a short video on it if you would like to watch some gameplay, I will do another video when there is an update to the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmR3ASTNHJ4","February 14","false","0.5"," 102 of 118 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","102","118","2","16"

It's one of the most boring, most unimaginative ideas and pieces of execution that I've ever played and a desperae grab especially considering it was made up of assets: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18139\n\nThe premise of the game is that you're a cat, you eat rats and knock over stuff and that's basically what cats do and it's the only thing they do OBVIOUSLY, because it's in a game where you need to be one with the cat so you do the thing every cat does, you eat rats and knock over everything and stack up on points. In case you couldn't tell from my description, the game gets really old, really fast. The game is also extremely buggy including the objects that you need to knock over have only one designated path to go so they can go in the direction you're coming from and maake u go flying away. There is also no skybox, as the unity asset map in the game is meant for a top down RPG, not a Cat Simulator game. You can barely climb the stairs as well, just as the cherry on top of the sh*t. The devs might argue back as one of their main promotions for this game is this "-LOTS of BUGS!" That's them basically admitting that their game is f*cking sh*t. Bugs don't = a good game. Some bugs can be funny, but it doesn't = a better verdict.\n\nThe game looks horrible. This game has a lot of horrible textures in the map. It even looks horrible on the "Fantastic" graphics quality. I want to also bring up that I never fealt like I was a cat, it could have been called "Baby Simulator" and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The only thing that reminded me I was a cat was the often *meow* sound made.\n\nI hate this game even more because I can't really talk much about it because it's just a simple game "You're a cat, you knock things over" that's it. I'm finding it quite hard to justify how much I hate this game out to you, I'm lucky I justified it this well.\n\nPros\n+ Simple\n\nCons\n- Boring gameplay\n- Bugs\n- Bad textures\n\nFinal verdict: 2/10\n\nMy curator page: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","May 23","false","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verifiedterrence/recommended/393390/","verifiedterrence","@#$%in' Terrence ✔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verifiedterrence/","26 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPlease note: I received a free key for the explicit purpose of reviewing this game. No one associated with this game has compelled me to leave positive feedback. Observations and comments, whether positive or negative, are entirely my own.\n\nThis is a videogame. About cats. On the internet. What are you waiting for? @#$%ING GET IT ALREADY. In all seriousness, this is an Early Access game, so don't go into it expecting too much.\n\nThe graphics aren't particularly mind-blowing, but it's easy enough to distinguish between what things are. Likewise, the controls are also very, very simple: WASD for meowvement, SPACE to jump.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there is just one goal. Players must get as meowny points as possible in two ways. The first way is to catch as many rats as possible. Each one will net you a pretty 100 points. The second way is to knock over as many things as pawsible for a measly 5 or 10 points here and there. Doing either is a lot of fun.\n\nWhen it came to bugs, I didn't actually encounter all that many. I fact, to be honest, I'm not sure if most of them were bugs or intentional features.\n\nThe most notable "bug" was that the rats seem to either only spawn when the game starts, or stop spawning at some unknown point. Either way, I ran out of things to catch. Such a shame; I could have quite happily kept meowving along and catching rats for hours.\n\nThe next bug came in the form of collision detection. At times it could be a little tricky to jump over things, or meowneuver out from behind some objects. Then there were the stairs, which I could freely pass through. I also ran into an invisible wall when I was trying to jump through what looked like a pair of large opening or "windows" on the bottom floor.\n\nLastly, the house, or tavern, or inn, has no roof! But that suited me fine, as I'm the kind of cool cat who doesn't mind staring up at the stars.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is that (at the meowment) players don't get to see a pair of cat paws swiping away at rats and books and teacups and the like. As the game is still in Early Access, I hope the developers will incorporate a toggle that adds some blood and guts to the rat-slaying should players so choose. I also think that cat-napping could be a funny way to "refresh" or otherwise incorporate replenishing the timer.\n\nAll in all, though the rounds are quick, there is some senseless fun to be found playing this game. If you don't want to get it meow, then seriously consider buying it in the future!","February 12","true","1.2"," 15 of 509 people (3%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","3","15","509","11","21"
