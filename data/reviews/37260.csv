And, if you pay close attention, you might even recognize some of the themes that are borrowed from the film noir genre and the history during WWII.\n\nI beat the game in roughly seven hours, and it may seem like a short time to beat it, but it felt like I had played it a lot longer than that. It's a really good balance for a point-and-click.\n\nI don't really have any complaints; it's a good game and the story ties up nicely at the end.","March 14, 2014","true","6.9"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

A very lite adventure game experience that gets rid of the tedious non sensical inventory combining puzzles in most adventure games. It is heavily focused on the story and dialogue. It's pretty easy with some minor difficulity but very fair puzzles in the middle, but when you solve the puzzles, you'll feel good about your self. The world, the characters, and the music are all excellent. I'm not the biggest Wizard of Oz fan, but they did a really good job into making this game interesting, and kind of made me interested in the other Oz books. Play it!","January 30, 2013","true","6.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","4"

Many characters from the canonical adventures written by L. Frank Baum make an appearance, and their interpretations in this game are decent. Each character has their own voice, personality, back story (inspired or taken from the books) and motives, although you only get a little taste of what they are like in this world.\n\nThe animation of the characters is passable, the voice acting is mostly decent, although the quality of the audio is iffy at times. Also, there is no actual full screen mode, just a boxed screen. As far as gameplay goes, it's all very straight forward and you won't likely find yourself getting lost often or for very long. It's a shame as the story is pretty engrossing. More challenging gameplay or mind puzzles would have made the game much more enjoyable (I'm not saying it wasn't!) There are also hidden "items" in the world that unlock sketches and concept art, but they aren't difficult to find and you don't have to go out of your way to find them.\n\nI haven't completed the game, but I'm already more than halfway done. Looks like this game tops off at around 5 or 6 hours. There are no branching paths, so there is little to no replayability. I won't give away anything, but what I figured would be a standard private eye story set in the land of Oz actually transformed into something slighly more greater.\n\nSo, should you buy it? $9.99 is a bit pricey for me to say yes, and the only reason I got this game was because of a Steam sale. It wasn't in a bundle, but the premise and price at the time were enough to persuade me to buy.\n\nWait for a price reduction and you'll have a fun and interesting way to kill an afternoon.","July 2, 2014","true","3.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

What I really liked was that the puzzles weren't so difficult that I ended up frustrated and having to pull up a walkthrough. (Why do I always bring up walkthroughs in my recommendations for point-and-click games?)  They and their solutions all made sense.  The story flowed well and it was a nice alternate tale in the Oz universe.\n\nBut I think this game is about drugs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/37260/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","Emerald City Confidential is a point-and-click adventure game where you take on the role of Petra, a private investigator in the Emerald City.  As the name implies, this game is somewhat based on the story of The Wizard of Oz, as there are many characters from the story, like Dororthy and Toto, the Scarecrow, the Lion, and the Tin Man.  It's more like a sequel to the story, though, in that you see how events could have unfolded after the events in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nBasically, the main story starts when Petra is back in her office and there's a mysterious visitor, Dee, who drops in and requests that Petra find a missing person.  We find out soon enough that the mysterious visitor is no other than Dorothy Gale, who is now an honorary princess in Emerald City.  Events unfold and by investigating several places and talking to several people, Petra eventually solves that case, only to have another case fall into her lap, etc.  Well, I won't reveal more since that would obviously spoil the story but there's definitely a huge twist regarding Petra which doesn't get revealed until almost at the very end of the game.\n\nIn addition to the events which unfold the main parts of the story, there are various colored gems that you can collect throughout.  Finding and redeeming them earn you concept sketches and I found them an interesting feature.  XD\n\nOverall, I'd totally recommend this game to anyone who loves adventure type games and a good story.  (I forgot to mention but I do love the voice acting in this game.  I thought the voices fit very well with the characters.)  I'd hope for a sequel but due to rights and all that, there sadly won't be one.  Still, I'd recommend this game and if you want to pass this time, definitely a must have.  ^^","April 23","true","9.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I really like that it takes place a sequel to the books rather than the movie since those are what I really like.  The puzzles are rather on the easy side, but I suppose they want this one to be playable by both kids and adults.  I really hope there are sequels  :-)\n\nIt is VERY short though.

I quite enjoyed this and it's a nice short adventure game that I recommend to most anyone willing to have a go with it, not to mention it's quite cheap and easy to find online.\n\nUnlike other Oz based things I've seen recently, this game adds to the lore instead of alters it and holds a lot of references to all the many different areas of Oz that you get to travel outside of the emerald city. You soon find yourself getting involved in a conspiricy that could plunge Oz into danger.","January 9, 2013","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Honestly speaking, I have to admit that I came accross this game by chance, but what a chance it was! I really loved it!\nAt its core, this is what you might call a casual-adventure indie game. The riddles might be quite obvious to the experienced  player, but still it is a nice one to play through. The story actually evolves very well and keeps the player engaged with the plot and whats going on. Truth be told, it might probably not rank among the greatest of all-time adventures, but if you enjoy playing one every now and then you can't do much wrong, even though if you are not - or never have been - into the "Oz"-story, just like me.","January 21, 2011","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Probably not worth full price, UNLESS you're a fan of the Oz books.\n\nYes, that's right--this is set in a sort of noir alternate take on the universe of the Oz BOOKS (not the movie).   If you're familiar with the books, it's great fun to spot the characters and see what has been done with them.\n\nThe story is okay, given the premise of a noir version of Oz (where Baum's Oz, of course, is almost by definition the opposite of noir).  It starts out well but the ending feels rushed.  (The glaring flaw, of course, is that you can spot the "surprise" a mile away if you are able to recognize the characters from the books and thus distinguish the few who were invented for the game.) This is mitigated by the delight of encountering Jack Pumpkin-Head, Tik-Tok, Hank the donkey, and a proper Toto who actually talks (but usually doesn't).","January 3, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is quite short.I think it took me about 5 hours to complete. In that sense it probably is a bit expensive but it is good entertainment.\n\nThe gameplay style is like an old Lucas Arts adventure in the sense you are mostly solving inventory and conversation based puzzles. The puzzles are logical but a bit easy.\n\nIt has a light-hearted, mock film-noir plot that is (obviously) not exactly mature but still well written and chock full of geekery about Frank Baum's original Oz books and plays.\n\nThe art is nice, the interface very straightforward, nice voice acting and a  forgettable but adequate score\n\nOne bad thing:\nI was worried at the start about how easy it seemed to be. In particular when the main character gets a new objective you get alerted with a properly in your face, fruit-machine style pinging and flashes of colour. The first objectives are really basic - they only require a step or two. I started thinking that of the main character succesfully managed to open an unlocked  door I might get a ping, a gem and an overly sparkly  achievement.\n\nBut it got better. The objectives got to be mildly challenging and the story is properly engaging.\n\nSo I recommend this game although I think the playtime should put it at £5. If you've got a ten year old who likes adventure games they'll probably be a excited as I was playing Monkey Island back in the day.","January 12, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're a fan of Oz... I'm not so sure since a lot of the characters act differently than I remember.  There's alot of emphasis on Petra, Jinjur and Scarecrow, but it doesn't really go anywhere with respect to the later two.  The most development is with Petra yet there's still alot of her back story that's just barely touched on.\n\nOne thing that bothered me, despiste the voice acting being okay was the use of similar sounding voices (probably same voice actor).  It was distracting and threw me at times. (Like Osma and Jinjur sounding alike)\n\nI would have liked to see more than just cameo appearances with characters we have come to love and enjoy and I would have liked a better explanation for the differences in their behaviour.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the game, but felt that it was cramming a lot of stuff in without giving enough detail on everything they were introducing.  Would have liked to have dealt with all four witches and would have preferred a better resolution with  the revelation on who Cutter really is (even though you can guess at it so early on in the story that's it's not really a big surprise.)\n\nI think this game could have been amazing if they had spread it out into several  more games.
