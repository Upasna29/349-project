The assets load on the fly\n2. Some levels and some bosses are easier (Has less hazards) than other versions\n\nDon't get me wrong, tho.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarbaricAvatar/recommended/377460/","BarbaricAvatar","BarbaricAvatar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarbaricAvatar/","204 products in account","By far the hardest of the Chicken Invaders trilogy on Steam (CI3,4,5). As someone who gets frustrated easily, i find this title a little beyond acceptable in the sadism stakes. I'll explain why.\nIn most of the traditional top-down or bullet-hell shooters i've played there is a pattern to foes, there are gaps between projectiles, there are tactics to be learned, there is timing to be practiced. Chicken Invaders 3 keeps up with these traditions for the most part, but is ruined by a handful of levels which throw these features out of the window. You can be having the best run of your life, having practiced and learned the movements of foes and general projectile release ideas and filled in the rest with your own reactions and nous. Then you reach a level called "Chicken Square Dance" or "Chicken Geometry" which are completely random and invade all possible safe-spaces without any measurable consistancies or rotas. It's not projectiles that get in the way, it's the foes themselves you'll get wiped-out by.\nIt's REALLY annoying.\n\nThe end-zone bosses are more imaginative than in CI5, but the keyboard repetition sensor is not as good as in either of the two sequels so you can't fire as quickly in this game, also the weapons overheat a lot more easily.\n\nDo i recommend it? Hmmmm. It's not as good as CI4; that game is this series' peak, but i do think CI3 is better than CI5 (which i gave a thumbs-down to). Yes, i would recommend it but only as an introduction to the series or for those who like their shooters to be bordering on unfair. But seriously, just get CI4 if you only want to buy one of these titles.","February 23","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
