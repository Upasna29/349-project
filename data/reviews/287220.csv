"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/287220/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you first hear the name Autocraft you might just think you’re dealing with some kind of Warcraft clone with cars here. Let me reassure you that it doesn’t come even close. In reality this is a fun game for all of those who have ever played with Lego or K’nex. That’s exactly right; Autocraft wants you to use your imagination again.\n\nFirst and foremost this is a puzzle game, but building stuff is also a very important part of the game. There aren’t any real objectives except to get to the goal. You start off in ‘building’ mode where you have the opportunity to build a vehicle. At first, this will be a car, but a few levels in you’ll be building an airplane and later on even boats and robots, among other things.\nEvery couple of levels you’ll learn something new to do so it gradually teaches you all the things you can do. These ‘tutorials’ aren’t too deep. As a matter of fact you’ll be doing everything yourself. The game doesn’t limit you to the developers’ ideas, it allows you to experiment with things yourself and maybe you can even find a different way to do things. I do have to admit that this is pretty hard in the beginning, because you only have a limited amount of building blocks available and you’re probably going to need them all just to understand the game’s mechanics. Still, it’s possible.\nAnd I wouldn’t say it’s impossible but it’s damn hard to get to the end of the level without crashing at least once. Building things is a learning process and a fun experience in itself. It’s very satisfying to see a crafted vehicle do exactly what you want it to do.\nI haven’t mentioned the controls yet but they’re really easy to use. Just dragging objects onto other objects will attach them to each other. You can smoothly and quickly drag them to other places, too and by keeping Control pressed you can quickly add the same parts to other pieces and by pressing and holding Alt you’ll be able to quickly delete specific parts. Easy as pie.\nAs I said there aren’t any real objectives but there are optional objectives you can complete like setting a speed record, collecting a star (‘hidden’ somewhere in the level) or by using a specific amount of blocks. Completing these objectives will earn you more (different) blocks that you can use in Sandbox mode where you can express your imagination and creativity more freely.\nSandbox mode is exactly what it sounds like. You select a level and you start building things with the blocks you have acquired. You’ll also be able to load objects from other users into your levels and then just have fun with them. Fans of Lego and K’nex will have an excellent time here, even if interaction with objects is fairly limited.\nThe game, at the moment of writing, has 37 levels to complete. The first couple of levels are easy and can be seen as an introduction to the game really, but around level 10 things start to get more difficult. You can play this until the end of time, but if you’re going to finish just the levels then you should be able to complete them between 10-20 hours I think. It depends on several factors so as you can understand it’s a very rough estimate.\n\nAs far as the graphics are concerned Autocraft looks really beautiful. This is the first game, I think ever, that reminded me of Mario Galaxy. The graphics have the same style with lots of colors and specific shading. It looks beautiful in motion and the screenshots don’t do it justice. Not entirely, at least. One thing I would like to see though, are more animated objects in the background. It feels a little barebones sometimes, but you’re usually probably too busy building anyway.\nThe music is kind of subtle but what’s there is calm and soothing, and maybe even a bit futuristic. It’s well done. As for the sounds; crashing, using your engines and blocks connecting with each other all sound realistic enough to keep you immersed.\n\nAutocraft is a fun game that’s all about completing puzzles by building vehicles. If you ever played Turbo Dismount but wanted more freedom and creativity then this is the game for you. I had a great time with it and I’m sure many share that sentiment. I know the game isn’t yet complete, but I’m positive the quality will only improve (it’s already very polished). I’m curious to see what the final product will be like. Recommended !\n\n[Rating: 79/100]","October 27, 2014","true","4.3"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","55","72","6","8"

But what disappointed me the most out this was that the game seems to be abandoned, with no new updates for nearly five months.\n\nIn all, this game had potential in it's earlier stages, but nothing was done with it and it ended up bland and no different than any other game.

It still has a lot of room to grow but shows promise. Autocraft gives players a freedom to approach puzzles that most other games of its kind lack and the achievements for each problem, now a staple of the genre, add real depth to the Build Challenges. With Autocraft in Early Access, I'm curious to see how the developers might implement the weapons systems to mix up this deeply enjoyable logic game and its stellar physics engine.","October 15, 2014","true","2.2"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","33","44","0","0"

In Autocraft's challenge mode you are given objectives to complete on different maps and you must build a vehicle with the parts you are given to complete these objectives.

The only real problem with Autocraft is there is not enough to do, the challenges are fun but are not plentiful enough, and a lack of a multiplayer mode at least in sandbox makes the game lose your interest quickly. However with more challenges and gamemodes added, I’m sure that Autocraft will be something to pick up in the near future.","October 15, 2014","true","15.2"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","30","42","0","0"

It takes a decent amount of imagination and creativity to advance, which is probably the best part about this game. There are 2 game modes at the moment with possibly more to be added in the future. The challenge mode has been my favorite so far and kinda acts as like a Story mode giving you misions to do, although there is no story, the objectives are quite fun to complete. It can also be quite difficult, especially if you try to get all the obejectives done. You are given certain and limited amount of parts to build your craft and reach your objective, which may be way off in space, around a huge mountain, or across a deadly gap. It can be as frustrating as it is funny trying to complete the given objectives, I've definitely experienced a bit of both. Completing the objectives in Challenge mode unlock extra parts to be used while playing in Sandbox Mode. So far I've played mainly the Challenge mode, As it kind of interests me a little more than Sandbox at the moment, but I did dip into it a little and I will eventually make some ridiculous vehicle and find the secrets that the SB world has to offer. As of writing this review, I honestly haven't experienced any game breaking bugs. The game is in EA so if you buy in, please keep that in mind. The developers also look like they are keeping up with the forums quite well and communicating with the community, which is a great thing we all love to see.

This one has "Challenges" which are small levels that you have to complete with limited parts, earning extra stars for beating a time limit, not breaking your craft, collecting stars (duh) and similar tasks - think small obstacle course. The whole game feels very sandboxey, from the cardboard tube sturdiness of your craft to the low-poly simplistic level design; and indeed the sandbox mode seems to be where it's at for most reviewers.\n\nAs a game, Autocraft leaves a lot to be desired (the ability to fire your gun without activating the thrusters, for one thing). Mostly, I suspect that the devlopers use the Unity physics angine as-is and don't really understand that much about physics modeling, which kinda breaks the game and my constructions: getting stuck in the ground from the "Play" button in level 1 (tip: use 4 wheels to be safe) to the general brittleness of everything that makes matchsticks look like a superior building material to the general uncontrollabity of everything. (I haven't found the "wiring" touted on the store page.) Some things can be easily remedied before Autocraft goes out of Early Access: gamepad support, a better introduction than to drop players in the first level with help that still leaves you wondering why you can build something with wheels that you can't control (you have no energy source, and no steering wheels in level 1); but the fact that I'm fighting the physics engine more than the level challenges means that the game is likely to stay a sandbox with extras for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo, yeah, if are bored of the physics sandboxes you have and want a new one, give this try; if you're looking for a game, it's probably too early to access this one.\n\nUpdate: I put some more time in this game, and found out that in later levels, when you have built something and go into "edit parts" mode, you can select parts on your vehicle and change some parameters, most importantly the activation key. This actually provides for a modicum of control, and now I am recommending this game to players who like to tinker and don't mind an "unfinished" feel about everything.","September 13, 2015","false","4.0"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","21","36","0","2"

Well worth its money, although when i  got it, the campaign/challenges weren't too long, but since it is being updated frequently, the campaign has grown and the sandbox is damn fun so you always have something to do... this would be freaking epic with workshop and i think they are working on it.

What I like about it is that the gameplay is fairly openand there are a certain number of challenges to keep things entertaining.  I enjoy the fact that the environment in the game changes as you go along, and that there is no perfect solution to getting your vehicle where it needs to go.  The results of a bad idea can also be pretty hilarious to watch.  It is a unique concept insofar as I can tell, and elements of it bring the player back to building cub cars as a child [except the track for cub cars was boring].  The physics are nice and satisfying, and the graphics are pretty.\n\nThe only thing I can really say wrong about this game is that the sandbox in particular requires a little too much guts for my crappy old laptop, but it is 5 years old [and poorly maintained =(] so I can't really fault the game for that and I'm sure the average user won't have problems with it at all.  I've found that I can play in the smaller sandbox levels, so even my crappy computer can let me make whatever I want to.","January 16, 2015","true","9.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

At present, there's nothing to justify spending $10 on this game, so don't do that unless you're very dedicated to supporting the developers. The last news update seems to have been in August 2015 as of now (I'm writing this in late November). I got the game on sale for less than $3, and sure, it's worth something around that price. You've almost certainly seen games like this before. It's a 'physics sandbox' in which you craft vehicles, and then pilot them through increasingly complex obstacle courses (there's also a sandbox mode with no goals except those you impose yourself). The graphics are minimalist; I like the style, but the game has not been optimized, and runs quite slowly for its appearance. It's... alright. I'm curious to see where it leads, but there's certainly tons of work left before it's a complete enjoyable game.","November 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/recommended/287220/","bolm","Gänseblümchen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/","593 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn-depth video review is now released! If you prefer a written form, check out the text below!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz5LLG8zOR8\n\nLet’s talk about the aesthetics of Autocraft first, and I will be supremely direct here. It seems to me that the game tries to hinge on the simple graphical fidelity train that Minecraft started. Most models seem deliberately low in their polygon count, leading to this peculiar art style, which could be okay if it would not be as highly inconsistent as it currently is. For example when looking at the astronaut, the model is actually quite detailed, thus creating a harsh contrast. Moreover, the choice of colours and in general the shading of the objects (I don’t even want to say texturing, as there is no real texture to it) seems inspired by smooth pastels, which again contrasts the rest of the aesthetics in terms of providing futuristic, edgy models. The overall appearance suggests that the developer does not know which way the game is supposed to look, lacking a clear artistic vision. The missing anti-aliasing does the rest to inflict screen flickering on your eyes wherever possible. Suffice to say, Autocraft does not give a good impression in terms of graphical fidelity. The same can be said about the overall sound design. Generic, monotone background tracks trot along while you are playing, never peaking interest or requiring any attention.\n\nBut technical facets do not necessarily make a good game bad and horrible gameplay is not rescued just by splendid graphics. Therefore, let’s talk about the core of Autocraft: the gameplay, consisting of building vehicles and afterwards steering them through the physics simulation to reach a certain point on the map. The building aspects of the game are actually decent. The camera can be rotated freely, parts mostly react like you would expect and all parts snap to the backbone of your vehicle making the building rather intuitive. Additionally you can remap the keys required to steer interactive parts, thus allowing fancy mechanisms if you are creative enough about it. Sadly, Autocraft wastes said potential as you are mostly required to limit yourself incredibly to reach the bonus star requirements. Additionally, even when you try fancy things, they usually end up not working as intended and often a simple solution of flying plane, rocket or standard car is the solution to every level I have encountered. What is the point of a wacky building game, if we can’t creatively use the level design to design vehicles of our weird twisted minds?\n\nImmediately when taking your firsts transport out for a ride, you will notice that the physics engine is so obviously terrible that you wonder which, if any, laws of physics have been applied to Autocraft. The worst part is again inconsistency. In a particular level, I was pressing W constantly and restarting in between to display how broken the simulation is. Even though the vehicle is spawned in the same spot over and over, and even though I just press W constantly, thus accelerating constantly, the bounces, breaks and side-ways reactions seem utterly random. If your game consists of essentially one gameplay element, you better make sure it is darn good, and currently the physics of Autocraft are anything but that.\n\nAt least I got a mild chuckle out of Autocraft when taking roughly ten minutes to build a giraffe, which I then took for a leisurely stroll through the sandbox mode. Seriously, these are the things I would want to do in a crazy building game like this. Huge machines, completely unreasonably flying vehicles and rocket boosted drag racers. Well, you could build rocket boosted drag racers, but Autocraft fails to display any sense of momentum, thus the whole endeavour is actually quite boring.\n\nOverall, even in its early access state, I have to say I do not see a bright future for Autocraft. The inconsistencies throughout the game are frustrating and frankly there are too many other good competitors in this genre for Autocraft to take off. The ideas are interesting, but in terms of execution it seems as if the developers are crushed below the weight.","November 23, 2014","false","1.7"," 27 of 58 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","27","58","2","0"

For those who have played Banjo & Kazooie Nuts & Bolts let me just say that this game is a  lot like that. You have to build vehicles in a certain way to complete certain challenges to get more parts for sandbox. The sandbox in this game is a lot like the Test-O-Track, in Nuts & Bolts, you can bring your creations in there, drive around, and cause chaos. Now there are a few problems that i hope the develpers do fix shortly. I just bought this game on February 27th, 2015, i went into sandbox mode and started to build. the only problem was that there was no inventory option, just preset blocks on my hotbar, After that i decided to walk around and i fell off the map and i did not die or respawn i just kept falling and i couldn't even exit the game. Now they just released a short patch and i noticed that they fixed it. there is now a inventory menu and i can now set my hot bar, and i can fall off the map and respawn (not that it really mattered anyway.), But now i can not build any vehicle. there is no grid that appears nor can i take the bolck and put it on the block that is floating in the air above me. Is there something i am doing wrong here? Is my game broken? Whatever the probelm is i would appreciate it if the developers fixed this problem as soon as they can. i also have one suggestion for this ghame and that is to make it a multiplayer game so others can invite friends to their sandbox game. I think that would be a nice addition to the game. Anyway dispite the minor problems this game has, it is a good game and it has a lot of potential and i do see this becoming a successful sandbox game.","February 28, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're looking for something like this, but has so much more, I simply recommend sticking with a studio that has a better reputation and a better game under it's belt such as Space Engineers.","April 13","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
