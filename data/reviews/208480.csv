"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ggabssong/recommended/208480/","ggabssong","kimchiman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ggabssong/","257 products in account","So, I was reading the reviews before I started playing this game and some of them were quite negative and even said not to buy this game if you much enjoyed assassin's creed 2 series. While I tremendously enjoyed the second series including Brotherhood and Revelations, I decided to give the third one a go regardless of those negative reviews.\n\nAfter thirty hours of playtime and completing the story, I can say I love this game as much as I love the previous ones.\n\nHowever, there's a very clear line between things I like and I don't like about this game, soI think it is better to categorize them into different sections.\n\nI LIKED:\n\n- Beautiful graphics and magnificent environments.\n- Smooth and fast motions in combats.\n- Great background music\n- Fun naval combats. I hugely enjoyed these naval combats and wished there were more of them.\n- Homestead missions. I loved homestead missions and enjoyed watching the community grow. It gave me similar enjoyment from watching Esperanca grow back in Assassin's creed 2. (I genuinely enjoyed the missions too. I couldn't stop smiling when Norris ran into Connor, shouting with joy, "She said yes!")\n- The characters. Very dynamic characters with superb voice acting. Storyline is a weak point but these characters make the storyline much more interesting than it really is.\n- Historicals. I personally think that this one delivers the most detailed portraits of the in-game era so far in the series.\n\nI DISLIKED:\n\n- I'm gonna be straight up. I didn't like the ending.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ was it. I see at the time they were trying to leave questions and wonders for the upcoming series, but it was completely out of nowhere. Probably the weakest ending I've seen in the series.\n\n- Controls.\n\nThey made some changes regarding the controls but I'm pretty sure for those of you who enjoyed playing assassin's creed 2, you wouldn't like this new control. The way you counter is changed and has become more difficult to endeavour. Also, with the new control, you can't prevent yourself from climbing everywhere while you are running. So, you'd have to walk if you don't wanna end up climbing everywhere.\n\n- Inconsistent missions. There are few non-animus missions happening in various places. The very existence of these missions is questionable and put unwated pauses when you are playing.\n\n- Slow beginning. Takes about 5 hours of gameplay to actually become an assassin.\n\n- Some new changes like trading and crafting, but they lack initiatives both fun-wise and need-wise.\n\n\nYou see how the thing I didn't like are quite detailed compared to the things I like. If you look at some of the details they newly implemented, you might start complaining about the game. But on a big picture, I strongly think this is a great and fun game to play.","February 5, 2015","true","32.2"," 89 of 91 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","89","91","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/persianshawn/recommended/208480/","persianshawn","Shawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/persianshawn/","330 products in account","After playing this game for more than 60 hours, I believe I can give a pretty comprehensive review of the game.\n\nWhere to start? After finishing the 2:d game and its sequels, the fan base had a lot of expectations of the next installment in the series. Some were met, others weren't. Unfortunately, the latter scenario proved to be truer than the former. Needless to say, the game came as quite a surprise when it first hit the internet, people being surprised at a sequel.\n\nIt's obvious from the get go that Ubisoft built almost everything from scratch, and it sure looks that way, with improved graphics, a fluid and satisfying fight-mechanism and the introduction of epic naval warfare. One cannot help but feel excitement when experiencing all of this within the game's first sequences. With that said, the intro-part of the games proves to be far to long and redundant, almost to the point that it feels like one enormous tutorial that you have to suffer through. It's not until some good 3-4 hours that you get introduced to the Assassin's Creed the fans are so familiar with. It's obvious Ubisoft had good intentions, also mentioning how they wanted the 3:d part in the series to be a great addition but also a great intro for newcomers to the AC games, whilst it might've helped those new to the series, it sure backfired on those already familiar with the series.\n\nFurthermore, it feels like the game suffers from identity crisis: introducing new graphics, a new setting, new mechanics, naval battles etc. but can't connect all of these new element into one cohesive game, easy for the players to digest. It rather feels like rollercoaster. Moments when you're out on the sea for the first time feels so epic that nothing can't beat it, only to have that special moment destroyed by introducing the player to characters that are hard to connect with, and as such making it a letdown. The same applies to all the other parts of the game, most notably the character-development. Even if Connor might not be the most charismatic Assassin we've seen, he sure have his reasons for being so, presented well done by Ubisoft, but it's just not enough to emphasize on the main characters, it's rarely the player cares for others in the game (with the homestead missions being a rare example). There was so much potential here with so many interesting characters presented to us (not to mention Benjamin Franklin whose only purpose in the game is so bleak, he's almost a non-existent one.). The Washington DLC:s were obviously a shot at character-development, but it just wasn't enough and came far too late to make the overall game any better.\n\nAll in all, Assassin's Creed 3 is a disappointment. Not only to veterans to the series, but also to those who are new to the series. The ideas are well presented, almost flawless. But it doesn't help much when the whole game doesn't feel connected and feels more like a well-crafted mess. Nonetheless, the good parts are so good that they lift the game, but ultimately the lack of a cohesive story and under-developed characters, lowers the game's overall quality.\n\nI'll give this game 3 bloody revolutions out of 5!","November 25, 2013","true","66.9"," 314 of 409 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","314","409","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/208480/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Assassin's Creed III features the silliest and most self-defeating mission design in the the series' history, and it's a huge shame. When it isn't directly hamstrung by constrained mission areas, flakey AI, and imprecise movement, it manages to steer you into the path of these flaws anyway with optional objectives that encourage you to game the system - and Assassin's Creed III's systems do not hold up well to gaming. When full sync bonuses were introduced in Brotherhood, they were designed to encourage creative use of the tools at your disposal. Here they more often tamp down your options, exposing the emptiness of the game underneath.There's a lot more to an Assassin's Creed game than its missions, but the fifth in the series drops the ball with such regularity that it resonates through the entire experience. A pervasive sense of frustration is the snare drum that accompanies Assassin's Creed III on its march through the American revolution. You undertake that march - for the most part - as Connor, a young assassin with a British father and a Native American mother. Connor's quest to negotiate a future for his people against the backdrop of revolutionary war is well written and often well acted. The game's treatment of issues of race, class, democracy and empire even manages to be insightful.Characterisation is strong. Connor will get some flak simply for not being Ezio, but he comes into his own in the second half of the game. Assassin's Creed III has a cracking villain, too, in a senior British Templar that the writers seem to like more than they do their ostensible lead. The game suffers for a lack of female characters - the only real exception being Connor's mother, who after a brief period of activity retreats from the stage to usher in the series' next male protagonist.Puppeteer-style controls are gone, replaced with traditional keybindings: interact, attack, secondary weapon and so on. The verisimilitude suggested by the old arms, legs and head system has been lost, but the new way is clearer and for the most part it's a worthy change.Counter-riposte combos are still the dominating force in combat, but what exactly constitutes a riposte has been diversified: firing lines mean grabbing an enemy to use as a shield, and heavy foes are better responded to with quick, aggressive jabs at their defences than waiting for them to attack. No more Ezio-style multi-man murder sprees spring from a single tap of the attack button. The game looks substantially better on PC but otherwise this is an underwhelming port. Keyboard and mouse controls can't be rebound and feel like an afterthought.The root of my issue with Assassin's Creed III is this: that for as much  stuff  as it provides, the amount that it actually allows you to do feels thinner than ever. A vast amount of its content can be reduced to 'get from A to B and push a button', and stealth rarely strays from minigame territory. Assassin's Creed III's basic mechanics fare much better in multiplayer, where human opponents - or allies, in the co-op Wolfpack assassination challenges - provide the depth and dynamism that the single-player game lacks. The other area where the game excels comes entirely from left field: naval combat.Connor moonlights as a privateer captain in a series of optional sea missions that thread in and out of the main plot. During these you take the helm of an Assassin frigate, barking orders at your men and steering your warship into broadsides and boarding actions. It's absolutely spectacular - weather and ocean effects create a phenomenal sense of place, and control is just arcadey enough to be exciting while retaining the heft associated with 18th century naval warfare. Assassin's Creed III rises above mediocrity by virtue of its ambition, its writing, and the set-piece moments where its best ideas form ranks and push. It's the sequel that proves that a revolutionary rethink is needed, but not the sequel that pulls it off.","October 25, 2014","true","94.1"," 94 of 123 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","94","123","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ank501/recommended/208480/","Ank501","Ank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ank501/","1595 products in account","Assassin's Creed III is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft and also the next instalment of the Assassin's Creed series. Assassin's Creed III is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed: Revelations.\n\nDesmond has regained his conscious and is now back in action. Desmond, Rebecca, Shaun and now his father, have traveled to the Grand Temple of "Those Who Came Before", an ancient race of powerful beings who created humankind before a global calamity thousands of years before the events of the game made them almost extinct and ravaged the Earth. There, Desmond needs to uncover how to open the secrets in the temple, but on his arrival, Desmond then falls into a fugue state, to which Desmond is returned to the Animus and bleeds back to Haytham Kenway.\n\nAssassin's Creed III has many major overhaul on the gameplay, some might think this good, some will not. The setting now takes place in the 18th century, in the North American continent, on the city of Boston, New York and the frontiers of America. This mean, we can expect less building to be climbed but instead replaced with tree running and jumping, somehow like Tarzan. This style of gameplay can offer a new way to play Assassin's Creed. The game also feature many mini games and animal hunting, a new way to earn some money in the game. The combat system are also improved here, some may find this easier or harder but it makes the combat feels more epic. Stealth have been completely overhauled with new features, such as double-counters, multiple takedowns, and chain kills. New heavy weapons type also present, the musket rifle, you can use it in melee combat with its attached bayonets or just fire it. And when the enemies are about to fire at you with rifle or pistol, you can use a human shield to protect yourself. The best part of the new gameplay is naval combat. It's so epic. You command your own ship and crew, and engage in many naval battles including the battle that involves the American and British navy. Assassins recruit are different in this game, its harder for you to recruit Assassins as the only way to do that is doing liberation missions. There are still many feature of the game that yet you can try.\n\nGraphics then. I must say, the game has far better graphics, textures, effects and better animation which make movement feels so smooth. The effects are also incredible. Assassin's Creed III does has better and improved graphics. The downside is the blinding white loading screen. Seriously they can use blue or maybe grey but white? It burns your eye when the game is loading a map, level or save games. Some minor graphics glitch also still present in the game. Despite that, the game runs optimized for me.\n\nMultiplayer has also been expanded in this sequel. New gamemodes where you have to work together to assassinate a target has been added. But Ubisoft seems to have decided to add a microtransactions in the multiplayer. That can be good or bad. But seriously the game is expensive already.\n\nOverall, Assassin's Creed III has better gameplay and graphics, the naval combat are the most epic part of the game. But the story isn't that interesting. Maybe because the main characters, Ratonhnhaké:ton or by his family name, Connor Kenway is just boring. Compared to Ezio and Altaïr, Connor is just plain I think. Other than that, this game is good.\n\nRating 7/10","June 1, 2014","true","28.5"," 113 of 156 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","113","156","0","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4furuta/recommended/208480/","4furuta","Furuta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4furuta/","182 products in account","The AC franchise has been built on a model of innovative gameplay, including fluid free-running, fast-paced combat, fascinateing story elements and intriguing and challenging puzzles. AC III takes a huge step backward in many of these elements, presenting a puzzling combination of frustrating circumstances that leads any fan of the series to wonder "WTF?!" Out loud. While yelling.\n\nFirst, the good. AC III is the first game in the series to change the combat system from the original counter system found in AC I. Aside from a poor tutorial, the new counter system actually seems even more fluid once you get the hang of it, and I did find it quite fun to fight scores of lobsterbacks at once (usually as a catharsis from the game's other elements). Not all moves worked on every enemy, and using defense breaks and disarms provided some interesing depth to an otherwise two dimensional combat system. The addition of naval combat was welcomed and was quite fun. I didn't quite understand why my huge cannonballs wouldn't have destroyed those powder stores rather than just exposing them, but the strategy was appreciated for its progression and seeing those ships explode did bring a smile to my face. The overall story and voice acting within the game were also relatively pleasing, keeping the player engaged during the intermittent cut scenes and expositions.\n\nNext, the bad. AC's "sync" system has been something of particular interest to me since it was introduced. While I am not a completionist, I have always wanted to get 100% synchonization on all missions. It was a feeling of accomplishment, achieving a level of mastery of those missions to the degree the original legends had done hundreds of years prior. What made all those extra requirements intriguing was that they elevated the tactics needed to complete the mission those that would be seen in an action movie or comic book. They made you awesome becuase you could do it like a badass ninja. AC III took those requirements and threw into the trash and lit them of fire. They instead replaced them with tedious requirements that weren't challenging but annoying and frustratiing. They didn't make you badass. They made you do stupid tricks. They didn't force you to master the system. They forced you to game it. A perfect example of this would be the requirement that you not shove pedestrians when chasing a target through the streets. Does daintily walking by pedestrians in between sprints make you badass? No. Does it provide you with ample opportunities to shout at your screen and punch the nearest breakable surface with your ragefist? Yes. If these requirements weren't tedious, they were unreasonably difficult. Don't take fire damage while running through a burning building with poor level design and convoluted routing. Air assasinate a specific enemy, forcing you to kill everyone else before climbing the mast just for this singular reason (breaking the natural flow of the overall strategy). Etc. Et-♥♥♥♥ing-cetera. It goes on and on. The game breaks you out of the strategy and says "Do it this way because reasons."\n\nMy final frustration was with this game's tendency to provide game elements that seemed to act as solutions looking for a problem. They had potential, but had little to no practicality. I never found it useful at any time to use any of the additional assassins for anything other than helping me kill enemies. The fake escort, the lure, and the like seemed to be gimmicks that had no use. The only missions that begged their use were those that introduced you to them. They served no other purpose than to be introduced and soon forgotten. The homestead was a wonderful idea in concept, but I honestly didn't craft a single item during the entire game. Recipes were collected and quickly forgotten as well. I could pick up all the ammo I needed from my dead enemies. What use did I have to make any? Almanac pages were a pain to grab due to an often clunky free run on slanted rooftops, and their reward was nebulous enough to leave me feeling very comfortable to leave them on the map. Hunting was fun at first, but I felt no need to gather skins or complete lists of animal kills. These entire portions of the game seemed like needless add-ons that I increasingly ignored the more I became frustrated with the game's core elements.\n\nWhile I am usually one to do all side missions to get all possible story elements and complete most other parts of the AC games (feathers and flags aside), I found myself grinding out the story missions exclusively in even the early game just to get to the end (and that was only because I wanted to see the outcome of the overall story arc set up in previous games, not anything within the merit of the game itself).\n\nMy conclusion? Don't play this game unless you are a die-hard fan of the series. I give it a 4/10.\n\nThis game is like Star Wars Episode I. With a franchise this good, how could another one be bad, right?","November 26, 2013","false","130.2"," 532 of 879 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","532","879","0","23"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/208480/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","I thought I had written a review for Assassin's Creed III... apparently I did not. I played this as part of the Franchise Blitz I did during November and December, with the view of getting through the Assassin's Creed games back-to-back before playing Assassin's Creed IV on the PS4 in the New Year.\n\nI had enjoyed the previous games (somewhat surprisingly so considering my dislike for the first Assassin's Creed game), and was looking forward to this one. Even though other people had warned me away from playing it, I HAD to play it as it was the last link before Assassin's Creed IV. This is written retrospectively, as I've since played & finished Assassin's Creed IV.\n\nThe short and sweet of it is that Assassin's Creed III is essentially more of the same, so if you've enjoyed the AC games so far you'll know what to expect in regards to both positive and negatives in the game. The fight mechanics haven't changed too much at all, though they have been slightly upgraded to include some new fist fighting mechanics and counters. There's also a bunch of new weapons, such as pistols and rifles, but for the most part I played with the 'tradititional weapons'. So don't go into the game expecting a major overhaul in that regard.\n\nHowever, what they have started to expand is the size of the world. The game world is massive, and is a real precursor to what they wanted to achieve in Assassin's Creed IV. The game is still 'hubbed' but the hubs are pretty vast (if a little lifeless and pointless at times) with a central travel hub connecting them. There's a few things to do in each hub, most of which are trademark Ubisoft collectable quests, yet there's also a return of the investable Villa concept as you build up your own homestead.\nNow it could be that I was playing through the game quickly, but just like in Assassin's Creed II I never really felt there was enough reason or time to really benefit investing heavily in your Homestead and building up a team of helpers around it.\n\nAlso there's the introduction of sailing, which would later become a huge part of Assassin's Creed IV. It's introduced as a small side quest late on in the game, so I never really put much time into it, but it was an interesting idea and one that I'm sure would have been fun to play if you were going to invest the time into it.\n\nSadly, the major issue I had with this game was something I couldn't really overlook - the main character. Without spoiling the game (hopefully) there's a design issue where you're sort of left playing a character you don't really want to play. It's not really the character's fault too much, it's just that there's a far more interesting and fun character I found myself wishing I could be playing.\nIn terms of story if you love the American Revolution, you'll probably find this interesting (depending on how liberal you can be with historical accuracry). I personally enjoyed the setting, as it was a refreshing change from Turkey and Italy, and it allowed for a 'modern' feeling to the game in regards to weapon changes.\nThe long term Desmond story is also (sort of) resolved in this game, so if you're invested in Desmond's story there's some interest for you there too.\n\nIn short fans of the series will enjoy the Easter Eggs and nods to the previous games (however fleeting they were), as well as the setup for Assassin's Creed IV. However, it's probably the weakest in the series so far due to a lacklustre character, even if the supporting cast is pretty damn good.\n\nRemember Haythem.","April 20, 2014","true","19.4"," 64 of 93 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","64","93","0","1"

Assassin's Creed III is in many aspects a good game and for some time I even enjoyed it. It's gorgeous, the traversal system has been improved over its predecessors, it has a great multiplayer mode and the beginning of what become a hit on the series: naval combat. But it's also one of my go to exemples of why I rarely buy AAA games anymore. It's bloated with a lot of poorly planned, poorly implemented and overall pointlesss side-content designed to make the games feel bigger and longer than it actually is. The story rhythym is so poor that even though I bought the game just to finish the 2012 arc I gave up halfway through and read the ending online. Bland characters everwhere, derivative and repetitive mission design, very little charm that makes the game while beatiful and responsive feel souless. I used to be a huge fan of AC but that's my final entry.","October 7, 2015","false","24.9"," 144 of 229 people (63%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","63","144","229","11","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/recommended/208480/","PrimalHunter_779","PrimalHunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/","383 products in account","Assassin’s Creed® III is the fifth major installment in the long-running Assassin's Creed series developed by Ubisoft. The original game had you play as Altair, an Assassin during the Crusades, while the other titles had you playing as Ezio, an Italian Assassin during the Renaissance. After four previous games, Assassin’s Creed® III had large shoes to feel; for the most part, the game fulfills these expectations (despite disappointing on other fronts).\nIn this game, you play as Connor, a Native American Assassin born during the American Revolution; after a lengthy introduction sequence in which you play as Haytham Kenway, Connor's father (who is easily one of the major highlights of the game), the player gets to experience the early stages of Connor's childhood and experience what puts him on the path of joining the fabled Assassins. This game has a very slow opening which takes around 5 hours, however I would argue that this is necessary due to the epic scope of the narrative; however, impatient players or those wanting to get straight into the action might want to reconsider.\nDue to Connor's Native American ancestry, there are a number of unique traits you can use, namely that of hunting, tree climbing and other variations of activies used in previous titles. The ability to free run through the trees is a very welcome addition to the series, and scaling large trees and natural obstacles feels almost as fluid as navigating the rooftops. The addition of a rather complicated hunting mechanic (which involves setting bait and traps as well as skillful use of bow and arrow) is interesting but feels rather unnecessary to the rest of the game, as the game rarely offers incentives for hunting out various forms of wildlife. I also found the quicktime event used when encountering certain animals (wolves, elk) to be rather silly and didn't really mesh with the rest of the game. In addition to those skills, Connor also has a tomahawk (a large axe-thingy) and a rope dart, which he can use to damage enemies as well as stringing up enemies from trees. This varies the already simplistic combat to a minor degree and allows for some entertaining situations. Just like previous games, you also have a gun and typical sword which you can both use in open combat.\nOne of the best additions to Assassin’s Creed® III is the new naval combat mode; in this mode, Connor undertakes a variety of missions using his own sea faring vessel dubbed 'The Aquila'. Naval combat is extremely fun due to the varied offensive techniques such as precision guns, heavy mortars and chain shots, all of which you can use to take down enemy ships and forts. The reason this mode is so fun is because it's rarely used in any other game to date, and is one of the few innovative features displayed in this game.\nWhilst the majority of Assassin’s Creed® III is up to the standard of the other titles, it is worth mentioning the several severe faults that I felt detracted from the overall experience. Firstly, the 'mission constraints'; these are a series of optional objectives attached to each story mission that give you the option of increased synchronisation within the Animus. My issues with these constraints is that they actively punish the player for trying to complete, or made the mission extremely irritating in general. These objectives simply pushed the player to the point of inconvenience, and I consistently felt as if they were tacked on to each mission rather than challenging the player due to the ridiculous nature of the tasks. My second issue with the game was the overall story and the character progression of the protagonist Connor; as in the narrative lacked the motivation and compelling nature found in previous titles, and Connor was actually a severely bland character to play as. The narrative starts off rather epically, until you start playing as Connor and achieving virtually nothing over the course of the game. He was sent from place to place, completing tasks that seemed to have no relation to one another and often just for the sake of throwing in some big, flashy historical moment. By the end of the game, I felt as if all I had achieved was going to a bunch of random locations and killing some British officer simply because the game wanted me to. Aside from the standout performance exhibited in the character of Haytham Kenway, there were hardly any moments where I was overly impressed by the characterisation. Connor is a bland and uninteresting character, whose motives are ambigous and murky, and who I could never truly connect with. Not to mention that the ending for both Connor and Desmond is astonishingly lazy and is one of the worst endings to a AAA title I have ever experienced.\nOverall, Assassin’s Creed® III is a solid entry in the franchie but not the ground breaking step forward I was expecting. All the standard trademarks of the series, and fans of the series such as myself will undoubtedly have a good time with this despite its flaws. Its worth noting that the lacklustre story and frustrating game design will frustrate some players and occassionally feels like a step-backwards from previous titles. However, this is a still a fairly enjoyable game and I couldn't help but enjoy myself for most of it. 7.5 / 10","November 28, 2014","true","23.6"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","37","48","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/208480/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","For me personally Assassin's Creed III was a huge disappointment. The game starts off way too slow. It will take several sequences (and, therefore, hours) before you're actually able to freely move around. Add to that the uninspiring, sometimes frustrating and confusing missions, the boring, often cold and colorless setting in which the game takes place, the cumbersome way to fast travel, the (gamebreaking) glitches and bugs and there you have AC3. I can forgive the game for the smaller glitches and bugs, sure, because, let's face it, it's still a gigantic game world with lots of activity. But I just can't forgive them for the other mistakes, especially since 100+ people have been working on this game for at least 3 years straight.\n\nAnd now that the entire story has been told, it's time Ubisoft took the franchise in a different direction. It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, and there's no need to change genres, but at least come up with some creative and innovative things for your next AC games. I'm not talking about side activities here, there's plenty of that.\n\nLet's make the whole thing exciting again. Don't milk it like certain other franchises (guess that's a bit late since this is, like what, the 7th game or so ?).\n\nWell now, on to the good stuff. Yes, AC3 uses a new engine and it shows. It's pretty good. The environments look nicely detailed, as well as most of the characters. Some of the citizens and less important characters still have that low poly look though so it's not all great. Overall, despite the sometimes poor performance, the game runs and looks very well and I can only see it get better with future releases.\n\nThere's more: hunting is a cool new feature that fits well in this game's theme. You could do nothing but hunt for hours and you'd still have fun. Hey, what do you know; I finally have something positive to say.\n\nNaval battles are also a great addition to the game. Granted, I didn't think they fit the theme that well, since your playing a Native American and all (have you ever seen one steering a ship ?), but they were fun to play and that's what's most important.\n\nDespite my ranting there were still times that I enjoyed playing this game, but ever since the brilliant Brotherhood I'm growing more and more tired of it with every new game they release.\nIf I had to score this game right now it would have to be a 7,5. Judge for yourself if you can.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","February 2, 2013","false","21.8"," 65 of 97 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","65","97","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/208480/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Assassin's Creed III (AC3) is a very good hybrid game that consists of historical telling, which combines fiction with non-fiction, and modern-day times. AC3 is set in the American Revolution with the British invading Colonial America and the uprise of the Patriots to counter the British. You, the player, play as Connor Kenway, a refreshing Native-American that strives to protect his native homeland from the Templars and the British. Also, in modern-day present time you play as Desmond Miles, an intriguing character that is determined to uncover the mystery of the first civilisation and the relation to the December end of the world scare.\n\nAC3 has many features and various stories that allow the game to shine. I commend the developers for their insight into expanding the backstory. For example, the Templers connection between the American Revolution and present-time in AC3. The modern day story is pretty substantial as that was the only hook from the previous game AC: Revelations. Safe to say, the developers successfully allowed me to further invest into the modern day story by allowing me to experience more revelations and experiences from the first civilisation and its effect on Desmond and his group. Here are some very minor spoilers; the modern day ending was excellent because there was a very significant continuation of the first civilisation story that occurs.\n\nThe campaign was very good with great storytelling. The amount of historical information in the game was fascinating as it expanded my knowledge on the American Revolution. There were several twists and turns in the story including the story within Connor and Haytham that kept me interested and engaged whilst completing the game. I completed AC3 in 51 hours so I am surprised the game held my interest. A big hit was the variety of missions such as killing an individual to defending a bridge crossing in a battle. This helped freshen the game and expand the story at hand while being engaging because the campaign covered a lot of ground. This included Haytham making his way to America at the beginning to transitioning to Connor and his journey from his small village into assassin. The endings for modern time and Connor were strong. I felt with Connor’s ending and also the epilogue there was a satisfying payoff to his journey, which also concluded multiple backstories like Achilles, which was very good. The modern day ending was rewarding in continuing the story of the first civilisation and the consequence with Desmond and the world.\n\nThere are an abundance of side missions in AC3. Due to this, there is a ton of replayability. There are different types of side missions. For example, in Frontier you will have a Frontiersmen challenge, which will include ‘skin five animals’ among other tasks. Once you complete them you get more challenges. I did not do them as well I found them uninspiring and boring. Other side missions include several semi-decent naval missions that include securing a trade route and finding Captain Kidds treasure adventure among other naval missions. The trade route naval missions are unnecessary as you cannot unlock a naval convoy until sequence nine, late in the game. A naval convoy basically ships goods overseas to produce profit, which I will expand on after. But naval missions are fun for shooting boats mostly. Lastly, there are homestead missions, which once you do them you earn the ability for your artisans (workers) to produce higher quality goods to sell for higher. These were very fun side missions as there were a lot of them to keep me occupied and they also bring a managerial element into the game.\n\nThe settings of AC3 are beautiful and vibrant. There are four main areas including Davenport Homestead, Frontier, Boston, and New York. All four have its own distinct qualities like Davenport Homestead is your home business basically while Frontier is where the majority of conflict between the British and Patriots take place. The weather system of snow, rain, etc. allows for each location to strive in realism and to look excellent. I ran the game on ultra-settings so the graphics looked great on everything, particularly the environment.\n\nThe characters in this game are quite good. All characters have distinct personalities from the arrogant ones such as Haytham to the greedy ones of Benjamin Church. Therefore, it is pretty easy to invest into the characters that are good and bad as they do play a really good role in the game. For example, my favourite character is Haytham because his voice acting is brilliant, his arrogance is on point and his mannerisms best match his personality.\n\nThe combat is very solid albeit repetitive in AC3. It involves the usual options of counter, throw, block and all that. The main difference in this instalment is the expanded variety of animations. The new animation of killing an individual or a counter attack are solid and fluid and is seamless in transitioning to the next maneuver. The naval combat is very good as well. Blasting ships is a bundle of joy as there are several ammunition types that enhance the battle. I prefer AC3’s naval combat over Black Flag as I felt that was average and this is engaging. Also the movement of the player is also enhanced. For example, moving up a steep surface will be harder to climb for the player, adding some level of realism into the movement. It is fresh as it spices up the movement aspect.\n\nThere are several new neat ideas in AC3. Features include the business aspect of trading and crafting that is fun. Meanwhile, the Brotherhood aspect implements a strategic element. The brotherhood aspect is the same from Brotherhood and Revelations and was introduced in Brotherhood. You have assassins and you send them over the country to do jobs that earn items, XP and money. The difference in this game is the recruiting of assassins. You have to complete liberation missions to eventually recruit an assassin, a simple yet effective idea.  Other features include the map feature which I feel has taken a downturn in this game. It is more difficult to uncover portions of the city as a viewpoint will not uncover all aspects of the area. This does encourage adventuring into unknown points in the city but I feel was too annoying at times. Lastly, the descriptions of individuals, groups and events in the animus database are neat and funny. They expanded my knowledge of what occurred and added some humour also.\n\nThere are several negatives in the game that I will keep as simple as possible. My biggest negative with the game was the synchronisation between cut scene and game. For example, I have a Boston outfit on in the game but in the cut scene I would have my default outfit on. This has happened several times in the game it really did annoy me and hurt the cut scene that was happening. There are other glitches such as losing your item and having to reequip it at very few general stores in the cities. There are other things such as voice acting not being on par with subtitles for portions of the game. My second main negative was performance issues. My FPS for half the game was stable at 30FPS however in performance-intensive areas like snow and on a mountain overlooking an area would drop my FPS to about 10. The FPS fluctuated so much it did become a nuisance. Lastly, there was the occasional crash.\n\nOverall, this game is very good. I had low expectations of the story but I was certainly blown away by the storytelling especially with Connor and Desmond. The side missions were good filler to occupy time and keep me engaged. The combat was fun and fluid as always. The main negatives highlighted above hurt the rating but I understand it’s a massive game so it’s harder to iron all the issues. I would recommend this game at $30 due to the high amount of replayability. 7.75/10\n\nJoin my review group if you liked this! http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AntwogReviews","February 14","true","56.6"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","5"

Time to kill Templar's, collect money, and generally be the baddest mother#@%@# on earth...  or in the case of Assassin's Creed 3 you're playing as Conner, a half Native American, half English assassin with a personality like George Washington's teeth.. if you didn't get the joke.. it was wooden..   The game starts off pretty slow, you begin as Haytham Kenway.. You play a very boring first three missions as Haytham, which almost killed the game for it.   After a while and a little bit of the old in and out and a plot twist which caught me totally off guard... you're transferred to the real protagonist of the game  Ratohnhake:ton otherwise known as Conner.\n\nStarting off as a Native America boy you play a very fun game of hide and seek..  to be young and care free..  (I'm sure you figured it out by now that playing hide and seek was actually about the game hide and seek, and not the above mentioned in and out right?)  After finding your friends, it's your turn to hide...  ahh fiddle sticks, I already knew hiding would probably be a bad idea.. here comes big bad Charles Lee to ruin the day.  I won't spoil what Mr Lee does but lets say it's bad, and so bad in fact that our buddy Ratohnhake swears a blood oath to hunt down and kill Lee.  The remainder of the game finds Conner begrudgingly helping the Patriots win the American Revolutionary War.  We meet such amazing characters as Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Paul Revere and the rest are here on Gilligan's Island..  Ok, the Skipper, Gilligan and the Professor aren't in the game but that's alright..\n\nSo without spoiling the game... (psst... The Patriots win the war..  just figured I'd spoil that in case you didn't know..)  I'll go into detail about the various different aspects of the game..\n\nGameplay:  very similar to previous Assassin's Creed's although this one has a slight twist.  Viewpoints still exist, (only now you can unlock the areas of the map by walking through them, where as in previous games the only way was by using the view points)..  Alot of the old methods of execution and or fighting have been overhauled and made far more difficult, under the guise of making them easier.  The game in alot of ways had the difficulty ramped up, yet the game seems far easier to get 100% on..  I'm not sure why that is, it's just how I felt personally..\n\nNew additions to the game..  hunting..  you can now hunt and trap animals.. bears, rabbits, elk, deer, bobcats, racoons, beavers (not that beaver, no love interest for Conner in this game), wolves  (I'll call them the Cliff racers of AC 3), and cougars.. (also not   talking about Demi Moore).  You can collect various body parts including teeth, tails, pelts, oil etc etc etc..  The hides can be damaged if you hunt the animal using anything other than the hidden knife.  The hunting is fun for all of about 5 minutes, then it becomes something you'll probably avoid altogether, the little bit of money you can make isn't necessary, as the chest and looting will see you having far more money then you'll ever need.\n\nAnother new addition is crafting and Convoys...  You can craft various items which you can then use or sell by using a convoy.  The various items you can use are swords and guns.  The convoys are very similar to assassin missions you send the convoy away with goods for a certain length of real time, and when it returns they bring you back the profits..  Taxes (yes even in this game you'll be paying taxes... it makes me mad enough to throw some tea into a harbor..) are taken out (you can lower them by liberating forts) and you have the chance of your convoy getting robbed..  Much like hunting it's not necessary to craft or send away convoys at all, as the chest and looting will leave you with more money than you can shake a stick at..\n\nBoat's... yes our little Conner is a captain of his own ship..  you'll have the chance to engage in numerous sea battles against ships and relive some of the naval battles from the Revolutionary war..  This was alot more fun than I thought it would be.. You can also find a legendary pirates treasure.. Argh...  only you'll have to collect trinkets for Peg Leg first..  Gotta love a pirate named Peg Leg..  Ship battles are totally optional except for about 3 missions which require it.  Although they are some of the most fun I had in the game..\n\nHomestead, Conner can recruit various merchants and helpers to build up the homestead.  Each of the inhabitants have a few special missions that Conner can run through to help build the community even more.  I won't get into it too much, but these missions can be some of the best in the game, and  help to break up the serious missions from the main game.\n\nreturning features..   Assassin's are back, and upgraded..  This time around you complete liberation missions sprinkled around the map, then a special liberation mission to finally recruit one of 6 assassins.  Thees guys are pretty nice to have, occasionally, but ultimately they can do more harm then good.  Especially if you're trying to go undetected and you happen to be too close to the targets you call them in on..  Also back are missions you can send your Assassin's on. Like the previous game you can take over control of various areas... You gain control with the more missions you carry out, the missions gain your crew Xp, money and normally a trade item such as a pelt.\n\nCombat:  The biggest overhaul I saw was to combat, AC 3 has a much more difficult and steeper learning curve than the previous 4 games in the series.  It seems to have been completely overhauled.  Sometimes they say you shouldn't fix what isn't broken and this is one of those times.  I'm sure in some ways this could be seen as a double edged sword.  While the combat is harder and you run into alot more enemies that require special methods to kill, it can lead to fights which are needlessly more difficult than they have to be, it can prove to be more of a challenge than the previous games.  While it's not so difficult that it distracts you from the game, it does make some sequences harder and longer than they probably should have been.  I was personally ok with the combat system but kind of preferred the faster pace of the previous games..\n\nThe Story:  I had a few issues with the story, for starters I wasn't really thrilled with Conner's personality, he was very wooden and far too serious.  It was a total and complete 180 to the personality of say Enzio.  While Enzio was running around being a ladies man, kicking ♥♥♥♥ and chewing bubble gum.... Conner was kind of like.. I want to kill Lee..  It also could have been that Lee is the name of the protagonist of The Walking Dead Season one and I loved that man..  so hearing Conner continually talk about killing Lee brought up some bad vibes..\n\nConner's personality aside, the rest of the Conner story was decent enough..   With that said it brings me to my next part of the story...  Desmond Miles..  The third game will finally see an end to the Desmond Miles chapter of Assassins' Creed.  This game has the most Desmond play of any previous AC game.. You actually go on a few Desmond mission.. While these missions are fairly straight forward and VERY EASY, it does flush out the story of Abstergo, the first civilization and the importance of why Desmond was being asked to go on his mission.  The ending in my opinion was like.. really?  Is that it!  Five games and this is how you end things..  ugh..\n\nScore  -  Over all I'd give this game a 7.5/10..   If you liked other Assassin Creed games you'll like this one, although it's not quite as good as Brotherhood and Revelations.  I'd say AC 3 is probably stuck between the first and second game overall.  Even the American Revolutionary war wasn't enough to push it up on my list.","February 18","true","46.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","25","31","8","0"

Connor's ultimate obligation is to his tribe, and he will go to any measure to secure its safety. The narrative starts with a playable introduction as Connor’s father, Haytham Kenway, whom players eventually discover is not what he appears. The introduction largely introduces the new setting and gameplay options, lasting roughly a third of the game. Outside of that is the continuing framing story of Desmond, desperately trying to avert catastrophe on December 21st, 2012, and deciphering clues left by the first civilization, specifically Minerva and Juno.\nInterspersed between 1700s missions and temple exploration, are segments set in modern day New York that allow for direct control of Desmond, set amongst a skyscraper, a Brazilian fighting match, and a final confrontation at Abstergo industries. Missions in this series have always been fun and varied, and this one is no different, although optional objectives tend to be headache inducing. Assassin’s Creed III reintroduces ideas from the original game in more engaging fashions allowing for mobile eavesdropping, and the general concept of assassinating the Templar heads. Connor will make significant changes throughout the history of the Revolutionary War.\nControls have been simplified to a minimalistic razor, as players largely hold a button and move forward to semi-effortlessly traverse historically accurate recreations of Colonial New York and Boston, as well as the awe-inspiring frontier. New to the game are the Y-shaped traversal obstacles, a Jason Bourne-like ability to dive through windows, and general improvements to navigating the world.\nThere have been massive improvements to combat system, including motion-captured animations of sword movement, greater flexibility, and the devastating ability to chain assassinations. Guns played a major role in the revolution, and the same is true here, as the world is littered with rifles. If stealth is more your speed, Connor is also equipped with a bow and the ubiquitous hidden blade. The tomahawk proves invaluable. On the other side of the equation are the wholly refreshing Naval missions, as Connor steers and directs the operations of large scale combat through beautifully expansive environments.\nFull recreations of minor details flesh out the world, lending credibility to the reality of the game. Improvements to the graphics engine allow for fully immersive weather systems and the changing of the seasons. Everything about how rain, snow, and natural atmosphere work in the world are well represented here. Shadows and lighting are incredibly realistic as well, softly filtered through tree canopies.\nThe world map is massive, detailing waterfalls, cliff sides, and forests filled with the new animal activity. Connor will find and interact with rabbits, raccoons, wolves, bears, mountain cats, dogs, and deer, as well as the expected horses. In addition to hunting, players can now engage in optional side quests such as exploring the underground, trading, thrilling naval missions, and much more.\nOverall, this latest entry is not perfect, as there are many glitches in the game world, and some difficulties with collision detection, but the many additions to the series feel fresh and exciting, particularly the ability to explore the great outdoors. The story is complex and involving, and lasts about 10 hours, not counting the endless variety of side quests. For fans of the series, consider this entry essential.","November 25, 2013","true","91.5"," 77 of 125 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","77","125","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stenosis/recommended/208480/","stenosis","Return to Lender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stenosis/","250 products in account","This game is a shambolic mess of poor controls, oversimplified gameplay and failed stealth.  Whereas previous games in the series featured extensive roof networks (AC) and towering monuments (ACII), Ubisoft had decided that engaging cities were not, in the grand scheme of things, all that important, and ditched the huge, colourful Renaissance hubs for the mud and thatch American Revolution era villages.  Gone are the paved streets, replaced by mud ruts, gone are the beautiful ivy-covered courtyards.  It's a wholly uninviting and squat place to explore.\n\nThe crowds of ACIII are hardly convincing.  The children seem only to have one recorded sound, consisting of a laugh track which they will repeat in broken-record style until you run away.  Civilians can no longer be killed for an easy diversion.  Glitches abound, both in animation and in AI stealthing detection.\n\nCharacter development is also inadequate.  Conor is by far the least significant, least fleshed-out character of the series.  He moves with the grace of an elephant, talks as if he has had no education whatsoever (to be fair, he probably hadn't) and seems to have no real motivation for being an assassin.  Whereas Altair of AC was a ruthless, faceless angel of death whose questioning of his cult led to his humbling, and Ezio was a brash and reckless young man whose family death caused him great anguish, Conor is an unwanted child who one day returned to find his home on fire and who promptly did absolutely NOTHING of consequence.  We don't care about Conor because he seems to be the sole contributor to Desmond's personality.  There is nothing in Conor that we would ever wish to be, and no amount of shoddy combat can ever fix such failure in story.\n\nAC's combat was a bit rough around the edges, but it involved a fair amount of timing which could be passed off as "skill" in the sense that if one won entire wars with single button presses, then becoming expeditious at pressing that one button might be something to be proud of.  Nevertheless, there was a certain satisfaction in killing the final templar with a single strike; in that one perfect moment, facing his (then) greatest enemy, Altair truly seemed to be a weapon without equal in his effortless dispatch of anyone in his way.  Ezio wasn't quite as good as this, but at least he had nifty climbing abilities and additional fighting moves, and was still able to fight in a flowing manner more reminiscent of a dancer than a thug.  Conor unfortunately is just a thug.  He moves like a clown (vaulting over walls with more effort than Mr. Bean) and his attacks are purely brute force, which would suit Hitman's Agent 47 more than a supposed Assassin.  His attacks are also purely contextual animations; if no one is in range when an attack is initiated, he flails his arms around in a poor flourish rather than actually swinging his weapon, and it looks ridiculous.\n\nThe controls are the final nail in the coffin.  The mouse control should remain the same in menu and game; it doesn't.  AC I required two buttons to be held to run, one separating "high profile" actions from "low," and it worked reasonably well.  ACII upped this with the sprint, which was a welcome change.  In both games the Spacebar, E key and Shift performed actions that required little directional input (except for grab, but that was a small thing), which was crucial because the left hand on PC spends most of its time covering the WSAD keys.  ACIII decided that it was preferable to suddenly change the Counter command from Right Mouse Button + Left Mouse Button to an E key binding, and dispose of the "High profile" in favour of making Right Mouse Button "Sprint."  Surely if one button is to be made Sprint it should be Shift, given its close proximity to the WSAD and the fact that the left hand controls character movement.  Common sense would surely dictate that the second most important controlling button, RMB, should not be stripped of its previous functions and relegated to a purely ancillary role.  All these things come second nature with any measure of good judgement.\n\nUltimately, common sense and good judgement are exactly what this game lacks.\n\n*Edited time for accuracy.","December 3, 2013","false","27.6"," 179 of 306 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","179","306","0","7"

But as the Desmond's story it's like a downside, because for me the story about the 1st civilization is quite absurd. And this ACIII character isn't as strong as it's predecessor, so it doesn't leave a strong impact for the player as Altair or Ezio.\n\nAside from the story, the game itself presenting a new game mechanic. I think it's somewhat good, the battle is become more fluctuative than the previous game, the way you kill the enemy is becoming more realistic as well.\n\nBut the point that you must taken from the previous game is you don't have to press space to free running, so you should get yourself customized in the way the game played, bcs for the prev game you have to press space. And now pressing space is kinda useless.\n\nThe game mechanic for obtaining money is different as well. In this game you play as Raton'haketon (Connor) who got the vision from the 1st civ to join the brotherhood, as the brotherhood is starting to wither in America. So you settle in some land and can invite new homestead to join in your land. As time goes by, every homestead serve many item that you can trade or create from receipt.\nSo the way to obtaining the money is to TRADE.\nYou can also hunt, because Connor is a native Indian, so you can hunt wild animal to collect for it's meat, fur, etc.\n\nThere is also side quest for sailing and battle on water, it's quite fun actually, as it's a start for AC IV. Other side quest is rather boring, because you just have to kill this-that, infiltrate, and deliver. The good side quest in this game is homestead mission, as it have a story on it's own, ship quest as it's fun, and the liberation.\n\nWell, as a fan of the AC franchise I would recommend this to anyone that like the AC series. As for other people who want to play AC, maybe you should play the previous version, bcs the story is really continuation from the previous.","February 16, 2015","true","59.8"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","0"

It took me about 40 hours to play, although I probably could have added another 10-15 to the base game experience if I really wanted to.\n\nFirst off: I dont understand why this game was panned so hard after release. It's actually quite good. It offered a huge leap in actual gameplay mechanics, introduced ship battles which would later be perfected in Black Flag, was a very cool setting, and had a pretty great story compared to earlier entries in the series (IMO). It also offered closure to the Desmond Miles story arc and set the table for the next stage of storytelling (which again begins with Black Flag).\n\nInitially, you play as Haytham Kenway, son of Edward (who was featured in Black Flag). After a brief stint as Haytham, you then play as his son Connor, who you spend the rest of the game as. I thought both characters to be compelling, and I enjoyed their interactions together towards the end of the game. While I wouldnt say Connor was my favorite character int he series by any stretch of the imagination, I liked him more than I liked Ezio for sure.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the gameplay was much improved from previous entries. No more jerking you around with trigger controlled cameras, not as much inadvertent climbing lol, more seamless and intuitive combat, plus the addition of hunting, homestead building, and of course ship upgrading and battles.\n\nAs far as the fleshing out of the world and side quests go, I enjoyed most of them. The homestead missions were cool, liberating the forts was fun, the Hunting Society and Frontiersman quests were interesting and sometimes funny, The Search for Oak Island was fairly epic, the liberation missions added a new wrinkle, etc....I didnt bother to grab all the almanac pages or feathers, although they werent too much of a chore (the ones I did gather). I also didnt really bother too much with pivot points, which are really only useful if you intend to keep playing after you finish the game the first time. Privateer missions were quite a bit of fun as well, and there was a bunch of other stuff that I just dont feel like typing out here that added to the experience and gave a lot of value to this game.\n\nI mentioned the liberation missions. Those end up unlocking assassins you join your cause and will help you in a number of different ways, both directly in battle, with distracting guards, and actually helping sneak you into contested areas. I highly recommend completing all of those missions.\n\nThis game marks the end of Desmond Miles story arc in the series, and offers a new arc which as of Syndicate, hasnt been fully realized yet, but has opened up a bit. I thought it was an interesting ending and I thought it worked well with the story such as it was leading up to this game. Very interesting and cool. It also takes you through many of the pivotal moments of the Revolutionary War and the politics behind it.\n\nAll in all, I thought this was a journey worth taking, and this game really offers so much. You could easily put a lot more time into this game than I did and still not run out of stuff to do. I'd give this 8 redcoats fleeing back to England on Evacuation Day out of 10 possible.","March 26","true","40.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

I loved Assassin's Creed 2, having fixed almost all its predecessor's problems. Brotherhood was an excellent refinement of AssCreed 2, with the ability to call in your students to cause distractions, the almost-as-good-as-Batman kill-spree combat improvements, and excellent characterisation. Hell, I even liked Revelations for tying up some of the stranger plot, even if it did nothing significantly new.\n\nThen along came this sorry waste of time. I don't know just how Ubisoft managed to make a massive revolution so soulless and boring, buy by gum they found a way. Having the main character being a really dull, unlikeable bell-end didn't help. He was worse than Altair for crying out loud.\n\nUninspired combat that totally broke the near-perfect flow of Brotherhood, far too much emphasis on building up a homestead instead of assassinating people, a boring, unfulfilling ending, boring, unfulfilling missions, boring towns that were no fun to freerun in, a wilderness that wasn't used nearly enough, a plot that was vague and confusing even by the standards of the mind-♥♥♥♥ery that came before...\n\nIt was an absolute chore to play.

Though the game was still enjoyable, there was something that didn't quite feel right about this.\n\nMaybe it was the fact that a quarter of the way through you swap playing who you think is the main character and move onto someone new, I'm not sure. There didn't seem to have that sneaky assassin's feel that the other games gave you either. Very little need to go running across roof tops or hiding in back alleys.\n\nThe actual game play is all the same as the previous, probably a little bit easier to be honest. I actually managed to get right up until Chapter 10 with the original weapons you get from the start without having to upgrade. There is no real need to craft anything if you just want to complete the story, you can complete all the chapters with the bare minimum effort being put in.\n\nThe length of the game is very good, I only finished the main story and this took me twenty four hours. My actual completion rate is about 30% according to the statistics page, so you can probably ramp up about fifty hours of game play in total if you wanted to do all the side missions and challenges.\n\nGraphics wise, looks really nice. Playing it on my big screen TV with the Xbox controller really shows off the power that PC gaming has over consoles.\n\nThis is in no way a bad game, it's just not as good as the previous titles in the series in my opinion.

AC3 has retained all of those aspects. *\n\nI still recommend this game in spite of all that.  I'm not wholly sure why....  The regenerative health system is dubious, the combat feels more random (heavies could take half a dozen slices with my knife all over the body, but a light kick to the gut that sends them into a wall auto-incapacitates? what?), the naval combat is iffy on a good day, and the economy menu is more a chore than a boon.\n\nWell, aesthetics enthralled me, so I'll go with that.\n\nMany dislike Connor.  I find him very interesting, and he may be my favorite Assassin yet.  He is hopelessly idealistic and naive, and very overzealous in his actions.  His worldview is incorruptible.  But his drive to improve, to accomplish, to learn, to grow, and to correct make him an exceptional student and a humble individual.  He is clear and concise, ever-poised to tackle any trouble that arises.  He doesn't shirk from a challenge.  His gumption precludes him to action over tact.  He cuts straight to the point and loathes the time-consuming inner politics of the Patriots, Loyalists, and Templar.\n\nHe's a thoroughly profound case-study, but most players obviously don't catch that from his words and deeds on face value.\n\nMost Assassin protagonists seem to be playboys of their time, accepting drink and women when their work allows them.  Connor pursues a more morally-upright ideal; I know of only one time Connor consumes alcohol, and I don't remember him settling down with a woman at all in AC3.\n\nEzio and Connor are both stealthy (Connor's a freaking hunter, lol; he "has" to be), but the difference between them is the former had subtlety and grace, whereas the latter has swiftness and decisiveness.  I loved that about Connor.  The manner in which he acts, the style of combat he adopts, both reflect his mores as an individual.\n\nRegarding the setting, it's bafflingly empty.  I'd argue 60% of the collective world map is unused for anything beyond filler.  It's wonderful filler, in my opinion, but it's empty space all the same.  Viewpoints are sparse, far between, and don't provide much vision once you synchronize with them.\n\nCombat may prove troublesome, but the animations in battle are a sight to behold.  Connor is flashy, but efficent.  Brutal, but quick.  I'm enraptured with awe every combat sequence I initiate.\n\nThe hunting is a solid addition, too.  It's far too easily abused, but you do have to play it smartly if you want to succeed.\n\n--\n\nI don't like relying on personal patriotism for much of anything, certainly not for a review of a video game.  However,... I believe it's an integral part in how I perceived and enjoyed Assassin's Creed 3.  AC1 had a great story, even though the setting wasn't my favorite.  AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations offered better combat, but I didn't care for Ezio as a character.\n\nBut AC3 struck a major chord with me while I was playing it.  The open space of the Frontier (as opposed to the cramped cities in Renaissance Italy and Crusader-era Middle East), the (little "r") republican community of the Homestead, the righteous (if incomplete) theme of the Patirots, the ferocious style of Connor's combat, the resolute demeanor he exhibits, the pristine settings in the wild, and the boundless opportunities of the major cities of a land brimming with potential,...  All of that sank in well with me.  Maybe it's relatable since I'm a red-blooded American.  Maybe the sights and sounds of the wild Frontier hearkened me back to my days as a Boy Scout.  Maybe the visuals of colonial Boston and New York warmed me to their nostalgia and nuance.  Maybe the theme of liberty and the reinvigoration of the moral struggle between the Assassins and the Templar sparked my interest once again.\n\n--\n\nI dunno.  I sure can see why people don't like it, but I don't share that sentiment at all.  I had a blast with AC3, so I will suggest it nonetheless.  I hope others like it for what it is, as well.","December 23, 2014","true","50.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","5"

The freerunning, combat sequences and progress through history are just as satisfying as ever. Loads of costumes, weapons (both purchasable and craftable) and abilities serve to add depth and customization to the gameplay, making Connor feel like the player's own creation. Numerous sidequests lengthen and support the game while allowing the player to explore the game's world through different avenues that retain a feeling of freshness by not grinding through them. Historical information to be divulged through seeing people and places incentivizes exploration, though the historical facts are sometimes hard to differentiate from the game's fiction, which makes the education value of the game questionable. Additionally, certain post-completion rewards allow the player to truly take command of the game, serving as satisfying means to engage the game in while the player strives for full completion.\n\nThis game does, however, faces difficulties. The biggest flaw that this game repeats consistently are its lackluster payoffs. ACIII is rife with missed opportunities and dead ends that will leave the player at best confused and at worst outraged. Its main story faces this issue in two major ways. First, Connor's saga, though decently paced through most of the game, screeches to a halt by the end of the game. The two top villains, who were built up so thoroughly during the rest of the game, have final encounters with Connor that can best be described as a quicktime event and a cutscene. Such needless handicaps and disconnects from player interaction are massive letdowns that leave the tribulations gone through by playing the rest of the story not feel worthwhile. The second issue comes in Desmond's storyline. Throughout the game, the player will be brought to the real world to engage as Desmond, who plays just like Connor but without all of his weapons and upgrades, thus feeling very weak. Desmond's missions are enjoyable as a view into what modern-day Assassining is like, but are ultimately letdowns. They feel wholly out-of-place, and the underlying story will be incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't played the prior games, thus leaving new players even more disjoint from the game. These shorts will force the player to call into question the value of completing the game's additional content, not knowing whether there will be an eventual payoff there, either.\n\nThe game also strives to stand out in the series by taking bold steps in key areas, with varying results. In some cases, the game succeeds. The diversity brought about for the protagonist, for instance, adds valuable style and culture to the game. Connor's Native American heritage is largely treated with respect, and the game provides players with opportunities to learn more about Native Americans in ways that don't even enter into the gameplay. However, many of the changes this game underwent were for the worse. The change in setting from Italy to colonial America does provide some freshness to the franchise; however, it sacrifices playability to achieve this. Freerunning in the city rooftops is largely useless now as guards will immediately investigate you when spotted - which is often. Freerunning in the forests is conceptually interesting but plays poorly, as there are few entry points to climb into the treetops, and even when in the treetops the players are mainly stuck on linear paths to a predetermined end, with few branching paths involved. But perhaps the most significant change is one of the least gameplay-changing: the protagonist himself. All the diversity that surrounds his character cannot save Connor from being as bland and dull as he is. His voice only shifts out of a lame monotone to go to grumbly anger. He shows more emotion while pig farming than during a pivotal death sequence. He never seems to grow over his adventures (except to become more grumbly), and even the end of what one may call his 'character arc' comes off as forced and clichéd. Connor's rigidness as a character just serves as one more disappointment to the player. Unfortunately, some series-staple bugs, such as dying via fall from the plane of existence, glitchy jump sequences, spawns into impossible locations and even hard crashes were not changed from previous games, and remain consistently present in this title.\n\nThis game reached far, and consequently fell hard. It did not fail from the fall, though, because it always has its satisfying core mechanics as an Assassin's Creed game to lie back on. What hurts most about this game, though, is that it clearly had the potential to be what it wanted to be. Should just some more time have gone into developing Connor, the interactions with the new area layouts and the rewards for beating various parts of the game, and this title could have been a masterpiece of not just the series, but the stealth-action genre. Instead, what it serves as now is an about-average game that should please fans of American history, Native Americans or the Assassin's Creed lore, but most others should look elsewhere for their Assassin simulator. Assassin's Creed III gets a C.","January 29, 2015","true","44.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Desmond Miles and the Assassins are guided to another temple where Minerva has him relive the memories of another Assassin ancestor, Ratonhnhaké:ton aka Connor, who fought a Templar plot in the New World at the turn of American independence.\n\nPros: The game goes back to having multiple maps, such as two cities, a large plot of wilderness and villages, in addition to replacing the economy and your base by a map of Davenport Homestead where mini quests allow you to make your village thrive, giving access to resources you'll craft for export. Colonial cities and forest are a nice change of scenery, and leaping from one tree branch to another feel very different from European rooftops. New A.I. enemies are more challenging and cannot be beaten or blocked as easily, which feels nice after the three past games all had similar Renaissance-based foes. The game finally has a decent participation from Desmond, fighting as an actual Assassin. By far, sailing the seas introduces the best new mechanic to the franchise in a long time, the Hidden Secrets Pack DLC adding additional quests in foreign territory very similar to, but much shorter than, the platforming dungeons of past games.\n\nCons: It is nearly impossible to take to the rooftops without being called out by guards who are much more intolerant and aggressive. As accurate as the setting is, the cities and forest aren't as memorable, Connor's story isn't as interesting, and the end of the Desmond story is unsatisfying. Side quests are boring, and your village's economy brings little to the game as you don't need much money and will rarely feel the need to purchase other weapons.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThe game is passable enough to get a light recommendation, but is definitively the weakest of the franchise so far. You will quickly tire of the hunting and crafting which are the two other new systems brought to the game. The King Washington DLCs will extend the gameplay, but offer dark and unenthusiastic story episodes. Purchase only if you feel you really want to play all the Assassin's Creed games.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","November 9, 2015","true","57.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","13","18","5","0"

While the series is beginning to have just a few too many mini-games in it for my tastes - ship battles are particularly annoying if you're an achievement hunter - the core gameplay of the series has reached a point where it is as refined as it will probably become. Combat is easy to master and the stealth aspects of the series have undergone a much needed overhaul regarding realism. In short, AC3 is polished to a mirrored sheen, with an absolutely brilliant soundtrack, series-typical great graphics, and an opportunity to bring closure to Desmond's story, this game is not to be missed by diehard members of the Brotherhood and is even a decent - albeit not perfect - place to start the series for newcomers.","December 20, 2013","true","58.1"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","3"

New gameplay have much bugs and just stupid. Best Multiplayer was at Assassin's Creed Revelations.\n\nSingle player: this is new story (in start you play for Assassin which join to Templars, this man father of protagonist), new locations: Boston and New York and other few: West Point, Frontier (big location with forest and so on) and the most important locations - this open ocean and the sea, where you can complete quests on the ship. You can upgrade your ship. And Manor where you will got quests with people, which find home or work. This people will work and live here. You can craft items they are even with the help of (I like that).\n\nWeps: you got new assassin knifes, tomahawk (my favorite wep), pistols - you can have 2 pistols at belt.\n\nGameplay: this Brand New gameplay: you can use the objects around you, absolutely new combo murder. New management is very convenient. You can also jump on the trees, fleeing from persecution through the open door or window (in cities). To game added dogs, which can find you :D At city walking much pigs, chickens, cats and dogs (to game add kids :D) - you can interact with.\n\nGraphic: this is an entirely new open world with new opportunities. For example: change in the weather (winter and summer, periodically snowing, rain and sunshine, and if you fall into the snow, then the character will slow down). In the game there is dirt on the pavement, as well as pools, stepping on you left a footprint. So, graphic is very beautiful.\n\nStory: new story this is Revolution in America. That is very interesting... But some time it's start bored. You play for Indian, which must kill few bad guys and him father. Indian join to Assassin's. He is want freedom for all people. But this guy don't help to Revolution, but he thought that it helps. He just wants to save his people - what can I say about this man? He is egoist. He says that everything should be free, and his father (Templar) said that freedom - is chaos. And his father was right, because if all people are free, everyone would do what he wants and how he wants. If you manage people, then they will not be as savages.\nIf you do not manage the company of people, they go mad.\nBut in the words of the Assassins have the same truth.\nManaging people do not need to resort to violence and slavery.\nAs I see it, I Templar :D\n(Big like for new gameplay and graphic)\nSo, this game is not for the faint of heart, there are a lot of cruel dramatic scenes. There were moments when I wanted to cry...\n\nSorry for my English ^ ^","December 23, 2014","true","49.4"," 63 of 113 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","63","113","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mykwon/recommended/208480/","mykwon","Mykwon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mykwon/","1225 products in account","Ok, let's start with the positive so we can clear this one out quickly : the cut scenes are awesome. Done. Check.\nNow with the negative :\n1. This is the most boring and clumsiest assassin you'll ever see in your life. This character - I already forgot his name just to say - is the total opposite of Ezio : no charisma whatsoever, no substance, no facial resemblance with any of the glorious assassin family Desmond is the last heir of, boring voice and poor abilities. You can't get attached to such a dull character and have any fun using him. You just can't.\n2. All the Assassin's Creed games sucked me in from the very beginning of the story and glued me to my screen, wasting countless hours to make the scenario and characters progress. This one is so annoying, I have no interest in making anything progress and knowing what happened to the saga. I didn't even understand why Desmond ended up in the animus reenacting this stupid ancestor memories. Nothing's explained or makes sense. It's like, yeah whatever, just do it because well, it's an Assassin's Creed game so let's just milk the same cow again and issue a new episode of the series.\n3. The game-play has been revised for the worst. Listen Ubisoft, there's one golden rule in gaming and in programming in general: if it ain't broken, don't fix it. Don't. Just don't. Ever. Instead, you just frustrated millions of players who enjoyed so far the continuity of playing all Assassin's Creed games the same way but you also made it much worse by complicating for no reason a fluid interface with boring menus/sub-menus and counter-intuitive controls. This is an epic failure.\n4. The AI. Oh my! The AI is as equally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than it is deadly, depending on the time, the scenario and the situation. This is such a marker for a failed product to see the vast dichotomy between AI characters accepting you just vanished because you hid behind a barrel in their plain sight as it is when they accurately shoot you to near death when you're jumping from one roof to another, while alerting instantly every other patrols within a 50 miles radius around you.\n5. Gazillions of bugs everywhere. For everything. We're not talking about specific glitches in specific areas and such. Direct and obvious bugs like the character's cape going crazy and making him look like a ridiculous bat whenever climbing any tall structure. This is not something you can miss. Clearly, you haven't tested your product at all. Or if you have, you clearly have no respect for your customers in attempting to deliver any level of quality for your products. Let's just issue the damn thing and bang money as much as we can before they realize they bought a piece of crap. The fact that Ubisoft publicly told their customers they have no intention to fix any of the bugs, well I guess we all know now how they consider them (moooo!).\n6. Missions : 90% of the time, I have no clue why I'm doing a mission or what I'm supposed to do. I just try random things until it seems that the mission progresses. The story is so botched that they didn't even try to provide explanations of why you're doing something in the game now.\nOverall, the whole thing feels very sour: the great saga that lasted for a decade now has been burnt to the ground by the greediness of Ubisoft executives in a clumsy attempt to milk their customers. From what I can read from gamers about AC IV, it's pretty much the same disaster. Guess what, won't buy it. Well, well done Ubisoft for shooting yourself in the foot and killing one of the greatest saga in gaming history.","January 3, 2014","false","69.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Now, if you want to see my elaboration read the whole review.\nMy playtime was 21 hours, without doing one single side-quest, and with of course, some bit of fooling around, so i think it's a decent playtime. I usually get bored of games that have a gameplay longer than let's say 7-8 hours maybe, but this wasn't the case.\nI enjoyed this game, it was better than any previous AC game, but you could feed that ubisoft did lay their filthy hands on because of the minor glitches and bugs, and the poor optimization. Ubisoft, in my opinion, really should just quit the game industry since they mess up everything they touch. Sorry, Ubi, but as usual, you somehow managed to ruin our fun a little bit. We won't miss you, tho!\n\nAbout the game itself, it's open-world, the combat style is similar to the previous games but improved, it has a great feeling added to it, and you will get into fights just because you like it.\nGraphics are good even on the lowest possible settings. I talked before about optimization, it's better optimized than the previous, but still, it still works sometime a bit crappy for example on my 6770 graphics card. It's typical for ubi since they don't seem to care about gamers too much.\nIt's interesting in so many ways, i've never been a fan of the series, but this one really caught me for some reason, that i don't even know.\nAt some point, yes, you will lose your mind and feel like you will want to smash the monitor of so many failures, but that's a factor that makes a game, a good game, isn't it ?\nSoundtrack was also quite good, but could've been better.\nI won't say a single word about the story, because it's not much to say about it.\nValue for the price? In my opinion there is no game worth 60€. But only us europeans have these high prices. Russians and brasilians have pretty much half of the prices we got here. Anyway.\nIf i will play it again? I don't think so, as i said, i usually get very bored of long games, and even tho i didn't get bored at this one, my brain couldn't handle it again. It will be purely insanity, at least in the next 6 months.\nWhat i want also to point out, the landscapes when you are on the sea are so beautiful, i couldn't stop dreaming about being some sort of pirate myself hehe.\nOverall, it's a good game, but know this Ubi did fail this one too at optimization and bug fixing.\nI recommend it for the graphics, the gameplay, the action, everything.\n\nCheers and have fun!

Its still a very high ended game that requires a decent graphic card to run on high setting as well a good system to sustain the game and for multitasking purpose.\n\n- Missions are well balanced, the money system is more balanced that the current AC Games, {AC Unity : 2 million franc} {AC syndicate: 270,000 pounds} in a/c.\n\n- Naval missions and DLC's are fun extra part of the game.\n\n- choice of outfits and weapons are reasonable, though AC Unity was the best in terms of weapons choices.\n\n- Recruitment and side bodyguards are useful in big missions or fighting multiple enemies or tough enemies {Ex: Grenadier or Hessian}\n\n- Combat mechanism is fast and engaging though personal preference of Assassin's Creed Rogue\n\nCon's\n\n- There is still lots of glitches in the game, sometime combat mechanism of countering an enemy doesn't work , thus usage of secondary weapons become necessary\n\n- People who had issues with Uplay being outdated didn't think about installing Uplay first then installing the game through steam, and this wasn't notified to steam for an alternate way to play AC III.\n\n- Levelling the artisians is explained no where in the game, I had to browse through IGN and steam community to get the solution.\n\n- Multiplayer seems new and odd, doesn't look interesting, maybe i am not used to it.\n\n\nOverall this is a must buy game if you are a Assassins Creed player or someone new to the community who wants to try this game\n\nCheers\nMax","May 15","true","164.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The counter system has been changed, and now gives you the option of throwing/disarming/killing your opponent with either primary or secondary weapons; but the enemy types remain roughly the same.\n\nThere are now more stealth opportunities, with the ability to move through dense undergrowth undetected, and some of the optional (and main) missions reflect this. There's still no option to stealthily move around normally though.\n\nCalling for support has also been changed, with a range of different options instead of just being able to call for a target to be assassinated or support in a fight. Some of them feel like they need a bit more work, particularly ambushes and the fake guards thing. Ambushes are slightly irritating in the rather long time between them being triggered and something actually happening (although, this also happens with the standard assassination and marksman skills, but I tended to use them in less time sensitive ways). Fake guards can spawn either colonial or redcoat disguises, but there's no way to specify which, so you have to hope for the right one.\n\nMoney is slightly problematic in the game. You no longer recieve any money for completing missions, but there's also very little to spend money on. The (dyed) outfits may be worth spending money on, and the maps are handy, but the better weapons can be crafted for less money (and there doesn't seem to be much difference between different swords etc. Pistols are a little more noticeable in their differences, since some fire multiple shots at a time and some can be fired twice without reloading). The ship upgrades are largely worthwhile, but the naval missions aren't really particularly important in the game so it seems a little dissapointing only spending money on upgrading the ship.\n\nThe naval missions are damn fun though. The difficulty of them seems a little easy though, since the Aquila appears to be nearly indestructible compared to the enemy ships. A lot of the optional missions make it seem like controlling it should be harder, with stuff like "25% or less damage from hitting rocks" appearing a couple of times.\n\nMost of the optional missions are pretty well chosen, adding some difficulty without being too annoying. There are a few exceptions, like when you have chase someone down busy streets without hitting anybody.\n\nThe Tyranny of King Washington is damn fun too, with the animal spirit powers modifying the gameplay style a bit. I would recommend playing the standard game first, since there are no tutorials for anything other than the spirit powers (and the control system is fairly different), and the collectibles do include spoilers for the main game (including the ending of the game). My main problem with it is that you have to find additional weapons in treasure chests, and you're never given the opportunity of deciding to keep what you already have equipped rather than what's in the chest.\n\nThere are problems with the game however. It's quite buggy. Some of the bugs may be due to me playing the game on a laptop that's a little below the minimum specs (although the game largely ran fine for me).\n\nThe most noticeable is that dyed outfits don't show up in cutscenes, and instead you always wear assassin white clothes (the unlockable outfits do work though). Sometimes, weapons mysteriously unequip and have to be re-equipped (this mostly happened with Captain Kidd's sword for me, but I also lost a tomahawk during the Tyranny dlc). The magic lanterns in New York (and one of the Boston ones) were blank, leaving me to solve them based on brief flashes of the symbols during transitions from the top to the right slots and youtube videos. Changing weapons/outfits are the homestead is also ridiculously slow, with massive pauses between pressing the button to change to the next weapon and the actual change happening.\n\nCliff climbing is also introduced in this game, as well as free running through trees and the ability to quickly go over fences etc. instead of climbing onto them and jumping off them. These are all largely good, although it can be difficult to tell where a cliff can actually be climbed and where it's just slight bulges in the cliff. Tree free running is pretty good, particularly when it's been snowing, but there aren't really enough branches for them to actually go where you want (particularly when you're running around outside of missions).\n\nThe actual plot of the game is pretty good, but it suffers one problem: Conner comes across as quite dull. I'm not sure whether it's a problem with character being unlikeable or the monotonous voice acting though. As in this review, there's so much else going on that the plot feels more like another distraction than the main bulk of the game.\n\nAnd while, yes it is a game by Ubisoft and so it needs uplay to work, Uplay does seem to mostly keep out of your way. There's a little delay at launch while it loads, and it likes reminding you about the dashboard when you start the game, but otherwise it's pretty much invisible. Except when you complete an achievement/action. It does feel like it shouldn't really be needed though.\n\nTL;DR: Pretty good game, with a few problems.","July 31, 2014","true","135.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'd come to expect quite a lot from AC after the last trilogy, and the promise of an AC set during the American Revolution, headlined by a Native was super exciting to me. Unfortunately, AC3 delivered on almost none of those expectations.\n\nThe mechanics have been scaled back in many unfortunate areas. Combat has been modified to make it more "challenging", but really it's just not as fun. You can still kill basically anyone in one or two hits, but they force you to use certain moves against certain opponents, and as the game goes on, those opponents become more prevalent, so all your fights end up feeling the same. The new additions of some interesting weapon types also seemed promising at first, but they proved to be unintuitive to use due to the new interface, and mostly just not as effective as the old staples. The combination of the altered combat and interface made fights feel less dynamic than they did in the past where you could chain kills fluidly together and it feel badass.\n\nThe parkour, while being significantly streamlined, did nothing to address common frustrations such as getting stuck climbing something ridiculous like a fence post or a door, and was missing some of the features from past games (shoulder charging for instance).\n\nThe mini-games of improving your home and sending assassins out on contracts was replaced with a series of sidequests that appeared to do nothing for you in the long run, and an incredibly boring and clunky trading minigame where you trade random goods for other random goods. Supposedly you can manipulate the market to make some commodity worth more per trade, but it seemed pretty arbitrary, and the menus were so clunky I didn't have the patience for selecting 6 deerskins individually for each trade I wanted to make, so I gave up on it pretty quickly.\n\nThe main character was also painfully earnest and irritating, and the whole story felt disjointed. I never knew what was going on or why I was doing anything, and there was almost no incentive at all to completing side quests. When I finished the game I thought to myself, "Oh, I didn't know that was the last mission..." Never a good sign.\n\nThere was one thing that I spent hours doing for no other reason than it was fun. The naval combat was really well done (if feeling totally tacked on, and not well integrated to the main storyline). I really enjoyed it despite the fact that it had nothing to do with anything, and Conor would throw on a silly admiral's outfit every time you took the boat out. It was good enough that it almost redeemed the entire game for me... Almost.","January 15, 2015","false","51.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/208480/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","After 5 years and 4 games, you would probably expect the 5th game in a series to be pretty close to perfect, right? Sadly, that is not the case with Assassin’s Creed III. It’s not a bad game, but it also doesn’t exactly rise to its full potential.\n\nPlot-wise, AC3 closes the book on the first major chapter in the Assassin’s Creed storyline. Although Desmond's quest concludes, the ending leaves enough unanswered questions to allow for future games (though I suspect many may feel the actual ending is a bit anticlimactic). The bulk of the game takes place in Boston and New York during the American Revolution and feels quite different from its predecessors. Part of the "mystique" of those games is, I believe, the unfamiliar settings. Conversely, the setting in AC3 is much more familiar to people and I think it diminishes the impact a little bit. I don’t exactly fault them for it, as I think it’s a good idea to switch things up, but just be aware that you might not get the same "wow factor" as from previous games.\n\nOne thing that *did* bring the wow factor, at least for me, is the world they built. In addition to Boston and New York, there is also an expansive wilderness to explore. These areas are not only enormous, but visually beautiful (at least, with all the PC settings cranked to the max). Maybe I’m just an old fogey or easily impressed, but I really was amazed at what they were able to pull off technically, in terms of the environments.\n\nYou play as Connor, a young Native American. He doesn’t start out as an Assassin, but comes to learn the way of the Order after a series of events lead him to discover his destiny. The character is interesting, but not as immediately likeable as Ezio. One of the annoying things about the game is how they’ve made Connor into an 18th century Forrest Gump - he always somehow happens to end up at (or play a part in) seemingly every major event leading up to and during the Revolution. I know the idea behind this series is that history isn’t exactly what we thought it was, but AC3 really stretches it to levels of absurdity.\n\nGameplay-wise, AC3 is a lot like its predecessors (which is good), but somehow they managed to take steps backward in a number of areas. For one thing, they decided to completely change the control scheme (after spending 4 games perfecting it): combat and free-running are now handled differently (requiring a bit of time to re-learn), targeting is a mess, the weapon and map menus have been changed for the worse, and the stealth mechanics sometimes don't work at all. A lot of it just feels totally half-♥♥♥♥♥. And don’t even get me started on the bugs. I can’t recall any other game I’ve played that was as buggy as AC3. I would run into a completely new bug seemingly every hour, many times having to reload checkpoints or restart in order to continue.\n\nBut not everything is bad. As I said, the environments are amazing, and the gameplay is generally OK once you’ve settled into the new control scheme. So it’s more of the standard AC formula, and that’s not a bad thing (when it works). New to AC3 are naval missions, which look amazing and feature awesome water-based physics. I had fun with these bits, but I can also see how some people might get bored with them, as they are a bit repetitive. Luckily, these missions are mostly optional.\n\nUltimately, AC3 is a good, but slightly disappointing game. Do the negatives completely ruin the experience? Not really... but it is nonetheless a disappointment when a game like this has so many rough edges. For fans of the series, it is still worth playing, especially since it concludes the story. For those who haven’t yet played an AC game, however, I would recommend starting with either AC2 or Brotherhood instead.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nNote: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.","February 16, 2013","true","51.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

Set during the American Revolution 1753-1783 Assassin's Creed III follows the centuries old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. AC III is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The story is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the American Revolution from 1753 to 1783, and it also follows Desmond Miles's half-English, half-Mohawk ancestor, Ratonhnhaké:ton, also known as Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain freedom in the colonies. Assassin's Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Assassin's Creed III now features naval expeditions. Using Connor's warship, the Aquila, the player can now navigate the high seas. Control of the ship relies on environmental factors such as wind direction and speed, local presence of storm's, high waves, and rocks. Free running has been simplified to allow for more fluid parkour in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, mountains, cliffs, etc. Stealth is also revamped, allowing Connor to use natural elements such as tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people. Assassin's Creed III really is a vast improvement over the other games in the series. While continuing the excellent story line. This game is full of amazing detail in every aspect; Story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and more. I really recommend this for the mere fact that it is always fun to play, and there's just so much to do in it improvement as it now features loads of new content while still retaining features from the previous games. I really cannot recommend this game enough it is just absolutely outstanding. I'm definitely 100% sure that Assassin's Creed III will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.","September 10, 2014","true","807.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","3"

I enjoy the combat, weapons, free-running, climbing, riding horses, etc. I especially enjoy free-running through the treetops. I bought this particular game because of the Native-American theme, though I don't care at all for the revolutionary war period. I also liked the inclusion of cats and dogs. Being able to reach down and pat cats and dogs was an inspired way to increase immersion.\n\nDislikes with A.C. franchise in general:\n– “Animus” concept breaks immersion more than glitches.\n-- Linear story arc. There is only Ubisoft's vision, my imagination means nothing.\n-- Regular instances where the game takes over and player choices are severely limited.\n– I prefer to create my own character: gender, race, face and body type. etc.\n– Only enemies can be killed. A limitation caused by playing someone else's memory I guess. You're playing an assassin not a psycho-path...but I prefer the choice.\n\nAC3 specific dislikes:\n– Controls need work. Perhaps too touchy. In the midst of running, I may try to jump but instead stop suddenly and pose as if I'm hiding against a wall...but there's no wall in sight.\n– AC3 has some outfits I like, which I bought as part of a package deal, but use is limited to DLC or multi-player game play. Should be able to wear the items during solo play.\n– The first 5 sequences felt like a waste of time. I would have liked the option to skip them.\n\nI dislike forced, lengthy dialogue in games, cut-scenes and quasi-controlled animated sequences. This game is far too chatty. There is a "Skip" option for a few of the dialogues but strangely not for others. We are forced to listen to long speeches after killing major targets, and when in the much hated “Animus”. I play open world games because I want to do what I want. When I want a story I read books or watch a movie. If I want limitations, I'll just engage in real life.\n\nI have read the argument "If you don't like the story, this game isn't for you." Rubbish! The atmosphere, the treasure hunts, hunting, exploring, action and fighting are all great; too much hand holding, inescapable story-telling and the Animus concept are the only things really keeping me away from this franchise in general.\n\n20 minute long forced viewing of the credits, without any way to skip them or even turn the game off?! I have a few gestures and choice words for whoever at Ubisoft decided that was okay.\n\nMost of the game from sequence 7 on, was pretty good. If you see it on sale for 75% off (like when I got it) give it a try.","May 23, 2015","false","43.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Now that thats over and done with, on to the review. I just recently finished my second playthrough on the pc of this game, and after playing through AC 2 and Brotherhood again recently, i have my opinion on this game. The combat isnt bad, but it is in no means challenging at all, as compared to AC 2. I could spend all day killing red coats or patriots till my hearts content without dropping a beat but, where's the fun in that now? The free running is back and more frusterating than ever, although not nearly as bad as 2 where i was about to rip my hair out on several occasions. It works, the tree hopping can be a bit buggy but mostly its fluid. Buildings, besides churches and save for a few other structures, are not really that tall. I remember this being a concern for many when the game was originally announced but fear not, you wont spend mins climbing up yet another tall structure just to have conner jump all the way down to his death (well, it happened once). On to the story. Its an AC game, i personally like the story line (thats more hurumph than huzzah) but it works to move the story along. However, the 7 hr tutorial as people like to call it, was not a welcome addition. In fact, it didn't even teach me the basics! Since i jumped from brotherhood to 3 i had to re learn the controls all over again. I figured out how to counter, grab ledges and other things on my own (i didnt figure out how to disarm till i was almost finished with the game). Conner is an over dramatic/ montone character. I am highly partial to Ezio's character because he seemed more human, his whole life was fleshed out before you. Unlike conners who you are just thrown into and meant to assume the role of this revenge seeking assassin. Without spoiling anything for you gents and madames out there, expect to hear alot of grunting and screaming for charles lee. The naval sections were a fine addition to the game (they made a whole game out of this section in the 4th game which i highly reccomend you check out) and were both a pretty spectacle and a liberating feeling. Theres nothing like sailing around martha's vineyard and blowing them bloody red coats out of the water! This is not an AMERICA HUZZAH!!! story, not in the slightest. The lines between the templars and assassins morality is somewhat blured in this game. You can see the templars struggling for their vision and in a way, they are good in their own regard. Without spoiling much else, i'll give you the bottom line\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nGET IF YOU: like the AC games and are playing through, like the revolutionary war, or just like the colonies before they became american\n\nDONT GET IF YOU: Don't like any of the things mentioned above, want to deal with a tedious story, or are expecting something thats going to knock your socks off\n\n\nIn the end, I DO RECOMMEND because i have been a fan of this series since the first game came out in 07. This series continues to bait me and bring me back into its ever widing embrace. Though the series has started to lose some of its focus over the years, they are still able to weave a very compeling narrative. It also helps i counter like a boss.","December 29, 2014","true","19.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

If you are a die-hard Assassin's creed fan as i am then you will enjoy this game. It has a great story an even better gameplay. They added to the fight mechanics that made it alot smoother and even the parkour was revamped.\n\nThe story was good. I loved it. It kept you on your toes while still staying true to the history of the events in the Assassin's Creed style we know and love. I definately learned a thing or two about American history and I found it very interesting. The story actually follows the Assassin's rather than say a pirate that touches slighly on the Assassin's and only half way through the game. The twists and turns that the story adds make it quite enjoyable as, even though the story can get a tad predictable, you are never completely certain of the comming events. If you are looking for a game that doesn't end as soon as you press play then this is a good one being slightly on the longer side. I have finnished the game and have 31 hours of gameplay time. I did however take my time with the game and I recommend you do too. If you love history then you probably love Assassin's Creed and if you love Assassin's Creed then this is a must play.\n\nThe movement and fighting mechanics have been improved since previous games. For one you can now vault over obsticles rather that having to climb on it and jump off it. Also when being persued by angry red coats you can evade them by running through buildings. This adds and exciting element. It is borderline Hollywood effects but the game can pull it off. Then there is the tree climbing. Never before have we seen this an an Assassin's game and it just makes things fit perfectly. It aids the story along and helps give the charaters a more immersed feel. The combat has also been revamped with the addition of double takedowns and human shields. This make the game fun to play and leaves you awe struck when you pull off your first double takedown and it doesn't lose it touch. Time and time again I found myself purposely just blocking attacks and waiting for the chance to pull off one of these deadly manuvers. The human shield was added, I presume, to combat the newly added guns man. Though guns have been seen before we have never seen them on this level. When 4 gunmen line up to fire you have no chance of running nor can you attack then all before being shot so the use of human shields is almost mandatory. Overall i love the new mechanics.\n\nThe naval combat in this game i feel is the best I have seen. I prefer it to the naval base game of Assassin's creed 4 and though not as exciting and in depth the simplicity make for an all round better expirience. I found myself wanting to keep getting naval contracts and when I finally completed then all I couldn't help but feel dissapointed.\n\nThe game however is not the best of the series and so i would not recommend it as a first time Assassin's game. Rather go for 2 or brotherhood. The game does have a few down sides. The voice acting leaves alot to be disired to be honest. The majority of the characters have pretty good voice acting but Connor unfortutely sound very monotone and boring to listen too. His voice just lacks that depth that make dialogue all the more interesting to listen too.\n\nFurther the upgrade system, though there, is not really needed. I played the entire game without buying a new sword or gun. In previous game the upgrade played an intergral role as enemies got stronger and increased in number and so better armour was needed and better weapons needed to fend off the stronger attacks from bigger enemies. I would have loved to see an upgrade system that you want to use. This however is by no means a gamebreaker and doesn't take away from the story one bit.\n\nAnd thus I get to the end of this review. If you have made it this far I applaud you I truely do. This wall 'o text is by no mean quick to read. I hope that this has helped those that are on the fence about buying the game. I was for a while and have never regretted getting it. Is it worth paying full price. I thinks thats up to you to decide. I bought in on sale and so I feel it is well worth what i paid for it. I know that this game went above and far beyond my expectatations for it.","February 18, 2015","true","31.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","8","12","3","0"

Ezio or Edward, don't buy this game\nIf you can't stand Desmond Miles, don't buy this game\nIf you can't tolerate bugs and egregious examples of bad game design, don't buy this game\n\nAssassin's Creed III is not a good game, let me make that clear. I'm recommending it because to me it is one of those games where the concept of the game is great but it is crippled by incompetent devs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design. Sure, it may sound like a great idea for a game to be set in the American Revolution and have a cast of characters such as George Washington, Sam Adams, Paul Revere etc. and to take place in famous battles such as Bunker Hill and Monmouth. That is until you realise that the characters are one dimensional caricatures and the battles are scripted sequences.\n\nThe story of the main game (not that present day Desmond in the Animus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) follows two main protagonists, Haytham and Ratonhnhaké:ton (Connor for short). The first two sequences of the game have you play as Haytham as he travels to America in search of something. During his adventures he forms a relationship with a native woman by the name of Kaniehtí:io. Together they have a child, that child is Connor. Also while on his adventures Haytham befriends Charles Lee who is relevant ot the plot.\n\nAfter a plot twist that anyone with half a brain should've seen coming miles away the game has you play as Connor through his childhood. At one point he encounters Charles Lee on the way to burn his village and says that one day he will find him. Connor returns to the village to find it burning and his mother trapped under some wood and about to burn to death. A few years later Connor is asked to seek out the Assassin's and encounters an old man named Achilles who trains him over a few years.\n\nAfter the training is over Connor gets that tneat looking outfit and ends up going on a revenge quest against Charles Lee and helping the Sons of Liberty along the way.\n\nI'd just like to point out that the game only really starts at Sequence 6 so there is essentially 5-6 hours of tutorial.\n\nA lot of the hate for this game tends to come from the protagonist Connor, people seem to find him humourless, shortspoken, tempramental and kinda standoffish at points. I think this works in his favour as it seems that he is one of the more realistic and believble characters in this story.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is pretty much the standard AC gameplay but with a few tweaks to make it work in the setting such as an aiming mode for guns and the bow or the use as a tomohawk as the ain weapon instead of the swords. The combat in this game is definitely the best out of all the AC games, it's still ridiculously easy but is a lot less reliant on counter spamming and has enemies that require more tactics than 'Press X to Kill'. There are also a ridiculous amount of combat animations that also make it look great.\n\nThe visuals are great even on the lowest settings as I played them, the frontier looks beautiful and the cities do feel alive. Only gripe with them is the draw distance in the cities (Boston especially) can be pretty low.\n\nIn conclusion. Even though I said it isn't a good game I am recommending it because I see the potential of a truly great game here if it was made by competent developers. It's worth picking up on sale but be warned, as with any title uPlay is required.","August 27, 2014","true","18.6"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","0"

The first game, starts with a beautiful, well-orchestrated, intriguing and delightful sequence, which takes you from the Opera to the colonies, following the game’s most interesting character: Haytham Kenway. During these first sequences, you control a character with, well, character. The feeling of the age is given very nicely and the world-wise and confident Haytham is a good match to anyone who has played the AC series. It pauses at the end of sequence 4, after having skillfully introduced the next character, to give way to the second game.\n\nThe second game, which gives you lots of things to do and follows the life of Connor, and his tutelage and eventual success at stopping the Templars, has the unfortunate feeling of being somewhat disconnected. There is lots to do, from trapping animals to fighting naval battles, from trading to building up the homestead, all the time collecting “energy sources” in present day to power up “the temple” and see what there is. The problem with all of this is that you control a character that starts, justifiably, naïve but does not develop into what you hope and falls way short of his far more interesting father. Surrounded by the most ridiculous rendition of naval warfare, the proverbially stupid guards and a background story that has lost all track, the game goes on to the very end with just a bit too much to do and a bit too little to say.\n\nIronically, AC III’s top two moments are probably after its main story is done, with Connor’s meeting with the old man in his village, and the criticism on the days after the American revolution, on how to make money by selling land you don’t own, and on how there is little difference over who rules.\n\nAC III is by no means a bad game. It has improved in all technical areas and the things you can do are really enjoyable and mostly well executed. As always, guards could be more intelligent, to add realism and depth to the game and bullets should kill you but, those things aside, the game delivers well in most areas – it is just a bit all over the place story-wise.","September 25, 2014","true","88.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

OK, maybe like this... AC III has some kind of a bad reputation, yet I enjoyed the game a lot, and was positively surprised  by how much I liked it.\n\nBefore I go on, two disclaimers: I am a fan of the AC franchise, have played all titles, and am now in the process of playing through all of them in chronological order. So before I even got to III, I did play through AC, ACII, Brotherhood, and Revelations.\n\nDisclaimer 2: I have not had any issues with uplay. I am able to start and play all Ubisoft games I own (mostly AC-titles) through it, and the client works. I run it as an admin and have allowed my firewall to let uplay access the net. The ONLY problem I had was that for a few days now, uplay would lose connection to the server. Which isnt really a problem though, as I can still start the games, and savegames and stuff is saved locally, and once you get to connect again, will be updated online.\n\nNow, lets get to the game. It brought a lot of nice changes to the franchise. To me, what stood out most were the changes to combat and freerunning. Freerun now feels a bit more "controlled", smoother and "safer". It seems to be more "intelligent", even though ofc you still will have a few accidents =) However, I felt much more in control during chases and travelling than I did with older AC games.\n\nDisadvantage: Freerunning through forests doesnt feel as...immersive or fun as doing that in a town like Florence, Rome or Constantinople. I found it hard sometimes to see the actual "routes" through the trees, and in town, Ubisoft seems to have wanted to discourage being on roofs 90% of the time, as there are a lot of guards up there who will attack quickly. So in ACIII, I spent a LOT of time on the ground.\n\nCOmbat is harder at first, especially if you were used to the fighting-style of older games. However, once you get the hang of it, it gets much easier, and it still is possible to take on big groups of mobs. Whats important is: You NEED to block a lot. Whenever the indicator (red triangle) comes up, hit your circle-key (I played this, like all other ACs, with an Xbox controller for PC), hold that button and decide how to counter after blocking.\n\nYou need to learn which counter works for which mob. The axe-wielding stronger mobs will hurt you if you try to counterkill, so you need to disarm. Basic mobs can easily be counter-killed. The grey-red-dressed british soldiers (strong) can be counter-killed too.\nNo health-potions here. YOu are stuck with the health you get at the beginning, and at first, it was a turn-off, but becomes much more fun.\n\nWeapon wise, the bow is added, plus the rope-dart. The latter has a cool mechanic, where you can drop enemies to the floor to execute them, or hang animals. Still, I didnt use this too much, but used the bow a lot...its ACIIIs crossbow, for silent, ranged kills.\nStealth works... ok. Its not always easy to see where to stealth, but both hiding in towns and the forest works, and I did like this mechanism, sneaking up on victims.\n\nThe township you build doesnt provide you with a ton of cool upgrades or anything. Armor upgrades arent in game, and the weapons I found recipes for werent an upgrade either. You can fill your ammunition with crafted items, plus increase the amount of ammo (smoke bombs, arrows, poison darts etc).\n\nWhat you CAN do though is earn a ton of money, and I recommend to work on that a bit, as you want to upgrade your ship. At first, the naval battles (which ARE fun!) felt forced into it, it didnt make much sense. However, you can lower the risk on routes for your naval convoys and later, you will do some ship-missions to progress the story, so getting upgrades is helpful.\n\nI earned most money selling furs, both the ones I hunted for myself, and those my homestead huntress got for me. I bought them off of her and sold them via convoys, and once I had ship convoys, I easily made like 20-30K pounds every hour or so.\nThere are a lot of homestead missions, which can be distracting, but they are quick, and I liked the characters.\n\nWhich leads me to the big one for me- Connor. So many people seem to dislike him, calling him uninteresting and bland. IMO, he isn't. It makes sense he behaves the way he does. His mother was a bit like that as well... very dry humor, very no-nonsense, and it seems to be right in line with Connors behaviour. He is different because he has a different past. He is no Italian noble, woman-hunting, brawling, like Ezio was. He is a native american with a british dad, who watched his village burn early on, and then went out to fulfill his mission in the outside world among all these other people.\n\nHe is from a different culture, and is more of a silent, determined, focused kinda guy. And there are some quite funny situations where his deadpan delivery makes for funny dialogues (for example the missions with his father later in the game).\n\nThe story was quite cool, and you start to hate Lee, one of the main antagonists. It all comes to a satisfying end eventually. Keep in mind that you DONT HAVE TO DO all of the side-stuff. Many people say the game felt grindy, but I left out most of the side-stuff, only did naval battles and homestead missions, and focused on the story missions, and it didnt feel grindy at all.\nHowever, Ubisoft AGAIN managed to drag it out way too much in the end. I hated that, in Brotherhood, you beat the game with Ezio, did all these amazing things, kill the bad guy..and then there is a long parcour-riddle with Desmond. Frustrating, it felt like "Guys, I beat this game, why do I now have to do more jumping riddles".\n\nThe Desmond-parts in the earlier game can be fun, but the end is horribly dragged out. TOo many cut-scenes, the lack of a UI (Desmond doesnt have one, of course) made it even more confusing, so even though the story of Desmond ends here, it wasnt a perfect ending.\n\nI enjoyed the game a lot, I did like Connor and the other characters (and once you learn where Achilles got Connors name from, and see his reaction, you might change your opinion on him being bland), liked the game-play, the missions, hunting, crafting/trading (even though the menus of the accounting book were rather... clunky).\n\nAltogether - 9/10\n\nPros:\n- Great graphics\n- Cool story/missions\n- Nice updates to old mechanics, like the freerunning and combat\n- Naval battles\n- I liked Haytham and COnnor\n- Nice to visit colonial NYC and Boston, and learn about stuff from the database\n- Some nice and creative writing (prison, the hanging etc.)\nCons:\n- The ending =/ Way too dragged out.\n- Music was...ok. Nothing memorable, other than one of the main-themes being a total rip-off\nof "Requiem For A Dream"\n- Menu of the accounting book is too clunky to navigate a lot","October 15, 2015","true","44.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It adds new elements to the franchise, new locations, new characters and improved gameplay that makes it feel unique to its franchise, but it is let down by Ubisoft's blatant disregard for PC gamers and their systems.\n\nPros\n\n+ Great storyline.\n+ Great characters (You start off as Haythem Kenway and eventually play as his son).\n+ Improved graphics.\n+ More fluent free climbing and combat.\n+ More side quests.\n+ Naval combat.\n+ Hunting.\n+ Fun gameplay.\n\n\nCons\n\n- While the combat is more fluent it can be somewhat irritating at times, you will often counter an enemies attack only for him to punch you or to be attacked by another enemy.\n- Weapons can often be inneffetive, the hidden blade in this game is only good for assassinations. For open combat it is useless, the pistol and bow can be effective but only against weaker enemies.\n- Terrible stealth mechanics....yet again.\n- Terrible port (certain areas of the game will have drastic drops in FPS and will dip to mid 30's whereas other areas will have a high framrate and smooth gameplay. Two examples of this are Boston and The Frontier).\n- Bland and stupid AI.\n- Riddle with glitches.\n- Still no ability to save when you like which can be irritating if the game crashes.\n- The game relies on horses for long-distance travel but it has made no improvements on them, the have very short stamina and often get glitched and stuck into objects.\n\nThis game would be fantastic if is was not for the constant drops in framerate and the game ruining bugs and glitches.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecybercoco/recommended/208480/","thecybercoco","Cybercoco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecybercoco/","283 products in account","To preface: I can't really give a full recommendation, nor outright not recommend this game. The game had a lot of potential to be great, but was held back by a considerable amount of bugs and lousy design choices. The result was a fairly mediocre game and a sloppy console port to PC.\n\n+ Nice visuals and soundtrack. The North American colonial setting is new and fresh for the series.\n+ Some interesting characters. Connor was a nice change of pace for a protagonist (unless you consider Desmond as the real main protagonist). The dynamics between the AC characters was good, especially the father and son relationship between Haytham and Connor and the tension that brang.\n+ The colonial story arc was neat for the most part. Even though it was kind of revisionist history, I can see history buffs getting somewhat of a treat with all the tid bits of history given (as well as calling out all the places the game got it wrong).\n+ The Desmond arc was the more interesting aspect of the story. Unfortunately, it has a weak ending.\n+ Desmond finally sees some action, although not a whole lot.\n+ Some of the new combat features were cool and aesthetically pleasing. A dual wielding assassin just seems right.\n+ The ability to choose between 4 different counters made combat feel more powerful as an assassin. Some people complain it was too easy, but it didn't seem like it to me. More guns in the environment made it more dangerous. Also, there was a lot more variety to the enimies than in past games that required more tactics to defeat. Definitely not a game where you can just mash the buttons and win.\n+ Naval combat was a new and fun feature.\n+ The Homestead stuff was also new and was actually worthwhile due to the ability to get the best gear in the game.\n+ Animus menu is vastly improved from past games. No more hypersensitive controls that make you skip where you want to go and generally frustrate the hell out of you.\n+ A lot more interesting recruit abilities. Unfortantely, a lot of them are pretty useless, but some are still cool and gives some variety.\n\n- This game was sloppily put together and lacks polish. There are a lot of bugs and glitches in this game. Problems with colision, randomly falling through the ground and under the world, getting stuck in objects, graphical glitch (like a good deal of rubberbanding), etc. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this game in the state it is in. Totally unacceptible.\n- Some very assinine design decisions that sometimes feel like they were developed by a group of r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d monkies (described in more detail below)\n- AC series has some of the worst controls in the industry. They tried to improves things in AC3, but failed miserably. The controls are still clunky and frustrating as hell. You'll still get those annoying instances where the character will stick to walls when running around corners or jump in totally random directions you didn't intend. In fact, I'm still debating whether they made the controls worse than past AC games or not. It's definitely still bad.\n- They attempted to hide the optional full sync objectives so failing wasn't so in you face (as complained about in Brotherhood and Revelations). The results was the it much easier to miss what the optional full sync objectives were, yet it was still in your face when you failed them. This just created an even more annoying experience with them.\n- Some of the full sync objectives were unreasonable and frustrating. One example is a naval mission that plops you in the middle of a horde of gun ships and frigates and expects you to complete it while taking less than 25% of damage. Another example is an objective to not take more then 30% damage to a pack of wolves, while only being given a fraction of a second to react to the QTE where any failure would make you take too much damage, and ranged weapons were not allowed (essentially impossible without emploiting and cheesing your way through it). It didn't seem like game balance was tested very well.\n- Desmond's story arc had a confusing ending that somewhat disconnected it from past games. It was a dissappointment after the build up through 5 games.\n- Connor's story had its issues as well with things that didn't fit all that well. The story is definitely weaker in AC3 than in other games in the series. It could've been better.\n- The majority of the game is filled with fluff and fillers that served more as novelties than anything fun and worthwhile.\n- Crafting has potential (mainly due to the ability to get the best gear in the game), but was held back by atrocous UI and controls. Needs a lot more refinement.\n- Convoys replace shop investments as the main source of income. Unfortanately, it's a very cumbersome and time consuming way to make income and more tedious than fun. Another poor design.\n- Even though the best gear is crafted, gear is mostly not worth much in this game. The vast majority of opponents are easily dispatched just by counters as one shot kills, which doesn't really account for gear. A better sword would essentially just allow you to kill disarmed enemies a little faster. Gear progression is totally wonky. Most weapons will start off as instantly obsolete. 2h weapons are pretty much worthless. The only weapon that really makes a difference is the kind of gun you have, and that only because some guns let you fire extra shots before needing to reload. Other than that, gear is nearly entirely inconsequential.\n- Due to the above, it feels like gear and currency just don't have a place in this game. This series is probably better with it taken out entirely. They're just unfun distractions.\n- Recruits feel a lot weaker in this game despite the fact that they can't die (but get injured instead). The guild menu is also clumsier to navigate.\n- Stealth in this game sucks. Imprecise controls makes it very frustrating. Also, inconsistent detection machanics also make for a very frustrating experience. To compound this problem, some missions require stealth and there is no options to complete certain missions (not all that open ended).\n- This game gives the illusion of open world, but it's not really all that open, especially during missions (this is a series issue).\n- And if you needed further proof that this game development was lead by idiots: the credits are atleast 15 minutes long AND CAN'T BE SKIPPED. The game inputs literally shut down during the credits, you can't do anything but watch them. You can't even exit the game without a hard shut down (which means nothing gets saved). This is by far the most assinine design decision in the history of video games!\n\nAs I said before, I can't give a full recommendation, but I can't say this game is outright bad either. It's a mediocre game that had potential to be great but was held back by bad design decisions and lack of polish. I can say that after playing this game I've lost motivation to continue with this series as it seems pointless (for what it's worth). Get this game if you are following the story or are just a fan of this kind of gameplay. Stick with the main mission. You can do the naval battle, and perhaps, the homestead missions which are fairly fun, but the rest is a waste of time and not all that fun at all.\n\nAlso, this game is a prime example of Ubisoft giving the PC community the finger by giving sloppy ports. Only get this when it's on sale. Ubisoft doesn't deserve full price for this game. It's not worth it.","November 8, 2015","false","117.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You play as Connor Kenway; a native American who trains to be an assassin in order to get revenge for his mother's death. You also play as his father, Haytham Kenway, at the start. Along the way you, Connor, ignite the fires of the American revolution and decide to help them purely because the Templars are helping the British. This entire idea feels pointless though because the patriots and Washington decide to burn your village so at the end you turn on them, whilst you see Templars killing royalists. Yeah Connor messed up...\n\nThe game introduces a new mechanic to its free running in the frontier sections, with the ability to climb trees and use these instead of rooftops. This is great and well executed but feels limiting, very streamlined, and is pointless seeing as most of the time nothing happens in the frontier. The rooftop free running is still there however guards detect you almost instantly and it kin  of discourages going on the roof, meaning you spend most time on the ground. This feels wrong for an assassin game, even more so with the fact you stand out wearing the assassins robes; at least Altair could hide among priests. The combat is great however after a while it feels repetitive as guards do the same moves, whether patriot or royalist, whether highlander or officer. Also you are so overpowered in this episode of the assassin's creed franchise.\n\nThe story is quite interesting and very in depth however Connor has no emotion or charm like the other assassins. He is quite plain, particularly when compared to his father who plays the relaxed aristocrat. In addition, every time you get somewhere good in the story Desmond shows his face and you have to endure half an hour of modern day pointless Desmond. The ending is boring and the credits last 20 mins, you can't even skip them. The beginning isn't great either, with a long tutorial, it takes about 5 hours before you even get the assassin robes. The lockpicking system is horrible (just copy Skyrim for goodness sake) and overall the game feels clunky and rushed; particularly the anti-climatic battles.\n\nHowever, as a history buff and a fan of the colonial era I felt at home with the game. I did get annoyed with the historical inaccuracies (there are a lot) however there were a few nods to people such as myself within the story. I felt as though the story itself was good, it was fun to go on killstreaks, the naval combat wasn't too bad and the graphics lived up to their standard. The seasonal and time changes were a joy and it was nice to see so much content; the hunting is an example of this, it had a lot of content but really was just pointless.\n\nOverall I enjoyed AC 3 however I feel as though the game is only enjoyable to people who appreciate the era and who don't over hype it.\n\n6/10.","July 9, 2014","true","256.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

My friends who played this game warned me that it's bad and it's going to put me off the AC series. They were right.\n\nI'm not going to complain about the optimisation and technicalities. It's not horrible, playable even on my old-ish rig. My main issues are:\n\n1. Dull plot.\nIt's difficult to care about the protagonist or his plight. The prologue of the game is actually reasonably interesting plot-wise (albeit definitely too long - takes almost 3 hours!!!). After that, it gets worse.\nNot sure, might be the fact that I'm not American so I don't really care much about their revolutionary history - apparently most of the people Conor meets are somehow famous, but since I recognise only a few names, I can't feel excited when he meets yet another guy who tells him how important it is to do this and that and yadda yadda yadda, ZZzzzz.\nWhat's worse, it's not entirely clear what the conflict is. Seems assassins want to kill templars only because they are templars, even though their goals in the colonies are somewhat aligned (getting rid of the Brits) - most of the time it looks as if Conor was fighting the templars because he holds a grudge, nothing more. Anyway, the plot is slow, uninspired and dull. If you thought Revelations had poor plot... this one is much worse. Revelations at least had an interestig city. Cities in AC3 are almost identical, bland and boring - absolutely nothing to look at, and famous spots look nothing like they now. Seriously, who thought setting the game in the British Colonies was a good idea?\n\n2. Game construction and mechanics.\nThis is just frustrating. Short walks or runs frequently interrupted by short cutscenes that don't really add any value. Then another short walk, another cutscene. A short fight, then a short walk, and a cutscene. Aaaargh! And it happens very very often!!! There are way too many missions where you have to chase someone, or tail someone, and soldiers tend to get alarmed by your presence for no apparent reason. Controls are clunky, after 20 hours of game time I'm still not entirely sure how the fighting system works and you don't really have that much assassinating to do... Oh, and parcouring in the forest - BORING and silly.\n\nAlso, this game feels like the most restrictive of all AC games so far. OK, in all of them your option to kill the target were seriously limited (it's not Hitman after all), but this one is totally ridiculous at times with laughable stealth and frequent instant failures. Feels extremely linear too but the most annoying fails are caused by stupid bugs, like Conor sticking to walls and buildings because game developers decided it will be a great idea to have running and climbing under the same button...\nThere were numerous moments where I considered giving up after yet another fail for stupid reason like that, and just watchning the rest of the endless cutscenes on youtube. I even attempted that once, only to find out (to my relief) that I'm nearly at the end of the main story, so decided to get on with it. Phew. And as I said - the story is dull and the only reason why you may want to actually suffer through it is to see Desmond's fate and for plot continuity before I move on to AC4.\n\n3. Shedload of stuff to do but none of it worth your time.\nYou can hunt, trade, expand your homestead, attack convoys, craft stuff, take control of city areas, conquer forts etc. The problem is - you don't really feel like it's worth your time. You won't get much out of it. Some money, that you can live without. Unless you're an OCD sufferer who just needs to do every single mission and achievement, you will completely ignore those side-subquests. The game will, of course, force you to suffer through some of them just to show you that you can do them, but after that... you'll most likely ignore it. Kind of like the tower defense part in Revelations - after the tutorial you probably never bothered. AC3 has about half a dozen useless elements like that.\n\nHaving said that, the only element that seems less boring is sailing. True, after a few missions the novelty wears off as well, but at least it's fun (no wonder the fourth game expanded that part) and there is some sense of achievement when you sink a larger vessel. Expanding your ship is very tedious though, as it requires a lot of money and the economy of this game is just broken.\nPrevious game had this neat system where you simply rebuilt shops, banks and whatnot and were getting the income from those. Here, you have to craft stuff with some ridiculous and tedious crafting system, then you need to sell stuff via trade routes and such, you can send assassins to do missions but it's nowhere near as simple as in previous game... All this feels like an intentional timesink and amounts to sheer frustration - it's really been a while since I played a game that annoyed me so much.\n\nIf you enjoyed previous AC games (even Revelations) - stick to them. Skip AC3 and give AC4 a try - apparently it's much better. Although me, after finishing AC3, I will probably have a short break from the AC franchise.

Refreshingly, it is a game about America that doesn't settle for simple fictions when the uncomfortable truths about the United States' history would be more interesting.\n\nACIII packs surprises big and small, veers away from habits of the older games, and looks a hell of a lot better than them, too, thanks to a new graphics engine. All things considered, it winds up perhaps not as refined as Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, but far more satisfying and well-crafted than the rough draft of Assassin's Creed 1. Connor may not have Ezio's flair, but he has a game that rivals the quality of the Italian's trilogy.

So much, in fact, that it was hard to put down until I beat it. The storyline is good, the characters likeable, and the interactions between the protagonist and antagonist humorous.\nI don't like the whole cliche storyline about saving the world from an exploding sun. The cutscenes were way too long and boring. Connor was underdeveloped, and you spend a while at the beginning playing as someone else.\nTo be honest, the parkour and assassinations were glitchy, and it was hard to get Connor to do what you want. Also, you could fight your way out of most goofs, so sneaking wasn't an emphasis.\nSo although it wasn't the best executed, it was still good. Freerunning is always fun, and getting to work with Ben Franklin and other historical figures is a blast. They do a great job of weaving fact with fiction.\nThe graphics are amazing, and the tried and true assassin gameplay is fun, although no Ubisoft, I will still not waste time hunting.\nI especially liked the chances to play as Desmond, because the lack of HUD made it much more of a challenge.\nSo if you're a hardcore fan of the series, get over the fact that it deviates from the second game and enjoy it for what it is: the video game version of the Avengers. Not much depth, a whole lot of fun.","January 21","true","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Add to that a poor optimization from a technical point of view, primarily when you visit the big cities of Boston and New York.\n\nAC3 story, in my personal list, is a bit more interesting than Revelations', but it will never reach previous chapters like AC2 and Brotherhood. Unfortunately, also Desmond tale's ending is weak and confusing, leaving the player a bit disappointed after 5 games (!) that built high expectations about First Civilization's mysteries.\n\n“So why have you played more than 50 hours if this game is not that good and interesting?” Well, because I'm an achievements ♥♥♥♥♥, and generally I like to explore every little inch of the games I play, and AC3 world is BIG, that's why! Probably it can be finished in about 20-25 hours if you do all primary and secondary missions, leaving some achievements alone.\n\nTo conclude, buy Assassin's Creed 3 if you really like the historical period and if you want to see Desmond's finale at all costs, but if you are looking for innovation, please go ahead.","January 16, 2015","true","54.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On the whole I love the historical representation of the AC series and always been facinated with America's revolution ERA, Yes it is a fictional reference but on the whole it's rather well done.\n\nYet this isn't about history and mostly about the setting and some unique story telling amidst Kenwood following clues from an amulet he took in the beggining of the game. Not goin to go into the story as others already mentioned in their review.\n\nAnyway my only gripe is about the combat that has been somewhat staple fo the AC series. I find it right now too much like the Batman Arkham games. Counter > attack, Counter > Attack. It's kind of dull a too easy in a way. The only alleviating thing about it is more of the trying to get full sychronization like not getting detected Silent kills  etc. I've heard black Flag has better combat though.\n\nIf you're a completionist like myself that this has plenty to do. Finding all the almanac pages, synchorinzing all the high locals, hunting every creature etc. It does a great job of that.\n\nOf course everyone has their personal opinion this game is well done, keeps my attention long enough. I have to say looking forward to delve into Black Flag which I picked up for $10 on the Holiday sale.

Those of you with your hands down are liars. This game broke Ubisoft's preorder record (previously held by Assassin's Creed Revelations) and I know several people who bought it; unfortunately none of them got it on PC do I don't have anybody to play multiplayer with. What I'm saying is that there was tons of hype for this game, and I don't feel like it delivered on its promises.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game a lot; but based on the improvements that each game in the series has made, I was expecting more. They promised a huge, open-world game and I was expecting Skyrim with hidden blades. As it turns out there are only four areas total for you to run around in: Boston, New York, the frontier, and the homestead which serves as your home base. There was plenty of side stuff for you to do in each of those areas, but none of them really seemed meaningful; they didn't add to the lore of the game and they didn't give interesting rewards. Getting more money wasn't something that I was concerned with; I had my hidden blades, my tomahawk, and my pistol. What more could I need? There aren't any armor upgrades or even medicine to buy like in previous games (regenerating health). I quickly stopped exploring altogether and only focused on doing the main story missions.\n\nThe story wasn't a disappointment. It had plenty of twists (some more unexpected than others) and I enjoyed the return to the epic decade-spanning narrative style similar to the one in Assassin's Creed II. It is much easier to understand a character's motivations when you have been following his story from before his birth through his childhood and into early adulthood.\n\nYou might notice that I said that the story started before Connor's birth. That is because throughout the first few hours of the game you play as Haytham, Connor's father. Many developers have gotten good at sneaking tutorials into plot-critical missions, and ACIII is a great example of that. Haytham and the other characters from the prologue are great; I appreciate Haytham's frank Britishness, Charles' door-kicking enthusiasm, and Hickey's idiocy. As my friend Katie said after he said something especially ignorant, "I wonder what it feels like to be that uneducated."\n\nI have always found the American Revolution fascinating, and I loved the missions that happened during major historical events like the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, and the midnight ride of Paul Revere. However, after those early events you stop interacting directly with the revolution. George Washington also didn't appear very often. I had been given the impression that he and Connor were going to become friends but he only appeared about four times throughout the game, and they were very brief encounters.\n\nAssassin's Creed III is of course the climax of the "the world is going to end on December 21st!" arc and thus you get to spend some time outside of the animus learning more about the first civilization. Desmond's father is one of the people there with Desmond, and their rocky relationship comes up quite a few times. I thought that the ending was a little weird. Desmond was given a choice, but the player didn't get to affect that choice. I personally would have chosen differently, but it's not like player choice has ever been something that Assassin's Creed did anyway.\n\nI am worried that I am sounding way more negative than I mean to here. I had a blast playing this game. My favorite addition were the naval missions. These missions were so well done, so fleshed out that they could have been their own game. I am so glad that AC4 is mostly naval combat.\n\nCombat has also been vastly improved. It is much easier to attack continuously and counter incoming attacks, often turning these into combo kills. Connor attacks with a lot more ferocity and violence than Ezio or Altair.\n\nSo yes, Assassin's Creed III is definitely worth getting, but make sure that your expectations are realistic before you play it.","December 19, 2012","true","37.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While seemingly simple and generic, the brilliance of the plot comes from how it is incorporated with real events and individuals of the American Revolution. Players will get to (virtually) relive the Boston Massacre, Tea Party, and many famous battles in the course of Connor’s journey. However, the narrative gets all sorts of convoluted and as someone with little knowledge of history, I found the game failing to convey important details and distinguish the supporting cast. Fortunately, Wikipedia was there to clarify any and all of my confusion.\n\nThe campaign takes place across three locations: colonial Boston, New York, and the frontier. Each of the former two is divided into three districts which can be liberated from the British via side quests. Liberating a district earns Connor an Assassin recruit and a skill. Unlike previous games in which the recruits were nothing more than killing machines, the new skills now allow them to act as body guards or set up ambushes. Standing in contrast to the bustling city life is the frontier, a mixture of lush forests and sprawling plains populated by wildlife. Describing it with mere words won’t do it justice, but I will say that upon finishing the main story, I found myself compelled to revisit the wilderness just to explore.\n\nOther new game mechanics include the ability to whistle around corners and participate in naval battles. The former must’ve been nice conceptually, but its execution was extremely poor. Its purpose is to lure guards, but frustratingly enough, it doesn’t always work. On the plus side, the naval battles are easily my favorite addition to the series. These side missions allow players to commandeer a warship and sail the Atlantic Ocean, defending merchant ships and fighting British vessels. The sounds and visuals when blowing up enemy boats are extremely gratifying. Also worth noting is the quality of Connor’s character animation. Everything he does, from combat to swinging from tree to tree is graceful and hypnotic. The animators at Ubisoft Montreal have really outdone themselves!\n\nTwo of the most glaring faults I’ve encountered are with the controls and multiplayer. Very often, I found my character doing stupid things like climbing up the wrong object, jumping off something in the wrong direction, or incorrectly assassinating people in a crowd. The bottom line is that the controls just don’t feel as smooth or responsive as they should. From what little time I spent in the multiplayer, I found it to be extremely imbalanced and this is coming from someone with plenty of experience in Brotherhood and Revelations. The broken matchmaking system often grouped the novice players together against experienced ones. Some of the level requirements to unlock useful skills are ridiculous, giving newcomers an extreme disadvantage.  This stands in contrast to the previous titles in which skills were unlocked in custom order as long as the player could afford it.\n\nI feel as though I’ve barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. I had planned to say much more, but Steam’s recommendation limit prohibits me from doing so. I’d like to note that by the time I finished the game (40 hours), I came to the shocking realization there were at least a handful of features I hadn’t even touched. As with many ambitious games, this one also has many flaws. But the one thing that separates the Assassin’s Creed titles from everything else is their potential educational value. It’s a solid and expansive game that, to me, is more than just a piece of mindless entertainment.\n\nGrade: 5/5","December 23, 2012","true","105.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/recommended/208480/","thecolorurple","TheColorUrple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/","511 products in account","For a while there I thought I would never recommend this. I have never played a more thoroughly unpolished, broken, and unfinished game than Assassin's Creed III.\n\nYet here I am recommending it to the 3 people who haven't already tried it, and I have to sort of figure out why. During the 60 hours or so of 100% completing every objective in the game, I found myself hugely ambivalent - completely floored at times by its scope, ambition, and amazing atmosphere, while at other times insanely bored at the mundane side quests or frustrated by its linear objectives and poorly scripted sequences.\n\nAssassin's Creed III gets so much stuff wrong, so I need to start with what it gets right, partly to remind myself why I enjoyed it overall.\n\nThe storyline and characters, while not for everyone, really satisfied me. A father-son relationship blooming on opposite sides of a conflict, a central character who is so standoffish and serious that he becomes endearing, and the whole Desmond metastory are all strong positives. There are Desmond haters out there, I know, but while the typical end-of-the-world scenario is ho hum, the fact that you get to explore really interesting present-time locations to break up the action in the past is icing on an already very, very large cake.\n\nThe slow development of the main plot is also a good thing. I don't like when game designers, for fear of players being so easy to bore these days, jump right into the action and don't let off the throttle til the credits roll. This reminds me a bit of Red Dead Redemption - deliberately paced to ease you into the world and properly introduce the characters to create scope, grandeur, and meaning in the game's much more dramatic final confrontations.\n\nThe Homestead, your place of residence, is a colonial utopia. While the missions you run for your friends and residents reek of that typical open-world desperation wherein developers feel the need to cram some nonsensical drama into every corner of your map, the actual place (once the missions are complete) feels alive and warm in a way most video game environments fail to achieve. As you walk down the main road, which is cut through the forest and gradually develops as you progress in the story, you will see the doctor aiding a resident with breathing problems, or one of your buddies fishing on the bridge, a barmaid squishing berries with her feet for wine, or a woodworker putting the finishing touches on his freshly-made chair. It all seems trivial and scripted, and it is, but the residents all casually flow from one activity to the next on a randomized schedule, and adhere to the day-night cycle as well. They will talk to you as you pass and make you feel like a part of their world. There is an achievement tied to observing them, and I found myself really enjoying my time there, relaxing as a part of the community, if you will. And even having done that for probably longer than most people will bother, I still didn't observe a good chunk of the activities the residents partake in. It's a really nice step forward for the open-world genre, wherein most other games NPCs are either doing one specific activity forever and ever or just walking around randomly.\n\nSo it follows to say that Creed III's atmosphere is top-notch, especially in the frontier, which is a giant map of hills, forest, rivers, and settlements where you can run around the treetops and hunt animals and so forth. It will rain, it will snow, and it will offer jaw-dropping vistas on a very regular basis. It's a superb location and was very lovingly crafted by the map designers. The city sections in the game are more typical for the AC series and aren't as vibrant, full, or interesting as previous entries. But the frontier, along with the open waters and side maps from the Caribbean to the Great North, keep the whole very interesting.\n\nMissions are hit-and-miss, with some just a matter of literally getting to the icon on the map and pressing a single button. There are a lot of annoying filler quests, and the fact that so many of these seem rushed, buggy, and incomplete make me wonder if the game would have been better off reducing the quantity and focusing on the quality. My guess is yes, because some of the sequences are superb and very worthy of its bazillion dollar budget.\n\nAlso, the sailing is awesome.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints with the AC series up to this point, and I've played them all, was a lack of stuff to do, a problem particularly flagrant in the first two installments. It's hard to complain about Creed III in this sense since it is packed to the brim with systems and icons and checklists. Unfortunately, it's overwhelming and poorly explained throughout, which made my first 20 hours with the game sort of resentful at all the things I didn't want to do while the game seemed to nudge me to do them anyway. I also had this strange feeling of being shepherded through the first half of the game's story, in which I would be shown each system one at a time and without proper or meaningful context. I didn't get a sense of the open world for a long while, nor did I have any reason to tinker and toy with the new systems.\n\nThis is one of Assassin's Creed III's biggest flaws: there are too many poorly-designed and\nsuperfluous systems that are not properly introduced to the player. The economy system is the worst: horrible and confusing menu systems that govern collecting materials, crafting new materials, and sending those materials on convoys for money. It seems like a good idea on paper, but one that was ultimately unfinished and inexplicably uncut from the release. Just the simple idea of including a quantity selector for an item you want to send on a convoy, for example, seems to have been neglected entirely, forcing you through an arduous process for every individual piece of loot you want to sell, rendering the whole activity pointless for the tiny amount of money you will make with most items. The poorly organized menus touch pretty much the entire game in some way, from the confusing objective menus to the general stores and weapons to the hard-to-interpret world map to the fast travel system and on and on and on, and these flaws are apparent immediately.\n\nHunting is another poorly implemented system - you get several tools such as bait, snares, and arrows to hunt with, where all you really need is your hidden blade since most animals are too dumb to run away or get stuck in trees as you chase them. Your horse is also an animal, and it also gets stuck on trees. And bushes, and rocks, and also pebbles, and anything that has volume, making traversing the frontier a frustrating chore.\n\nSince the frontier itself is so vast compared to your movement speed, you will find a very considerable amount of your play time will be just getting from point A to point B in the fastest way possible, and even the improved climbing mechanics still don't make this process any less annoying than previous games. It's actually quite worse now, since the distances are much longer and there's just more empty space than before. The fast travel points are too few, and having to spend two or three minutes running just to go collect a ♥♥♥♥ing feather drove me bananas.\n\nAnd the game is so, so buggy. Immersion-breaking, head-shaking, existential-crisis-why-do-I-play-video-games type bugs. I've never played Skyrim, I dunno. I got attacked and mauled by a wolf during a cutscene where I was just chatting with a farmer, forcing a restart, which might have been the only time I laughed out loud and enjoyed a glitch, whereas the rest are just embarassing. I get that open-world games are more prone to this type of stuff, but I would love to see Ubisoft exercise more quality control in this regard instead of kicking these games out the door every holiday season.\n\nAssassin's Creed III is very flawed, very frustrating, and probably still worth playing. I suppose that sums it up correctly.","January 17, 2015","true","79.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not everything about the game gels together convincingly and the missions’ unnecessary prescriptiveness sometimes undermines the sense of freedom that the rest of the game works so hard to create. But it achieves so much that you can’t help but respect it. Connor’s story has its lulls but it still tells a tale much richer and more compelling than most other games manage, set in a fascinating period of history. Assassin's Creed III has got all the same triumphs and flaws: it isn’t as huge an improvement upon its predecessors’ achievements as many players will be hoping for, but it’s still up there with the best that the series has achieved. Even if it isn't quite the best.","November 17, 2015","true","16.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Personally all the side missions and extra stuff didn't have enough incentive, I think they could have designed things so you felt a little more compelled to use different equipment, improve the home and do the other side missions, the game would have felt more enriched in terms of gameplay then. The ship battles were the best part of the game aside the level design, and so it's no wonder that became the core part for AC4.\n\nI definitely recommend playing AC3 though, just for experience of such a well designed depiction of Revolutionary America.

Small piece of advice, DO NOT RUSH FOR THE STORY. Instead try to do all those side quest first.  I never actually encounter any bugs in my entire playthrough but i guess it depends on your pc itself. There are a lot of complaints about how Connor was a shallow, forgettable character but for me I kinda like his plain, humble style so not a big problem to me. The graphic is great, just some minor fps drop in Boston thats all, no big deal, no need to cry like a baby because it is not game breaking flaw. Love the liberation missions, gives the assassins recruits more characteristic rather than plain forgettable AI that you cant attached to in the previous game. You need to have patience and will to explore because it is a huge world and unlocking fast travel location can sometime be a little annoying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/recommended/208480/","likeucare","LIKEUCARE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/","1377 products in account","Assassin's Creed 3... where do I begin... I had played this game and was halfway done on the PS3 version, back in 2012... and somehow, I had lost interest on the game. Not because of the American Revolution War setting, but of many bugs, glitches, bland missions and irritating side missions. Honestly, AC3 is my least favorite game of the franchise. So many annoying aspects that kept this game to be just fun.\n\nWhile the game continues the story of Desmond Miles, I would say that if you had played previous AC games, you ought it to yourself to at least, play AC3 for the sake of Desmond's storyline. It is quite interesting to finally see it conclude in some way while being somehow predictable but frankly, it has finally the closure many fans demanded.\n\nAs for the Animus storyline, you play as a Native American, a Mohawk named Ratonhnhaké:ton, aka Connor. He's thrown into the assassin vs templar neverending war, without his conscent (like usual!). You see him growing up, learning how to be an assassin, mastering skills and whatnot. Some time further, you get to control your own sail ship. At least, this is a fun portion of the game! But alas, the good portions are very rare, on the experience I got while playing this game...\n\nPROS:\n+Graphically, this game is impressive, especially this PC version compared to PS3.\n+Amazing attention to historical and visual details (seeing Boston and New York of the old times was quite a virtual visit!).\n+Haytham Kenway (really liked that character and I wish we'd get to play some more of that character's faction in the future of AC games).\n+Rich storytelling.\n+Sea battles are indeed, very fun and tense!\n+Homestead missions and watching that Homestead come to life after each mission completed.\n\nCONS:\n-Uplay DRM.\n-LOTS bugs and glitches.\n-QTE. Not too abundant but still present nonetheless.\n-Terrible and Inflexible missions. You gotta play each missions as how the developer demands you do.\n-Checklist of optional objectives for some bullcrap of "FULL SYNCHRONIZATION". Besides achievements and Desmond Miles skin inside the Animus, it's not worth the trouble!\n-Assassin's recruits doesn't seem to level up as much and as fast as previous AC games.\n-Weak soundtrack done by Lorne Balfe. Worse was at many times, you don't hear any music at all which makes the game a snore fest.\n-Hunting mechanics go largely undeveloped and becomes pointless for the little gain you obtain from hunting.\n-Parkour inconsistencies. (Connor always seem to grip into everything... if only you'd had a button to trigger "grip" when running, that way, you wouldn't be grabbing every ledges and fences).\n-Stealth inconsistencies. (LOTS of stealth requirements on missions and if detected, DESYNCHRONIZED, REPEAT!).\n-As fun as the ship battles go, it becomes mostly pointless since you never obtain any rewards from them, no money, nothing!\n-Currency in the game is hard to obtain. I never understood the trading mechanic of the game and can't care at this point anyway.\n-Way too many tailing missions... just too many...\n-Limited replay value unless you seek Full Synch and all collectibles.\n-Same old multiplayer gameplay. Not my bag but maybe yours?\n-The Tyranny of King Washington DLC has a decent "WHAT-IF" scenario; it gives Connor cool "animal spirit" powers too. That DLC adds about 7 hours of gameplay, depending if you seek Full Synch that is! Although, it feels very strechted and doesn't add up anything into AC3 story. Ubisoft has mentioned that this DLC's story is canon but I fail to see on what base it is. You may skip that 7 or so hours and just read Wiki or watch gameplay videos instead!\n\nOVERALL:\nThe game felt rushed and overly streched in many parts. It was such a huge disappointment even if I dared investing around 40 hours into that iteration. Also, I do wonder if Ubisoft had tested that game and determined that, no, it is not fun to be whacked with a great big red X for failing the long and pointless checklist of optional objectives in missions. It just feels forced to play the game the way they have intended and you can't play the game otherwise, completely inflexible. AC3 is not mediocre but somehow, it is close to it. The game goes in both extremes very often. As good as the game can be at a time and as bad, annoying and irritating the next mission can be.\n\nIn all honesty, if my good old friend never told me how amazing Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag is, I would have given up on the franchise, right here, after having played this AC3.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nSomewhat, yes. For the sake of Desmond's final story arc mainly. If you do not care much about the modern story, you can always have some fun with Connor in the Animus and I gotta say, Connor's story is the saving grace of the whole game. Also, the Tyranny of King Washingtong DLC is passable and doesn't add anything to Connor's story, which makes the Season Pass very optional! If interested, you should get the Deluxe Edition as it includes everything released of AC3.\n\nRATING:\n6.5 / 10\n\n...and now, onto Assassin's Creed: Liberation...","July 14, 2014","true","42.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

This AC3 is completely the oppossite.\nStarting off with Connor. Ok, his motivations are legit, his skills are ducking awesome and all of that but... Wow, he lacks charisma. This guy is mad with everyone for no reason at all. He's completely flat. The worst main character in the saga.\nFor some reason the story doesn't really start until you spend like 1.5 hours (or 2 if you like to explore things and stuff as I like). And man... What a terrible story. It's the perfect scenario, they had a lot of ways to make a good and epic story but it's... Flat. Like Connor.\nThe story fails to hook up. Even tho secondary missions are... Meeeeh.\nHonorable mention to the tech side of the game: disapperaing corpses, strange physics, bugged missions in which the game doesn't recognize you met the objectives (forcing you to restart the mission), and a bunch of things more. I feel like the stealth part of the game is kinda missing. I feel like I can't kill someone without being detected. And man, you don't want them to see you, cause I don't know why, soldiers appear out of nothing! You killed a 4-soldier squad here cause you realized there were no more guards surrounding the zone? FALSE. They keep appearing from nowhere. They didn't appear in the minimap, "Pouf" and they're trying to stab you in the back.\nI simply don't feel like playing this game...\n\nOn the other hand, there are a few new things i find interesting (cause not everything is bad... but almost everything). The new climbing moves are pretty amazing. It's super cool to run from tree to tree and all of that. Naval fights are awesome. Hunting missions are simply a great addition to the saga, in the end it doesn't worth and sometimes is pretty annoying cause you can't even run without being attacked by wolves, lynx, mooses or bears, but it's a great addition no matter what.\n\nIn conclussion, the game is just... Average. It's not a good successor form AC in general, and Connor is the worst main character in the saga.\n\nIf you're a huge fan... Well, maybe you'll find it interesting. But I feel like this game isn't interesting and epic enough (even the BSO is worst than previous AC games).\n\n6/10.

If you never played AC you would love it, if you have played you may still. Things are just changing too much, fighting controls are much more dumbed down. Only attack and deflect really. All about timing. Previous AC you could get into some rag-tag battles and win with a variety of moves.\n\nEach time I feel as though they focus on the story less and more on the city upkeep, weapon upgrades etc. Also, there used to be more variety on how you could complete a mission. This game makes you stand in the right spot otherwise you fail the mission.\n\nWorth $10-15 if you like vamped up stealth version of AC.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Long enough that I sorta forgot a few things including, but not limited to, the following.\n\n- I don't like platforming\n- I won't even try getting 100% completion in this\n- I need to resist my inner Scrooge McDuck\n- HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THESE CREDITS TAKE FOREVER TO FINISH\n\nActually I remembered the last one and made sure to read a book once they started rolling. XD\n\nAnyway, you play in Colonial America this time, which ends up leading to less platforming and more giant open worlds with alot of open space in them. And trees. The US was pretty underdeveloped at this point, so it is true to the setting. Still, Boston and New York have nothing on Florence or Rome from AC2/ACB.  And you meet historical people sometimes, though hypocritical discussion about liberty that the 'Founding Fathers' are into is far less interesting than the murderous schemes of the Borgias. I can go on and say that Connor is nowhere near as awesome as Ezio, or that there are too many tailing missions, and such, but really I don't feel like it. My opinion by now is quite clear: AC3 is not as good as its predecessors.\n\nBut I also get to sail a ship and blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of people. That's pretty neat.\n\nActually the only reason I even got this game was to fill the story gap I would have had between Revelations and Black Flag. Seeing that the sailing was good funtimes in AC3, I'm forcing myself to write this review now before I dive into exciting pirate action. Because that sounds like exactly what I am looking for right now.\n\nThis isn't a bad game. Indeed I had fun playing it. But at the same time I felt like for a game called "Assassin's Creed" I did far less murdering than I would have expected. Actually I'm pretty sure I spent more time finding collectibles and doing all that homestead stuff than I did killing people. And that's kinda unfortunate.\n\nAnyways, it's an okay game. I guess now I am going to get my pirate adventuring on and play Black Flag. Yeargh...\n\nEdit: One last thing: Uplay sucks. Seriously.

After you gain footing and ease\ninto your role of Assassin, the game pulls\na rug under you and switches perspective\nto his son, a Native American youth by the\nname of Ratonhnhaké:ton, or Connor, as he\nwill be later known.\n\nAs you wander about again as his son yet\nto earn his Assassin garb, your vision of\nloveliness, Summer-Rain, enters your room\nin nothing but a loose white top, golden\neyeshadow accenting her already-beautiful\neyes. She looks like one of Those Who Came\nBefore, radiant and alluring.\n\n"Hey. How've you been doing?"

The game enters\ninto open-world exploration mode, and only\nnow you manage to explain to Summer-Rain.\n\n"Freedom Cry (and Assassin's Creed IV: Black\nFlag) comes first." You tell her, as you return\nto your base of operations, the Davenport\nHomestead, and meet with your aging Mentor,\nAchilles. Summer-Rain tries to understand.\n"Sounds complicated. Or at most, ubisoft didn't\nseem to plan things far ahead." She says, one\neyebrow arching.\n\n"The game is a mixed bag." You reply, as\nyou lodge your tomahawk into a Jaeger\nguard of the British Army before using your\nsawtooth sword to finish off a grenadier. You\nfinish killing more British Forces and escape\ninto a General Store, where Summer-Rain\npicks out the Charleston Outfit for you to use,\nthe stark white-red accents on grey which\nresemble Connor from the concept art of III.\n\n"Assassin's Creed III is a great end point\nfor the larger part of the saga, but this game had\nmore than four different studios working on\ndifferent elements of the game." You explain,\nSummer-Rain folding her arms around your neck,\nher face curious."I've not had much experience\nwith it, but I feel that III's modern-day story\nwas all over the place and ruined the momentum\nfor me."\n\nYou put down the controller and leave AC III\nin the background. "I'm not going to argue\nwith you on that, Summer... Assassin's Creed\nIII is a good game-"\n\n"-but...?"\n\n"...it's flaws outweigh its merits. Starting out\nway too slowly, heavily scripted missions, even\nit's story, which could have been great, suffered\nfrom being very middling and kept jumping all\nover the place. These issues didn't do III\nany favors, even though the world, setting and\neach of the characters were compelling in their\nown right." You tell Summer-Rain, who all\nthis time has been inching closer and closer to\nyour lips.\n\n"But it's good... yes? The buildup to get to\nwhere you are right now in the game is worth\neverything is it not?" She breathes, both of\nyour foreheads touching each other.

It was\nworthwhile... if you're not a completionist like\nme and don't mind a few game-breaking bugs...\nit was a bittersweet ending, putting it mildly."\nYou tell Summer-Rain, both of your foreheads\nand noses rubbing against one another.\n\n"I can't even achieve 100% sync even on\nreplay because of these mission bugs, the\nworst part is that the DLC for III, known as\n'The Tyranny of King Washington' is actually\nthe only redeeming thing about the game.'"\nSummer-Rain smiles at you before pushing\nyou to the ground.\n\nThe lights go out, the only source of illumination\nfrom the menu of Assassin's Creed III. Before\nyou can react to your imminent synchronization\nwith Summer-Rain, she tackles you down in the\nhalf-darkness, the sound of eagle fading out.\n\n"After all we've been through, I hope that\nyou find me worthwhile." You can hear the\nuncertainty in Summer-Rain's voice, before\nreaching for her to kiss her doubts away.\n\n"Always, Summer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/208480/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Assassin's Creed 3 to me represents the worst game in the series.\n\nMostly because it had so much potential. It was advertised as potentially being the game to reinvigorate the franchise. At the time AC3 released Assassin's Creed already had a reputation as being a yearly released franchise with just the same game re-released over and over again. With AC3 we were promised arguably one of the more interesting settings, the American Revolutionary War. And we were promised that the game would feature an open world you could traverse either by foot, by boat or by horse.\n\nWhat we got was a game that was half finished. The game controls awkwardly with the gamepad and the user interface is much less functional than in previous games. It's only marginally better with KB+M. Things like using your gun, to switching weapons, to countering attacks feels very sluggish compared to previous games. It doesn't help that the combat is ludicrously easy and that it's near impossible to die due to the very forgiving regenerating health. Despite being advertised differently, the big war battles in AC3 are slow and time consuming. All of the missions in the game feel like a chore and the most enjoyment I had with it was running around the overworld and doing side missions.\n\nThe story is where the game really dropped the ball for me. Nothing in AC3 is unique in terms of story. It plays out very predictibly and it feels like it would've been much more interesting had they been given another year of development time. The first few hours of gameplay are spent in an extremely long extended tutorial sequence which I just want to skip past every single time. The game does get better once you become an Assassin but it really is a slog to get through that first 3 hour milestone. It doesn't help that the protagonist Connor is easily the least interesting character in the game. Who mostly does what he's told and never really comes across as a fully realized character. The Present day storyline is also at it's most annoying in this game. You're frequently taken out of Connor's storyline into Desmond's vastly less interesting storyline to be given endless amounts of exposition you don't care about. I really began to hate the cutscenes in this game after only a few hours.\n\nIt's really sad to me because there are great aspects of this game. I love exploring the frontier and I love the sailing mechanic. The aesthetic of AC3 was something the developer really did very well, and something they thankfully translated well into later titles like Black Flag and Rogue. Things like running through snow, to jumping along treetops, to sailing around in the Aquila are all done really well, and I wasn't surprised those mechanics were done by different studios entirely. The American Revolutionary War is one of my favorite parts of history to read about, and it's depressing to me it ended up being used so poorly here.\n\nTo me AC3 is the worst game in the series. Unlike Revelations which was just dull and uninteresting, AC3 is a mix of things you like and everything you hate about Assassin's Creed. And it's really sad to me because had they been given more time to work on the game it could've easily been the best game in the series. As it stands now it remains one of the biggest indications of missed potential in a videogame.","October 14, 2015","false","10.1"," 38 of 74 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","38","74","4","11"

That being said, my feelings are in no way to deter anyone from playing the game. There a few things that make this game stellar and more things that make it rather lackluster:\n\nPros:\n-Amazing graphics, with beautiful scenery and (new!) changing weather\n-Likable characters, although lacking in development\n-Even more possibilities in battle and free roaming\n-Tons of stuff to do\n-Historically accurate (most of the time)\n\nCons:\n-Glitches everywhere. Aside from falling through the floor a couple times, they didn't really ruin the game, but invisible Benjamin Franklin was rather disconcerting.\n-Plot inconsistencies and strange pacing. I won't spoil anything, but if you actually look at some of the situations logically,  make little to no sense. Sometimes the characters do things completely contradictory to their personalities. As a person who essentially played this game for the plot, it was rather disappointing.\n-Tutorial spends too much time on plot and not enough on actually explaining ♥♥♥♥. Stores are a little bit difficult to find in the beginning and the game spends little time describing what can be upgraded, discovered, etc. I didn't even recruit any Assassins because it was too much trouble. And they just briefly describe how to manage the homestead and the like.\n-Several nearly impossible sync missions. While the previous games have had difficult quests to get 100% sync, some of them in this game are near impossible due to glitches or bad programming. One asked for an air assassination in a place where there was nowhere to air assassinate from. The quests themselves sometimes had rather disappointing glitches or problems that were overlooked. There was a one quest with a follower that was strangely prone to being shoved into the water by civilians.\n\n\nToss-up:\n-Battle mechanics. They've become harder, which is not a bad thing in and of itself. The problem lies in that sometimes the mechanics are glitchy and lead to some strange situations like enemies clipping through walls. In one instance, I threw a redcoat down the well, but he didn't die and so he kept trying to kill me from below. Harmless, but rather annoying.\n-Good guys vs. Bad guys. Ubisoft said they didn't want to villainize one side over the other. Instead, AC3 villainizes several historical figures, like good ol' George Washington. Nothing wrong with that, so long as it's historically accurate. The problem is that although the head of the Patriots may not be a "good guy", the Patriots are clearly favored. Although it's supposed to be Assassins versus Templars, it ends up looking more like America versus Great Britain. The game developers claim this was not the case, but after playing through the game and seeing how almost all of the targets were British or Loyalists, it's kinda hard to say the game doesn't favor the victors. Some people might not find issue with it, but I found it rather annoying since it seemed like the game developer did a real half-♥♥♥♥♥ job on trying to emphasize this point.\n\nTL;DR Play this game if you want a conclusion to the first four games. Unfortunately, it has quite a few problems and glitches that take away from the overall enjoyment of the game. If you can overlook the aforementioned cons, then you ought to have a great time. Expect to invest a lot of time to enjoy this thoroughly.\n","December 27, 2014","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I have to say that it did just that.  The story itself is quite strong, with the majority of it, surrounding your main player character helping defeat the Templars and win the Revolution against the British.  The game had it's share of bugs and rather bad performance, though you can expect that from Ubisoft.  If you can get this game on sale it is definitely worth a playthrough.  Especially if you enjoy games with historical contexts and killing a lot of red coats.  7.5/10","December 22, 2014","true","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's still awesome, tho.\n\nThe controls made me thrash my keyboard because i got so angry. So often i was running thru the woods or cities and suddenly Connor decided to perch on this one slab of stone slightly above the ground and then refused to jump off until i found the 5 degree angle where it was possible to leave. Also i often got spotted by guards because Connor decided to lean onto the wrong side of the environmental object which would have given protection from prying eyes.\n\nI found it extremely hard to feel like an assassin, unless the mission required to remain undetected. The guards spotted me so quickly and then it was almost impossible to hide again. Usually the guards are marked as red dots on the screen, but some just aren't, so Connor ran into them time and again when rounding corners and such. During the ensuing open conflict I felt more like a mass murderer. Luckily the combat was easy enough and death was only a rare consequence of these scuffles.\n\nAnd what's with these homesteaders? Why was effort spent on a useless feature to trade goods from your homestead? The revenue is totally unnecessary since i rarely had to spend any money and it didn't add much atmosphere in my opinion. I'd rather have the control glitches fixed than that.\n\nThe Mayan temple made me angry, because multiple times i found different paths to the shrine, but since i didn't follow the proper invisible way points, nothing happened when reaching the visible way point.\n\nIf you haven't played the previous parts, you will be quite confused about the present-time story and the First Civilisation, tho. It's not well explained.\n\nOtherwise, i enjoyed the atmosphere. The story was intriguing, the templar beginning and the temporary alliance with them is a nice twist. Learning more about native american culture (as a european) and the american revolution was fascinating. Running through the woods and hunting animals was a very enjoyable experience.\nThe graphics are good (not exceptional anymore on PC) and the musical score terrific.\n\nSo i still recommend this game, although it made me so angry.","October 18, 2014","true","58.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a lot of fun going through this whole series but this one really stands out for me. Not because it's better than the other ones, which if I'm being honest it isn't, but rather the hate this game has recieved. I feel like this one is extremely underrated. The intro with Haytham is amazing, it was so well done and parts of Connor's intro were also good. However this game does kind of start to fall apart at times, I'd say hold out on this game until you pass that stupid Paul Revere section half way through because past that this game picks up speed big time.\n\nThe big problem with this one is that it really does insist on beating you over the head with historical references in a really annoying way. Like the Benjamin Franklin scene is a good example of being very half ♥♥♥♥♥ and especially the Paul Revere section as I already mentioned, the teaparty event was all the work of an assassin of course and a templar was responsible for the Boston Masacre, wtf. And here's the Decleration of Independence being signed guys!! *wink* *wink* It felt like I was having my intelligence insulted at times, because of how cheesy and uncreative it was, they handled it really poorly. Oh and the bugs, this game has lots of bugs. I got lucky and didn't experience too many but I've seen the reports on bugs, so be careful buying this game, same with revelations, I'd recommend getting them on sale just to be safe. Also, the mission design and the controls in this one are clearly the weakest in the series.\n\nTo wrap it up, the first quarter of the game is overall good, the second quarter was when things started falling apart, then third and fourth quarter it completely comes together and turns into an awesome story. I wont spoil any more stuff beyond what I've said. It also finishes off the desmond storyline which was done well overall but I felt it could've been much better if they included an epilogue to his story but I can't blame them seeing as how it's easy to run out of time when your being rushed by ubisoft. Overall I recommend it, just hold out on the story and have some patience is all I ask and if you don't like it I don't blame you, it really is a hit or miss game.","April 9, 2015","true","129.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story itself is great, developing more on the ideology of the Templar Order than previous games. The American Revolution was also the ideal event for the rebirth of the Assassin Order. The game delivers one of the most engaging stories of its genre.\n\nThe gameplay was really good; the combat became more realistic and entertaining with various weapons to play with, combining ranged with melee. It also added features like the ability to climb not only buildings but cliffs and trees, and also command a ship through fantastic naval battles.\n\nThe graphics are amazing to look at, from the american landscapes to its cities. But are some of the most unstable I’ve ever seen in a PC game. The game itself is unstable, crashing randomly and delivering an unstable framerate regardless of your hardware and with some tricky bugs like corrupt save files and bad synchronization. Should these problems like graphical optimization be addressed, this would probably be one of my favorite games and we as consumers shouldn’t be the ones fixing the game after paying for it.\n\nHowever, if you somehow don’t experience these issues or manage to correct them yourself like me, the game should deliver you with an amazing experience.  The characters are very well written, it really is movie material as well as its music.\n\nI really do recommend this game, but should only be bought on sale due to its poor optimization.","April 15, 2015","true","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/budget_security/recommended/208480/","budget_security","Budget_Security","http://steamcommunity.com/id/budget_security/","72 products in account","Not as mediocre as many user reviews suggested. In my opinion it's one of the better games in the series so far.\n\nThere is a great amount of varied content (less than Skyrim, but not far off arguably). The main story is quite decent and of a good length, but it is a bit messy at times. There are also a large amount of sidequests, but as with other games in the series, many are low-key and their sub-plots lack plausibility. Gameplay is standard AssCreed fare - familiar and accessible, but sometimes a bit contrived and poorly balanced. The wide variety of activities prevent things from getting too repetitive. It's almost always too easy, except when the controls and game mechanics are being a pain. Missions have optional objectives for added difficulty, which often works well, but sometimes is more annoying than anything else. Combat looks cool, but usually lacks depth and challenge. The new naval missions may lack plot, and the ships may handle more like motorboats, but these missions are fun, and a great change of scenery. The visuals and sea wave effects are also excellent. The soundtrack is good, even better than in AC-Revelations.\n\nSo, as always, realism and historical authenticity leave much to be desired, but the game is still fun. It caters well to the mainstream, but may leave hardcore gamers a bit hungry for more challenge and immersion.\n\nMost environments look decent, and on a technical level the graphics are slightly superior to Skyrim (even with the HD textures DLC), but at the same time, some things still looks a bit dated due to the Xbox360's limits. Like with most console games, the open world still lacks some persistence (bodies vanishing right after you look away, people and even carts spawning or vanishing right in front of you). The detail on the main characters is excellent though. (tip - the low anti-aliasing setting looks better than the high one which makes things blurry).\n\nThe checkpoint save system is better than many others, but can still be annoying sometimes. As with past games controls are ok, but a bit temperamental and not optimised for mouse and keyboard, of course. It is a pity you cannot have a standard FPS setup and programmable 1-9 weapon/gear hotkeys. These kind of things are to be expected with this series, and while annoying, they are not too bad, and certainly don't break the game. I have noticed a few minor bugs (the odd missing model or floating object), but otherwise the game runs very stable. Overall, porting to PC has slightly improved since AssCreed2.\n\nSadly the animus combat training centre has been removed. And one more thing - why can't I gallop(sprint) my horse in town?! In AC-Brotherhood you could gallop only if you had the game installed on an SSD (yes, seriously!). I still have SSD, so WHY U NO GALLOP horsey?!?!\n\nVerdict: It may not be an excellent game, but it is decent, and I can easily recommend it, even if you are new to the series.","April 23, 2015","true","107.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Это одна из основных фишек  этой  серии игр. Плюс ко всему здесь добавили лазание по деревьям, что отсутствовало в прошедших частях асасина. Сюжет довольно таки хороший, система торговли с караванами не такая уж и удобная. В каких либо трагичных или веселых моментах, выражение лица у главного героя вообще не меняется, оно короче говоря каменное (poker face). Мультиплеер улучшился, вообщем когда я прошел кампанию, я начал играть в мультиплеер, и как оказалось очень интересно. В торговых лавках можно приобрести различные костюмы на свое усмотрение и конечно же пистолеты, шпаги и тому подобное. 9/10","March 23, 2013","true","190.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Connor di sini sama sekali tidak berhubungan dengan Altair maupun Ezio. Wajah yang dipakai sebagai model karakter Connor pun juga jauh berbeda dengan Altair, Ezio, & Desmond yang semuanya punya wajah yang sama.\nCerita AC3 pribadi tidak semenarik AC sebelumnya kecuali 1 plot twist di awal cerita. Lalu tentang Desmond, masa petualangan kemana2 endingnya gitu aja?\n\nGameplay (7/10)\nKini penggunaan assassin recruit di AC3 menjadi lebih terbatas daripada di AC Brotherhood atau Revelation. Uang yang dapat dikumpulkan juga semakin susah didapat bila kita tidak berusaha sendiri. Lebih susah tapi realistis menurut ane pribadi. Ada pengenalan naval battle yang menjadi cikal bakal AC4BF, jadi penyegaran buat ganti suasana.\n\nGrafis (9/10)\nSegi grafis AC3 dilengkapi dengan fitur TXAA untuk anti aliasing. Jauh lebih realistis dan proporsional. Meski terkadang ada sedikit bug. Desmond di AC3 jauh lebih kurus daripada yang sebelumnya, jadi mirip campuran Rio Ferdinand sma Van Persie.

It's still awesome, tho.\n\nThe controls made me thrash my keyboard because i got so angry. So often i was running thru the woods or cities and suddenly Connor decided to perch on this one slab of stone slightly above the ground and then refused to jump off until i found the 5 degree angle where it was possible to leave. Also i often got spotted by guards because Connor decided to lean onto the wrong side of the environmental object which would have given protection from prying eyes.\n\nI found it extremely hard to feel like an assassin, unless the mission required to remain undetected. The guards spotted me so quickly and then it was almost impossible to hide again. Usually the guards are marked as red dots on the screen, but some just aren't, so Connor ran into them time and again when rounding corners and such. During the ensuing open conflict I felt more like a mass murderer. Luckily the combat was easy enough and death was only a rare consequence of these scuffles.\n\nAnd what's with these homesteaders? Why was effort spent on a useless feature to trade goods from your homestead? The revenue is totally unnecessary since i rarely had to spend any money and it didn't add much atmosphere in my opinion. I'd rather have the control glitches fixed than that.\n\nThe Mayan temple made me angry, because multiple times i found different paths to the shrine, but since i didn't follow the proper invisible way points, nothing happened when reaching the visible way point.\n\nIf you haven't played the previous parts, you will be quite confused about the present-time story and the First Civilisation, tho. It's not well explained.\n\nOtherwise, i enjoyed the atmosphere. The story was intriguing, the templar beginning and the temporary alliance with them is a nice twist. Learning more about native american culture (as a european) and the american revolution was fascinating. Running through the woods and hunting animals was a very enjoyable experience.\nThe graphics are good (not exceptional anymore on PC) and the musical score terrific.\n\nSo i still recommend this game, although it made me so angry.","October 18, 2014","true","58.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One is templar and one is an Assassin. So at least you aren't playing a goodie two shoes the whole time, but for whatever reason this game is more about the boats. You will play the game in order to unlock those segments of gameplay.\n\nInstead of a commerce empire in each city, in this you build a cult around your homestead and those who reside there believe in you somewhat fanatically. Particularly when you will kill a dozen or so men in order regain the blueprints for the folding chair. I mean, wow, it's the folding chair.\n\nWell, I guess these things need to be done if you are to save the earth from the Sun.\n\nThere is DLC here where you see a Crazed King Washington, but it was too buggy to complete so I gave up.\n\nOverall: Not as good as Brotherhood, the overhaul in combat is welcome, but the fact that when-ever I want to run fast I have to put up with the fact that I will want to climb on crates and fences instead of skirt around the sides of them still has not been solved (Hint Ubisoft: If I'm pushing all the way forward make me run fast, when I hit the right trigger, change the animation to more of a hunch, leave the speed the same.  This will give me the ability to gladly opt into the insanity of free-running over milk crates etc when I choose to.). The ship sequences are awesome.\n\nTIP: During the finale, throw some food into the oven or microwave, because after you chase the final boss the rest of it is pretty much a cutscene.. and believe it or not a non-skippable set of credits.. Which you need to hang around for because there is an epilogue which then leads you to a map mini game that I think only two people understand (I sure hope that does not show up in the next game).","February 18, 2015","true","63.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since revelations. Ubisoft is rushing these games out too fast. The QC was terrible and I can see why Unity is getting such bad reviews. I honestly dont remember this bad of gameplay in the others.\n\nThe story was good but gameplay and a lot of graphical glitches, a lot. Poppins everywhere. All settings maxed. You'd call an assassin strike, once the person dies they immediately disappear and just leave their gun. Some bodies stick around but for the computer there should be much more. Weather changes is a nice effect, with snowy days being the best but rare.\n\nConnor's character seems to be just thrown into the story and he doesn't really feel like part of the series as a whole. I enjoyed his abilities and different things you could do but it just seemed out of place. I didn't really get how he got into the position he did. I mean, you get it, it just seems out of place.\n\nNo point in doing any side missions (hunting, homestead. frontier, etc) as the game is so easy you can use all your default weapons and be fine. I remember in the others you had to as you couldn't beat certain enemies. Here, no one is a match for you! No point in wasting time trying to get money to upgrade stuff because you don't need to. Only thing i upgraded was for the Ship. Cannon, armor, and steering and thats all you need!\n\nThe best part of this game is the Naval battles.

It is often said about the latest AC games that it is just like the old ones, with new weapons, a few new mechanics and new storyline.\nI see this as a good thing, nay, a great thing. Assassin's Creed has stepped from it's astounding beginnings each time building on what was liked in the last game and added new features.\n\nAs the closing act for the main storyline (no spoilers), it was a little disappointing. Also the architecture of this era makes for very little house running that we had in the previous games.\n\nThe introduction of sea battles was a little clunky but a good starting point for Black Flag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clockworkcourier/recommended/208480/","clockworkcourier","ClockworkCourier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clockworkcourier/","48 products in account","I highly recommend this game, legit. Fortunately, I never had any of the bugs other users have talked about. I've had more of them in AC3 or Black Flag, but I'm sure that's in uplay's court. Anyway, technical stuff aside (other than controls, I'll get there), I really did enjoy this game for a multitude of reasons. Some of them may be faults to some people, but hey, that's why this is my review.\n\n1. Characters\n\nHoly gosh darn dang did I love the characters in this. Knowing a bit of the plot helped, since at first I was ready to just kind of trudge through Haytham's sequences and found myself absolutely loving him. He's got that dry British humor that made me love Shaun, but with more... I dunno, Haytham. Of course, I was really hyping myself up the whole time for Connor, and he didn't disappoint me at all.\n\nHe has a ton of personality, which seems to be a complaint for some people? I read a few reviews where people said he seemed flat and boring, but I found it to be the opposite. He acts in that partial-teenager-never-quite-grew-up way, and that hyphen abuse is very intentional. He's got a temper, has a heart the size of the entirety of Boston, and his black and white view of the world is almost refreshing in a way. It makes you frustrated, like maybe shaking his shoulders through the screen should be an added feature to the game. But that's the point, I think. He's tangible and believable, even if sometimes he seems, in his own words (out of context), "Unbelivable!" (Cue the player throwing their hands in the air.)\n\nAlso, not to abuse the word 'refreshing' much more, but it honestly is just that to first of all, have a Native American character that isn't some garbled caricatured stereotype, and secondly, to have them *voiced* by actual Native Americans. I won't say it much, but good on you, Ubisoft, if just for that.\n\nSo aside from me essentially worshipping Connor over here, onto the next thing. (And take a moment to remember Ziio. Remember her. Love her.)\n\n2. Missions\n\nI'll admit, some of the missions had me ready to just give up. Desynching for even being seen for a second can be hella frustrating. One mission in particular during one of Haytham's sequences comes to mind, with having to eavesdrop on soldiers by following them through a fort. I probably failed nearly twelve times before I eventually got the hang of it. Obviously, stealth isn't my thing.\n\nFor all the click-and-drag of some of the missions, there were quite a few I really did like. Some of the battles were really cool, and the Midnight Ride mission was pretty fun, actually! There's quite a few where you have to put your thinking cap on, but it's pretty worth it if you just think it through. Otherwise, throwing your weight around seems to work just great.\n\n3. Side Missions\n\nBEST. THING. EVER. This game stole another piece of my heart just for these awesome things. Helping Homesteaders, sending out convoys, naval battles, minigames galore, and collectibles? Yessss. I actually got bizarrely addicted to the convoy system to the point I probably spent the better part of an hour just being the best business person I could be. Cue Connor getting eye strain from staring at the accounting book for so long.\n\nThe collectibles were stupidly addicting to follow up on. Captain Kidd's in particular was great, if mostly for the trinkets that were crazy hard to get. I'm still yet to get all the feathers, but I'm set on it still!\n\nAnd hellooooo naval battles! Nearly everyone I know who has played this game thrived on this part. I think the only disappointment I had was that there weren't more of them. The system was easy to use, but that didn't mean the missions weren't challenging. I got desynched quite a few times, even if the system was second nature to me by then. It wasn't too annoying though, since it made me just want to try harder to win the next time.\n\n4. Controls\n\nThe controls were pretty simple! I never had a problem with them (unlike AC2 where I mixed controls up frequently). Probably the best thing is that the controls aren't prompted on screen by symbols anymore. Not so much of the 'PRESS KEY SHAPED LIKE A HEAD. NO, THE OTHER ONE, STUPIDO. GOOD. NOW PRESS THE HAND ONE. NO THE HAND HOLDING THE THINGY. NO THE OOOOTHER ONE.' Catch my drift? Now it's just 'Press E. Good. Goooood.'\n\nThat being said, like all PC games of this nature, button mashing was like a cheat code thing. Any combo of left click + space + shift + E key worked. I rarely got killed unless I got mobbed by guards, so that's a thing. But hey, nothing I can complain too loudly about.\n\nThe freerunning was also excellent in this game. Running through the Frontier and the Homestead in particular was ridiculous fun. I also like the added physics of Connor being a bit larger and more cumbersome than Altair and Ezio, and so having to hoist himself up to get anywhere. Nice touch, yep.\n\nThe only thing I had trouble with was the QTE system. That is, the hunting button-slamming controls. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, and you can get mauled pretty easily if they fail on you.\n\n5. Plot\n\nI've heard a lot of complaints about this part, and to some degree, I can't totally dispute it. The plot did seem pretty dry and repetitive at times, if only for the whole *SPOILERS* Kill the Templar, Getting a Stern Talking-To From a Dying Man, Feel Kinda Bad spiel. Like you get you're supposed to be on the fence, but there is a point where you're just like OKAY CONNOR, GET A WIN, BOY, GET A WIN. You get the general idea that his life sucks and his choices aren't always stellar.\n\nFollowing the American Revolution was pretty interesting, even if it did seem like they just sort of squeeze you into the corner like an old mop. Oh, cool, you just saw the Declaration of Independence get signed? Radical, now get outta here. That's sort of the gist with that.\n\nSo yeah, it was kind of a saltine cracker at times, but it moves quick, which is nice.\n\nAs for Desmond's plot, well, most people know how that one went. Feels bad, man.\n\nTL;DR: Seriously, give this game a chance. If you're pretty meathead melee-junkie, it might not be too fun. It does make you think, both in a philosophical way and in a logical way. It's fun, it's challenging at times, and the side missions are great. Go for it.\n\nADDED STUFF: -It's a little disappointing that Ubisoft didn't follow up much on Connor after this. I get the *SPOILERS, AGAIN* life-threatening injury thing, but at least in novel format or something, it would have been nice. There's very little to be seen about him afterward, and so far everything's been pretty doom and gloom. Pretty disappointing.\n\n-This game deals with ye olde racism, and it definitely wants you to be uncomfortable. "But why would you put that in a gaaaaame?" you hear a distant voice whine. "Well," you can say all knowingly, "That happened back then. A lot. Like all the time." And then punch the closest portrait of Washington in the face. Do it.","December 1, 2014","true","77.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uux/recommended/208480/","uux","UltimateXero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uux/","142 products in account","This is the first of a new type of Assassin's Creed game and it has lot of promise and stumbling points much like the very first AC game had. Freerunning has been simplified and combat has been expanded as well as the mission variety. You don't have to play many of the naval missions at all but I found them fun and an added bonus to a game already jam packed with content. The story and characters are satisfactory and Connor isn't a suave cool dude like Ezio but his backstory justifies a more solemn and serious assassin. Overall I don't think this game is better or worse than the Ezio trilogy, I just think it's a very different experience. I do have to say there are a few bugs you'll probably come across that may annoy you but ultimately shouldn't wreck your experience.\n\nThe multiplayer is ok based on the two games I had the patience to try. It's not dead, but the new wolfpack co-op mode I was really excited about did seem to be dead. The gameplay is very much like the previous games' multiplayer oddly enough.\n\nAnd now the part I really loved about AC3: the tyranny of king washington dlc. If you get the base game, you need to get the season pass and experience this ridiculous journey. It takes the familiar feel of assassin's creed and throws it out to make a completely different-feeling action-based game. And the story ain't bad either. The worst part about this dlc is that there's a bug with the first chapter that could totally prevent you from completing it and force you to restart. I advise you to research and avoid this bug if you want to play the dlc.\n\n","February 8","true","65.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a fricking Homestead, you are building your small communitiy and it is very satisfieng to see it grow and progress.\n\nBut like every game this also has some negatives\n-The Stockpile, Crafting and Trading Menus are the worst i navigated through in the last years, and the need of these is pretty much nonexistent, you dont need the money it drops off which is kinda sad, I wish the Menu would be alot better to control and it would have a real impact on the game with missions and notority effects or in general that it changes something in the game.\n-Alot of running from A to B and then over D to C and back to A again. 20 hours or so of my playtime was me riding, running, climbing through the land just to come to the mission starts just to be send 2 miles in the other direction again.\n-The ending was the most dissapointing I ever played till now, it is just so unsatisfying, it just ends, you yourslef as the player aint even given the "press X to kill" for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lee, which would've made the game at least a bit better. but yeah the ending is crap.\n\nAnd thats pretty much all, buy it, play it, enjoy it for it is a good game.","June 19, 2015","true","56.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Freerunning has been simplified and combat has been expanded as well as the mission variety. You don't have to play many of the naval missions at all but I found them fun and an added bonus to a game already jam packed with content. The story and characters are satisfactory and Connor isn't a suave cool dude like Ezio but his backstory justifies a more solemn and serious assassin. Overall I don't think this game is better or worse than the Ezio trilogy, I just think it's a very different experience. I do have to say there are a few bugs you'll probably come across that may annoy you but ultimately shouldn't wreck your experience.\n\nThe multiplayer is ok based on the two games I had the patience to try. It's not dead, but the new wolfpack co-op mode I was really excited about did seem to be dead. The gameplay is very much like the previous games' multiplayer oddly enough.\n\nAnd now the part I really loved about AC3: the tyranny of king washington dlc. If you get the base game, you need to get the season pass and experience this ridiculous journey. It takes the familiar feel of assassin's creed and throws it out to make a completely different-feeling action-based game. And the story ain't bad either. The worst part about this dlc is that there's a bug with the first chapter that could totally prevent you from completing it and force you to restart. I advise you to research and avoid this bug if you want to play the dlc.\n\n","February 8","true","65.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Game has so much things to do like hunting, sailing, running, climbing and all that type of things.. Ubisoft have improved Assassin's Creed so much in third part that you don't have only 1 map to discover all of the feathers, and treasure chests, because in AC3 you have different kind of locations: New York, Boston, Homestead and Frontier.\nMany Assassin's Creed fan criticized that Ubisoft changed Ezio to Connor but I think it's a great thing if u want some change to AC-series and not that old repeating same city with a guy who's story is more well-known than your own pockets...\n\nIn AC3 you play as 3 different characters: Desmond Miles who is a 21st-century Assassin, working to uncover the secrets of a mysterious Precursor Vault that purportedly will protect the Earth from an upcoming solar flare on December 21, 2012. To uncover the secrets, Desmond uses the Animus to live out memories of two of his ancestors which the player controls during these sequences, both set at the time of the American Revolutionary War. The first, briefly played at the start of the game, is Haytham Kenway, a British Templar that seeks the location of the Vault. The second, and the primary character for the game, is Ratonhnhaké:ton, the result of a brief liaison between Kenway and a Native American woman. Ratonhnhaké:ton takes on the name Connor to blend in better with colonial society. When playing as Connor, the player has access to a huge wilderness known as the Frontier, the cities of Boston and New York. Portions of the Eastern Seaboard and Caribbean Sea can be explored via the flagship of the Assassin's navy, the Aquila, captained by Connor Kenway himself, with Robert Faulkner his first-mate advising and teaching him in the ways of the sea.\n\nBut no more of that... In my opinion Assassin's Creed 3 is the best in the whole AC-Series and even Black Flag won't be able to beat this game... And it's good thing in Assassin's Creed 3 that you won't have to play other AC's because this has different character and you won't be missing anything if u start your Assassinating from this game!\nSo what are you waiting for?!?!??! Go to Steam store, Search for Assassin's Creed 3, open it, click add to cart, Buy it and enjoy the assassinating, exploring and By far the most awesome story! :)","July 10, 2014","true","48.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With that being said their is alot that is painstakingly awful or rather irking. If you liked Prince Persia this is your game. Its like a way improved version. Both in story telling, and the ability to control your character is better.\n\nThe bad Assassinate and strike attacks are the same button. At time you will have trouble because the auto feature for assassinate can't distinguish at between regular and assassin attacks.  (This all could have been avoided by using and r trigger for stealth kills.) Or rather use a diferent button for each seperate action.\n\nThe other thing that should be painstakingly obvious is that the game limits and confines you. You don't get to free roam.\nYou go to far you die, you do an assassination and it goes wrong you die. Well they don't call it dying in the game its restarting memory. Not only is this tideous and makes nerve reckly diffecult on your nerves as you have to restart alot, its time consuming, and takes you out of the immersion of the game while eerily being hand held at the same time.\nThe most annoying is sometimes a wall will be by a bush and it will auto cover when you're trying to stealth kill, or visa versa.\n\nDesmond huh such a generic character. If you're going to have us crashing at least make Desmond show suffering so it actually feels like it affects his memory. I didn't like the fact that I just couldn't play with the main character Conner.  Perhaps its to introduce his background. But we are already in a background to background story here. I wanted to learn way more about the main protoganist. His father could have been a seperate dlc. This could have given Conner the better story arc that I feel sort of lacking.  I still recommend this game, because what game is perfect. Let's just hope Unity and Rogue (hopefully comes to pc) have fixed these bugs and implement a beter stealth/ combat system.","September 18, 2014","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/208480/","Sweatbandz","A_Sweatband","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/","254 products in account","Assassin's Creed III is a game of many flaws, but at the same time, it isn't a bad game in itself.\n\nThe plot is about a man known as Ratonhnhaké:ton, a native American, who is on a great important mission in which he searches for a man known as "Charles Lee" to protect his people and take revenge following the burning of his village. However, before this, you play as Haytham Kenway, who goes through a somewhat long and controlled tutorial. Fortunately though, these memories introduce nearly all of the major gameplay mechanics, and feature some of the best developed characters in the game. Other major plot elements include Desmond making a massive choice that he doesn't get to make, involving some end of the world situation, and him building his relationship with his angry father. Some characters, especially the leading Templars in the Animus sections are quite well developed, and all the cast are very well voice acted, with some brilliantly written dialogue, especially between Haytham and Connor in the scenes that they share. However, sometimes the plot sometimes feels wafer thin, most characters are very well developed, with exception to some of the historical figures, such as George Washington, and sometimes Connor's naivety can become annoying, especially to those with proper hindsight to what becomes of his people, and the templars (again, Haytham) come across as more likable, which doesn't help. Despite this, the game tells its story well across the gameplay time, even if it does seem to develop very slowly.\n\nGraphically, the game is extremely appealing, with high detail models and cloth physics, with large expansive environments and areas. However, certain areas in the game will sutter all over the place regardless of settings and setup due to classic Ubisoft PC porting. Although it doesn't make the game unplayable, it is extremely noticeable in some areas within the game.\n\nThe audio is well designed. As mentioned above, the voice acting is solid all-round, and the OST is well done for the game as well. The music changes based on where you are, how many enemies are nearby, or how many are in open combat, and whether you are fighting or running from them. The OST is brilliantly done, and these little features help build on the gameplay and atmosphere.\n\nHowever, the parkour within the cities is a letdown, compared to both its predecessors due to less to climb on and fewer landmarks compared to its predecessors. Because of this, the flow is different, and this doesn't work well in this game because outside of the frontier tree jumping, you feel awfully grounded compared to earlier and later assassins. Naval combat is this games big addition, and this is the great contribution of AC3. The naval combat plays well, and was ripe for expansion, which thankfully, Ubisoft did in some of the later games. Outside of assassining (it’s not a word yet); you can build on Davenport Homestead and make loads of money. However, this is pointless as money is practically worthless, due to a lack of things to spend it on.\n\nOverall, this is a weaker game in the series. That isn't to say that it is a bad game though. There is a lot of crap on Steam, and this is not one of those crap games. The length is good and the game plays well, and in many departments, the game still excels far above the average.","April 8, 2015","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I normally love games with plenty of side-missions, but not this style, for some reason, so I did not 100% complete the game. However, completing side-missions along the way of completing the main story made for an excellent adventure and had me feeling very good about myself by the end of it.\n\nThe gameplay, at some points, is frustrating. I still haven't played an Assassin's Creed game where this isn't the case. In all games that I've played from this series, every failure feels like the game's fault rather than the player's, as opposed to how it feels when you miss a jump in a well-constructed platforming game.\n\nThe combat here is pretty nice: improved over Assassin's Creed 2 and its sequels, but improved more in the games coming after this one.\n\nAs I said, this game really made me happy that I'd beaten it when I reached the end, whereas the others before this one had me feeling more like I'd completed a chore, even while watching the nice ending cutscenes. I did grow attached to some of the characters, and so I felt invested in the story enough to still care, come the end of the game.\n\nI'm still unfinished with Black Flag, and I haven't played others after that, as of writing this, but 3 was definitely my favorite of the series, so far.","March 10","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I paid a little extra for the “deluxe” edition, which means it comes with all the DLCs, kind of like a Game of the Year edition.  Unfortunately, Uplay has a weird way of activating the deluxe edition. I downloaded the game through Steam, and upon launching, Uplay asks for the game key. Not a problem, since Steam has a little window telling you the serial numbers. But once I entered the key and the game actually launched, I had to type in the additional keys that unlock the game’s DLCs one by one. I couldn’t copy and paste, I actually had to write down the 3 serial numbers and type them in manually. There were a few hick-ups (server errors), but it went through eventually.\n\nStory with mild spoilers:\nIf you’ve played the previous Assassin’s Creed games, you’ll know that most of the game is taking place inside a computer simulation, while in the “real world” the protagonist Desmond Miles is one of the last descendants of the Assassin brotherhood. Desmond is using a machine called the Animus to relive the genetic memories of his ancestors. In the real world, in the not too distant future, there is some sort of world ending natural disaster about the happen. Thousands of years ago an alien race predicted the disaster and set plans in motion to stop it (all the plans failed). Desmond and his companions are trying to gather the alien relics/technology to stop the apocalypse. To do this, Desmond is reliving his ancestor’s memories to find where the items were hidden throughout history. Inside the Animus, the game’s memories begin around 1750 in England and quickly move to the New World where you live the life of Haytham Kenway. Kenway eventually has a son with a Native American woman and 20 years later you take over playing as Connor, carrying on the Assassin legacy of fighting Templars.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, AC3 is almost identical to the previous games. It’s a third person game similar to the Batman Arkham series and you spend a lot of time free running and climbing buildings. Combat seems to have been simplified this time around, and you really only use a few buttons: Attack, Counter, Break Defense, and Special Attack (gun). Since the game takes place around the American Revolution, guns play a bigger role than in previous Assassin’s Creed games, but you still use your melee weapons 90% of the time. Ammunition is limited and reloading takes a long time. Like the previous games, you’ll spend most of your time outside of story missions The Assassin’s Creed games are open world with tons of side missions and collectibles. The most useful side quests are synchronizing viewpoints (climbing tall buildings to reveal large map sections) and unlocking fast travel points (exploring underground tunnels to create map waypoints). The underground sections are pretty boring, but the fast travel unlocks are time savers later on.\n\nYou can gain money in the Animus by completing quests and opening treasure boxes throughout the game world. The treasure boxes are usually locked, leading to a VERY annoying mini game where you need to pick the lock. The lock picking was clearly designed for console controls, not the PC, so it can be frustratingly difficult to accomplish (you use the mouse and need perfect vertical/horizontal control or you start all over). Fortunately, like most of the side stuff, the treasure chests are optional. This is because you really don’t have that many things to spend your money on. You can buy new weapons (not much improvement over your default gear), treasure maps (so you can find more money - that you don’t need), and ship upgrades (this is actually useful). The other collectibles in the game don’t really do anything except increase your “synchronization” which is just your game completion percentage. You don’t “level up” in the game so there’s no gameplay benefit to increasing your synchronization. I’ve heard that the only thing you get from higher synch is unlocking outfits for you to wear.\n\nI mentioned the ship upgrades earlier, and the naval missions are actually a highlight of the game. At various points in the game, you captain a warship named the Aquila, and sail around blasting British ships. It’s a lot of fun, which is probably why the next game in the series - Assassin’s Creed Black Flag is based around pirate gameplay. The ship upgrades that you can buy are all extremely expensive, but can give you a tremendous edge in battle (improved armor and weapons). I ended up spending pretty much all my money on ship upgrades.\n\nPros:\n+Long game where you can spend all day exploring pre-industrial American and hunting various animals. The hunting is fun for a little while, but is kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things.\n+Engaging story, both in the real world, and in the Animus. The main reason I wanted to get this game was to see how things work out for Desmond in the real world.\n+There’s a lot of variety to be found in the game. A lot of missions are stealth based while there are also times where you just need to slaughter everyone. The navy missions are a great diversion.\n\nCons:\n-Additional layer of DRM: Uplay. It’s not as bad as some people make it out to be, but it can still be annoying, adding an extra 10-15 minutes to installation procedures and you need to open Uplay after launching the game through Steam (every single time). I’ll admit I was worried when I heard that the game was badly designed for AMD processors/Graphics cards, but I didn’t notice any problems. The game ran smoothly. Both my CPU and GPU are AMD (cheap ones).\n-Side missions/collectibles are basically useless, as outlined above. If the game had Steam achievements, I probably would have spent a lot more time chasing side quests, but as it is, there’s really no reason for me to grind for collectibles or money. The whole “crafting” system for the game was pointless since I didn’t need the money.\n- There are some really annoying parts to the game, (such as the final chase sequence) but if you don’t care about synchronization, you could blow right through the game. Most of the quests have optional requirements (such as “don’t be detected”). It really is as hard as you want it to be. One thing that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off was the 20 minute unskippable end credits of the game. If you just force the game to close, you’ll miss the final cutscene (and next couple missions), and you can’t alt+tab out of the game to let it run in the background (it just pauses).\n\nThe gameplay DLCs for the game are the Benedict Arnold missions, and Tyranny of King Washington (TOKW). The Benedict Arnold missions were pretty short, probably less than an hour, but the Tyranny of King Washington is quite long, possibly 5-6 hours.  TOKW seems to take place in an alternate universe, and include some “magic powers” that make the game a lot easier.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend Assassin’s Creed 3 to anyone who has played the previous games and enjoyed them. A couple of people warned me that AC3 is the weakest in the series, but I can’t say I liked/disliked it any more than the previous ones. If you’re a game trader, you can get the deluxe edition for about 4 TF2 keys ($10) when Steam has it on sale.\n","November 20, 2014","true","52.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not that great either. There are more than a few issues with this one. Bugs and glitches abound, the A.I. can be idiotic at times, and the controls are far less as convenient as they were with the Ezio trilogy or the first Assassins Creed. Lastly, the frequent little hiccups this game caused on my machine during gameplay were troublesome. Every few minutes the game would get choppy and only pausing it and letting the choppiness pass fixed it. Each of these instances occurred at the same time as UPlay.exe using up more memory on my PC. UPlay is horrible anyway, but I felt like giving this game a fair try. It wasn't worth it in the end, mostly thanks to UPlay itself ruining my experience.\n\nThe other main issue I had with this game is that the main character you play as is a thoroughly unlikeable fellow. (I didn't like him anyway.) He'd range from unemotional zombie to raging assclown to most (if not all) of his allies in the storyline. He was definitely not as interesting as Ezio, Altair, or even Aveline (Liberation wasn't that great either, truth be told). Connor Kenway (or Rato:whatever:nobodycares) was a horrible character and to be subjected to his comically overplayed seriousness for more than a couple of hours was pretty painful.\n\nBuy this if you cannot live without all the AC games. Skip it if you're not that hardcore a fan of the series or if you dislike UPlay.\n\nOh, and I haven't done the multiplayer yet, but I suspect it's just like it was in Brotherhood and Revelations. UPlay kinda forgot (twice) that I owned all the multiplayer DLC related things and I had to go through Ubisoft support to get things restored. Meh.

I mean, there's a lot of stuff to do. A LOT.\n\nOkay, so the story wasn't the high point; Connor is an angsty teenager who's one a revenge quest for the death of his mother and the burning of his village. While his goals are similar to that of the Sons of Liberty, that is, when he meets them, he's careless and anxious. I praise Ubisoft for getting the character of an overly anxious youth correct, but his weakness is where his mind is fogged and forgets about what he should be concentrating on, being an Assassin.\n\nAC III is short on espionage and heavy on combat. (oh wow, an AC game short on espionage and heavy on combat, go figure) But the combat is amazing and actually improves from the previous installments once you get used to the controls.\n\nYou get to meet a lot of historical figures, and while I enjoyed their presence, they clutter the game and it seems like the writers tried to juggle around the historical figures without making any of them close acquaintances, aside from the fictional Achilles Davenport. I would have liked to see more of the Culper Spy ring, as they would have been a huge bonuse in terms of espionage, but Ubisoft looked the other way with their revenge mission.\n\nThe graphics are great. I feel like I shouldn't have to mention that. This is Ubisoft after-all. And they didn't lie when they said the frontier was huge. I mean, it's huge, bigger than Rome. And then you also get Boston and New York City. I'm glad they added the two cities as runnig around the frontier got old rather quickly. It's just too big with too little content, as in story. There are citizen missions and hunting and frontiersman. Okay, there's actually a lot to do in the frontier, it's just a real pain getting around.\n\nDid I mention all the content in the game? Building the homestead, recruiting assassins, saving citizens, naval missions, collecting trinkets, collecting feathers, finding treasures, capturing forts held by the templars/British, frontiersman missions, hunting missions, Boston brawlers, getting convoys, getting the almanac pages. There's a lot of content, including the DLC, which I found fantastic. (Mainly The Tyranny of Washington, and the Benedict Arnold DLC)\n\nWell, while the story wasn't the high point, the setting, the side missions, the naval missions and a bunch of other stuff really made up for it.\n\n9.0/10","May 21, 2014","true","75.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the next month, I enjoyed this game wholeheartedly, and eventually the DLC.\n\nMusic: This soundtrack's orchestral pieces match PERFECTLY with the timeline in Ubisoft's mindset. Puts one in the mood for the Colonial Ages.\n\nGraphics/Presentation: For 2012, this still holds up to these days and shows only slight aging. The open world is lustrious and blooming with nature, and the shaders don't feel aged. Presentation wise, they captured the Colonial Ages and the American Revolution with perfection in style. Voices are made to sound mostly English, with some American. The Mohawk Valley tribe vocals are done well, minus a few times.\n\nCharacters: I will mainly talk about Connor here. Connor "Ratonhnhaké:ton" Kenway is nowhere near the indepthness of Ezio's story, but interesting none the less. We get to see Connor's life unfold as he grows, from watching his village burn to that of Washington's forces, to meeting him in person and not expecting forgiveness himself, and even up to meeting his own father, Haytham Kenway, the son of Edward from Black Flag. He meets Achillies, and is trained by him in the ways of an Assassin. Achillies at one point met with Adewale, Edward's former quartermaster and at that point an Assassin. So, he trained Ratonhnhaké:ton in these ways, eventually ending his training abruptly in death. We watch as we have to bury Ratonhnhaké:ton's former mentor in grief and stormy weather. This game shows us Connor's personality. How he helped Washington even after the burning of his village, forgiving him because he didn't know better. How he never left Achillies' home to be trained, even after being rudely blocked out by him. He was determined in his life.\n\nStory: It was alright. Not good by any means, but wasn't ♥♥♥♥. At least it had a story.\n\nRating: 9/10 A Near Perfect Game (Story Kills That One Point)\n\n"I realize now that it will take time, that the road ahead is long and shrouded in darkness.

Let me start with the positives: the graphics have been greatly improved, the sounds are good as always, the combat and freerun are way better than before, also this game introduces the naval combat in the franchise. However there are couple of things why this game falls short: graphical glitches, sometimes the audio is out of sync (especially in the DLC), sometimes the combat's counter signs don't trigger or the camera angle glitches out a bit, too few naval missions and finally the biggest issue: poor performance on PC due to poor optimization. The plot is starting out great, but soon gets boring and the main character, Ratonhnhaké:ton or Connor, is not likeable at all (at least I didn't like him) so you don't feel attached. Anyway I'd say that if there's a deep discount on the title, I'd only recommend it to hardcore AC fans.\nAs for the DLC: I also have all of them and I can safely say they don't worth it. Why?

You can easily see the gap from ACR to AC3, and if you are the type of person who either never played one, or only played AC2 like so many others, you will be blown away. While this game lacks a suitable 'tutorial' to get into many of it's core features (crafting especially), this game's combat and free-running systems are better than ever, including predator-like 'rope darts' that allow you to hang victims from trees, dual pistols which can later be upgraded, the extremely weakly done 'dual wielding' that nobody cares about... seriously? why go into all the effort marketing Connor as a 'dual wielding specialist' when all he does is use his hidden blade as an offhand knife? Aside from this, the combat system is more refined and the free running more fluid. Free running now permits access to trees and you can now look round corners, the basic things you take for granted. Any veteran AC player will be amazed.\n\nNext, is the story. Now really the only thing anyone cares about is the modern day parts which I have to say is brilliant and better than the others combined. There are a good few moments where you embark on missions to various locations as desmond with his hood up and hidden blade prepped may I say. I'm not going to say more than that.\nThe Revolutionary side of things, not so good. I did my research on this, and I agree. The best part of the game within the animus takes place up until sequence 3 where you play as the father of the main character, Haytham. It's not because Haytham is British that is good, and thus not 'american gung-ho', it's because he is a far more likeable character than Connor, the main character is.\nConnor is, without a doubt, the worst assassin ever. His personality is like a machine, and his choices are not the best ever. The fact he is a native american makes him unrelateble in every aspect and he just feels... boring. Words cannot describe this, If you played the game you would understand just how drained of life the main character is, and this can impact gameplay A LOT. In fact, half this game I was thinking 'i'd rather be a templar right now'.\n\nNaval battles. There is a reason why they made AC4 based off this, undoubtedly the best part of this game is the naval battles. they are so good, they beat any modern ship combat game. I spent a good few weeks looking for potential challengers. I played the Battlestations games, the Pirates of the Caribean MMO and various other pirate MMOs. No competion, not even close. Once again, words cannot describe... the legendary awesomeness of this feature of the game.\n\nFinally we have the multiplayer. Most of you will not end up spending much, if any time on this, but this is where I spend all my time on this game. This game's multiplayer and the previous AC multiplayers before it have been utterly amazing. Tough to get into, frustrating for the dull-minded average cod player. This game requires patience and extreme strategic skill to win. The same player customisation is back and better, but the gameplay is also done up to match the latest AC3 system. If you are the kind of player who likes to rush around and get as many kills as possible in a very short space of time, or alternatively, if you completed an assassin's creed game without a tinge of stealth, this multiplayer is not for you. It's an aquired taste, but immensely rewarding once you are in. You will know early depending on if you are complaining about smoke bombs often or if instead, like me, you picked up the throwing knife.\n\nThis game may not capture quite the majesty of AC2, and in my heart ACR will always be my favourite, but overall I can give this game a hefty (8.9).","September 27, 2013","true","94.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

Sure, in the beginning it is quite slow, because it is the origin story of an half-Indian child who grows up to be trained as an Assassin. And we seee a bit of his childhood - but all of that is very important because what happens when he is a child, will shape things to come.\nBefore i get into some details about pros and cons, i will say the main game had no bugs, unless you count some instances in the Frontier where you are climbing rocks and it seems like the Assassin has hit a wall. But that is easily overcome by going elsewhere. It isn't game-breaking at all.\n\nCONS:\n- One big question mark: resources that are collected when you do missions (in the Frontier, for example) that unlock resources like wood, meat, other produce, metals et cetera, don't have any use other than gaining achievments in the game. Such as the achievment for sending convoys to NY or Boston(?).\n\n- certain objectives (which allow you to gain Full Syncronization) are kind of pointless in terms of the specific part of the story which you are playing through during a memory. Certain objectives, for example, like destroying a certain number of ships INSIDE the bay don't progress the story. And if you don't achieve full syncronization in that memory, you still get to see, and paricipate in, ALL of the story line in the real world when you finish each section of the story, unlike previous AC episodes where you had to have full syncronization everywhere in order to find all the symbols on buildings to unlock recordings. On the other hand you can consider this a good thing since for people who aren't good at these games, may find that having mandatory full syncronization extremely frustrating.\n\n- using rifles: since I obviously used the PC version (thank God, becuase i loath consoles) you sparingly use large fire-arms, and you may forget how to use them. By the way use 'E' to aim (at explosives or a specific enemy) and then use 'Q' to fire it. Consequently with your small fire-arm, you can just fire automatically with 'Q' as long as the enemy that you want to kill is highlighted (and press 'R' to reload any fire-arm) Similarly, you can fire your arrows in the same manner (no reload needed, obviously).\n\n- not so much a consequence if you've upgraded your ship: turning toward an enemy ship without a rudder upgrade will require quick thinking and good steering.\n\nPROS:\n\n- The Story is very enjoyable. From the beginning you start off slowly and it builds and builds until you reach a bitter-sweet climax (I have similar feelings for the DLC)\n\n- Without collecting resources and sending convoys to other cities, you are able to collect enough Pounds to fully upgrade your ship, and still have several thousand Pounds left over for bribes for example.\n\n- There are enough chests around after you finish the Epilogue missions for more ammunition, and a bit of cash if you feel like just going around and killing Regulars.\n\n- I found out that the people who complained about AC3, saying that AC4 is better for having ship missions, were lying through their teeth. The ship missions are very enjoyable, especially when you use different types of ammunition with the cannons.\n\nAnd the biggest positive aspect of the game: the real world missions. Ever since I played the previous games in the series i was hoping to God that they would give us missions with Desmond Miles. And by God they delivered!! The real world missions aren't overly complicated for non-gamers, but still fun. Let's hope in future games they give us an assassin story that is set in a modern city...\n\nAll in all, the positive things of the game out-weigh the small negative things.\nNow i'm off to hunt for the special edition with flags and other goodies!","October 7, 2014","true","72.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While doing so, Ubisoft brings the Assassins to the colonial times of the 18th century and begins an enticing tale of the North American settlement. Following the game's predecessors, AC3 still features parkour-style movement and intense melee combat, but it also includes naval warfare to shake things up. The game's naval battles are a fantastic addition that will leave you smelling the salt of the sea and have you jumping when unleashing your ship's cannons. However, AC3 has some rather convoluted features such as hunting and arranging convoys. It is between these parts of the game that the menus become tedious and drag the main story along. Still, AC3 should not be passed up. If you're a fan then you must play AC3 to continue the story of the Assassins.","March 30, 2013","true","34.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Many of the early parts feel very constrained for an open world game. Many of the other elements feel pretty tired if you've already played many of the older titles. Despite this is does have a few new things to offer. One of this things is the revised combat system, which while still very similar to previous games it is a teeny bit more skill based with the removal of a block button and some other small changes. Graphics are also very good for a console port from the PS3 and 360 from 2012.\n\n6/10","April 14, 2015","true","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game has a story that I liked and hated at the same time, but I would suggest it to everyone :) I enjoy the combat thought it can get repetitive very quickly, though it's fun to jump around on buildings using a bow to stealthily take out enemies. I may only have 35+ hours on PC but I played a ton on the PS3 and I'm guessing 150+ hours of just playing around looking for chests\n\nPros: A diverse amount of weapons to use on enemies\nHunting\nLarge amount of land to explore (3 different sections of land, Boston, New York, and the Frontier with winter/summer visuals)\nSmall amount of ship missions (destroying ships)\nLarge amount of side missions\nA HUGE amount of "homestead" missions\nFellow assassins that can be called upon or sent away to different states to do tasks which provide money, selling materials, etc\nCrafting is possible with things such as larger quivers, etc\nCons: Repetitive very quickly\nDifferent appearances? Nope, just recolors\nHunting can get boring quickly though is a great source of income\nExperiences with the ship are limited\n\nAll in all, Assassin's Creed 3 is a great game that I would suggest when it's on sale, and though I haven't tried any games further up the series, I'd try those first.","January 3","true","38.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There could be so many good story arcs in Connor knowing only a native lifestyle and transitioning into a colonial life and being recruited by an Assassin.  Instead there wasn't even a transition, he just instantly fit in with the colonists like he lived with them since birth, and in 6 months he was an assassin, believing everything they believed, and hunting templars.  There was a bit of a revege story, but the way it was portrayed made connor look more petty than anything, and that was reinforced by constant childish outbursts.  By comparison, Ezio's revenge story drove his initial actions, but he developed from that, and realized there were bigger, more important things.  That doesn't happen with Connor.  Finally, the facial profile Ubisoft used made Connor look like he aged 40 years between 1769, and 1773, then toward 1780 he looked younger again which was distracting.  In short Connor was a terrible protagonist with little redeemable character development.\n\nThe main story missions are standard Assassin's Creed with more open combat, and less assassination compared to AC 2, and Brotherhood.  Sort of makes sense considering it's a war, but I think the best part of the AC2 series of games was that you actually used your Assassin's blades.  The first 5 sequences (at least) seem like an extended training sequence to me, so that's at least 5 hours learning to play the game.  The reason I think this game is so disliked is because you don't care what happens next for the first 6 sequences, it's only in the last half of the game that the story becomes intriguing.\n\nThe Side missions are the most redeeming part of this game.  The Naval battles were heralded, and likely gave rise to AC4 (Probably as good as AC2 in terms of story, play it).  Definitely play through all of those missions, they're a blast.  Secondly, the Homestead missions in this game are the best of any of the series.  You get to the point to which you care what happens to those settlers.  At the end of the game, I would have much rather had a synopsis of what happened to those settlers than what happened to Connor.  The Captain Kidd missions also were fun to play.  The rest to me didn't really seem worth the effort.  Most of them don't even have dialogue, you walk up to them, and they say "Thank You", and that's it apparently.\n\nSo long as you are getting this game during an Ubisoft sale, which happens every 6 months or less, pick it up.  It's not a bad play once you get through the first half of the game.  Other than that, there are better AC games out there, so play those over again first.","November 13, 2015","true","36.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Now, don't get me wrong, there are several flaws, but they are easily outnumbered by the positives.\n\nEarly on, you play as Haytham, the master of the templars, and also Connor's father. This is an ingenius way to become familiar with the games' controls and mechanics as well as being comfortably settled in with the plot. You can't help but get attached to Haytham and the Templar Order at first, but then you are transferred to the control of Conner as a young child, and to keep away from spoilers, the change is masterfully emotional, and perfectly executed. You immediately gain an emotional bond with Connor - and it continues as you control him as he grows into a man. The game leads you to find (and kill) the men responsible for the act, and every single assassination brings the plot in an interesting and thought provoking direction. Excellent Revolutionary Boston storytelling.\n\nNow, if the game were to take place only in the past, the game would be an easy 10/10. But the modern time excerpts are just aweful.\n\nWork in Progress.","December 10, 2015","true","33.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

But it just did not feel as epic as the previous games (im looking at you II and Brotherhood) pretty much up until it's ending.\n\nThe side missions are more repetitive than ever, combined with the amount of bugs and glitches I experienced, it effectively turns this into Assassins Frustration 3. This game feels much bigger than it actually is.\n\nStory-wise, I didn't feel so captivated by it during the first hour or two, only then it started to make more sense to me, I did enjoy playing a little more as Desmond in the present but ultimately I guess I prefer the previous settings to this one (Colonial East Coast). But once the story unravles a little more, as a fan of the series, you're pretty much stuck playing it. Im about 90% done story-wise and I plan to revisit all of the previous games again before moving onto 4, except this one, i will skip this one. (edit: maybe not)\n\nEdit: I finished the story 100%. Now that I look back, I kinda miss playing this game already.\n\n\nThe one thing I enjoyed the most was Naval battles.

In AC3 you play as Connor, when in the simulation, and Desmond when out of it, as well as playing as Haytham in a lengthy prologue. Each character plays exactly the same and there is no differences other than looks. AC3 takes place during the American Revolution and throughout the game you'll meet some historical figures such as George Washington or Samuel Adams. As the game begins you are forced to play as a man named Haytham, Connors father, in what is essentially a 3 hour long tutorial which almost turned me off from playing the game altogether. After that Connor is born and you begin your journey in a small indian village with multiple timeskips as Connor ages. Eventually you end up having a vision about the sigil of the Assassins and this leads you to a man named Achilles who trains you to take up the mantle of Assassin. The game features lots of side options and collectibles but most of them feel pointless and forced so you have little incentive to get them. AC3 also features a weak attempt at a multiplayer component that I really cannot give much comment on seeing as it's dead. The game's story mode works in longer sections called sequences and each of these has multiple missions inside of it. Each mission probably lasts 10-30 minutes and there are maybe 4-5 in a sequence which brings the total game time for story alone to about 12-13 hours. However, I did lots of the side missions and a good amount of collectibles and my playtime came out to be about 30 hours so it depends on how much content you want to play through.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=635246704\nThe Assassins Creed series has a very basic but satisfying combat system, similar to the Batman: Arkham series, which consists of just countering your enemies then executing them over and over again. There are multiple supplementary weapons such as a flintlock pistol, rope and poison darts, and even trip mines that you can use to enhance the combat experience. You can also stealth your way through AC3 even though, for a game about assassins, the stealth here is absolutely abysmal and lacks basic features like being able to crouch. The fact that there are mandatory stealth missions in this game really brings out the terrible stealth system and semi-stealth eavesdropping segments are just as bad if not worse in some places. However what can help the stealth segments significantly is the AC parkour system that has been a staple of the series for as long as it's been here. In the AC games you can climb virtually anything and you can run from building to building to get where you need to be. In AC3 the world feels like it was meant to be built for you to be able to flow across the buildings but instead feels very choppy. After you counter an enemy you have three options: execute, throw, or disarm them and on some enemies you cant execute or throw them since they will end up countering you instead. Honestly the combat is pretty satisfying with the executions to make things interesting but overall even those get stale after having to do the same things over and over again. Most of the enemies in AC3 are just generic soldiers but some are actually unique and can prove to be a challenge to even the most experienced assassins. Soldiers like the Jaeger, who cannot be executed or disarmed, can prove a challenge when they are mixed in with hordes of other basic troopers. The combat here is incredibly satisfying yet repetitive and can make you either take up your blade in an adrenaline rush or turn around and run away from its repetitive nature.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=635246750\nThe story of AC3 does a very poor job of both drawing you in and keeping you interested as its pretty boring with no real twists and a very dissatisfying ending. The world AC3 tries to build looks amazing on the surface but once you get into it you realize that it's just the same as every other world that they've made except for the new coat of paint hastily thrown onto it. The side missions in the world of AC3 make you do things like climb across rooftops chasing pages for a book or grab feathers from a birds nest in the woods and these are so boring that they chase you away from the good side missions. Some of the better side missions are based on the Liberation system which allows you to liberate parts of each city and get a follower who can help you out in return. Both of the cities, Boston and New York, are divided into 3 areas and you have to do side missions to free the populace from British control and then finish the area off with a liberation mission. The liberation missions are typically very basic assassination missions with Connor recruiting the follower into the assassins. You can also send your recruits out on time-based missions in one of the colonies which can give you things like gold and pelts to level up your followers and make them more effective. However the problem with these missions is, as I said, they're time based. This means you have to choose which followers to send on a missions and then wait like 10 minutes for them to complete the mission and even then they could fail and make you restart. The Liberation system is really cool and all but I don't feel like it was implemented well and instead was shoehorned into the game at the last second. However, a system I feel was probably the best part of this game is the naval missions and the quest for Captain Kidd's treasure. Once you get into the game you will restore an old ship named the Aquila and become her new captain. You have around 18 normal naval missions, which involve you blowing up some ships or defending a convoy, then you have the templar missions and the hunt for Captain Kidd's treasure. You have 2 kinds of attacks on your ship: Small swivel guns to take out smaller craft, and main cannons for taking out forts or larger ships. You can also switch out your ammo from basic cannon to things like grape shot for smaller boats or chain shot for the masts. You can upgrade your ship so that you can do things like do more damage when ramming ships or gain an extra cannon so your volleys are more powerful. The naval system is very well implemented and really makes you feel like you're a badass captain and brings a break from the repetitive combat and tiring story.\n\nTL;DRAssassins Creed III is a very mediocre entry to the series bringing very little new features with it and those it does bring feel like they were shoehorned in at the last second.\n\nIf you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming","March 2","true","30.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

On one hand you have Assassin's Creed's now already signature phenomenal world realization in every respect, which happens to sadly be offset by being in a game which simply can't get me to give a damn in the grand scheme things. This off-putting switch in question occurs after a sizable prologue section when game replaces a much more charismatic stand-in main character with a proper one who has all the likeability of a lonesome rock. And that's probably the main fault of AC3 - Connor simply cannot carry the weight to be an interesting character and, by proxy, make for an interesting game. This results in clearly emotional moments and twists falling flat on their faces because there's ZERO emotional investment going on. Your mileage will also obviously vary depending on how much you're into the time period in question, but this has always been one of the stipulations for the series.\n\nThat's not to say Connor's personality backed by bad-to-forgettable VA is the only thing at fault here, though. Replacing sprawling cities of previous games with trailblazing colonial towns and explorable frontier was honestly because it directly cuts into the effective use of series' hallmark parkouring abilities. But once again, this is seemingly balanced out with the inclusion of brand new sailing segments which manage to, for the most part, be optional and not overstay their welcome... unlike the all-present repetition seen in other activities throughout the game. Last thing that boggles the mind: why change the control scheme, but still retain the need to keep the run button pressed at all times leading to chronic case of Death Grip?","May 21, 2014","false","45.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You feel like just can't move forward in the story although you spend many hours, it's frustrating.\n-The amonut of cutscenes are too damn high. Well since the scenario isn't so interesting, cutscenes aren't either.\n-Poor stealth mechanics. I couldn't get it to work. Everytime it was waay more easier to just kill everyone in the map, which doesn't make you feel like an assassin.\n-Rooftops don't really help you hide! I'm especially offended by this.\n-Secondary goals in missions are just pointless and tiring rather than challenging.\n-The game gives wierd instructions to you sometimes. Let me write an example involving most of the bad sides.\n\nThere is mission that requires you to chase someone. The mission says exactly just "Chase him." And you're both wanted by the soldiers. On my first try, i thought i should chase and kill him, so shot him with an arrow: mission failed. On my second try, i noticed he has a "tail/dont kill" mark over him so i chased him without attacking thinking that in some point a cutscene would kick in. NO, the chase just went on and on. By the way the soldiers were just letting him pass through them but not me. At a point a row of soldiers shot me through a HOUSE(glitch). Whatever, on my third attempt, i got close to him and left clicked, Conner knocked him down and cutscene kicked in. BUT NORMALLY this left clicking would have ASSASSINATED the target!

Having had purchased the Freedom Edition together with my brother, I now even got myself a second copy of this what I think truly brilliant experience in gaming. I'm just going to outline what it is that I enjoyed so much about the fifth part of the Assassin's Creed series.\nLet's start with the story, as this is what I believe to be the one red thread throughout all the games and thus should be paid special attention to. Assassin's Creed III has a very promising story being set in the time of the American Revolution. As a great fan of history this already got me very excited for the game. My hopes weren't disappointed either. After a couple of plot twists we encounter Connor and follow him throughout his childhood until he meets his teacher and becomes an Assassin. His story is incredibly touching and thrilling, his character devekopment shows a lot of depth as we see him change throughout the story. But it's not just Connor we love about the game. The sidecharacters we meet and interact with all are created with great detail, we get to hear plenty of stories and yes, there are some extremely sad moments, too.\nBut enough with the story, let's take a look at what als Connor/Haytham/Desmond's adventures offer us. Assassin's Creed games have always been nice to look at and 3 definitely has some breathtaking graphics. The different seasons, night and day, the deep forests and dirty towns as well as characters and animals are well animated and look extremely realistc. What I especially liked here is the light and shadows, that add flavour to the already great graphics. The most beautiful part probably is when you take a black horse at night when it's snowing, ride into the woods and have it rear right in front of the full moon; it's incredible.\nLastly, let's take a look at the game-play and the controls. I've heard alot of people being unhappy about these, but as I only ever play games with my XBOX 360 controller for Windows (if possible), I was okay with it. The controls are different though, which felt a little weird from time to time, but is something you get used to easily. The introduction of a bunch of cool, new skills and weaponry also make these new controls forgiveable. Combat is fluid and well-paced. Another very interesting new addition to the game are the naval missions. "Real Fans" who have already played Black Flag are probably going to tell you how crappy these are, but you mustn't forget that III actually was released before IV. They are of course not as fantastic as they are in the latest Assassin's Creed game, but since they are not a key element and you're not playing as a pirate, they are still pretty fun and a refreshing difference. Personally I wasn't a fan of them at first, but after a while even I started to love them.\nAssassin's Creed III is a great gaming experience in so many a way. It has so much to offer and there's no way you won't enjoy it. I can only recommend it.","December 29, 2013","true","49.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It absolutely ruins the franchise in that regard. An assassin game with basically no stealth.\n\nThe gameplay is fun otherwise. Free running is alwasys good, the fighting is still super easy, but at least the kill animations make it seem more complex. I prefer the controls from the first 4 games but its not that big of a change. There is hunting and naval missions. I didn't even realize there were naval side-missions until the end of the game, I actually never did any of them, because I played this game to be an assassin, lurking in the shadows, killing only specific targets.... not blasting other ships with cannon-fire (or leading revolutionary war armies).\n\nThe story is cool-ish. I always like alternate history story concepts, but I never really felt engaged in it. I did not feel attached to the main characters at all, which was the biggest dissapointment since Ezio was the effing man! I still enjoyed Desmond and the gang. But I wasn't really a fan of where that story went either.\n\nBasically if you want to play an action game with a decent story then you can play this, you will likely enjoy it. But if you were hoping to play a stealth based game with a moving storyline like the first 4 games then you will be dissapointed as I was.\n\nI am not recommending this game even though I gave it a 7, because it is not stealth action, and I was lead to expect that from the franchise. I still gave it a 7 though, because as a standalone game, with no expectations on gameplay you will likely find it an entertaining action experience.","December 9, 2013","false","27.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You can capture Templar forts, hunt animals through the wilderness, attack roving convoys, build your own village ("Homestead"), battle the British navy in your ship, rescue citizens from firing squads and oppression, not to mention all the usual features fans of the series know too well. Tons of collectables, many Templars to assassinate, a guild of assassins to train, and a few minigames to enjoy that are spread about.\n\nIn AC3 if you can endure a very slow start, if you branch out between missions to fill up your arsenal of weapons and tools, and if you ignore the DRM (uplay) and the occasional bug... You will be rewarded with a highly entertaining game,  with a huge amount of game time.\n\n8/10","October 14, 2014","true","36.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The worst assassin creed to date!\n\nI played the first and the 2nd with all expacs and they were awesome, but this one is quite terrible.\n\nThe game is well done, polished with great graphics. As a standalone game, an ok AAA game it would be. But the dark side of the force has taken hold of it and teared it apart:\n\n- The story is REDICULOUS and quiiiiiite boring. There would simply be no USA today without conor the a..s..s guy in charge! yipee whata hero!!!\n- The control are the worst i've seen in any video games. After 50+ hours of playing, i still can't get the hang of fighting and regularly get thrashed because of the sheeeeety controls that seems to have been made for aliens hands or something. Maybe if i had claws it would be better.... Also expect to have hand fatigue pretty fast with a game pad. It was there also in the other games, but it did not bother me as much as in this one. The bad controls are the results of this .\n- Again with the bad controls, the genius who came up with using both control sticks and holding them in an awkward position while smashing with your little finger the farthest button that exists on the controller needs to be shot in the face with a canon, repeatedly.\n- Edmond missions are even worst than before and that's saying because they were already baaaad in the other games!\n- Conor our great hero has the annoying voice of a depressed and angry teenager who is going through puberty. When you start the game and he is 16, it's only annoying and you can't wait to see him grown up! Then 14 years later with gray hairs, he's still as annoying. Also, he is the dumbest adult i've ever saw. He's like a reaaaaaaly slow witted amerindian. Such an inept representation of what they were is quite insulting. I feel insulted and i'm not even an amerindian!\n- The boat missions were actually far better than the rest of the game combined! Too bad there were only a few and they didnt last long (But that's why they made 'black flag' hehehe)\n- The wilderness and hunting was okayish. It was graphically gorgeous and when it rained it was pretty realistic. But if youre not a maniac of nature like me, there wasn't much fun to be had there.\n- The cities are quite boring affairs. Looking like crap compared to the other game. But then, houses were made with planks of wood or red brics. Far from the splendor of rome and constantinople. I think the era was not a great one to have this game in nor the country.\n- The assassins group that you eventually have are quite boring affairs too. It seems like an afterthougth that they added after their QA comments was: "Man that game is soooo boring it stinks!" After the fun with Brotherhood and the conquest you could do in Revelation, here it's pretty pointless. After level 5 thought, one assassin can seemingly one shot kill the whole english army on his own, while you can't do that with the bad controls of the game. It's like the guys who designed the fighting mechanics thought: Let's make the fights more realistic and hard and not one shot kills! But the guys who made the 'assassins guild' thought, let's one shot kill everyone in 5 seconds after your assassin buddies reached lvl 5. Mmmmmm balanced!!!!\n- Somehow, even the historical figures are boring people. I'm not sure why exactly, maybe they wanted to make them more normal people which is closer to historically accurate. Like george washington fleeing most battles because he lost them all pretty equally and won one little pointless one that was marketed to high heaven and disturbed the english so much that they started losing more and more after that. Faaaar from the historical 'american hero' we used to hear about. Still, all the historical figures seems shallow. I did love the guy with the cigar who had some spunk while commanding the failing battle. Was disturbed by Benjaming Franklin talking on and on about screwin....g older women and fantasizing about it all the time. THAT was unexpected! Still, the other seems colorless.\n- Guns are useless in this game. In fact, the little gun we had in the other games was far more accurate, shot a lot faster without reloading and was usefull to use. Those one-shot gun that takes 10 seconds of reloading might be accurate historically speaking, but god damn i had time to kill the guy with my sword before i could reload my gun. Or with my fist....\n- The templar looks more and more like the real winners and good guys all around. The assassins seems quite pathetic and with no heart or cause that is worth to die for. When you start rooting for the bad guys, something has gone wrong with your story.....\n\nSo skip this game and go play Black flag the pirate game instead. There are booty to be taken ahoy!\n","January 13","false","32.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Let's start with the bad : Connor starts off horribly, I hated him to the extreme.  Yet as you progress he matures before your eyes and redeems himself, but let's get one straight.  He will NEVER hold up to Ezio from AC2. (to be fair, those are hard shoes to fill.)\n\nThe game is riddled with annoying chases.  Chasing animals, people, rushing here and there and it bothered me.  Yet the excellent ship combat which MORE then makes up for it is a huge amount of fun. You make shots and if you hit, your crew cheers and comments. It makes you feel awesome.\n\nThe story kept me interested all throughout the game, and makes you question the whole  templar / assassin war and wonder which side is really right.    It even makes the villains have multiple dimensions and have them show regret, fear and concern and even compassion over all the supposedly evil things they do.  Let's just say when you get to finally get revenge on the lead villain it lead to probably my favorite moment in the whole franchise.\n\nIf you can look past the flaws it is a very enjoyable experience.

I had to restart a single mission THIRTY times, just because of this and other glitches.\n\nGlitches aside, the story meanders, and fails to have a cohesive plot. The protagonist is railroaded into one story after another, clearly more to force the plot to carry you along with major historical events (riding the same horse as Paul Revere, for example) rather than writing a good story against the backdrop of the Revolutionary War. The developers clearly had a checklist of major and minor historical figures and events that they wanted to force you into meeting.\n\nThe voice acting of the main protagonist is dull. He has two tones: Grey, and loud. The writing is shoddy, with his emotional state seemingly random.\n\nThe mechanics are a bit haphazard as well. Hunting? It's never really made clear what that's for. Possibly for (near-pointless) crafting for (absolutely pointless) trading, and the occasional collection quest, but I have tons of materials in my pocket (because infinite pockets) that I'm never quite sure if I'm supposed to be selling or saving, so I've stuck with saving (and ultimately doing nothing with them).\n\nClimbing trees? Dangerous, not actually all that useful (since it slows you down). Same with buildings, at this point. Gone are the days of AC1 and AC2's free running being a transportation method. The roofs of buildings are often too mismatched or unconnected to ever be useful. It was so bad that even the developers realized they needed to shoehorn in an underground maze that unlocks fast travel points around the area, so you can quickly traverse the city without having to deal with actually playing the game to travel.\n\nThe maze you unlock fast travel with? Dull. It's atmospheric at first, but after spending 45 mind-numbing minutes exploring ever nook of it just to make sure I missed nothing (there was nothing to miss, only the fast travel points are down there), I now have absolutely no reason to visit it ever again, and regret spending so much time with it.\n\nSide missions? Most of them involve little to no plot. In fact, the vast majority involve finding four people in a city, and pushing a button/key while standing next to them. The most complicated the dialog gets is something like "Thank you for delivering this".\n\nI'm around half way through the game, and most of the time I spend playing it has me either rolling my eyes, yawning, or incredibly frustrated.\n\nI'm only playing it because I feel it's necessary to not miss part of the over-arching story. I read books. I *own* books (enough to fill two seven-foot-tall bookshelves). I've been reading my whole life, and sci-fi/fantasy stories are my bread and butter. I can't *not* finish this game before moving on to the (reportedly better) AC4, but I'm NOT enjoying the experience.\n\nThe first time I started playing it, I spent 19 hours with it before I gave up. It's the first PC AC game I didn't play through to the end. I'm back now a year and a half later, playing it again, just so I can finish it and move on to the reportedly much better AC4. I'm 48% of the way through, and wish it was already over.\n\nIf you're not like me, and can stand to skip this bit of the story (or are willing to let someone else spoil it for you), do not buy this game.

The most complicated the dialog gets is something like "Thank you for delivering this".\n\nI'm around half way through the game, and most of the time I spend playing it has me either rolling my eyes, yawning, or incredibly frustrated.\n\nI'm only playing it because I feel it's necessary to not miss part of the over-arching story. I read books. I *own* books (enough to fill two seven-foot-tall bookshelves). I've been reading my whole life, and sci-fi/fantasy stories are my bread and butter. I can't *not* finish this game before moving on to the (reportedly better) AC4, but I'm NOT enjoying the experience.\n\nThe first time I started playing it, I spent 19 hours with it before I gave up. It's the first PC AC game I didn't play through to the end. I'm back now a year and a half later, playing it again, just so I can finish it and move on to the reportedly much better AC4. I'm 48% of the way through, and wish it was already over.\n\nIf you're not like me, and can stand to skip this bit of the story (or are willing to let someone else spoil it for you), do not buy this game. If you DO need to buy this game, I recommend spending as little money as possible.","August 10, 2014","false","52.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

That said AC3 is simply not fun. One simply can't shake the notion that (parts of) it was designed-by-commitee. The "optional objectives" more often than not force you to play completely against type, needlessly complicating missions and in a few cases simply turn into a luck based mission if they are not outright impossible to achieve. Controls sometimes force you to jump between barrels and crates, especially funny when you are chasing someone, and the character seems to have a fear of moderate hights and tend to get stuck on tables and the like.\n\nDefinitely a low point of the series and I just realised that I have still 4-5 games to go.\nMay god have mercy on my soul.","November 26, 2013","false","120.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Admittedly it may have something to do with me getting into it long after the final DLC and/or patch(es) came out, but a lot of the bad reviews I've been seeing have less to do with issues in the software and more with the game itself.\n\nI liked AC2 more than the first, Brotherhood more than AC2, Revelations more than Brotherhood... every single one has been nothing but an improvement upon the previous in nearly every way. This is no exception.\n\nThat doesn't mean I have no complaints myself. I still have the same complaints I did when I first started Brotherhood. The arbitrary camera "helper angles," during certain dungeon missions, and certain scenes that are nigh impossible to finish - especially in the case of chasing Lee who sprints at nearly twice the speed of Connor. I've also never been fond of requirements for "full synchronisation." I find most of them tedious in the extreme, so I usually just ignore them. Static Collision Detection and how the "parkour triggers" are affected by it also still needs a lot of work. But, as suggested, little-to-none of that has anything to do with AC3 itself. It's just stuff that I don't care for, and a couple other things Ubisoft are still working on.\n\nAnd I gotta say, after those privateering missions, I can certainly see why Black Flag is such a success by comparison. I've always been fond of the concept of maritime naval warfare in gaming, but I would never have expected an Assassin's Creed game to fill that niche. I will certainly be getting AC4 "Deluxe" when I can.\n\nAnd now for one of those silly "out of ten" ratings: 9/10 (would be ten if not for that Charles Lee chase scene, the most frustrating part of the entire game for me)\n\nA little apropos: I've seen a lot of complaints about AC devs and storywriters "failing at historical accuracy" and/or "realism." Hey uh, guys? It's a game with a fictional storyline, not a damned simulator intended for educational purposes. It even clearly states during startup that it is "inspired by historical people and events." That's "inspired by," not "based on." Seriously, stop it. It's embarrassing, just stop.\n\nOh and Desmond's death? Still a better ending than Mass Effect 3. Shameless plug, I know, but it doesn't make it any less true.\n\nAnyways, yes, I do indeed recommend this game.

At least this stops in the fourth Assassin's Creed (took you long enough Ubisoft).\n\nAnyway, Assassin's Creed 3 was a lot of firsts for me. It was the first AC game that I got angry at. It was the first AC game that I believe has an unfollowable story. It was the first AC game where Desmond's story is significantly more interesting than playing as the Assassin. It was the first AC game where I didn't get a single viewpoint or do any side quests - there was just no need to, nor were any of them on the way to the main quest. In fact this is the first AC game where the heart of the previous Assassin's Creeds' feel completely ripped out; the formula was changed too much in all the wrong places to the point that you aren't even playing an Assassin's Creed game anymore.\n\nOh yeah, ship battles were fun until you got to where you couldn't complete missions without upgrades. The only issue here is that upgrades cost 12,000 pounds, but I never had more than 100 pounds throughout the entire game. You aren't awarded money for completing missions, and I only got menial amounts from looting bodies or pickpocketing people. I have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to get tons of money in this game because nothing I ever did gave me money, and I didn't have any reason to find out anyway. I just didn't do those harder ship missions.\n\nAnd there was something about hunting, forgot about that pretty quick.\n\nIf this game were completely on its own outside of a series it would be pretty decent. The problem is it isn't an Assassin's Creed game, it's something entirely different that could have been condensed by cutting out all of the nonsense Connor went through and shoving the events of Desmond into the ending of Revelations. For that reason AC3 is one of the worst games I have ever played, and this is definitely one that I will never be returning to. My only real motivation for completing this mess was to power through it and be able to play Black Flag now, especially with all the hype I hear around that from my friends (even if it's many years old now).","April 8","false","15.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","1"

It is the first game to veer away from Ezio and introduces a new playable character, Connor. The game, in my opinion, has done the impossible - it has managed to supercede Assassin's Creed 1 (which was excusable as it was the first foray into these games) and Revelations as the dullest Assassin's Creed game yet.\n\nThe game is set in colonial America at the start of the American Revolution. You go through various towns that are key to the revolution. The cities are big, but feel empty - the colonies feel like they aren't as populated as the past cities explored by the previous games. They lack a certain character. In fact, a lot of the game lacks character - the main issue being Connor himself. You start out with Connor's dad, which gives the game an excellent intro - Haytham is an astounding character, full of wit and life. In contrast, Connor is dry, monotonous, and almost always angry. It feels like they were trying to recreate Altair, but failed to do so. Altair may have been brooding, but his character changed, and he held the role of 'badass' very well. Connor is just a bore to be with.\n\nThe game itself is very poorly designed, I feel. There is no sense of progression. There is no incentive to be stronger, to do side quests, to discover stuff.

If possible, jump back to the old games, get Liberation, or even jump to Assassin's Creed 4, which I hear is actually fun and includes more focus on the naval missions, one of the few good aspects from 3.","November 26, 2013","false","23.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

All the excitement of having an excellent story with relatable main characters, amazing gameplay mechanics and environments? If you did not then you might want to get this game, it does away with the Ezio storyline and gives you control over an angsty kid with a name I do not even remember (rakakakananananahakumamatata or something) fighting in the most boring era of the most boring ''country'' of all time. Fight in wars using poorly controlled cannons in long events which means nothing; get a boat and sail the seas in this terrible edition of ''Sailing Simulator 1760''.\n\nExchange the beautiful landscapes of Italy for a bland background (I guess you can call the game realistic if you look at the present state of the country) of a country founded by traitors calling themselves patriots.

It seems like they decided to get rid of all the parts of Assassins Creed that I enjoy, what with a confusing fast travel system, a terrible port for pc and an obvious lack of effort into the weapons and mission hubs. There are no side quests, there are very limited weapons, the missions are repetitive and boring, and Connor himself isn't very likeable. No character development whatsoever, Connor is supposed to be a calm, patient person who doesn't like to kill. But his brutal combat skills contradict that fact. Also, Ubisoft advertised the game as centered around Connor as an assassin. Not until sequence 4 do you actually get to play as Connor, and you have to wait another sequence until he is an actual assassin. Altogether a disappointment to the AC series, although I believe they made up for it with Black Flag, which is the best AC game in my opinion.","February 25, 2014","false","23.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

AC3 drops some of the best and most fun things from all the time spent as Ezio (good hit detection, functional contextual controls, QUIET single hit kill weapons, guards that don't spawn in trees, rocks you can climb most of the time, an economy that isn't terribly designed, freerunning that more or less works, a Brotherhood of Assassins that can actually KILL PEOPLE...) and replaces them with the ability to jump in trees and kill beavers.\n\nThis is by no means an even trade. Calling the game buggy is a drastic understatement. Calling the game dull... the same. Calling the story poorly written, many of the characters flavorless, the actual development involved in the title questionable... very reasonable.\n\nGive it a pass.

Everyone gets it.\n\nTerrible modern story and dialogue -- as usual.\n\nTerrible historical story and dialogue -- worse than the others, which aren't great either.\n\nTerrible mission design and secondary objectives.\n\nUninteresting cities and wilderness.\n\nObnoxious romanticizing of native American cultures.

Lexington and Concord? You were there, in fact -- YOU rode Paul Revere around to tell people the British were coming AND you won the battle for the Americans. Bunker Hill? You were there.\n\nEvery other battle? You were there and commanded the troops to victory! The Boston Tea Party -- YOU threw most of the tea in and defended the colonists helping?

The dumb 'My dad is a templar grandmaster' subplot is also really annoying and nonsensical.\n\nConnor is an annoying angsty teen for the entirety of the story.\n\nDon't play this game.","July 2, 2015","false","20.0"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","18","35","3","0"

The characters are uninteresting, the story is boring, and all stealth elements are pretty much absent and what little remains is so clunky it barely works. Cities are boring, forests are barely more interesting, and the QTE hunting is a huge pain. And finally, the sailing is unbearably bad...nothing like the polished beauty of Black Flag. There is only one positive aspect to this game, and that comes with reservations: the setting. Ubisoft does a pretty great job of portraying Colonial/Revolutionary America as well as the tensions between the colonists and Native Americans. The historical figures they have the game show thorough research on part of Ubisoft as does the scenery and props throughout the world. The only reservation I have is that an AC game has no place in this setting and completely breaks it. You can get away with street brawls and guard stabbings in Renaissance Italy, Byzantium, and the Caribbean but you can't convincingly have that in Colonial America. Just think about the "Boston Massacre"...barely anyone died in that, and that was one of the pivotal events leading up to the Revolution. You could never run through the streets cutting down British soldiers and get away with it. Not only would you bring down reparations from the Brits but the Colonists would probably reject your underhanded tactics as well. Washington did have spies but they still experienced the stigma associated with such a deceitful and duplicitous way of fighting. I feel that I am justified in this complaint because Ubisoft has always stressed the historicity of their games so it is a fair criticism.","May 5, 2014","false","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not as fun as the previous games and I'm still a bit unclear as to how the last game in the series directly translates in this one... I'll have to not recommend it for several reasons.\n1) The game is extremely temperamental and glitchy. I don’t believe I've ever been able to play more than an hour or so without some freeze, story glitch or outright crash to desktop.\n2) Ubisoft's support is nonexistent and in the few, extremely rare circumstances you actually get a response, it is of zero help or reeks of incompetence and/or no concern to paying customers whatsoever.\n3) BE WARNED and DO NOT BUY the Tyranny of Washington DLC. There is a well know issue in the first episode that completely make progress impossible. There have been thousands of online posts and nothing in the way of support or a fix from Ubisoft. Their only recommendation was to delete your save game and start over, hoping, that it won’t happen again. To most players, it happens again though after hours of playing everything over again. Don't take my word for it, google "Stalk the guard dog""Justice Served" for yourself is read of all the misery.\n\nThis is the last title from Ubisoft I ever purchase it joins a list of blacklisted companies that will never see my money again such as EA and Amazon. There are plenty of choices for entertainment out there and I can live without another AC title or EA recycled sports game. The only thing these companies understand and care for is $ and that is the only we can control directly. If you will not properly support the titles you release then you will not have me as a customer.\nIf half of you reading this followed through on the same, things would change very, very quickly.","May 19, 2014","false","73.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From the story missions, which are interesting but confusing (see further down), to the homested missions trading and recruting assassins (PLEASE BRING THIS BACK UBISOFT). Note the game is not 100% cohesive game many of the side missions are detatched and weird, but it is still 75%, better then most games.\nThe stroy is the games weak spot, it can be summerized into 3 words - "Where's charls lee".

As such conner is really 1-D (not really, but for about 60% of the time), however haythem (the main villain) is very deep and has really good caracter.\nThis game has alot of fun to offer, but it is not a real AC game, take that into account.","October 8, 2014","true","143.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it has some negatives overall it is a strong entry and definitely feels like a numerical entry to the series after the Ezio trilogy.\n\nThe game play does a great job of stream lining many of the elements introduced since AC2. No longer having to constantly hold one of the triggers helps make combat more smooth and brings it closer to the combat you experience in the Batman series by Rock Steady. Running through the forest adds a new element to the series and helped with immersion and felt fluid. It was the highlight of the game and makes you feel like a true assassin tracking prey through the tree tops and pouncing on them from above.\n\nThe story does a nice job of moving things along and telling a coherent tale from both Desmond and Connors perspective. While you start as a different character for the rather long tutorial (took me around 5 hours because I had to reach all the eagle views in Boston) it does a fantastic job of setting up the game world and introducing you to characters you meet down the road. It also has an interesting twist that I did not see coming.\n\nThe weakest part of the story I found was the main character Connor. The voice acting was flat and monotone. He seemed to grab on to the stoic Native stereotype and never let go of it.  Most of the other characters gave at least passible emotional range but Connor seemed to have a cloud of ennuyeux about him.\nOther than Connor I really enjoyed the Desmond story line because it finally started to make some sense instead of being tremendously vague about what was going on and the Connor line had a number of twists and turns I truly did not see coming.\n\nIf you are an Assassin’s Creed fan or just looking to jump into the series this is a great point to start. The game play is modern and the story is something to not miss. If you can stand having to listen to Connors inability to change the pitch of his voice no matter the circumstances you will enjoy the ride.\n","January 8, 2014","true","45.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I finished the game without upgrading/buying any weapons, armour, ship, homestead, etc. The whole economy is completely superfluous!\n7. The worst fast travel system I have seen in a game yet!\n8.

I was disapointed in this game.  The main charater in this one is Connor and is horrible.  The game mechanics are basically same in all the AC games.  I am having a hard time not recommending this game because im such a huge fan of the series.  Don't get me wrong it is a fun game the rope dart is a great weapon in your assassin tool kit.  But the main story is the same old same old.  Maybe after playing as Ezio across three of the AC series it is hard to appericate Connor.  And I would of liked to see main story outside of Animus progress more.  But it does end on a cliff hanger and will be interesting how ubisoft corrects this IMO terrible ending.  If your a die hard fan play it if you are just thinking of picking it because it looks fun get AC2, Brotherhood, or Revelations instead.  I wish steam had a better recommendation system because a thumbs up is right and a thumbs down isn't right for how i feel on this game.","January 10, 2013","true","129.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I can see why it's received all sorts of gentle pummelling from all sides, but it deserves major accolades at the very least for boldly venturing into quite different territory from the previous titles (all too rare in a huge budget sequel!) and actually pulling it off, absolutely superb handling of the historical material and some truly excellent, nuanced and thought-out writing – though admittedly the protagonist mostly feels like he was written by three different people who didn't quite agree on what they want to do with him.

I wanted to like this game i truly did but in my hours of playing I just never could admit I was having fun (except for the naval portions those were excellent).\n\nThe game starts out well enough with a great character that you like and want to continue playing as, the sad part is that this is actually the antagonist of the game and not Connor.\n\n(Spoiler)You find out you have been playing as Connors father Laytham who is actually the leader of the Templars in America(Spoiler ends).\n\nYou then play as Connor and honestly he was one of the worst parts of the game. Maybe this was the designers fault or a personal dislike of Connors consstant doe eyed innocence to the world around him even though he is constantly being rebuked not only by foes but by his own mentor. On top of that he is just a forgettable character and his motivation for becoming and Assassin is pretty standard (revenge). Moving on from Connor we come back to Desmond and the sci-fi aspect of the first civ. Desmond has changed but not exactly for the better he has seemed to have lost the depth he gained in precious games and has exchanged it for a personallity that would most likely be of an angry teenager not a grown man who knows the world is at risk. Also the way that the whole Desmond story is finally concluded felt rushed and shoe horned in to say the least.\n\nTo the more technical aspects the cities and setting are very beautiful but they grow very stale and boring after a short time (I would really like to know how the trees grew to provide a clear parkour path it is a miracle of nature). There are multitudes of mini objectives and collectibles but they tend to either do close to nothing or unlock a new set of robes for Connor. Oh and about the Assassins robes you do not get those till you are almost 2/3 of the way done with the game. There are some framereate problems and some texture popping caused by the lack of the game taking advantage of multiple cores instead of just one. Oh yes and be prepared for pointless and badly implemented additional objectives during missions to get full sync. By the fifth time of having to restart a mission to try and get full sync I finally said "to  hell with it" and just started playing the game how I wanted. Though as a gamer whenI see that big red X pop up it did mess with me and I of course would try multiple times again to get full sync. An example of a poorly implemented extra objective was during a chase scene through a crowded city it was "Do no shove anyone while chasing the target". This caused me frustration on a massive scale. Not only does the target run straight through crowds without knocking anyone down or slowing down he also throws down money to make it extra difficult for you. This is what I mean by badly implemented extra objectives things that are just put in to pad out the play time.\n\nTo sum up this is not a game that was rushed out but it feels like a game that was rushed out to meet a deadline for the holidays.

Ezio was a fun and interesting character to play, and so was his game.\n\nConversely, Connor seems filled with hate. And I hate his game too. The controls have been "simplified" from previous titles, so you'll be hitting the same button to pick up a gun, parry, or pat a random dog that wanders past (just what you need in a fight scene). While there were points in ACII that seem unpolished, ACIII seems to deliberately steer you into them: stealth missions that hinge on you getting past a certain point where, if you fail the first time, you'll be dropped back at a checkpoint in line of sight of your targets; ledges that you'll autolock and hang from to despite simply trying to run through an archway to avoid foes in scripted chase scenes; the damnable "lockpicking" minigame that seems to have been lifted from Fallout 3 except with all elements of skill left behind.\n\nThere are two reasons to get ACIII: 1) You're an avid American history buff; 2) You've played the previous Assassin's Creed titles and want to find out what happens next.

I got to this one quickly after going through AC2, AC Brotherhood and Revelations so one could say I had good compression to the older ones.\nSadly apart from few new interesting features like sea battles I won't deny it game is bad, like 2/10 bad. Ships are amazing. But again this game is not a ship simulation. So sorry, but game about assessin's where most of the time you can't choose how to kill an enemy and instead you are forced to watch cutsceen followed by "Press LeftMouseButton" indicator is not a good one. Just to compare in older ones of course you had this "100% sync" objectives but still it was you who had to do running, sneaking, jumping, killing (with those few restrictions to do them right way to gain 100%). Now in most main quests it's just press "Forward" and when you reach destination "Press LMB". In addition to stupid and sometimes luck based restrictions to do this or that - in older AC games, those 100% sync restristions had some logic behind them now, mostly non.\nThat's the first and main let down, scripts and stupidity, I want to play not watch the movie and points that forces me to do something stupid just for 100% won't make me any more amused.\nGoing further, freerun. Never ever was I so frustrated with AC game, our main character doing whatever he wants just because "fu** you, that's why".\nFighting. They said "we made easier interface, less buttons" I said "maybe just give us PLAY button if you don't want us to actually interact with game". In older ones you had to have some skill to fight now mehh even your grandma (no offence) can beat hell out of the enemies.\n100% sync requirements are based on luck too often which forces you to relunch missions again and again just to get the damn 100% sync.\nMaps, never less explored than now, and to be clear I'm not talking about big forest maps I'm talking about towns, boring, ugly and not challenging at all, I know better damn forests than towns...\nI could go on a lot longer about, capturing forts, how you can just openly attack them, about stupid AI, about bugged guards attacking you because you just walked next to them (not in red zone and in incognito) without reason...\n\nGood sides, yeah this game have few, sadly only few and not really adding anything to assassin part :(\nShips - are amazing, but again as I said befor that's game about assassins not ships.\nHunting - really nice, well done, sometimes unrealistic, but I won't complain, it's game, sadly forgotten in mid and late game, sadly, because they could use it somehow in game.\nEconomy (caravans) nice, but also, you will forget about them as fast as you got to know about them...\nOther Assassin's - there are here, and well, you can say, they could gone as well. Not like in AC Revelations where they were an asset. Here they feel forced and useless.\nPlot - I like Desomnd part, whole thing with ancients but the part about our main Animus character is colourless, boring, plain. All plot twists (big words... I don't know if you can say plot and twists in this case together ;p) feel not right and makes you stay in game for just few more minutes. Also main character himself is deep like a puddle. Yet another frustrated guy without a plan, making stupid things EXACLY NOT LIKE ASSASSIN should do them... Not like Ezio, not like Altair, not like any other Assassin. Period.\n\nSummary:\n+ Ships\n+ Forest and not city like zones\n? Hunting (amusing for a short period of time, and sadly devs didn't use it's potential - forgotten in mid and late game)\n? Buy/sell via caravans (nice, but you could not care less)\n--- Scripts, scripts everywhere, cutsceens "Press button" (for 5min straight) periods\n- Freerun\n- Fighting (too easy + with messed up movement and grabbing things you don't want to grab, annoying)\n- Stupid and luck based 100% sync requirements\n- You won't feel like assassin, more like frustrated native American without plan\n- Other assassin's, could gone as well\n\nSadly only 5/10 in my opinion. Seems like scraps of meat glued together with some fancy colour papers and shiny powder riding on amazing horse called Assassin's Creed series. Great title, but nothing worth this name behind.","January 2, 2015","false","47.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I love the changing seasons and the hunting, it's like Red Dead but with much more focus on the hunting because you can track animals and stuff. Love the way you can sell and buy supplies, be like a merchant, even though I never really understood how you do it.\nYou can get and level up recruits in this game, send them on missions to make them level up plus you get some cash and stuff to sell.\nI love the character Connor aswell. He's very cool and unique from the others and his robes are awesome. The start of the game is reeeally slow, you don't actually get your robes until like sequence 4 or something and you don't even become Connor until sequence 3, I believe. But once you become him, the game becomes really fun.\nBasically AC3 takes all the cool and good aspects from the other games and mixes it with hunting and a focus on managing and fixing your homestead.\nThe naval combat is really cool too, which is where they got the idea for AC4 because the community loved it. They're a cool side feature and you can upgrade your ship to be able to ram enemies or to deal more damage with guns, etc.\nIf you're an AC fan who likes immersion then this game is for you.","March 10, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What threw off most people is how slow the game is for the first 3-4 hours. It does pick up after that, but a lot of your time is spent running around from cutscene to cutscene with an action setpiece every now and then. While I personally am a fan of more storydriven cinematic games, don't play this game if you want non-stop action-packed assassin awesomeness. Go play Black Flag if you want that.\n\nAs for the story itself, its good. It tells a personal story of Connor, and there is a lot of development in the characters of Achilles and the villains. However, Connor himself is a very boring and uninteresting protagonist. The combat is good, but very easy. All you have to do is counter, break defense, and then kill.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game if you enjoy a very immersive world, and good story, if a bit slow moving.","June 24, 2015","true","19.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So I started this game when it came out in 2012 and gave up fairly quickly. I don't particularly remember the start of the game apart from it being incredibly boring.\n\nI finally came back to it in 2015 and found i had played 10 hours of the game and I still didn't have any of the assasins gear or anything (i also really couldn't remember the story too well) So that will give you an idea of how slow it is to begin.\n\nAnway after coming back to the game I found it to be enjoyable. There are a few things in the game I don't care for, like killing and skinning animals, crafting but there are other elements i found suprisingly fun like the whole ship and naval missions and the dlc animal spirit powers are a blast they are definitely a highlight of the game.\n\nThe history and timeline of the game were initially another thing that put me off, i'm not sure why other than it just didn't capture my imagination like the locations and times in the previous games.\n\nThen the character of Connor seemed just too flat, I don't mind the change and well what can i say its hard to surpass Ezio and Altiar but something about Connor just made him hard to care about or relate to as a character.\n\nThen there is the ending of the game, it just wasn't satisfying at all, and i've heard that desmond no long features in the games beyond this point which makes his journey all the more pointless.\n\nAfter all my moaning though there is some solid fun gameplay in there, it just takes some time to get at it and looking back at my steam hours suprisingly this game has the most hours for me even though i like it the least. So that really shows there is plenty to do in the game.\n\nSo If you haven't played much assasins creed and have the patience i'd say you will enjoy the game. If you have just finished playing the last few assasins creed games and are jumping into this for the first time. I'd say brace yourself for slogging through some crap until you get to the fun parts.\n\n\n","July 6, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you have played, and enjoyed (as I have), the previous instalments of the francise, you will probably get some enjoyment from this episode too. I like the addition of seafaring and the naval battles. There is a feeling of panic, unique to this game, when you see a 100 gun Man of war appear in to view. And it is fun using your more manouvable frigate to send one of these giants to Davey Jones' locker. And of course it never gets old appearing over a rooftop and as an enemy starts to challenge you, leaping on him and burying your hidden blade in his chest.\n\nHaving said this, in all honsety the fifth installment of the series still suffers from many of the same problems and bugs previous versions had. The story still has a disjointed feel to it and there were times when there were characters that were refered to and I ended up thinking "who on earth are they?" You could rush through the main story without the need to fulifil any of the optional missions and in honesty I felt that they don't really add much to the narrative. On top of the standard AC plot issues there are the standard game play issues. Connor loves to stand on walls watching as his target disapears off into the distance, leap of a builing in the wrong direction and jump over an assassination target that is on the move. After 5 years development time you would have hoped that Ubisoft would have many of these issues solved, yet they still persist.\n\nAll in all I give this game a 7.5/10. I've scored it this high only because I bought it in the sumer sale for £3.75 and at that price it's good value for money. If I see AC4 available for a similar price I will probably give that a whirl too, but not at the £15.99 Steam and Ubisoft are currently asking.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/recommended/208480/","totalwargamer","Sleep deprived shift worker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/","88 products in account","Assassin's Creed 3\n\nPositives:\n\n+ Pretty immersive atmosphere, Ubisoft captured the essence of the American Revolution and what it is like to live in the 1700s. You'll explore the frontier forests, the city of Boston and the town of New York. On ultra graphics, it's quite pleasant and enjoyable.\n+ Free frunning and climbing, like all the Assassin's Creed games. You can now hide in shrubs and other bushes, adding a new element of stealth, and you can climb trees, adding another facet of gameplay.\n+ Lots of side missions, some with better rewards and more pertinence to the main story than others. Peg Leg's missions to uncover Captain Kidd's treasure are great, as are the naval missions to take down Nicholas Biddle, a Templar.\n\n+ Many, many collectibles to find, almanac pages, peg leg trinkets, chests to unlock - hours of content there if you like to discover every part of the map. Some of these collectibles actually serve a purpose, so you don't feel like you're running around aimlessly picking up random items. You need peg leg trinkets to exchange for letters, which lead you to Captain Kidd's treasure map and chests are pretty critical to the game, because you're going to want money for the best weapons and some naval enhancements, maybe even new clothes.\n+ Loved the main plotline, many people criticise this but I thought it was great, even the ending. It ties in well with Desmond in the future too.\n+ Awesome combat animations for weapons, there's different ones for using a tomahawk, sword or rifle with a bayonet. You can use rope darts, poison darts, pistols or a bow and arrow to kill foes. Very, very fun fighting indeed.\n\n+ Unlike previous Asasssin's Creed games, number 3 has a balanced economy, meaning you don't become insanely rich mid-game. In fact, even after looting all chests in the game, you're not going to have enough pounds to purchase all ship upgrades (not that they're essential), outfits and the most expensive weapons. I thought this was a flaw of previous titles in the series, where I invested in businesses and just became incredibly wealthy that everything became too easy. That problem is solved.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- So, rewards for some collectibles are good, as I already mentioned. But rewards for others are poor and don't offer much incentive to go about collecting in the first place. The only reason you'd consider doing so is if you're a completionist. For instance, collecting all feathers gives you ONE new outfit (big deal) which doesn't really do anything. Collecting the almanac pages provides access to inventions which can decorate your home, again who cares.\n- Some side quests like hunting animals and helping individuals re-settle on the homestead don't offer much in terms of gameplay rewards and aren't particularly exciting, they can get boring unless you only do them here and there, inbetween other activities.\n\n- Ubisoft just don't get how truly DISGUSTING their controls are for the Assassin's Creed franchise on PC. Yes it's playable and yes you get used to it, to the point it becomes second nature. But that doesn't change the fact that the controls for PC are simply bad. They are BAD. It takes more than an hour to get used to (I dare say several), the opening tutorial is laughable at explaining the combat mechanics. I mean, you can't even bind the keys you want half the time (enter can't be bound). There's excessive keys (maybe like 10-12) for combat that could be achieved in 3-4. If ONLY Ubisoft weren't lazy as ♥♥♥♥ and could be bothered to make a proper control system when they port the game from console. If only.\n\nOverall Score: 8.5/10\n\nAssassin's Creed 3 is an epic game. I really did enjoy my time on this and can't see any valid reason as to why it's a bad game. Better than any of the games before it, it's a must play. I do recommend it, despite the awkward controls, as you will get used to it with time.","January 24, 2015","true","54.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What threw off most people is how slow the game is for the first 3-4 hours. It does pick up after that, but a lot of your time is spent running around from cutscene to cutscene with an action setpiece every now and then. While I personally am a fan of more storydriven cinematic games, don't play this game if you want non-stop action-packed assassin awesomeness. Go play Black Flag if you want that.\n\nAs for the story itself, its good. It tells a personal story of Connor, and there is a lot of development in the characters of Achilles and the villains. However, Connor himself is a very boring and uninteresting protagonist. The combat is good, but very easy. All you have to do is counter, break defense, and then kill.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game if you enjoy a very immersive world, and good story, if a bit slow moving.","June 24, 2015","true","19.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So I started this game when it came out in 2012 and gave up fairly quickly. I don't particularly remember the start of the game apart from it being incredibly boring.\n\nI finally came back to it in 2015 and found i had played 10 hours of the game and I still didn't have any of the assasins gear or anything (i also really couldn't remember the story too well) So that will give you an idea of how slow it is to begin.\n\nAnway after coming back to the game I found it to be enjoyable. There are a few things in the game I don't care for, like killing and skinning animals, crafting but there are other elements i found suprisingly fun like the whole ship and naval missions and the dlc animal spirit powers are a blast they are definitely a highlight of the game.\n\nThe history and timeline of the game were initially another thing that put me off, i'm not sure why other than it just didn't capture my imagination like the locations and times in the previous games.\n\nThen the character of Connor seemed just too flat, I don't mind the change and well what can i say its hard to surpass Ezio and Altiar but something about Connor just made him hard to care about or relate to as a character.\n\nThen there is the ending of the game, it just wasn't satisfying at all, and i've heard that desmond no long features in the games beyond this point which makes his journey all the more pointless.\n\nAfter all my moaning though there is some solid fun gameplay in there, it just takes some time to get at it and looking back at my steam hours suprisingly this game has the most hours for me even though i like it the least. So that really shows there is plenty to do in the game.\n\nSo If you haven't played much assasins creed and have the patience i'd say you will enjoy the game. If you have just finished playing the last few assasins creed games and are jumping into this for the first time. I'd say brace yourself for slogging through some crap until you get to the fun parts.\n\n\n","July 6, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The movement of character and parkour is better than ever! -Now with an addition of tree climbing mechanic you can climb and traverse trees from one to another. Making exploration a bit different and more enjoyable!\nOther noteworthy mechanics are tracking and hunting of animals, which is interesting in the beginning but later on i just found myself ignoring it most of the time. It's just not worth your time and effort...\nThe most significant is the addition of naval combat, and needless to say it is amazing! They are separated into their own 'missions' from the classic gameplay and are quite short, but regardless it's still the best you can experience in gaming atm!\nGraphics have been upped a notch too, the game looks beautiful.

Only after becoming the great Assassin you put literal hours of gameplay by this point into becoming, Connor turns into a whiney, brooding child who laments on how Assassin's and Templars can't simply work together to protect (read: control) the free world. After playing Assassin's Creeds 1, 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations, After building up the Assassin Brotherhood from the brink of destruction, Aftering fighting a shadow war through multiple games to reach this point you have absolutely nothing to show for it, "Back to square one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, thanks for the cash!" -Ubisoft.

The mission bugs and general gameplay bugs are still present, the Boston FPS Drop from my knowledge does not exist anymore.\n\nIn my opinion, the removal of some parkour mechanics from the older games was not needed, such as being able to run up a wall and back eject, or run up a wall and jump to another ledge. I do like the fact though that only one key needs to be held to freerun, and not two. However, I prefer the older two-keyed freerunning because you could control the player much more efficiently.\n\nThis game should not be hated but rather avoided in favor of the older titles or IV if you're starting out in the series. It's enjoyable in itself but not to a lot of people.","January 8, 2014","false","151.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Ubisoft reminds me of my old Jewish landlord, guy was a disgusting slum lord who fixed nothing. A cancerous blister, whose only joy came out of legally robbing his tenants. Ubisoft, EA, Acti, all ♥♥♥♥ing trash, and two of them even have enough balls to come up with their own online services to put their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games they pump out. DRM on top of DRM. So the cycle continues because we all buy into it. I can hear my grandmother telling me what the ♥♥♥♥ am I doing giving my money to these people, and to be honest It's because of boredom.\n\nLike what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing later tonight? Nothing, the same ♥♥♥♥ I've been doing the past twelve years.  I got people coming up to me asking why I am not dating or what will I be doing later on in the night, would you like to grab a coffee? No, I'm going to be on steam writing reviews that have barely anything to do with the game I'm reviewing. You know what it's like to go to work and hear how ♥♥♥♥ing handsome you are, and why are you just doing this, since your intellect and looks could get you so much further in life. Like how the ♥♥♥♥ do you know how I feel inside? Why, because I joke about my vanity? Attractive people aren't suppose to be depressed?\n\nLike who makes up these rules. I think I'm going to compile all of these reviews and post them on my website, whenever I drum up the willpower to create one. Some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ will say "you're being an angst teen" "make sure to tip your fedora" the only thing these internet dungeon dwellers can come up with, with their pea sized brains.  "Epic dank memes bro, dem mays mays be cray ♥♥♥♥♥♥" How they even function in the real world is a mystery. Like, when their parents die and they have no one to pay the bills, how the ♥♥♥♥ are they going to take care of themselves?\n\nWhat are they going to put on their resume? Yes, I would like to be hired for this job, my skills include being a dmg in csgo, watching 1000+ animes, and naming more than 52 current female jav stars. Yeah, exactly, no, what will happen is, they will go on the system and I will be checking them into one of my rooms at my job, they will destroy said room, and move on to place to place having nowhere to call home.

Ezio was a fun and interesting character to play, and so was his game.\n\nConversely, Connor seems filled with hate. And I hate his game too. The controls have been "simplified" from previous titles, so you'll be hitting the same button to pick up a gun, parry, or pat a random dog that wanders past (just what you need in a fight scene). While there were points in ACII that seem unpolished, ACIII seems to deliberately steer you into them: stealth missions that hinge on you getting past a certain point where, if you fail the first time, you'll be dropped back at a checkpoint in line of sight of your targets; ledges that you'll autolock and hang from to despite simply trying to run through an archway to avoid foes in scripted chase scenes; the damnable "lockpicking" minigame that seems to have been lifted from Fallout 3 except with all elements of skill left behind.\n\nThere are two reasons to get ACIII: 1) You're an avid American history buff; 2) You've played the previous Assassin's Creed titles and want to find out what happens next.

Its becouse you just click to a button and it kills someone in a COOL way. I dont know if any of you played Dishonored but it is the real stealth and challengable game.

For the first time I did not like the the main protagonist as much as I liked the villian. He was smarter, honorable, gentle and apparently more skilled than I was.\n\nPlaying only through this sotry I surely understand the background of revolutionary america. But that story is more of a sidequest which interferes with your actual goal, of course, to kill all templars.\n\nThe missions are very repetitive and I didn't bother recruiting all assassins or liberate all city parts. That was not really my concern, although the recruitments were well made. Each character had its own problem you have to solve first. To bad it lacks the story here.\n\nThe best parts for me were the ship battles and the real-life parts with Desmond. Those were the one thing that kept me playing. Even with the stiff controls and the frustrating climbing I experienced with my XBox One controller.\n\nStill I do recommend it, but for me it certainly was one of the weaker AC games.\n\nCompletion time: 22 hours.","March 22","true","22.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's too bad that it gets dragged down by technical flaws and uninteresting characters.\n\nI can't comment on the stability of the console version of this game, but the PC version certainly has issues. The game crashed and had to be restarted numerous times throughout my time with it. At the beginning the crashes were very frequent until I went online and found something that helped, but didn't completely resolve the problem. Here it is: "Go to Nvidia Control Panel (e.g. right click on desktop) -> 3D settings section -> Configure Surround PhysX function -> change CPU to your GPU graphic card e.g. GeForce GTX" (Thanks to Freeplayer2012 on forums.ubi.com) Beyond the crashes, I got stuck between a rock and a tree once and glitched through the roof of a horse drawn carriage and was unable to escape the inside of it. Some movements within the game were overly sticky in terms of climbing on objects when I didn't want to, or jittering on the top of a fence when I'm clearly directing it to jump down. While it controls very similarly to past games, this is a small step backward for the series.\n\nA hallmark of the Assassin's Creed series is its ability to recreate a historical time and place that feels alive and packed with places to explore. By and large, AC3 succeeds in that category. This is the most graphically impressive game in the series so far. There were numerous moments where I had to just stop and take in the scenery, particularly in the game's Frontier region. At no point did I regret the change in setting from the vast cityscapes of the previous games in the series to this new rural wilderness.\n\nIn fact, it was the cities of AC3 that held some disappointment. Perhaps this could be blamed on the setting. For instance, the historical architecture of 1700s America just can't hold up next to Jerusalem or Venice. Not only that but the people of the time were less colorful. Frontiers men and women ARE interesting, but compared to Italian Carnevale attendees? Despite those limitations I do think Ubisoft could have done a better job. There just wasn't enough variety throughout the cities to keep things interesting. Gone are the Mercenary, Romanies, and Thieves Guild buildings and their members roaming the streets. Gone are the purchasable shops and landmarks. I'm not saying either of those were particularly compelling gameplay wise but they weren't replaced by anything in AC3 and I think that resulted in a lack of depth and connection with AC3's New York and Boston.\n\nPerhaps my biggest disappointment was with the characters. Connor has a neat backstory being half British and half Native American. But as a character he's relatively flat, poorly voiced and comes off as childish at times (you play as a young Connor at one point but I'm referring to the adult here). The character I enjoyed the most is the one you play as in the opening few chapters of the game, Haytham. He has a charisma somewhat reminiscent of Ezio but is still unique as a character in the AC series. Unfortunately even his depiction is flawed over the course of the game. I found it baffling and unnecessary the way Haytham and his companions' personalities and overall demeanors were changed quite dramatically as you switched from playing as Haytham to Connor. I understand that Ubisoft was likely trying to highlight how differently each character sees the world, but what they did was too heavy handed and ultimately dehumanized a significant portion of the cast of characters.\n\nLorne Balfe did an admirable job with the soundtrack and I'm glad it was included in the deluxe version of the game. However, he's no Jesper Kyd (who composed for all the previous games). I admit I'm biased in that Kyd is one of my favorite composers while I'm not familiar with Balfe outside of his collaboration with Kyd on the AC: Revelations OST.\n\nThe 3 King Washington DLCs were a pleasant surprise to me. In them you gain animal spirit powers that can drastically change how you play the game. I had a lot of fun putting them to use. I won't be surprised if I find myself wishing I had the Eagle power available to me in future AC titles. The revisionist history that makes up the story is a fun reimagining of events. I was also satisfied with how they went about tying it in with the main story.\n\nI love the Assassin's Creed series and I really enjoyed this game. But it's hard deny that in a lot of ways the series took a step backwards with this iteration.","May 30, 2014","true","70.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In fact you'll never like the main char and will be more mind sided with Templars as the game continues.\n- The main char is a complete tard, the way he become an assassin is dumb, he deals with his "life challenges" are above ridiculous. Everyone and every element will beat you... and I mean EVERY! An old lady, your father, cannon, guard, drunk, whatever... the main char nothing more than a walking shame disguised as an assassin on carnival suit (I got so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with Connor that I had to immediately unblock Ezio's suit to make him at least like a man - I'm not kidding).\n- There are a thousands of bugs on the game and some times you will have to reset the quest to understand what the hell you need to do next and sometimes something important get stuck in the scenario.\n- If you're the kinda person who likes escalating things, forget it. UBISOFT manage to put so many guards in the roofs that you will pass most of the game alerting and running from them instead of having chance to explore the city. Also be aware that these magical guards uses the best alerting system in the entire galaxy, in 10 seconds the entire US Colony and British Army will be after you so you'll have to deal with 20 to 30 soldiers EACH TIME you get on a top of roof! Things get a little better once you start liberating parts of the city but that is a test to patience since the game is boring and not motivating at all!\n- The economy in this game is far from bad. Let me explain that with a little more details: I've finished the game without expending a single coin in weapons, consumables, whatever. Oh! But I've spent money bribing people to stop guards from chasing me since I'm the kinda guy who likes unlocking all outposts :(\n- The combat is far from easy, "press the button at the right time" and you won. This certainly needs improvement.\n- Sequence 12 (the final mission) is the most absurd and idiot thing I've seen in years... and I'm not talking about Desmond history at all\n- The DLC "The Tyranny of King Washington" doesnt need 5 minutes to show you that it sucks harder than the main history. It is a spin off from the main quest where Washington goes mad and pronounce himself as King\n\n\nIf you bough this game (and still are willing to play it after reading all this) everytime you have a chance burn Connor to death, he deserves it.","January 23, 2014","false","33.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

So, why don't I recommend it? Every bit of gameplay on land is exactly like AC 1. Jerky, abhorent, hard to move about fluidly without a controller. I am a person who plays games on the PC so he doesn't have to use the terribad layout of a controller. Do not map my keys, and the way the game works on a PC as if everyone wants to play it with a controller. We don't, and we wont.\nReason 2: The ending is worse than Mass effect 3. How is that even possible?! Oh, well, you know...That chase scene where charles lee must die. And we're also placed far enough away that we have to chase him, and he runs faster than Connor, and he must be followed to the green dragon, a cutscene will happen, blah blah blah storyline. It's a bad ending because you're offered no help, nothing, in moving thorugh the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the maze of the burning ship. You WILL die in fire a few hundred times until you figure it out.\nUltimatly, forget actually playing the final mission. Just go watch the ending on youtube and call it a day, becasue you WILL NOT be able to do it yourself, unless you could somehow always catch all the chase mission targets down in 2 seconds. THEN you MIGHT be able to keep up with Lee.\nThat ending mission feels like what most of AC 1 did; horribly untested, poorly coded, and a simply bad port to the PC. Can we get some quality checks back on games? I mean, come on people. That ending squence made Dark Souls:Prepare to die edition look better, more fluid, and easier to play than this. No actually, I've played Dark Souls before. It IS easier. Holy ♥♥♥♥, talk about 3 steps forward with the ship stuff and 40 back with the lack of work placed in the majority of the gameplay. I mean, seriosuly? I get stuck on invisible walls...running...trying to catch Lee...running...in place...forever failing.........\nSo, questions from this reviewer: Was any thought placed on the general on-land gameplay of the game, or was it expected that no one would notice that nothing has changed at all?\nHas anyone even bothered to point out that the end of this game alone knocks it down 2-3 points on a 1-10 IGN type rating system?\nDid anyone look at playtesting the obvious port to the PC?\nWas it a port, or was it really THAT bad?\nSo, if I was an IGN reviewer, I'd have to say 4/10.\nThe storylines are nice, but most of the gameplay is horrible. I can already tell that almost nothing in AC4 has changed for the land-based movement system, but I can see that they focused on their strong point....(Ships)\nWhile the music is immersive, it is often looked over by the loud cracks of cannon fire or gunshots, the clang of steel on steel or the really noisy for some reason footsteps.\nThe quests are new, and the combat system has been overhauled, but the controlls and feel of the movement remind me that AC 2 apexed the series and it has yet to get better.\nFrom what I've seen in the more recent AC Unity, it's no better. I'm not going to buy it until I see damn well what it's like. That mean something to anyone?\nLet me spell it out. Before buying any of these games, PIRATE THEM. I garentee you will thank yourself if you find that you absolutly hate it, you won't have buyer's remorse over it.\nAll I remeber was buying AC 1, 2, and all the DLC at the time of the release of 3 for some insanely low price, and buying 3 for about $10. But I'm not spending a single penny until I know what 4 will be like.\nSo yea, sorry if I hurt some feelings, sorry if I made people disagree with me, but this game does not deserve half the praise it got, and certainly not half the score.","October 18, 2014","false","82.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/208480/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","The problems exist in this game that exist in most Ubisoft games because they are the undisputed masters of bad PC ports. This had really bad performance when it first came out and they did a little work on it and now it runs fine, but surely not on max settings. A couple of the settings can't be maxed or else the problems skyrocket because it is still somewhat of a unoptimized/poorly programmed mess. The controls are not great either. My guy very often will parkour up, over, onto or around things that I do not want him to, and the movement is not programmed well. Just to name a couple, once I strangled a guy near the edge of a plank on a ship and my guy just kept automatically slightly moving forward after the strangle and did a weird glitch bounce right off the plank and fell far down into the water. I killed a guy another time and still got detected because my guy automatically dragged him into the open while strangling him. These are just a very, very few examples of the underwhelming control scheme this game offers. But it does not detract too badly from the gameplay and this game mostly is a really fun experience.\n\nAC games are pretty fun. My favs being this, IV and Revelations. This has slightly better controls and combat than Revelations. For running/climbing you just hold right button on the controller and run and he automatically parkours around like a champ. In combat you don't have to hold right button to be in combat stance, in Revelations you did. The two things I miss that were in Revelations were territory control mini battles and being able to buy buildings. Neither very important, but fun. 3 makes up for that by putting in naval ship combat and holy crap is it fun. So awesome and spectacular looking to be fighting ship battles like something right out of a movie. The highlight of AC3 though are the melee combat kill moves. Very cool and there are lots of different kill animations. Oh and the game has awesome graphics, some of the best.\n\nThe ending completely sucks. All this work for such a garbage ending? Thanks! When the game ends after a ♥♥♥♥ bag of an ending, the credits roll and last over twenty minutes and are unskippable. This is unacceptable and uncalled for and Ubisoft should know better because nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about or will remember specific names of people that worked on the game. After the credits, it gives you the option to play more in the epilogue. It tells me about some pivots and how to triangulate them but gives no other information so I am not sure why I am doing what I am doing. It was just overwhelmingly boring so I just quit.\n\nUbisoft usually can't port games from console worth a f--k, but this was ported much better than AC4 was more recently. That was a ♥♥♥♥ing disaster that had performance problems up the ♥♥♥ for tons of ppl. Assassin's Creed games are some of the most fun games ever made and 3 is my second fav AC game so far behind 4 which is even better. 8/10","March 23, 2015","true","49.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Maybe the acting is good, but it's covered.\n\nBy things such as the overusement of CGI effects, and placing effects over drama. Now, let's take Call of Duty: Black Ops III, or many others like Assassin's Creed: Syndicate, Assassin's Creed: Unity, Farcry 4, Farcry Primal and many more.\n\nThese games have a good story, eh?  WRONG!	It's overused, the computer hardware that can support the "overripped" quality is worth 500$ each, bottoms. The stories are getting worse and worse. The multiplayer is getting a worser and worser, but that's the community's problem.\n\nThe movies lost it's former beauty, they are simply a shadow of their former selves.\n\nThe CGI effects are too overused, squattled and spammed like eggs.\n\nLet's take Star-Wars as a sample.

(Spoilers)\n\nEntire BF3 campaign in a nutshell:\n\nYou start in a train, bang bang, yadda yadda, bang bang. You randomly go in Iraq, bang, bang, yadda, yadda, bang, bang, bang. Random earth quake!!! You wake up in the middle of random ruins from a random building, you see enemies, go sneaky-beaky and again bang, bang, bang, yadda, yadda, yadda, bang, bang. You randomly switch your soul with a pilot after escaping the random Iraqian ruins. Bang, bang, bang, boom, boom, yadda, yadda, bang, boom. You go in a city now, bang, bang, bang, yadda, yadda, bang, boom. Random nukes are suddenly and randomly missing. Now you are in a tank! Boom, bang, boom, yadda, yadda, bang, boom. You get captured and executed, *cries*. Now you try to find a guy named  Makarov	 Kaffarov. You go in random forests, trough random places and random valleys while fighting random Russian soldiers like never before. BUT WEIGHT!! Your squad is 3/4 dead, *cries*. Meanwhile pro Russian Spetsnaz raid  Makarov	 Kaffarov's holy villa! You go in there! You see a random Russian man! HE MAKES A DEAL! HE WANTS TO WORK WITH YOU!!! You hear random yelling behind you... you turn around and see a random black nigg- err, umm, gentleman! You greet him nicely, but you get shot! You go back to the last checkpoint, 360 no-scope his bottom and get randomly teleported to prison. With your last squad member, of course! You get interrogated for no reason whatsoever. Or do you? You break out, you hijack a train! Deja vu! You now chase  Makarov	 Kaffarov on a motorcycle, you ram into him or something. He headshots your last teammate, *cries*. You fight him in a similar fashion to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. You disarm the nuke! The end! BUT THERE'S MORE! The Russian that helped you for no reason suddenly commits suicide.\n\nThe sudden, real and random end!\n*cries*.\n\nIs that good?

I got everything except for those flags, because the only rewards were achievements. If they had included anything in-game, I quite likely would have gone and collected all of them, like I did with the feathers in Assassin's Creed 2.\n\nSpeaking of Assassin's Creed 2, that game was great. I bought it for myself in the week of Christmas 2009 and had completely passed it by the New Year. It was an improvement in every way over the original.\n\nThen Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood came out (I'm not counting any of the handheld ones) and was pretty much more of the same. It had a few improvements, the most significant of which was the ability to recruit other assassins and have them aid you in battle. I lost interest and never finished this game, but luckily Liam eventually got interested in the series and did it for me.\n\nAfter that came Assassin's Creed: Revelations, which added bombs and the hook blade. Which amounts to basically nothing. Liam played this one too.\n\nAnd now we get to Assassin's Creed 3. While it's true that this series has always been very story-focused, I think this game is the first one that actually suffered for it. The past couple were excusable, because they were just detailing more and more of Ezio's life and were like the Vice City and San Andreas of the Assassin's Creed Series - similar games built on the existing engine but not quite proper sequels (well, they were sequels, but hopefully you know what I mean).\n\nWhile Grand Theft Auto IV was completely different from the previous generation (whether you think that was good or bad is irrelevant), Assassin's Creed 3 was significantly less so. They mostly got rid of assassinating, and they included a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ more of Desmond "Most-boring-and-unlikeable-character-ever" Miles, the plot framing device descended from all of the past assassins.\n\nIf you haven't played the previous games, give them a go, but only get this one if you're so interested in the story that you don't mind playing a much worse game.","June 2, 2013","false","69.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's so foolishly ambitious that it trips over ever flaw it could possibly have, not stumbling, but falling down a flight of game-breaking glitches, buggy mechanics, shoehorned features, and the smallest focus on actual assassinations in the entire series.\n\nI do have to give it credit though, the story they went for was a good idea. Setting up Haytham as the main character only to bait and switch him is clever. The issue was making an interesting character out of Conor, which they downright failed to do. Conor never seems to change gears throughout the entireity of the story, helped by mediocre voicework.\n\n4 times I had to restart the game due to glitches, either being unable to complete a mission or due to the world disappearing around me. Not to mention crashes I encountered.\n\nIn all honesty, just skip this game and go straight to 4. If you're really interested in the story, it's available by Wikipedia or in cutscene form on Youtube. The game itself is not worth the time of day. I gave up on the game after I realized I was still going through what was essentially tutorials 8 hours into the game.","March 26, 2014","false","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is my new favourite game in the Assassin’s Creed series. The story, the characters, the evolution of the game from start to finish is just so well done.\n\n18th century colonial America is a fascinating period in history and Assassin’s Creed 3 does well to showcase major events whilst maintaining its own original storyline. The fusion of what supposedly happened and what actually happened are blended so well together. The open ended level design is also very appealing to me. There’s so much to do, so much to explore, and so many people to meet, it’s great! I genuinely feel like I’m visiting 18th century America.\n\nWhat really stood out for me was the new and improved free running. In previous games, the player could move through predominantly urban environments. In this sequel, the wilderness becomes your playground and you can move through trees and scale up cliffsides! I love this new system of movement as it opens up a whole new environment for the series to explore and experience; an environment where you can hunt, ambush, trap, and stalk your enemies.\n\nThe core gameplay/combat are great fun too, with plenty more finishing moves and plenty new weapons to use. There are neat gameplay features that have been added for the more modernized combat, such as using a human shield to block gunfire. I like how Assassin’s Creed 3 has adapted its gameplay rather than just rinse and repeat from the previous title. Ranged weapons play a much stronger role and can really make a difference in battle.\n\nAlright I’ve said more than enough. I’m glad I got this game, I’ll be playing it for a while :)\n","March 28, 2013","true","37.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

It's so foolishly ambitious that it trips over ever flaw it could possibly have, not stumbling, but falling down a flight of game-breaking glitches, buggy mechanics, shoehorned features, and the smallest focus on actual assassinations in the entire series.\n\nI do have to give it credit though, the story they went for was a good idea. Setting up Haytham as the main character only to bait and switch him is clever. The issue was making an interesting character out of Conor, which they downright failed to do. Conor never seems to change gears throughout the entireity of the story, helped by mediocre voicework.\n\n4 times I had to restart the game due to glitches, either being unable to complete a mission or due to the world disappearing around me. Not to mention crashes I encountered.\n\nIn all honesty, just skip this game and go straight to 4. If you're really interested in the story, it's available by Wikipedia or in cutscene form on Youtube. The game itself is not worth the time of day. I gave up on the game after I realized I was still going through what was essentially tutorials 8 hours into the game.","March 26, 2014","false","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Played the part on the ship, which was decent and made me want to play further but when the ship docked and got to boston i was getting 5-8 fps. I dont have a crappy rig, its actually pretty decent but for what ever reason the game was just unplayable after that. I have found assassins creed games to run pretty poorly in general but this really was pathetic, the strange thing is that in multiplayer i was getting 80fps but the single player section was just broken for me and as a result i wasted my money( bought it for 5 bucks on sale so not a major deal but still).

I cannot say that it is mostly good (most other games in franchise) or mostly bad (Unity), so I will list all points:\nBad or not so good:Lockpicking is an unnecessary addition to the game. As it is done, it only keeps you swearing and repeating the process for a dozen of times just because your hand slipped or the mousepad suddenly ended.\nOf course, other games had some indiscrete missions (like blowing up the chain tower in AC:Rev), but this is the most unstealthy game, here we charge in the middle of the fight, behave aggressively and not practice subtle approach.\nThe only time in the franchise the map doesn’t get revealed via syncing with viewpoints – you have to explore on foot to unveil the fog on your map, and this ‘unveiling trace’ you leave when walking is too thin, thus making the process of getting mementos for exploration obtainable in a very mundane and boring way.\nEncyclopedia of the common man is an interesting element, except for two lazy asses Go and Te, who either chop wood, smoke, fish or do nothing. It was really hard catching them do something useful. Since I wanted an achievement, I had to catch them in the act of doing it.\nSending convoys is not balanced and clumsy. You can not choose to fill the convoy with the same resource. For each slot you must first find the thing you want to send (in the long list of all the stuff), then find the best shopto send it to. Too time-consuming to be fun.\nThe guards in this game seem to posess x-ray vision since they continue to pursue you even if you run away from them. Because of this  and random spawn some occasional fight might turn into a gruesome battle with bodycount of a small village.\nOf all the games in the franchise to include several main cities (AC, AC2, AC:Rev, AC3 and AC4:BF), here cities and villages in the Frontier look completely alike. I know, it is due to the atmosphere and building style of that era, but you do not have that exhilarating feeling of the new area.\nStores now sell everything – weapons, maps, outfit colours. I prefered different shops in Ezio’s saga. Still, it’s better than Unity’s buying in the main menu option.\nThe main plot seems to unravel only with immediate presence of Connor, more so, without Connor it wouldn’t be possible. There is not too many occasions that Connor simply observes or just happens to be close to the event. He needs to make that event happen. Eventually you can grow a little bit tired\nMultiplayer repeats the same movements it already had in the previous game. I get if you do not change low profile kills, but signature kills should have been changed (for those having weapons other than hook or rifle, of course).Good points, making it really enjoyable:Really ‘assassinscreedish’ mission in the beginning of the game with Haytham – despite climbing the balconies n the plain sight, it was really done with style and precision.\nActually, the ability to play with Haytham is a real good twist. Also, I completely agree with Desmond in the end of Act 3, when he finds out that Connor’s dad is a Templar Master, not assassin.\nAnd it brings us to the next point. In this game, first in the franchise, we, as players, can see that it is not necessarily ‘assassins good, templars bad’, sometimes templars do have better and more logical motives.\nAdding the change of seasons was really nice, especially everything animation connected (snow footprints, walking, etc.)\nUnderground network from the inside – now we can see what Ezio used in two previous games. It looks far more logical and story-based than before.\nAssassin recruits now feel more alive and personal than in any game before (just named apprentices) or after (nameless fodder). You do real missions for them, they give you access for special abilities (actually, only ambushing opponents is new, everything else makes up for missing factions like thieves or courtesans).\nFinally, we see Desmond in action. A pity he had to die to save the world and a pity we can not replay his missions.\nReally immersive new DLC, with brand new mechanics. The addition of magic makes the fight more interesting for those who already grew tired of simple slashing. The plot component is also very strong and makes us meet a lot of characters from the main campaign.\nMultiplayer offered Wolfpack mode, which is really great, except for overcomplicated names of hunted targets. Also, really loved the Champion costume packs – both intimidating Bears, Blackwatch highlander or proud Commodore...So, the game has a lot of good points, and a lot of bad ones. It is up to you to decide whether you want to check it out, or not, but I strongly recommend to get first-hand experience.","October 6, 2015","true","257.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

AC3 is a fun entry in the series for a few reasons: the setting is detailed, you get a lot of American history references, most of which flow ...interestingly enough i suppose. Some might see it forced, but I think they integrated it alright. You have an -awesome- naval portion of the game, easily the best part, and, in some ways I think, it's more fun than AC4's naval mechanics. You see a lot of historical figures, there's lots to collect, do, and see, a lot of decent characters...but a lot of dull characters too.\n\nMost characters have good voices, decent stories, but a lot of them lack much depth, and only a few of them stick around long enough to justify any depth anyways. Instead of having a tight core group of characters you have a larger pool of more shallow ones. Luckily, to me, the villains were brilliant and entertaining, and Connor really wasn't as bad as people made him out to be; he was stoic, just not rambunctious and funny like Ezio.\n\nOverall it was a worthwhile entry. Certainly not the best, but definitely worth finishing. The ending for Connor's story was fantastic and emotional...while the 2012 storyline really sucked. It's a game of equalizing pros and cons. For as pretty as it is, detailed and deep, there's also storyline and character shortcomings. If you don't like the colonial period, don't bother though. It's not a MUST-PLAY. But it was still certainly fun enough to recommend\n\nIf you plan to skip it...\nSPOILERS:\nAll you really might need to do is watch a few cutscenes online, if you really care about continuing the 2012/modern day storyline, like the ending and such where Desmond gets fried, since that works into AC4.","May 16, 2015","true","49.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blue_Sal/recommended/208480/","Blue_Sal","BlueSal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blue_Sal/","182 products in account","AC3 in my opinion is where Assassin Creed started to go down hill and every game since AC3 for diehard AC fans like myself has just been a prayer that the next game will go back to its former glory. It might be the fact that I loved Ezio and Altair so much or maybe the game just lost its simple touch that so many of us loved. I do not recommend this game for people who enjoyed the first few games and are expecting this to be similar. However, I do try to make my reviews unbiased so I will base the rest of the review on the game on its own, out of context of the previous games. So this game does have a nice open world environment with seasons changing along the story line to create a real sense of the world revolving. For the students of history, AC3 has definitely put a twist on the players of the colonial period of America. I do admit that I love scaling the rooftops of colonial New York and the vast forests you can explore. Upgrading your Homestead is also a nice feature. Watching your small plot of land grow into a thriving village. Gameplay there are many differences in terms of weapons and the lack of armour sets, which was quite disappointing, although you can change outfits, they are nothing special. The selection of weapons were not really my cup of tea so to speak and I ended up mainly using the hidden blade.\nOverall, the game was a major disappointment and in all honesty the franchise hasn't improved much over the years.\n4/10","February 22","false","38.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I expected something revitalized from the original, some unique concepts or something, but all I got was all the other previous games just skinned over to be in the colonial United States. The only real addition made in this game is the naval warfare, which even that isn't anything great.
