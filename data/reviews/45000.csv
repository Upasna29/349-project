There are numerous uncanny similarities.  That being said, there are many worse formulas to copy than Defense Grid, and I highly recommend this game as well as an excellent entry in the Tower Defense genre (but play Defense Grid first).  It doesn't do a lot to differentiate itself, but it executes well on the basic Tower Defense tropes... tower building and placement, tower synergies, etc.\n\nThe campaign is relatively short, but there are numerous ways to replay the same levels giving it longer legs than it would otherwise have.\n\nIt is a solid tower defense game that deserves attention.

Worried? You should be! Don't despair as you have been issued with an extravagant variety of turrets including shotgun, machine gun, laser and rocket to name but a few as well as a range of support towers to enhance the abilities of neighbouring weaponry. If that wasn't enough to keep you busy, you have a choice of special abilities that can be called in from off map such as fire bombs and nuclear missiles to aid you in your struggle.\n\nI have been loving this game after picking it up in the Steam Sale. It's a simple concept but well executed. The graphics are good for the genre so should be more than playable no matter what system you're running. The multi-player co-op function is incredibly fun as it adds a lot of replay value to the maps and missions although it is still highly addictive going it alone. The hordes vary depending on the amount of players as well as the difficulty level. You can choose from the standard difficulties or an endless assault (my current record on that is 35 minutes!). Personally, I would like the option of choosing a specific amount of waves as there is a not a big difference between the easiest mode and the most difficult in terms of numbers of waves. As a side note, the soundtrack is sublime. This game is worth every penny of the £1.99 I paid for it in the sale and still would be worth it even at the full price of £7.99 (at the time of writing).\n\nIf you love tower defence games, you'll love Sol Survivor!\n","November 30, 2015","true","96.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

I never felt like I wasn't able to identify what each turret's function was even in the thick of battle. I especially like that each type of turret damage is color coded, allowing you to easily spot where areas of your defense may be lacking in certain damage types. Piercing turrets are yellow, concussive turrets are orange, support fields are green and electrical damage is blue. It affords an interesting "temperature" to a fleshed out defense and makes each level a paint-by-numbers process of constructing creep murder.\n\nThe soundtrack is exceptional, and I must take a moment to point it out. It's not heartpounding, thrilling or action-y. You play the role of an ensign, rapidly rising through the ranks in a battle for humanity's survival. The music fits that theme. It's immersive, sad, and desperate. Kudos to the composer, because the soundtrack is amazing and fitting in every way.\n\nSome tower defense fans will balk at the lack of "mazing" or "zoning". Each map already has its path laid out a la the original Warcraft tower defense maps. You simply place your turrets along the path and attempt to capitalize on the various types of damage you have available and the various creeps you are facing. As above, each tower can deal a certain type of damage. This damage is more or less effective against the various types of creeps, so planning your resource expenditure is necessary for a successful defense. Where Sol Survivor lacks the strategy of "zoning", it makes up for it in the addition of support powers. Each field commander brings a variety of support abilities to the table which can either be used to shore up a weakness in your tower selection or to bolster an already solid defense strategy. Your satellite arrays adapt to the support powers you use which allows them to level up over time, increasing their range of effectiveness, power and recharge time. The missions are carefully balanced to allow for this feature, making it necessary to take an active role in combat (rather than simply laying down towers and waiting for enough mass to upgrade or place more).\n\nSol Survivor also features multiplayer co-op, which is mind-blowing. I have yet to see another tower defense game offer up the same, and the fact that it has slipped under the radar is disappointing. You will be hard pressed to find partners (there are rarely any random people hosting an open lobby) but the playerbase is still active and you can find partners on the discussion hub. You can also send me an invite. I'm always willing to play.\n\nAll in all, Sol Survivor is an excellent game. It looks gorgeous, has an amazing soundtrack and it definitely has a story to tell. It may not have voice acting or other fancy features, but the gameplay is solid. I highly recommend it.","January 1, 2014","true","13.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

They really are spitting them out on an assembly line these days.\n\nSol Survivor is one of the better examples though as it takes great care to provide you with a multitude of different play-styles and tactics as well as decent multi-player component although it's a bit depopulated these days.\n\nThe rather long campaign provides you with the option of choosing which commander to play as which in turn changes which turrets and abilities are available to you. Everything from the standard "Gun" turret to nuke silos and booster towers is available to you from the tower side and on the abilities you have simple damage abilities, slowing and stunning abilities and even an ability that permanently sacrifices the power you use to cast abilities in exchange for more resources to build towers.\n\nThe abilities are a big part of the game and where other Tower Defense games like Defense Grid focus on building the most minimalistic defense possible Sol Survivor is all about intelligent tower placement and well timed ability use making it a very thoughtful and tactical game.\n\nSol Survivor also comes packaged with some excellent multi-player modes which in my opinion is one of the most important things in a Tower Defense game. Unfortunately there aren't a whole lot of people playing this online anymore so unless you got friends to play with you might have a bit of a hard time finding opponents and coop partners.\n\nProbably the most intelligent Tower Defense game on steam and definitely one of the best.","November 14, 2012","true","187.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The general gameplay is fairly standard - aliens walk down a path trying to steal your stuff, place towers to stop them, yadda yadda yadda... What makes this game unique are the various "commanders" from which you can select before starting a level. Each commander has their own set of turrets (which are placed once and work autonomously) and special abilities (powers that can be used actively by you during the match). This results in a huge variety of playstyles that are available, which encourages experimentation and replay (in order to find the best combination for certain maps, or whatever suits you best). The game has multiple difficulty levels as well as leaderboards, so if you are into competing with your friends for high scores, this is a good game for that. It also features a co-op mode, so you can play with a friend if you prefer working together (though I haven't tried that mode so can't speak to how it is). On the down side, the game is what I would call somewhat "rough around the edges". I mean, it's not bad or anything, just the presentation, interface and controls could be a bit better. But considering the fact that the game was built by a miniscule team of people, it's quite easy to forgive such minor inconveniences. All in all, this is a decent tower defense title with some unique aspects that is worth the asking price if you are a fan of the genre.

He had an extra copy that he gifted me after we spent a couple hours kicking each other's asses in some Dukematches.\n\nThis is my first "real" Tower-Defense game, and it's a great way to be introduced to the genre.  Before Sol Survivor, my only glimpse into this genre were the UMS "Turret Defense" and "Pylon Defense" user-created maps for Battle.net StarCraft matches (classic, mind you, not II).\n\nThis is an old game by today's standards, but I would consider it and oldie-but-goodie.  However, the multiplayer pool is quite small, so only buy if you intend to play the single-player or have friends who want to play with you.  It's easy to get into, and the music is kick-♥♥♥.  The graphics are also quite contemporary, and I'm rather impressed that a tower-defense game has that much love put into it.  Story is somewhat nonexistent, but it's a moot point when you're watching your towers launch volley after volley of defensive flak to a kickin' soundtrack.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/recommended/45000/","Monukai","monukai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/","1200 products in account","A few days ago I was talking a friend and he had said that "[Sol Survivor] is the pinnacle of tower defense games" or something to that effect...and I have to agree with him. Most would say PvZ, Dungeon Defenders, or Defense Grid, but I really think if most people gave this game a shot they would see where I'm coming from. It's a seemingly simple game, that is more complex than meets the eye, there are many strategies to play around with and it's an amazing learning process, you master the game only through playing around with different builds. Even at 100+ hours I'm still coming up with tweaks to my best strategies, as well as coming up with new bizarre ones that somehow work. Although it's nearly 5 year olds it only shows it's age visually and remains the best true tower defense game I have ever played and I consider myself a tower defense junkie.\n\nThe basics of this game is to place turrets around the paths of the enemies (which is already determined and easy to pick out on the map). Most turrets have pretty good range, so it's easy to make a good choke. Sounds simple, yet surprisingly there is a lot you can do. There is a fairly good variety of turrets and each of them specialize in something, making them all valuable in some way (or you can at least incorporate them all into some solid strategy). It takes time and playing around to really learn the ins and out of each turret. A lot of information is included in the in-game encyclopedia, but even that isn't completely exhaustive. On top of damaging turrets there are also a slew of support turrets that also mix up how you strategize placement and spending priorities. (note: money is gained in-game in different ways depending on what the income setting is set on) Another element of gameplay is the powers, your character has 100 max power. You can only choose so many powers and towers (I want to say about 8 each) every time you play a map, so that's another aspect you have to strategize. Regardless of you what you pick you'll be limited to casting your abilities based on how much power you have, it regenerates over time like mana would, so using your powers efficiently and at critical times is key.\n\nOne argument could be made against my assertion that this is perhaps the best tower defense out there and that is it doesn't feature path building. That's to say you can't influence the path an enemy takes or build constructions, something that is key in games like Sanctum, Orcs Must Die!, and Defense Grid. Admittedly the ability to structure enemy pathing really adds to the strategizing process. At the same time, it can also make it easier (leading orcs to one solidified choke is key in OMD, and in DG the only way to get on the top 10 leaderboards is to bounce enemies back and forth blocking and unblocking sections of your structures), so it's arguable about what's better, I definitely like path building, but even so Sol Survivor still somehow captivates me more than games that allow for that.\n\nI think this is due in part to how relaxing and inviting this game is. There is never a time where I don't feel like playing this, that I'm not in the mood. The game is very laid back, the soundtrack is quite ambient, a lot of the levels are nighttime or snowy levels which means a lot of cool colours (grays and blues). The enemies move a nice constant rate, they aren't ferocious or in your face as they are in games like Sanctum or Orcs Must Die. As mentioned before you do have powers (abilities) but also mentioned before you can't spam them so even the "combat" aspect of the game is laid back. Overall it's a great game to kick back to, especially if you're with friends since you can spend most of the time chatting, both strategizing with each other and just talking about whatever strikes your fancy.\n\nThis game has a good chunk of content, and playing survival in particular has yet to get old. I've played the campaign with friends quite a few times and still always enjoy replaying it. The difficulties are well balanced, you won't be mastering the hardest difficulty anytime soon, and since the survival mode is endless (and it gets exponentially harder) there is never a skill cap where you can essentially "beat" the survival mode. I don't feel like I've said enough about one of the games I love the most, but I'll wrap up by saying if you want a good tower defense game with focus on tower placement and a less active combat role then look into Sol Survivor, and if you're serious about trying it, find some friends you like playing and nag them to play with you, since friends really do make this game even greater than it already is (or ask me).","May 27, 2013","true","170.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each one has a slightly different theme, some of which are orientated towards certain strategies and some towards certain 'flavours' - so one officer emphasises sheer pin-point damage while another emphasises... errr.... fire and heat.\n\nAfter completing the campaign (or rather, acquiring enough medals to unlock all the EXOs), you get a far better option in that you can choose which powers and towers from the full list, but you'd be surprised how hard it is is to put together an effective selection.\n\nTurrets and powers are interesting. You have your basic lasers, machine guns, missile pods etc etc that you'll likely have seen a million times before, plus a few interesting options like pillboxes (machine gun pods that divide their fire between all enemies in range) and various silos (extremely long range, powerful missile sites). Support powers are mainly satellite strikes which range from the obvious (laser beams, missiles, EMP strikes) to the weird (gas bombs, Fear effects, supply drops). There's even a nice encyclopedia to find out about them all.\n\nThe only real issue I have with the game is that it looks a lot deeper than it is. The number of creeps that make up the waves looks amazing and you'd think you need evey bit of your tactical skill to handle the various monsters, cyborgs and robots arriving via ground and air... but in reality, all you have to do is build as many lasers and other air/ground-capable turrets on u-bends as you can and bombard everything you can. You can't alter their path so there's a limit to how much you can actually do on levels, and with the exception of a few levels, they're all basically the same - a few spawn sites, one or two bases for you to defend, and some hilly roads between. It isn't helped by taking place over fairly boring landscapes - you get a desert, lunar, snow and volcanic planets that are functionally identical beyond their colour.\n\nOverall it's worth the sale price I paid. Hardcore TD fans will likely power through it fairly quickly, but its fun while it lasts. It just isn't quite as polished or as deep as stuff like Sanctum 2 and Defence Grid: The Awakening.","February 16, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, if you've played Orc's must die and finished up Sanctum. You might enjoy this one.\n\nIt has several levels where you basically make towers and use abilities from the fleet to help supplement them. It can be a challenge but it's not impossible and there are plenty of achievements to be had. I really wish I could've given the multiplayer a try before writing this but unfortunately the game seems mostly dead as of 2014 in terms of an online following with the internet lobby being completely bare so buy this keeping in mind that it's only going to be a solo experience unless you grab a friend to buy it with you.\n\nAll that said, there isn't too much that sets it apart from other tower defense games.  I enjoy it, but don't expect anything revolutionary.","February 23, 2014","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No matter if you're more into fire-it-up-gameplay or controlling the whole area with more defensive equipment, every commander has an own strategic plan to offer.\n\nThe 3d graphics might appear a little old compared to younger games but is still what I would call bearable.\n\nAnother highlight is the incredibly beautiful composed Soundtrack, which consists mostly of electronic space sounds and melodies which remind of late 80s synth pop.\n\nAll in all a fantastic game!\n","January 6, 2015","true","90.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With a wide range of turret and support options (active support is a crucial component of this game, turrets alone won't do everything), Sol offers several tactical routes to accomplish your goals.","August 30, 2013","true","156.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can recommend it to any fan of the genre who is looking for a different option. The campaign lasts around 10 hours, and when you add survival mode and multiplayer the value for money is good. Turret placement isnt locked to a specific grid, which allows more freedom, but in the heat of battle can also be a bit fiddly. The player can also use support powers to attack enemies or buff towers. There are 26 towers and 19 powers which in theory allows for a wide range of tactics. However the campaign is limited to using prebuilt sets containing 8 of each, and building a custom set of your favourites is only possible in survival. Both modes lack of information about which types of enemies are coming next. Campaign does at least indicate when flying or cloaked enemies are coming, but survival does not. The music is fantastic, but tower sound effects feel flat and the story is also very basic.","November 24, 2012","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each one has a slightly different theme, some of which are orientated towards certain strategies and some towards certain 'flavours' - so one officer emphasises sheer pin-point damage while another emphasises... errr.... fire and heat.\n\nAfter completing the campaign (or rather, acquiring enough medals to unlock all the EXOs), you get a far better option in that you can choose which powers and towers from the full list, but you'd be surprised how hard it is is to put together an effective selection.\n\nTurrets and powers are interesting. You have your basic lasers, machine guns, missile pods etc etc that you'll likely have seen a million times before, plus a few interesting options like pillboxes (machine gun pods that divide their fire between all enemies in range) and various silos (extremely long range, powerful missile sites). Support powers are mainly satellite strikes which range from the obvious (laser beams, missiles, EMP strikes) to the weird (gas bombs, Fear effects, supply drops). There's even a nice encyclopedia to find out about them all.\n\nThe only real issue I have with the game is that it looks a lot deeper than it is. The number of creeps that make up the waves looks amazing and you'd think you need evey bit of your tactical skill to handle the various monsters, cyborgs and robots arriving via ground and air... but in reality, all you have to do is build as many lasers and other air/ground-capable turrets on u-bends as you can and bombard everything you can. You can't alter their path so there's a limit to how much you can actually do on levels, and with the exception of a few levels, they're all basically the same - a few spawn sites, one or two bases for you to defend, and some hilly roads between. It isn't helped by taking place over fairly boring landscapes - you get a desert, lunar, snow and volcanic planets that are functionally identical beyond their colour.\n\nOverall it's worth the sale price I paid. Hardcore TD fans will likely power through it fairly quickly, but its fun while it lasts. It just isn't quite as polished or as deep as stuff like Sanctum 2 and Defence Grid: The Awakening.","February 16, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, if you've played Orc's must die and finished up Sanctum. You might enjoy this one.\n\nIt has several levels where you basically make towers and use abilities from the fleet to help supplement them. It can be a challenge but it's not impossible and there are plenty of achievements to be had. I really wish I could've given the multiplayer a try before writing this but unfortunately the game seems mostly dead as of 2014 in terms of an online following with the internet lobby being completely bare so buy this keeping in mind that it's only going to be a solo experience unless you grab a friend to buy it with you.\n\nAll that said, there isn't too much that sets it apart from other tower defense games.

Relatively free placeable turrets and a variety of weaponry and upgrades with a good amount of different enemies make Sol Survivor one of the cornerstones of nowadays TDs.\n\nThe campaign isn't too hard to play. The different commanders make every single level a recurring challenge, it's fun to try every one of them. No matter if you're more into fire-it-up-gameplay or controlling the whole area with more defensive equipment, every commander has an own strategic plan to offer.\n\nThe 3d graphics might appear a little old compared to younger games but is still what I would call bearable.\n\nAnother highlight is the incredibly beautiful composed Soundtrack, which consists mostly of electronic space sounds and melodies which remind of late 80s synth pop.\n\nAll in all a fantastic game!\n","January 6, 2015","true","90.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has lots of different towers (almost too many), and it has diffferent "commanders" you can choose who bring slightly different sets of towers into each level.  You also have abilities you can summon with a separate set of energy - things like poison clouds, nukes, etc, that let you do direct damage.  There are badges awarded for killing a certin enemy type a certain number of times, or building a certain tower a certain number of times.  These things def give it replayability.  The graphics are nothing special, and you can't make the waves come faster, so it can get slow at parts.  It's hard to explain, but while it had more cool things going for it than say Defense Grid, I didn't like it nearly as much.  Still a solid game though.","September 1, 2013","true","9.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not much to it, honestly what you see is what you get, a tower defense game with a basic economy and powers that allows you to destroy hordes of invading aliens to save your people.\n\nA rather lengthy single player campaign is present but the true strength of this game lies in the coop survival feature. I have personally logged over 50 hours playing with friends and it never gets old. A wide variety of towers are availiable ranging from combat to support accompanied with a large selection of "abilities" used to help turn the tide of battle.\n\nIf you enjoy tower defense games, you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot.","August 17, 2012","true","84.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The entire scenario of "monsters land here and walk along a path lined with guns shooting at them" is of course extraordinarily contrived, but to Cadenza Interactive's credit, their attempt to step outside of the bounds of boring single-pathway tower defence gameplay was realised when they introduced orbital strikes. Fort Condor this is not, but it's still quite good... for a tower defence game.","January 20, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 24 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","3","24","0","0"

While there are a lot of Officers with varying turret setups and powers to use, you can also make a custom Officer, and choose which turrets you want to use.  And you can play co-op with friends, or even in a competetive VS mode, which proves to be quite interesting.","November 19, 2010","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The effects and variety allow for a visually stunning battle across a vareity of fun and interesting maps wach with its own quirks advantages and dis advantages.  each turret and its attack is visually dicernable from the rest for very colourful and entertaining combination.\n\nGame play is simple but with depth each turret has its own advantages and disadvantages.  While there are definitaly beter turrets within the game each does seem to have its own place with in a build allowing for a wide choice in play styles and tactics.\nAdditonally the support options -attacks (such as the orbital laser) and buffs (such as speed and crit chance) etc that allow the player to directly efefct the battle field- add an interesting dynamic allowing players to deal with leaks or weaknesses in thier defence line immediately and reliably while giving them somethign to do while they save mass for that all important t3 upgrade or AoE booster turret\n\nA huge menagerie of enemys'(called Creeps) mean you are constantly on the look out for new problems to deal with and ensuring that you have the tools to deal with them and after a few games you will begin to develope a particular dislike for certain creeps and the dreaded boss waves.\n\nAs for actually playing? get the 4 pack, get three friends with an evening free and get ready for a game that sucks up more time than minecraft with PvE, CooP and PvP all being available for hours of fun.\n\nAnd remember, Its not time wasted if its time you enjoyed wasting. :D","February 25","true","99.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The variety of powers (and ability to create a custom set), the variety of play modes (including different co-op variants), and the nice soundtrack are definitely strengths.  However, my co-op partner and I seemed to be pushed towards a rather simplistic strategy in order to ensure success.  As opposed to creating various combinations of towers to be placed throughout the map, we typically made one area of about 9 towers, bunched together, referred to online as a "kill box."  This strategy proved enormously successful, but led to each map playing about the same.  Locate the area (rarely areas) by which all "creeps" would pass on the way to the goal, and then put down the "kill box." The rest of the map was just watching enemies get obliterated and waiting until we had accumulated enough resources for an upgrade.  It's a nice little title and I don't regret playing it, but I do wish it would have demanded a little more creatively from its players.","June 4","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
