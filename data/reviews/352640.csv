Roguelight is a fun and clever little Roguelike with a light and dark mechanic, hets is a really fun and fast-paced action game, Test Chamber is a cute and interesting puzzle game, and Detective Chirpums is a cute little noir-style adventure game. The only game I disliked was Laza Knitez, which I felt was sorta slow and poorly made. Overall, though, a really great package that is absolutely worth the price.","April 24, 2015","true","2.3"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

Here is what I think:\n\nTest Chamber: After playing some levels, I can say this is, to me, the best game in this package. Very interesting puzzles that require seeing things from different angles, nice Fez-looking characters and clean, cool graphics.\n\nRoguelight: Really nice rogue-like game, which has a very interesting play with light, nice gameboy-like graphics and many upgrades. I've reached level 3, and I plan to try it a bit more to see if I can finish it. You can get this game for free or pay what you want here: http://managore.itch.io/roguelight\n\nDetective Chirpums: The game is mostly filled up with dialogs, with only 3 puzzles and some dialog choices that don't seem to matter much (you just get a different dialog response). It's not a great game, but it's OK.\n\nHets: cool graphics, randomized levels, you get upgrades when you finish a level. Not too bad, but after playing it 44 times, I got bored and decided to never play it again.\n\nLaz Knitez: joust game with shooting mechanics and some weird power-ups. Played it for a couple of minutes (by myself) and quit. Could be nice with friends, but it is boring alone.\n\n\nSo, to sum it up, I think Roguelight and Test Chamber make ths mixtape worth it, specially if you get it at the current discount (80%). If you read this later, make sure you wait for a discount.","October 4, 2015","true","7.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

My personal favorite was the mini-noir-like point and click "Dectective Chirpums" which had a smooth and spicy feel to it, with a story intriguing enough to warrant a playthrough. The art style was also very appealing to my anthro side, with all charachters being birds - in my opinion an under-drawn animal. The other titles on the tape are interesting as well, but I have yet to dedicate as much time to them as Detective Chirpums.\n\nA note with respect to LAZA KNITEZ - It seems many are unsatisfied with that game... I feel you guys are missing the point of it. It's a game that's more for comedic value than sheer gaming brilliance. It's probably not worth it's fraction of the tape's cost, but at a party it can be a fun and competitive title. Ya just need to get a few people together to properly enjoy it.\n\nAnyway, I loved this little gem. Some who are not into the more retro side of gaming might not appreciate this game as much as I, and if you are such a person I'd advise against purchasing this. Reguardless of your taste though, even if you only get an hour or two's entertainment out of it, the Indie Mixtape is still a better entertainment value per dollar than an average movie ticket these days, So why not give it a go!","April 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

So it's hit and miss. Some of the games are good. Some of them are bad. But overall, personally - I believe the bad outway the good (maybe it will change later, I don't know)\n\nI've played them all, and there's only one I liked. The other 4 are bland, repetitive and lack any depth. They have nothing going for them. No story. No fun gameplay. Nothing.\n\nThe only one I liked was the puzzle game which actually has fun puzzles and a good story, the rest are complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nEven the one I liked got bland and repetitive quickly. Seriously. Don't waste your money. I brought this from humble store so I gave money to charity, but man...was this a waste. Even as an indie dev, I can't feel that this is one of those things done for a quick buck.\n\nIt had so much potential, yet it failed to deliver.","April 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 14 of 52 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","14","52","0","0"

Though 4 of them didn't really interest me, Roguelight was fantastic.  It is a mix of Spelunky/Downwell with Rogue Legacy type rogue-lite permanent progression.  Roguelight is a small game, but I had fun learning the secrets of mastering the game and collecting the upgrades.  Well worth getting this bundle on sale for that game alone.","April 15","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
