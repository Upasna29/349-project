I've played some where I spent too much time staring at the screen, waiting for the ball to make its slow way back down so I could painstakingly aim for another brick. There are very few of those moments in Reaxxion; power-ups and unique mechanics keep things pleasantly hectic. The game's graphics are a bit dated, but they still have style. The neon colors are appropriate for an arcade game, and the shapes fashioned out of obstacles are often surprisingly cute.\n\nThere are plenty of levels to play through (165), and it took me nearly 6 hours to beat the game on normal difficulty. I enjoyed myself enough that I'm going to play through again. If you're good at this type of game, you should probably play on hard. I finished the game with about 15 lives left and didn't get a "game over" once. I'm not bragging; this says more about the game's easiness than it does about my ability! If you like arcade games, there's plenty to enjoy here. If you're still not sure, wait for it to go on sale.","December 4, 2013","true","8.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"

What's a little different with this the ball comes out of your liquid metal reserve in your paddle, meaning the length of the paddle is directly proportional to how many balls you have left.    When you run out of liquid metal, you lose a life.  There are also three different sizes of balls you can have in play, which change how many bricks you can break before the ball will bounce.  As you break the blocks, drops of liquid metal drop down and, if you catch them, they cause your paddle to grow.  Catch too much without using it (you can have multiple balls in play), and the paddle will start ejecting the liquid metal all over the place.\n\n...I'm probably making this sound a lot dirtier than it is, but I don't really know how else to describe this without getting really silly.\n\nAnyway, the game has power ups, all of them deal with how the ball destroys the bricks.  Some make you punch through them in a line, others take out a large group at once, others shoot off electricity and hit others randomly.  Their usefulness can be situational.  Finally, there is an area on the stage that, if you get three of your balls into it (it doesn't need to be all in one stage; they seem to carry over), you can create a REAXXION, meaning the balls turn from silver to gold, go from three to five, grow in size, and then shoot out everywhere.\n\nAnyway, while all of that sounds neat (and indeed, it is pretty neat), it has some flaws which made the game unplayable for me.  If you're playing in windowed mode, it doesn't take much for the mouse to travel out of window, causing the paddle to stop moving.  And if you're playing full screen... it still kind of seem to do that.  The other problem is the paddle seemed to stutter quite a bit, which is aggravating when you're trying to bounce the ball back.\n\nSo yeah.  Good concept, but those issues make it a poor execution.","July 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Similar to a classic pinball table, aiming your shots for specific regions of the game board yield bonuses and powerups, encouraging strategic play.  Unfortunately the title is marred by a lack of native controller support, as well as no widescreen display features.  The unfortunate result is a game that, while fun for awhile, cannot compete with more polished arcade Breakout games like Shatter.  Pick this game up if you love the genre or can get it at a bargain price, but expect an average gaming experience.","March 10, 2012","true","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
