I recommend this for Harry Potter fans only - as you won't understand what's happening if you haven't read the books and seen the movies. The puzzles can get tricky. I got badly stuck quite a few times, but my solution was always the same - destroy EVERYTHING. Maybe this is common idea with LEGO games? I'm not sure, because this is my first. Either way, I immensely enjoyed the artistic style of the world, the somewhat open-world layout, and the hilarious LEGO retelling of the stories. If we had stars to give, I'd give it 5.","February 27, 2014","true","29.1"," 75 of 84 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","75","84","3","0"

It is a bit of a challenge for kids to figure out as it's a problem solving kind of game. I love the uniqueness of the story lines in the Harry Potter series, as they try to not mimic the movies entirely, but create a totally new experience other than the basic plot. I reccommend for older kids and adult fans.","October 4, 2015","true","2.5"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","32","34","6","1"

Both the lego and normal 3D environments have a much higher resolutiion and quality, in addition to the "magic" effect graphics. This coupled with some new gameplay challenges, like duelling, add lots more variety to this game.\n\nAgain, there is no voicing in this game, but it does expand the soundtrack to include music from the later films.\n\nAnother change worthy of note is that this game does not crash intermittently like the first lego hp game. It does however suffer from end-of-level saves only, which means that if the game bugs out somewhere [which it occasionally does] you'll have to restart the entire level.\n\nIf you played and liked the original HP lego game, then you'll definitely enjoy this one.","April 1, 2015","true","13.7"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

Of course, you have to own a controller, because the game is, in my opinion, unplayable without one. But if you`ve got that figured out, there is nothing between you and an amazing game.\n\nIt brings together two of my favourite game genres, Open World Exploration and "Collect `em all" type games, similar to most other LEGO games. However, the levels are enjoyable, the cutscenes wonderful and TT manages to get me through Sirius`s death scene without crying, so that is definitly an accomplishment on their part!\n\nI have 100% this game twice(if you are stuck somewhere, feel free to add me ;) ) and I can still lean back and have a good time. Of course, LEGO games have always been family oriented, but if you pick up a friend that enjoys Harry Potter too, you can have a great time no matter your age.\n\nFinally, I`d like to add, that this is a very relaxing game to play, even if you aren`t a Harry Potter fan, and who knows, maybe you`ll even read the books or watch the movies after the game caught your eye. Have a wonderful time playing, if you are on this page already, you might aswell buy it (IF YOU HAVE A CONTROLLER!) :)","December 15, 2015","true","77.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","18","20","5","1"

I wanted  to see how the story would continue, and since this game came out years after the first one, I expected graphical improvements and other nice features. I though this was gonna be another funny game to play. I think that's actually correct, but performance keeps me off this game.\n\nFunny thing is, for a lot of players with low-end graphics card this game runs good. For me, using a Nvidia gtx 980 however, game does not. I played for a few hours, really tried to like this game, but when framerate dips between 60 and down to below 10, it's really hard to do so.\n\nNormally I would just wait to write a review until the problem is fixed, but since this game was released in 2012, I don't think they will ever update it properly. It's sad to see, since the graphical improvements over the first game is great and everything about the dark and gritty wizard world is also nice.\n\nThere is a lack of harry potter games available, so it's sad when the ones available aren't great either. It's even worse when the game has potential, but it dragged down by poor performance. It's a little wierd too, because the first one (released in 2008) runs great on new high-end graphics card.\n\nI got dizzy playing this game so I had to quit it, which sucks, since I really like both LEGO and Harry Potter franchise. I wanna recommend this game, but I really can't do that, unless you are running an old machine or if you have an xbox 360 to play it on.","February 24","false","3.7"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","29","41","5","0"

This game summed up a journey I had been on since I played LEGO Harry Potter Years 1-4 years ago in 2010 on my Nintendo Wii and I must say that this has been a great way to finally finish the adventure five years later!\n\nPlot:\n\nThe game goes through the last 3 Harry Potter books and the last four films. You get to play through 24 levels of magical mayhem, each story consisting of six levels a lesson or two and some free roaming in the open world. Fans of HP and his amazing adventures will be enthralled to see LEGO's comedic twists on the story and to discover references to both the books and the films, from obvious ones like locations and characters, to tiny ones like the objects characters will sometimes hold for a few seconds if you watch them closely ( e.g every minute or so Neville Longbottom will get out a plant, stroke it for a few seconds and then put it away, this is a reference to the Mimbulus Mimbletonia he owns in the Order Of The Pheonix book.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThere is lots of magical gameplay to experience and 7 spells to unlock:\n\nWingardium Leviosa\n\nLumos\n\nDiffindo\n\nAquamenti ( yes I looked it up )\n\nFocus ( The spell Snape uses to get inside Harry's mind in Order of the Pheonix )\n\nExpecto Patronum\n\nReducto\n\nThese spells allow characters to break special objects, levitate things, spray water, create objects out of red brick, light up areas and defeat all sorts of magical beings. There is also a brilliant feature where instead of an 8th spell, you get a special pet, animagus, or just object that that character possesses (e.g. Harry has his Invis Cloak, Hermione has Crookshanks the cat and Remus Lupin has the power to turn into a werewolf ). Another good feature to note is the fact that 5-7 has added duels. This allows you to fight against many characters by using spells you have collected. You must use these to shield yourself, or try to defeat your opponent. These duels are a key part of the 5-7 levels, so you'll have lots of time to prepare yourself for the grand finale: Harry vs Voldermort in Deathly Hallows pt. 2. Between levels you will be able to explore one, two or all three of the main hubs. The main hubs are as follows:\n\nHogwarts Castle\n\nLondon\n\nA small part of the countryside, used to represent Harry, Ron and Hermione's trek in Deathly Hallows Part 1\n\nEach hub has lots to do and extras to collect, for instance, London does not only include the Muggle part, but also The Leaky Cauldron and both Diagon and Knockturn alley. The free roam world does alter depending on which of the four stories you are currently playing in:\n\nOrder Of The Pheonix is a sunny, safe environment with racy, peaceful and happy music.\n\nHalf Blood Prince has a darker environment and Death Eaters can attack you at moments in both the alleys and The Leaky Cauldron. It also has a slightly sadder tune in the background.\n\nDeathly Hallows Part 1 has a rainy and very dark environment with lots of common Death Eater attacks in both the Muggle and Wizarding parts of London. Hogwarts is only able to explore via the Marauder's map and you have to play as Neville, Ginny or Seamus.\n\nDeathly Hallows Part 2 has a dangerous environment before you defeat Voldermort, where Death Eaters attack in London, both the alleys and even Hogwarts. After you defeat Voldermort, the open world becomes safe and sunny with slightly sad music in the background.","May 29, 2015","true","12.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","15","17","4","0"

The boarding school antics have trickled to a halt, classrooms have gone silent, and even Quidditch matches--once the mark of happier times--have fallen by the wayside. In their place, a much darker picture has taken shape, marked by the ever-increasing fear of death. As far as stories go, it's not exactly a walk in the park, but it's nothing that a good Lego sense of humour can't handle.\n\nLike its predecessor, Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7 excels at finding the true heart of the story it is trying to tell, layering this otherwise bleak premise with its own particular brand of cheekiness without sacrificing the essence of J.K. Rowling's world. This is a fun, richly detailed game that rewards curiosity and offers plenty of gameplay variety, making it well worth the effort for Lego and Harry Potter fans alike.\n\nLego Harry Potter: Years 5-7 weaves together events from the final three Harry Potter books and the final four films. Despite the necessary liberties taken to mesh three narratives into one, the game manages to employ a multifaceted structure that is easy to navigate: each of the four chapters of the game is divided into smaller subchapters, each comprising a new part of the story. While the Vita version is a slightly simplified version of the console game (for example, cutscenes sometimes replace extended gameplay sequences, and some activities are different), it loses none of the charm.\n\nThe gameplay is consistent with past Lego games: each short level requires you to complete a series of puzzle-solving tasks using a range of character abilities while knocking down and rebuilding large parts of the environment. There are also myriad side missions, quests, and collectibles. While the game's story moves along with effortless charm, it's the collectible element that adds both variety and replay value.\n\nThere's a certain kind of addictive satisfaction that comes with collecting absolutely everything, and the game rewards this interactivity in a multitude of ways: 200 gold bricks, 24 school emblems, 20 cheats, and the fulfilment of becoming a "True Wizard" stud collector. It's also smart about the way it does this: only a proper playthrough unlocks all the characters and their respective abilities, and given that a lot of the game's environments feature areas and puzzles that are not immediately accessible, this adds a good incentive for a later reexamination.\n\nThe Vita version of the game employs a number of touch-screen controls, which work well for some activities and not so well for others. For example, throughout the game you have access to eight spells, acquired in stages and presented in a spell-wheel system that can be cycled through on the fly, using either the right or left bumper or the touch screen. The game has made things a lot easier by eliminating the need for a lock-on mechanism, meaning you can shoot spells out of your wand to your heart's content or use the crosshairs when there is something specific you want to target. Casting spells with the button controls is simple enough: use the square button and the thumbstick to target and fire.\n\nYou're also supposed to be able to charge and aim spells using the touch screen, but this never works as well as the button layout--the touch screen very often does not recognise where you want to aim the spell, and your character ends up shooting randomly. It's much simpler--and quicker--to use the buttons. The touch screen does come in handy during duelling, however, where you can block spells by simply swiping left or right. You can also use the touch screen to select highlighted objects that can be magicked by holding your finger on the object and then making a rotating motion, which activates the spell; again, this usually proves simpler and quicker with the buttons.\n\nThe addition of Weasley Boxes in the game goes towards helping make the experience feel new; the boxes themselves--which contain numerous joke products providing special abilities for the surrounding puzzles--can be accessed only by members of the Weasley family, making red-haired companions a must in the free-play levels and providing you with an incentive to switch between characters more often. There are also Luna Lovegood's Spectre Specs, which let you see and build with invisible Lego bricks.\n\nAs in other Lego games, there are certain exemplary moments full of well-dressed charm: Dumbledore's botched escape from his office in Order of the Phoenix, Harry's awkward romantic entanglements in Half-Blood Prince, and Snape's grisly death at the hand of Voldemort for the horrendous crime of eating all the muffins. This well-maintained lighthearted tone--a hallmark of all Lego games--is possible here due in large part to the attention to detail paid in the game's design.\n\nThe game's environments are well detailed and contextually accurate, providing a rich backdrop for the action. The cutscenes re-create some of the film series' most inspired moments; the opening scene of Half-Blood Prince is a particularly fine example of this. They succeed in doing justice to the story's darker tone through the expertly crafted flashback sequences which are presented in a striking, sepia-toned aesthetic that reflects the maturity of the source material.\n\nBut it's not all smooth sailing. The loading times can be a bit of a bore, especially since the game requires a substantial amount of time to load even when you're walking in between rooms and scenes. There's also a slight inconsistency with some of the game's smaller tasks, which are inserted at various moments throughout the story but have little bearing on what's happening. This is irksome only during the particularly high-tension moments, some of which are peppered with a number of bafflingly mundane activities, like building a cart or collecting ingredients for a potion. Thankfully, these moments are infrequent.\n\nFor those who aren't ready to say good-bye to Harry Potter just yet, Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7 is a charming way to stay inside J.K. Rowling's magical world a little bit longer. Despite the occasional slipup, the game successfully builds on the original story to offer a simple yet satisfying experience that has depth and replay value. There's enough to engage and have fun with to appeal to fans of Harry Potter as well as fans of previous Lego games.","February 11","true","10.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

To me, it seemed like the storyline was really short and the rest of the game was just tedious work to unlock characters and such.

The Harry Potter games are especially easy to recommend, though, because it plays more like an adventure game than an action game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/204120/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7 is yet another licensed Lego game and a sequel to Years 1-4. As you can masterfully detuct, it's based on the movies of the last three years of Harry Potter. And yes, the last one is divided into two parts in the game too. Developed by Traveller's Tales and released in 2011. Nope, no talking yet. Nope, still never-ever online multiplayer.\n\nIt also was released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, NDS, 3DS, PSP, Vita, iOS. From the main consoles you can guess that Wii has the worse graphics. However PC doesn't come as the best, as it's not optimised and they don't sell DLC for it like for consoles: DLC pack of 10 characters and DLC pack of 5 silly magic to shoot at honest people. It doesn't sound important though.\n\nNDS, 3DS, PSP, Vita and iOS are also interesting to mention. As usual, Traveller's Tales can't decide what kind of Lego game to make for portable systems. Years 1-4 had some kind of isometric fetch quest with characters telling you things in dialog box. Years 5-7 seems to be made from scratch and made itself to be like a cutted down version of main game, while occasionally doing unique things. Single-player, yea. It is however nasty that PS Vita was forced to have as much of content as Nintendo DS, despite being much more powerful.\n\nTechnically, PC version comes with bunch of problems.\nFirst of all, it's not optimized. Many people reported to have low framerates. Some have it only at start of levels, others have it constantly. Be ready that you may not run it smoothly.\nAnd another one is control mapping. The game doesn't remember them and you will have to rebind buttons on each game's launch. I also had a minor glitch where when I chose USB controller the game would show me square characters instead of words like "button" or "axis".\nAt least it doesn't freeze or lose save or make progress impossible like Years 1-4 for some people.\n\nGameplay-wise, yea, it's another Lego game. Casual, can't die, collect-a-thon. That was before characters talked. It still has a hub world of Hogwards and some story missions take place in it instead of separate levels. Mostly for classes. And yes, it's a direct sequel to Years 1-4. It added this fancy magic duel where you just have to attack with same-colored magic as opponent and then button mash to do damage. Though, I must say that magic selection this time around is more fun due to being more varied. They require doing a bit more thing then just moving target over things as game automatically chooses magic for you. Like, there is water-shooting magic.\n\nHowever, this is the one early Lego game that I beat on a single breath, so to say! I liked Harry Potter books a lot and read them all but I didn't remember books 5-7 much at all. As a result, game acted as refresher. As said, characters don't talk, so new people will not understand much and will not find it fun. But oh boy, I had a lot of it, remembering all the plot twists, reminding myself which one belonged to what year and laughing out at all the Lego jokes. It also wasn't complete comedy as there was a bit of drama, mostly thanks to that awesome soundtrack, so it was quite an experience to me personally.\nBut then, I am not sure if it's because the game being objectively better than previous Lego ones or my personal bias in this case. Probably the latter.\nAnd hey, it has a level without wand and a 2D-like fancy-pantsy-artsy stage as well.\n\nAlso can be noted is that this LEGO game pushed graphics up, using by-modern technical standards. Mostly you will see how shadows look awesome on all those lego details. High-quality and clear and superb lighting. Shame about not-so-awesome optimisation though.\n\nAlso, yes, gamepad is recommended.\n\nAnd yes, I still feel that game mixes battle and puzzles nicely. Most often it's puzzle-only, just very few fights. I approve it in casual Lego games. Ok, not "mixes", more like "pro-puzzle". Still approve.\n\nAnyway, if you are fan of Harry Potter and got a friend, try this one. I liked it a lot. If you are not, then ehhhhhh yet another Lego game.","January 24","true","12.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a cause of frustraition, however as this mostly happens in the last part of the game then you don't lose any studs when you get killed which is very suiting.\n\nAs I managed to unlock the x4 multiplier I've managed to get enough studs to afford anything and make completeing this game 100% so much easier.\n\nI really can't wait to play the Marvel Lego heroes game.","March 22, 2015","true","14.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has everything that all of the previous LEGO games have, but it also comes with its own problems. The main one is that it can be incredibly boring. A few of the missions just don't have anything going on with them. No enemies, no plot points, nothing. Then when the game realizes that you probably should have enemies, it spams you with them, so you literally have to stop everything you're doing every few seconds to beat them. It gets repetitive, and shows that the game developers don't realize that there's a big difference between challenging and annoying.\n\nThe makers of Candy Crush also have no idea what that line is, but whatever.\n\nAlso, all of the best LEGO games have humor, or, at the very least, characterize their characters pretty well. They're fun to watch. That is not the case with this one. I didn't really care about any of them.\n\nMost of the levels feel like busywork instead of actual levels that advance the story. Heck, some of the levels in between the levels that weren't really levels were more interesting than the levels we got.\n\nI'd say that, if the game got one more re-write for the story, it could have been a lot better.

Stuttery frame rates on a 4k series I7 tied with a GTX 780ti shows poor optimization (tried with a variety of drivers to the same effect). Also, the story telling just felt off, with both me and my wife (who have read all the books and films) feeling slightly confused about what is going on.\n\nThe other big let down is, a heck of a lot of assets from the first game have been re-used, making the whole game feel like an add on and repetitive. We also managed to get our characters or important objects stuck in scenery, and unable to progress revealing game breaking bugs. Having to restart a level a third time because of this lowered the fun levels deep into the frustrating.\n\nCompared with newer Lego titles like LOTR, this game holds no candle. Buggy, un-optimized, rehash feel that has no chance of me ever going back to get 100%.\n\nWould only recommend to die hard fans, and even then only just. For everyone else, there are much better games in the family co-op genre out there. 6/10","June 28, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's nothing specifically awful, it's just that every aspect of gameplay feels slower or has little niggles that make it more awkward and interrupt the flow of destruction.\n\nI wanted to get all the collectables in the first game, this one just felt like a chore.","March 4","false","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was so looking forward to this game after the amazing years 1-4, but I couldn't even get past the second scene without giving up.\n\nMy problems:\n- which idiot decided to change the control settings from game 1 to game 2???\n- everything that's within a few steps from where you are is blurred............. and gets unblurred when you get closer........... talk about a migraine trigger\n- the camera changes angles at the most inconvenient moments :X\n- Harry has conveniently forgotten all his spells from years 1-4 except for one, even the ones gotten through the storyline.......\n\nHonestly, this game should have been a breeze and enjoyable after getting the hang of years 1-4, yet I feel like I'm playing a completely different game, which is not quite what I was expecting. The blurring thing and the changing camera angles is a serious deal-breaker.","February 19","false","0.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoy the recent push to make the game more about exploring places, such as Hogwarts and London, rather just than completing levels. This really makes the games more fun and interesting in large worlds such as: LOTR and the Marvel Lego games.\nToo bad this one is based off the movies and not the books. Some of the levels seem pretty trivial and pointless, but the later HP books and movies could be a little too dark for a Lego game.\nThese make a fun playthrough if you read the books and/or watch the movie at the same time that you play the games, just like with years 1-4.\nDefinitely recommend","April 4","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Go through the stories of Order of the Pheonix, Half Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2. Everything this time around is better, the spells are more pretty, the graphics now has Shaders, less loading times and bigger levels, Play as a multitude of characters just like the last game and more!\n\nThere are more gameplay features and characters have more unique options to complete a level. This is a very fun and great game if you loved Years 1-4, this game has the fantastic updated soundtrack making you experience wonderful memories of watching the movies or reading the books.\n\nThis game however deals with darker themes but it does sugar coat it with it's hilarious cutscenes of lego. Must have if you love Harry Potter, Magic or anything fun.","May 9","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
