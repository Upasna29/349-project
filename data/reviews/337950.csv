This is amazing and there are too few games doing this sort of system these days.\n\n2) PvP to the nth power. if you're not in town, you're fair game. But death is not horribly penalized, so its okay.\n\nThe things I didnt:\nThe Developers are thus far, actively fixing the issues listed below, the review will be regularly updated as is appropriate.\n\n1} A trip into the wastes will net a new, lowbie player between 200-600 Coins. Leather armor costs 88,500 coins per piece. No. Huzzah! I'm being told that this is not so bad as it was previously and that there is potential for big finds and that the general rate of earning has been evened out!\n\n2) Crafting items requires materials (Makes sense, right?) but what you scavenge in the wastes are not the materials you need to craft items.. No, you scavenge the materials you need to make the materials you need to make items. This would be fine if I didnt need to make dozens of individual parts, each taking up at minimum a minute and a half of my time EACH. No.\n\n3) You get the pellet gun pretty early on after doing a few quests, unfortunately, it's completely worthless since the starter shotgun has the ability to do dozens of points more damage and is, for some reason, just as accurate. In fact, all weapons seem to have roughly the exact same accuracy. No.\n\n4) The english translations are misleading and faulty, telling you lies that ultimately end up wasting your time.\n\n5) The game would be better WITHOUT the voice acting. I would rather read the text than hear these people speak. It is HILARIOUSLY awful. No, really, The voice acting in this game makes the voiceovers from Oblivion sound like a choir of angels. No. ♥♥♥♥ no.\n\n6) Your inventory is limited by your strength, this makes sense, sure. But seeing as I literally cannot hold enough materials to craft a large majority of the items, this is pretty much game breaking. This issue is alleviated slightly by being able to place things in storage and just craft from there ... Oh wait..\n\n7) There's absolutely no form of bulk storage whatsoever. Huzzah again! The Developers have added bulk storage. This also somewhat helps to alleviate the rigors of point 6 and makes it not such a glaring issue.\n\n8) The game is only vaguely playable, but there is already a premium shop.\n\nThere is more to be said about this game, almost all of it negative. The concept behind everything would be amazing, in fact it would be a blast if any other part of it had been executed in any reasonable fashion.\n\nI understand that this is an Alpha, but this game is not in an Alpha state.. All of these flaws should have been uncovered by a few hours of internal play testing by the developers.\n\nI was excited about this title, but I can now say without doubt that you've made a genuinely terrible mistake in releasing this game in its current state. Chances are, any hope you had of generating a good early buzz around it are now completely gone and you've forced yourself into a long, grueling, uphill battle if you choose to persevere.\n\nGood luck and I hope you have an ace up your sleeve. You're going to need it.","April 16","true","3.3"," 489 of 516 people (95%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","95","489","516","60","17"

But I was enraptured by the desolate Fallout feeling, and decided to give it a try. And boy, did I wish I didn't.\n\nNo, my last few days playing the SKIES wasn't without its share of game-breaking updates. No, I didn't coast through my playtime entirely happy. Yes, the last update prior to being fixed made me want to throw my entire gaming system in the direction of the game developers, hoping the rage will propel it further than a few feet.\n\nDoes any of that actually matter? No, because as soon as the problems arose, in only three hours, the devs were working on a fix. Less than 24 hours later, it had been fixed. And on top of that? They offered to restore the inventories of all the players who lost something to this update, manually. That's unimaginable customer service that few of us can even wish for, in the day and age of triple A games throwing post-launch day 1 DLCs that require you to pay again for the game that you just bought.\n\nSo, give it a try, why not? You may find yourself wandering the wastelands for hours, cheering and screaming profanity. But I don't regret the time I spent on this game, at all.","April 21","true","68.4"," 117 of 131 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","117","131","11","3"

So yes, the game isn't finished and that brings me to my second thing. EARLY ACCESS IS FOR THE DEVELOPERS TO KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE GAME SO THEY CAN FIX IT. You should never expect a game in early access with no flaws, that is what early access is for. That the game has many bugs in it is because it is in early alpha, not ealry beta. So its theyre choice to put it out here so they can know faster what is wrong with the game and fix it.\n\nif i had to rate it it would be in this state a 5.5 out of 10. But i will stick with it simply because it is still early alpha and can achieve great things.

(PLEASE READ REVIEW BEFORE SKIPPING)\n\nOkay so The SKIES is a mmorpg set in a post apocalyptic style wasteland. The game has heavy focus on crafting and PVP. There us not much to say other then it feels and plays like other games such as Fallen Earth. It's been years since I've played Fallen Earth so maybe that's not the greatest comparison.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\nLOTS and I mean LOTS of bugs!\nOpen world PvP - YEP, no hand holding, grab your guns, your wives, and your kids because this is a harsh world! ;)\nHeavy crafting, lots of items in this game are obtained through crafting or paying merchants.\nClans - Clan warfare which involves guarding and protecting players run cities, that's the impression though, don't believe player cities are implemeted yet.\nSemi interesting NPC's and quests.\n\nWhat not to expect:\n\nDO NOT, and I seriously mean it. Do not expect a finished game.... this game has ♥♥♥♥ tons of bugs, the developers are actively working around the clock. Since ALPHA launch the game has seen a dozen patches. Most of which have further broken the game. Not compeltely to the point of no return, you can still play and run around. Farm materials and kill other players.\n\nMy verdict: 6/10\n\nSo far solid 6/10. I think the game has great potential. As it stands there way too many bugs that will make most players shy away from the game and not touch it with a 10 ft. pole. However it is a free game and there is content to be enjoyed despite the awful state it's in. If you like PvP then thats a huge plus, besides who doesn't like to run around with a gun and shoot little 12 year olds? ;)\n\n(Will revisit game once in more stable state and will UPDATE review)","April 23","true","83.0"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","45","51","6","0"

It seems it will end up being an MMO cross between Mad Max and Fallout. Hopefully the hacks and exploits can get resolved before the game gets so toxic it is over before it even has a chance to begin. Players will kill you as soon as you move out of a safe zone, which are few and far between. PvE outside of a safe zone is pointless, as you will get sniped and killed by someone just for fun.\nThat being said, the game currently has massive cheating going on. You can get one shotted by someone who is not even on your map screen. I moved in all four directions out from the safe zone and was killed by the same person the instant I stepped out of the safe zone every time. The respawn point had dozens of other players, all apparently being killed at the same time by the same player.\nNPCs can throw grenades farther than your rifle can shoot. Hackers and NPCs can shoot through walls, floors, and ceilings at a whim. Currently no in game system for reporting bugs/exploits/cheaters.\nCrafting needs a lot of work still. You need a tech level of 9 to create component items that are needed to make a tech level 1 item. Crafting of subcomponents takes extraodinarily longer than it should.\nAbandoning a broken quest is an automatic fail with NO CHANCE to go back and pick it up again and retry. This can potentially break an entire chain of quests.\nThe game is listed as being in early alpha stage. If actually true, then there is time for all of these things to be fixed. Patches seem to be happending quite often, but with little to no data log to show what has all been changed. Radiation was added without warning, and there is no indicator for a radiation zone until you character is already being affected by it.\nAgain, the game has loads of potential, but I would not recommend at this time.Give the developers a chance to get the hackers under control, or you will just be fodder for their exploits.","May 14","false","57.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"

Well im glad i did I had a lot of fun playing over the last few days of playing. It took me a while to get to grips with how things work but after around 8 hours of playtime I've got to grips with it and i think I'm going to play a lot more.\n\nI had a few issues on how things worked along the way so i posted on the forum for help and got good help from the community and even the devs were even quick to comment to help me.\n\nLet me tell you one thing this game is no way pay to win and i am very glad about that, the only thing you need to pay for is an premium account which gives you bonus xp and in game cash. In the next couple of days i will be buying a premium account as i think the game is worth it and the devs have shown that they care about what the community want and they take time to read the comments on the forum as they did mine.\n\nAll in all a solid game with no major bugs which i hope is going to last and turn into a great free to play game.","April 28","true","63.8"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

Being free to play is nice, but not when a game is obviously built around wanting you to purchase a membership.\n\nI loaded up the game. Everything looked like it was being put through some sort of filter.\nI am unable to change the options yet, instead I am forced to pick a realm and create a character, not the worst thing.\nI want to be female, unable to be female!\nI make the blackest avatar I can and I only look like i'm mexican in game. Is dissapointed.\nFirst thing that happens in game you get out of bed in 3rd person mode.\nAnd good lord are you ever the most muscular person in the world.\nIf someone needed to pose for the picture next to word beefcake, it would be your character.\n\nTutorial quests are alright, voice acting literally makes me burst out laughing. I can't stop laughing at how close the scripts must have been to these voice actors faces....because sometimes they read things literally, and sometimes, normally the better voice actor, will sort of paraphrase.\n\nYour family keeps calling you stupid... and people in game refer to each other as Doctor, Aunt, Uncle, which would be alright, except they say things like, "I must care about him, you know, Doctor is a good man." They use the word doctor as if it was his name, and not his title.\n\nAlso the tutorial would be awesome if it actually taught you something about the game, besides what every other PC gamer knows how to do, Oh push E to repair a flipping fence? Oh ♥♥♥♥ DAWG, that's innovation! All the little intricacies within the game are to be read online on some sort of wiki, not because that's not important information, but more because it's just not there.\n\n\nGet out of tutiorial phase looking forward to seeing what they throw at me next. There's a silly guy calling me "good person" dying on the ground, begging for help. I say i will send back a hit squad or something and roll into town. I ask around for the vendors, and get told to go to the south part of town.\n\nThere I pick up a few quests, and find the town armorer, Barias. He tells me I look too terrible, in some kind of well voiced accent, and that I should make myself some clothes. So I do that.... so now I have to wait for fourty minutes to my clothes to be made, and I find the weapon smith, and pick up the quest. It tells me where to go, and I head out to find about five or so bandits.\n\nI kill a few with the super powerful shotgun, and see a person with a red name. I try to inspect him, wondering if that meant he might be a bandit, or turned on pvp for the overworld, when, blam, he shoots me once and kills me. Well thankfully you don't lose items, only durabilty on equipped items and experience. Experience is kind of a pain, but that's when it hit me. I finally get back and scav for wood and other stuff, to get my new rifle, the gun I was looking forward to using. I come to find it shoots stones... at much less damage then the shotgun, from pretty much the same range. Also they gave me about 60 shotty bullets to start with, comparatively to the bumber, which i would have to restock on ammo. So no brainer there, i immediately dequip my brand new shiny quest item, and strap on my rustic....noob starter...shotty... wait....what... that's just... insane...\n\nGetting money doesn't seem like it would be that bad, I went out into the wastes, and scavenged up about 1400 bucks. But... guns cost multiple tens of thousands of dollars, and are only bought from at a tiny fraction of the price.... this crazy discrepency in prices is rediculous.\n\nAll of this brings me to my next point. At this point in time, this game is a money and time sink. The timers, the PVP all the time, the long lists of items upong items needed to craft other items, in order to craft weapons, the prices of things to buy them from merchants, the complete lack of a help system, a lack of balancing in weapons, how injuries work, everything.... it feels as though the game wants to make it as difficult for you to progress as it can, despite the fact they want you to play it.\n","April 16","false","1.3"," 72 of 117 people (62%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","62","72","117","14","2"

In the stage the game is at right now, however, it is very buggy and it can bring a lot of frustration. The A.I bugs a lot, the quests bug a lot, the aggroing is weird at times and the shooting between player and NPC is weird to say the least....I had to spend some time in game to get used to it but I am attributing that to the fact that this game is still early alpha.\n\nAll in all, if this game is treated well and given proper attention, it could be one of the best games ( in my opinion ) that I would have the pleasure of playing in a long time.

I learned after that to not touch the guns, meanwhile in the corner of my eye a chicken appeared. I knew what i had to do at that point so i chased the chicken as a naked guy to kick the chicken. I had accomplished my goal quickly, then i seen a pig so of course i had to kick that too to kill it. The pig gave no resistance to me kicking it, once it died i seen i had a quest to do finally i thought to myself this was my adventure time! this is my moment!

I do believe this game has great potential and backed up with these amazing devs I believe it'll be come a great game. I do wish the developers would instead of having the premium service, have cosmetics similar to path of exile.

The game's open world pvp can be a turn off for some as a lot of people are worried of being ganked without reason, (See Mortal online) however it does not really matter much as from what I can understand, nothing is lost on death, besides durability which by it self degrades with continual weapon and equipment use. The trade system can also be a little confusing at first as it can have some first time players who may have played games such as fallout and fallout 2 in the past believe that it works like fallout's barter system, however the difference text in this game defines how many coins you will either obtain after trade or lose after trade. The optimization is also pretty buggy near big towns and server shutdowns are regular occurances. The exit to the starting area also tends to be camped by PK'ers attempting to test their luck. However I can definitely see some potential in this Early access Early alpha game even though I am not much of a fan of the open pvp idea.\n\nPros\n-----\n- Combat is pretty solid at the time of this review.\n- Wasteland 2 style wasteland.\n- Both FPS & TPS cameras.\n- Instanced PVP match making for those not wanting to be tagged as killers in the open world.\n- Attention to detail with dialogue choices based on intelligence.\n- Crafting system\n- Town based safe zones\n- PVP world map capture points for clan based PVP players.\n\n\nNeutral\n--------\n- Open PVP can be a turn off for some.\n- Constant server reboots for bug fixing.\n- Casuals need not worry about dying in PVP due to kept inventory.\n\nCons\n------\n- Audio for weapon reloads finish quicker than the actual reload timer.\n- Bad Optimization near cities.\n- Framerate feels capped though I don't see a V-sync option in settings.\n- A bit buggy as a given for Early Alpha gameplay.\n- First person camera has a head bob that can not be turned off.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nRecount of first hour of Gameplay\n---------------------------------------------------\nI create my character, looking a bit bland as the character creator is no where near complete. I then spawn into the farm where all new players go. I wake up and get out of bed, I talk to the MC's uncle and then proceed to loot the wardrobe for fresh clothes as I move to the kitchen, I loot all the weapons and equipment from the starter area and move complete all the starter quests, I leave the farm, shotgun and knife (Which I had to level up cold weapons to equip) in hand. Upon leaving the farm I load in to the sounds of gunshots and running, I notice a white name plate player next to me firing at another white name plate, given my good samaritan status that I feel the need to uphold I fire my shotgun into the back of the firing player, this kills him instantly and gives me the killer debuff turning me into a red-tag player for the next hour. I run to town trying my best to avoid all the PK'ers that were waiting to hunt me and other new players down. Upon entering the town I fail to find a job or anything else to do, so I sit at the gate and watch passerbys while recounting my stats and currency. I notice two white players running together away from the gates, a few moments later a red-tag wearing armor follows the two white players. Given my experience with Day-Z I knew what would happen if he caught up to them, so naturally with my dexterity build self, I chase him down but not before waiting for him to get into the open. I fire three shells into him, the second shell missed, he dies and I gain 6xp. The announcement for a server reboot to fix a bug with the job system occurs and I run around for a bit collecting mushrooms before returning to town. The server shuts down for the next 15 minutes and I think, what a day.","April 17","true","6.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

But, this game isn't very "noob" friendly. Starting in, the tutorial will get you to around level 2, maybe 3 if you milk it. After that, it sends you right to a town. I haven't been following the story very much. Now, here is the pickle. There is only 2 mobs that you can actually kill regularly, fairly low level, but they both will kill you in a few hits. Scarabs, and Dogs. That's going to be your bread and butter for a while. Raiders are also just right outside the starting town, they give you decent exp compared to the other mobs. But, raiders, without armor are very hard to fight, you can just shoot them from afar, not alerting them. Which is a good strategy. But, the good 'ol shotgun works better, but they also have guns. They shoot faster, and hit harder then you. So, prepare to die in 3 or so hits.\n\nThen if you decide to travel to the next area, the scarabs are a much higher levels, but don't give as much loot as the starting area scarabs. But, give almost 10x the exp. So, that's the trade off.\n\nSo, if you don't mind a grind, this game is for you. If you want a challenge, this game is for you. If you wanted to ever play a game of Rust and fallout mixed, this game is for you.","May 26","true","2.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No idea if it is the client or the servers or my connection but I will for sure retry this game because I like it.\n\nCrafting is done in two steps, resources -> materials -> products.\nYou can harvest resources with your hand, not sure if you get more or it is faster with tools.\nI got stone, wood, clay, berries and wheat with my hands, just use "e" and wait half a second until the harvesting is done.\nThe shot gun in the tutorial is nice, you can kill more than one dog with one shot, you get leather and meat from these dogs and can start crafting things.\n\nCrafting takes a very long time. They will change that I am pretty sure.\n\nWhatever, the game is in pre alpha, it just started to be playable for us, I like it!","April 17","true","1.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It took me some time to understand what I do in the beginner's\nfarm, I think it can easily be improved as the only need there is abit more instructions, also displayed on the main screen with no need to jump to the journal everytime.\n\n2) Open World - the whole area outside of Kimary (starting town) is PvP forced, which is pretty annoying if you try to do a quest and you get killed by people who don't really know what to do. I think that there should be an option (or chat command) that will flag you as PvP.\n(Dev's updated)\n\n3) Quests - partially same as the quests part in "1)", however, I find it hard to know where you actually should go if it's a open world quest, and the NPCs don't actually send you to a specific place. If they send you to a specific place, adding a marker on the map would be helpful.\n(Dev's updated)\n\n4) Repairing Items - When I try to remove an item from a outfit slot, it won't actually remove it in the free-roam, making it not able to be fixed, as a NPC who repairs the items won't repair because it can't identify the items.\n\n5) Map - Zooming in/out is reversed. Map won't show all the NPCs (foes or excact location of merchants). Being able to place your own marker would be helpful as well, to know about specific locations that you discovered and want to use for later times.\n\n6) Visibility - It's not long enough, as only when you see a enemy foe - it will start chasing / shooting at you, but only the mini-map is useful for it, but what you can see in the mini-map you don't always see on the game.\n\nThere are also some little things that may help by animation, but I don't think they are crucial\nfor the game.\n\nBy overall, it's a nice game, and I expect it will be great as if the dev's will keep putting time into it with frequent updates\nas they done in the first early alpha day.","April 18","true","11.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","4"

The story seems good (up to my point), and the partyplaying really did have a good advantage in getting this game, so that when you play with friends it is entertaining. Weapons are kind of repetitive at the beginning of the game (you can find the starter weapons literally EVERYWHERE around you), and SIDE QUESTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PROGRESSION IN THE GAME AS WELL, as they will help you to level-up –better gear, help you even travel across the map.\nIF YOU HAVE A LAPTOP, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST THE RECOMMENDED, NOT MINIMUM, SPECS AS EVEN THE RECOMMENDED SPECS ARE QUITE LOW.\nOverall, I would rate this a 8/10 (for now).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donnus/recommended/337950/","donnus","don","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donnus/","125 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe SKIES is a 3rd Person Open-World MMORPG set in a sandy, post-apocalyptic landscape with a nonlinear storyline and the ability to do whatever you want.\n\nWhen The SKIES is loaded up, players can start off by customizing a character to what suits them. Compared to other games the character customisation is extremely limited, with only tattoos, face shape, eyebrows, eye colour, hair colour and skin colour as the only variables with only a few options for each. There is also only the option to make a male character. I would definitely like to see more character customisations as this is a key factor in MMORPGs.\n\nThe SKIES starts you off with a bit of a story. Spawning in a small settlement, the tutorial phase is just a few quests with your parents before you leave towards Kimary and start the game for real. The tutorial is extremely short and doesn’t really give a good introduction to the game. For me, when I left the tutorial zone, I was lost as to what to do and confused as to what my options were.\n\nI could only really start ‘enjoying’ the game and doing quests when I realised (with a bit of help from some players) that there was an order in which you had to do the quests in. Although lots of people were marked as quest givers, only a few were available. This threw me off a bit.\n\nThe SKIES is ridden with bugs, but this is expected as it’s a beta game. A few bugs that I found were animals spawning halfway in the ground and textures for players not loading properly. I also found the walking animations to be slightly off. When you jump, the running animation does not start instantly when landing and also some objects that you shouldn’t be able to step up can be climbed, this causes for a weird animation the character just seems to float up the side of the object. Conversely, probably the most simple of bugs but the one having the biggest impact on gameplay means walls can be looked through if pressed up against it. People can use this to their advantage to find other players and I definitely think this is a bug that should be fixed in the near future.\n\nHUD overlapping: http://i.imgur.com/73neXjO.png\nUntextured player: http://i.imgur.com/pN5Bodm.png\nAnimal in the ground: http://i.imgur.com/cUFJL2i.png\nLooking through walls: http://i.imgur.com/v4uF9Js.png\n\nThis might just be for me, but also, my game always seems to crash when I try to close it.\n\nThe game also seems really grindy. When you start off, you literally start with nothing other than a bump, a small gun that fires stones and does near to no damage. Masses amounts of in game money are needed to buy any good equipment, and even when you do get it, you need a high level in order to use it.\n\nThe easiest way to get stuff is to buy it with your real money, otherwise it’s really grindy. Or, a cheaper option: just find a website that’s giving away codes and just get a bunch of them. This way you get a bunch of free items without having to do anything!\n\nCompletely unfair.\n\nDespite the map being immense and filled to the brim with other players and entities, the game is well optimised compared to other games of the same style. It can be run easily at 40 frames per second with near to no choppiness. There are many graphics options to enable less powerful PCs to run the game, but don’t expect any old, low end PCs to run the game as it still requires a half decent computer at least.\n\nPlaying by myself, I found the game difficult to have fun on and almost tedious in the way that the gameplay is laid out. I can see how this game can be fun, but without friends I don’t really see where the gratification comes in. I know the idea of the game is that there is no clear objective and you’re free to do what you want, but this almost makes the game feel pointless and I struggled to get into the game. I spent most of my time running around, getting confused, getting lost and dying to random scarabs.\n\nDespite this, I see that there is definitely a good game hidden behind the grind and confusion. In my opinion, this is a game that can’t really be played on your own. I really like the idea and it is probably a game I could see myself playing with a few friends.\n\nNevertheless, it’s ridden with bugs and not fun.\n\n3/10","May 27","false","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I don't know if I recommend this game or not, in all honesty, I mean, it's a good concept, but..\n\n\nThe aiming is literally worse than anything I've ever seen, I can't shoot a scarab 3 feet in front of me unless I aim at the ground?\n\nNot to mention I spend 95% of the game walking backwards because ALL of the mobs are faster than me only slightly, and I have to shoot them before thye can get to me, which, they can hit me from like 5 feet away with their tiny claws(??)\nusable Iron Sights would be a huge plus, but no, it's typical side scoping most games seem to think is acceptable for using guns, becasue yes, everyone aims down the side of their gun and leans forward a little instead of using the Iron Sights, because why would you want to do something as silly as use those, right?\n\nI got sniped by a player the same level as me and he was almost a speck in the distance, he killed me in one shot without any misses or issues, just turned around and bam I was dead, and I can barely shoot a few feet ahead of me, let alone do any decent damage, inb4 I am a rifle build, and my rifle does literally ♥♥♥♥ damage, a lot of improving is needed, mostly with the Aiming and lest not forget, Melee combat, try to swing at someone and go straight through you as they turn around instantly and wack you in the back, boom, dead, get stuck in rocks and fall through phantom objects, all in all this game needs work, I mean it's early access so it's understandable but some of these issues are basic whne the game first was made they should have been fixed, like the grand lack of Iron Sight usage, and the aiming incapabilities, I do hope to see this game go far, it is fun, hopefully the female char will come out soon and it won't be manlandia anymore,\n\n\nThe Computers have an uncanny ability to know exactly where you are at any given moment, I was sneaking through a house and heard endless gunfire, come to find out ALL of the enemes, 3 stories ABOVE me who had no way of knowing  was there, were aiming straight down and shooting at where I was standing, 3 stories down, and the dogs will find you, no matter what, they will find you.","April 30","true","2.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It really lets you explore and be creative about how you want to do quests. The only problems I have with the game currently  are that the game is poorly optimized, the servers lag on occasion, and you cannot aim down sights. However, I will definitely be giving this game a thumbs up, because it has truly "wowed" me for an early access game that came out on Steam 3 days before this review was written :D","April 19","true","4.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Major improvements in last updates great awesome job. 1 last thing what everybody wants in-game is marketing items in steam market would change things since thats what everybody wants and now without it almost semms pointless we want some 2 show 4 it and make cash and trade is what gives it more meaning upgrades build combine mods workshop if u can cause thats what most games are missing so keep it in mind\n","May 4","true","3.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The landscape for alpha and beta has changed a lot in the last several years and this game is what alpha's truly used to be.  It's pretty rough right now, by no means even close to finished.\n\nI can't recommend this for anyone looking for a new shiny stable MMO, there are still way too many issues to resolve.  Having said that, this game has the foundation to be one of the best MMOs that I've ever played.\n\nBiggest issues for me right now:\n\n1) Tutorial is very sparse and the confusing dialog doesn't do that any favors\n2) The few fights that I tried, I got owned pretty badly\n3) The dialogue and voice acting leave a lot to be desired.  To the point that they shouldn't have even bother recording voicework for the game yet if they intend to replace what's already there, and believe me they need to\n\nPositives:\n\n1) Lot's of dynamic gameplay potential.  There were lots of items to pick up and use.  Reminds me of Fallout or Elderscrolls games in that regard\n2) Very interesting stat and progression system\n3) For an alpha, it actually looks and plays pretty well\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend it for someone who wants to keep up with it as it gets better, but not for someone looking for a new finished game.","May 15","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

That’s a pleasure to hear only good things about first project of «young» developers. My comrades are really satisfied, so do I. they taught me how to play here, what should I do and etc. What can I say about the game itself?\nPros:   1) Really nice graphics and design of characters.\n2) Kind and helpful community. When I played alone, I found that not only friends can help you. That was nice \n3) It is a game in early access, but there is really low level of bugs. My friends said sometimes they meet it, but I didn’t meet it still.\nCons: 1) Game is still not so popular, I’d like to see more players.\n2) Many patches to download!

I had second thoughts about downloading it . You might aswell say I have perfect hindight .\nSo the game finished downlaoding and we jump in . We customize our character with the three face selections we were given . You spawn at a farm with your aunt and Uncle and they give you some quests with one of the best voice acting you can get . I lied . The chat is very lazy it makes you think that your character has a mind of a 13 year old American Teenage girl .. "Ughhh ... mmm. Yea " "Ughhh... hmmm ... Ahhh . No" You finish the quests and you are rewarded with a pie for killing off 5 dogs and getting some berries . You finally get out and even if you are on the same server you cant find your friend .\nYou just die because everybody already has a shotgun and the lag is jsut ♥♥♥♥ing amazing you cant get more than 20 fps with the lowest settings set .

This feels like a few stages before Alpha. I cant really say a bad word about them as the game is FREE... but i think it is at list 6 months away from being an actuall multiplayer Alpha. For the life of me i dont really understand why did they even release it now... all they did is just creat a bad reputation for themselfs.\n\nThe list goes like this:\n\n1) Constant disconnections - many players including myslf are getting disconnected every 5-10 min from the game...its a known issue but after planty of posts about it they dont seem to be able to fix it. You cant ebjoy the game if cant bloody play it.\n\n2) Crushing trigers - Talking to NPC's , collecting stuff from the ground, completing quests cuase in many cases the game to crush.\n\n3) Trading is bugged, Quests are bugged.\n\n\nIt a really fairly nice game.... but its not even Alpha i am afriad.

That being said, it is a free-to-play title so this balances things out somewhat but microtransactions are in the game. It has potential, but needs an entire overhaul of it's lighting systems, character models, user interface and questing mechanics. One of the lighting options drops your FPS drastically when enabled and there is very little to no improvement visually. Once again, I'll say that there is a decent free-to-play title that could come from this, but currently the game is not worth anybody's time.","May 7","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

But right now it's not worth taking up space on your hard drive. Start the game and you get an incredibly laggy screen after 3 full minutes of loading the game up. It took me 20 full seconds to find the character creation screen. (alveit probably because i'm just dumb) Character "customization" is abysmal. From what I could tell you can't rotate your character, so I couldn't see that I actually had a ponytail with the hair that i chose from ~5 hairstyles. The only body customization is a few tattoos. You can pick from something like 5 different faces, but they're all abysmal and make the character look like he REALLY needs to get to the bathroom. Oh, and you can't change the gender of your character yet. There are like 15 different skills to level up, and personally I think that's a bit too much. If there was a tutorial button, I didn't see one. I can't read the text very well because I had to set the graphics down to the lowest quality just to be able to maneuver through the menus without waiting 15 seconds for every button i press. So I get into the game. The first thing I notice is that the game itself looks fairly decent, even on low graphics. The next thing I notice makes my ears bleed. The voice acting is truly horrendous; it is as far from engaging and believable as the bottom of the ocean is from the surface of the sun. I grimace through the terrible scripting and attempt to actually figure out what i'm supposed to be doing but there are 3,000 things flashing upon my screen. Seriously, all I need is a health bar and ammo. I can check for quests and daily quests in the menu or whatever. I walk out of the starting house and kick a chicken to death. I go down the path, ignoring the quest given by Aunt Bleach-Your-Ears, and I see this pile of rocks. COPPER. PRESS E TO INTERACT. I press E. Nothing happens, but then I realize that I actually need to hold E. I do. KLANG! You don't have the required skill. So I go down the road some more. I check my inventory. What the heck? Where did I get lead and chromium? Also, dogs apparently drop money when you kill them and you use stones for ammo for your first gun, from what I could deduce.\n\nGame desperately needs:\n- A single-player mode, i don't want to have to worry about raiding and losing all my stuff\n- More character customization\n- Less content, instead focus on refining the content you have, and THEN add more content\n\nI understand I didn't play for very long, but I just couldn't get involved. I also understand it's still in its Alpha stage (at least I hope it is, i vaguely remember reading that somewhere) and again, it has a LOT of potential. I hope it reaches its full potential.","May 10","false","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

You spend about 1 hour farming the required material to craft your new piece of equipment in order to advance but then they tell you that it will take 45 minutes to craft your boots... and you need to craft boots,pants,chest piece,helmet, weapon ... so after 5/6 hours you can actually advance to the next quest... yep dont play this game unless you want to idle for a day... if you could actually play the game it would be one of the best mmo ever released but you just cannot play it you can wait in the game tho (basically the only thing you can do)","May 9","false","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Though the rating for this game is "Mixed" So there for I am upvoting this to give them my support. Now also make note that this review won't be  giving pros and cons. Look at other reviews for that information or give the game a shot... its free to play, it can't hurt to try.\n-----\nSo from what I have done so far, "The Skies" is a FP/TPS MMORPG. You start off by waking up in a bed in the house of your aunt's and uncles farm. Right away, I have the option to do what I want. I go into my dresser and put on my clothes. I get a gun right away, called the "Bumper" The bumper is a gun that looks to be crafted and uses stone as ammo. Stone can be aquired literally all over game. Now I can choose to help my aunt and uncle around the farm for some goodies and  exp, or I can just leave and go off and explore. Doing quest's in this game is 100% optionable. You can get everything in this game and not do a single quest. There's so many different skills to go into and to level up. You make your own "class." I guarentee you, not one person's stats will be exactly the same unless you follow a guide. There are safe zones and pvp zones. I have explored in the pvp zone for more then half of the time I played and only once have I been in a pvp fight. I have run into people who are generally friendly and wont harm you unless you harm them. I checked out the crafting system in this game and I barely even knew where to begin. There is so much you can craft, and if you dont feel like crafting you can always trade with other players or search the shops. The shops have items in them that people have sold which makes this game very unique because in most games the shop items are adjusted and are very limited. You can also do everything in this game and not spend a single dollar. The payment system in this game is not pay to win at all. You pay to speed things up, this is great for people who have busy lives and dont have lot's of free time. What really shocked me was the membership in this game. It's $9.99 a month and for a limited time only you can pay $14.99 and be a member for life! Theres so much more I can go on about and I will be editing this review as I continue through my experience. The game is buggy, yes, but if you can look past the bugs then this game is very promising and very fun and enjoyable.","May 1","true","64.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As it is in early Alpha it needs work but that is to be expected.\nSome things that I think need to be fixed are:\n-Combat, the bots have insane aim, and will hit you 9/10 times, even if you are running\n-Combat, the mechanics of combat are laggy and slow to respond, allowing weak opponents to sink hits they otherwise couldn't and putting some serious disadvantages on me in PvP combat.\n-The Tutorial level needs to show you how to play the game a little better than it does currently\n-The map needs a little less empty space, and an easier way to get around, becuase as is, I spend 10 minutes walking around a wasteland, and killing only 5 or so enemies, and not finding any cities or villages or other players, yet the second I get killed I teleport back to the city and have to walk out for another 10 minutes or more just to find something.\nOverall it is a great game with a huge amount of potential, and I cannot wait to see where this game goes.\nP.S adding vehicles would be really cool. Also allowing the community to set up servers, so that you and your friends could create a private server would be great. :]","May 9","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As clunky and confusing the mechanics are at first, as glitchy and poor the combat is, and as hilariously horrific the voice acting is, there is a solid foundation one can make a GREAT game out of. You can feel the MMO aspect in the basics of it and there is an immersive, apocolyptic feel in the surroundings. It certainly could be a lot worse than it is now.\n\nDon't be discouraged when you try it out. Just know it's very, very bare bones. It's a good chuckle to play currently, but hopefully it'll be a serious game later in development.\n\nThe early permium already does make me uncertain, but the developers could use the extra dough I'm sure.

Multiple screens will pop up while trying to chat. The same key that opens these windows don't always close them. There's no fast way to close all open windows. The chat window is impossibly small and clunky to use. The crafting system is horribly slow in regards to what you need versus ability to gather the materials.

Ok, let me say that one more time before you continue reading...EARLY ALPHA.\n\nHere's the game in a nutshell:\n\n-Mad Max mixed with Fallout\n-Decent atmosphere that really gives the apocalyptic vibe\n-Character progression is fun and reminds me of fallout\n-Combat is 50/50 - Can be fun, but also frustrating\n-Personal storage was just patched in recently so +1 for the devs there\n-Graphics are a solid 5/6-10 at the moment, but I'm sure they will get better over time\n-The voice acting is either meh or just downright hilarious-The game would be better with no voices at all, but you can skip through the bad voiceover\n-Crafting times are hilariously long, but I think the devs will update those sooner or later\n\nVERDICT/TLDR- Good game that needs a little bit of work/polish. Worth a try considering it's free and has the potential to outclass Fallen Earth.

Its almost entirely non-linear, past the tutorial area, the entire game opens up. Skills are a bit wierd however (It takes almost 40 points in the travel skill to get some gas in the wastelands, but eh.) And the aiming is rather wierd for a third person game. Aiming is almost next to impossible, even with a pellet pistol. And sometimes (Although this just could be me with a bad internet connection) Enemys will somehow hit me, even though I am a mile away, causing some issues with trying to play, and with the rather... Buggy... 'Aiming', Fighting NPCs is a chore, and if its a large group, you are dead, because some how you can get hit from behind. The crafting system is very strange also, it took about 20 minutes to craft a leather jacket (Ok I guess), 13 for a pair of leather pants, and /30 MINUTES/ for boots. I mean, seriously? In this games current state, I can not say I recomend the game. Due to its rather... Odd bugs.

Yes the bugs in this game are real, but the Devs update this game constantly and it just keeps getting better and better. What people need to Realize is that Early Alpha is just that. If you feel your time can't be wasted on a game because it is it's early stages well good for you. But overall with all the stuff wrong with this game, there is still alot of stuff that is right. I give it  a solid 8/10 simply for the fact updates are constant, Devs work really hard, Gameplay mechanics have the potential to be amazing and im sure it will be. If you miss out on some cool stuff because you CBA to play this game in Early Alpha I feel bad for you XD\n\n\nBugs have been fixed mostly still a little stuff here and there i have never seen a more dedicated Developer Team. Even through all the stuff that "broke the game" the devs have done the best they can to fix it. Thank you for making such a great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luunna/recommended/337950/","Luunna","Žΰλ. Yuunna ダニー","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luunna/","163 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nI was going to wait til 100 hours of game play, but I just can't see my thought on this game changing. I have put about 45 hours into this game now, and I can say it is very addictive. If you enjoy a Sandbox, open world game, Take a few and read my review on this game or even try it!\n\nPros :\n\nCrafting Varity :\n\nThe number one thing I want to point out is that when it comes to the processing line or your (product line) for crafting, I have noticed alot of people saying that it is broke, and they can only craft 1 item, UNLESS they are Premium. Wrong, increase your Mastery skill. Done. I have found it easy and rather cheap to make my own ammo for my weapons in this game, I have premium, and 20 mastery, 20 mastery provided me with 1 extra crafting slot, yes that seems a little crazy, 20 stat points for one crafting slot. BUT those 20 points are on your passive skills, if you level up your\n\nQuests (LOTS) :\n\nIn Kimary the first city you arrive at after the tutorial, you can obtain a quest from practically any NPC, BUT some and most NPC's require a specific level of skill before they will give you said quest. Alot of the quests can be super simple too! alot are just errands for lazy merchants. I personally love rich stories, alot of differnet stories to listen too, or even help out the local troubled citizen with their person issues.\n\nResources Every where! :\n\nAhhh, one of my favorites, gathering resources. In Kimary all around the city, in the city, wait... EVERYWHERE there is resources for you to gather, from wood, cotton, chrome, steel, coal and so on and so on. I have found that gathering resources in this game is actually pretty quick. Correct me if im wrong PLEASE, but I believe if you level up your Traveling skill, you will begin to see that instead of getting 1 per gather, you'll start to get multiple. Im at about 60 Travel, gathering is anywhere from 3-4 per gather.\n\nFast Mob Spawns :\n\nOne of the best feelings and alot of people will agree with this, I can stay in one area, and not have to run around all over the map just to get 15 kills. there are alot of different areas that have 5-10 mobs in each group. and take no more then 30 seconds to respawn. Yes the elite's (what I call the strong mobs) can take awhile to spawn, but thats the point. For example in Lighthouse, the second map there are Scarubs (stronger then the ones in Kimary) one that looks like the ones in Kimary, and one that has a purple glow to it. The purple ones (elites) give me about 5 times the exp and coin.\n\nStat System :\n\nThe Stat system in this game is absolutely awesome.  You have passive skills, and your base skills, I.E your base stats consist of, Strength, Endurance, Dexteriety, Inteligence, Technology, and luck. Pretty self explainitory if you have played an RPG before. Passive skills have alot of effects on weapons, armor, crafting etc.\n\nAuction House :\n\nDo I have to explain this? it gets you cheap gear, and makes you rich. DONE!\n\nThe Little Things :\n\nCommon who doesn't goto the local bar on games and get smashed? Or do the Chicken dance in the street?  Its a sand box people, you don't have any objectives! Enjoy the little things.\n\nCons :\n\n-Shared World/Killed Loot\n\nHands down the most annoying thing ever, especially when your off killing a mob, and some underwear pirate (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) runs up and jacks your loot from your kill. The shared world resources I can see that being a thing, it is a sandbox openworld after all, Survival of the fittest!\n\nEarly Alpha -\n\nI tend to laugh at this one alot, especially after reading the review's, PEOPLE have you looked above the mini map?? See how it says Early Alpha? IT MEANS ITS EARLY! This game isn't perfect, no it's not tended to be at this stage in their development, they are providing access to this game for us so we can test it for them, so WE can enjoy a game that is for ****FREE**** Yes there are some minor glitches (Bound to happen on any early access game), Hub complications etc, there are 15 guides on steam, the beginners guide helped me learn the game in speedy time. Writing decent review's and actually giving feed back to the developers, helps them out, and the people that enjoy the game, it also gets those issues fixed faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 31","true","59.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean some cockroaches break your arm and you cannot use gun...not to mention constant spawn around some missions so it makes it impossible.\n\nQuests are messed up, for example it says "Go back to Vargis", I've been looking for that dude for whole day...it turnes out his name is Grett or something like that not Vargis.\nSquading up with my friend and then we cannot se each other on the map (we are same server)\n\nMost basic missions make you walk over the whole map for no good reason, you get easily killed and then you need to walk again.\n\nNew player experience is non existing and pretty hard to start building your character, full of bugs, messed up missions, difficulty issues.

For the PVP problem the minute I exited the starting area 5 other real people were waiting for me and killed me within seconds (made me laugh tbh) but on a serious note this IS a major problem as some people would want to enjoy the game and not die HOWEVER I think the PVP side is quite fun and I imagine so do many other people - my advice? either double the servers (one being with allowed PVP and the other with PVP disabled) or do what SWTOR did and only allow certain areas to be PVP if this is impossible (as I have no idea how difficult it is to add those two things) possibly get rid of the PVP element as this will ruin the game for some people. For the hud problems the map acually expanded across the whole screen in a bitty unreadable fashion (if the map was legible as a map I probably would not be adding this but it was clearly an error). HOWEVER I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS GAME the graphics are great, the combat is alright (for a alpha) and the quest system isnt confusing asf like in other mmorpgs so in conclusion I would rate this as a 4/10 now but could imagine a 10/10 if this game recives the support and dedication it deserves.","April 16","false","0.3"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

I get that this is an alpha, this is for the devs, not you salty steam ♥♥♥♥ wads to comment on.\n\n1. Obviously less lag. (it gets bad sometimes)\n2. A bank for storing items (noone i know has found one)\n3. Bump and other stone weapons need more range, and raiders and other bandit archtypes need more loot drop chance and less range. The starter shotgun shouldnt be vastly better simply because all ranges are the same.\n4. Bump and other stone weapons need damage buff\n5. Crafting mat req needs nerf\n6. Using merchants to repair needs to not be relative to player skill... should only cost money.\n7. Raiders/bandits need aggro bugs fixed.\n8. Getting better weapons shouldnt be so impossible. Crafting mat requirements are insane, and need more mats than someone can hold via inv weight, and shouldnt take so long to craft (given that everything needs parts which can only be crafted one at a time and its like a minute a pop).... its just stupid. Also, everything is super expensive. Like SUPER expensive.\n9. Better balance overall.\n10. The game can be difficult, thats cool, but the slope of progression after level 6ish is stupid. its gonna take me a week to get a better gun, especially because im overweight with mats for them. -.-\n\nI have bought the lifetime premium for 15 bucks, kinda a waste of money, but i wont ask for it back. This game has alot of potential and its fun for an hour or so, after the novelty wears off (and it does quick) this game becomes a pile of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nKilling people with a stick outside of town shouldnt be the funnest aspect of the game.\n\nFix the balance of some guns, make progression just a LITTLE easier, put a ♥♥♥♥ing bank in the game, and it should be good to go.\n\nI also understand that this is an Alpha and the steam kids are gonna throw that at me like they know something about life, but honestly, i have played alot of alphas, and this is one of the worse off ones. Yet one of the best concepts for a game i have seen in a while. I get that its an alpha and things will change, but there are alot of concepts and mechanics that arent working out AT ALL. Its to the point that even the handful of devs shouldve realized that after a few hours of playing legit its a little redundant and hard to progress or even enjoy yourself.\n\nUse my 15 bucks to the best of your ability.

One thing i dont like at all. even as in bad shape game is atm, it has P2W elements.... you can buy ingame cash with real money. so i cant imagine how unbalanced it will be. you can buy automatic rifle on start of game when every1 else is running around with weapon that fires stones.","April 16","false","10.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

Very, very large.\n\nOutside of the sad money-making model, well, it's early access. There are good ideas here and there. A lot of work to do in order to call that a complete game, but the foundations are okay.\nHowever, this economic model is a major turn-off for me (playing is not rewarding because you can progress extremely faster thanks to cash buy).\n\nMy quest to find the perfect MMO continues","April 17","false","2.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

People that just want a quick pro's and con's in my opinion it is at the top.\n\nPRO's (mostly just potential and interest)\n- Potential\n- Like a Fallout online\n- Devs seem to be working\n- Interesting clan system\n- Interesting stat mechanic\n- Player diologue is entertaining\n\nCON's\n- Its in a hardcore Alpha\n- Safe zone/ Bad zone is kinda bs right now\n- Voice actors are ♥♥♥♥\n- Characters are boring\n- OP ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s\n- BUGS LOTS OF BUGS\n- Bad combat with NPC's\n\nLONG SUMMARY\nThe game currently is a mess. UI is ♥♥♥♥ed, NPC's are not interesting, and bugs everywhere. HOWEVER a lot of aspects to the game are interesting and devs seem to be improving it constantly. Most of the people disliking on the game forget how ALPHA this game actually is. The stat system, clan, and the way things seems to be going interest me and if done right can make this game amazing.\n\nThis game reminds me a lot of Fallout and when I say a lot I mean a lot! The game is set in a wasteland kind of deal and some dialoge options can allow you to be this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. One of the few I experianced was getting to call some kid that was being a ♥♥♥♥ "a little ♥♥♥♥." I find this game as of now and most likely the future to need friends to be fun and I say that because of the clan system added to the game. I feel like this system can put out this big pvp vibe that I love in MMO's that is honestly in my opinion needed for the way they are taking this game.\n\nThis game does even for an extreme alpha look like bad potential also such as the safe zone/ bad zone thing. I think there should be a safe zone for the main questing and that there is a route for the safety zone. Another thing with the safe zone ♥♥♥♥ DO SOMETHING WITH THE OP ♥♥♥♥S. At the rate of what the safe zone thing is going they should rethink it and do lots of changes to it. It makes the game not fun when ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s go in and out of the border line for safety so they can just swoop in and out to kill you. Characters need better more inviting/evil voices. some remind me of when I was in Juinor High and there was that one kid who had no experession and sounded like a robot. Another thing is Dialoge and I'm not going to be harsh on this at all because I feel like this is an easy thing to be fixed and its kinda just opinion, but maybe more options plz I would to see new options more like fallout new vegas or fallout 3. Bugs are huge also, but thats a basic thing with alphas they just need to make sure to fix them. Last but not least on my cons is graphics. To be real I think judging a game on its graphics is dumb, but I know there are people that strongly want "pretty graphics" so I'm putting it in my cons for those people because the game is kinda like eeehhhh on the graphic side of things it isn't smooth even with the highest setting and I'm mostly putting this down upon the things of building and people and such.\n\nOVERALL\nGreat potential, Lots of basic cons that can be fixed and some that arn't basic that NEED to be fixed, Interesting, and needs more of that fallout/wasteland vibe. With my review being negative its not that this is subjected to change over time. If the devs put in the good work and make it a nonP2W this game could be what many people have been wating for in a mass pvp, fps, MMO. Everyone just needs to be patient and understand how alpha it really is becuase this game is insane on the alpha scale ( its a solid 9.5/10 on my scale.)","May 10","false","1.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Wandered around town for an hour looking for any quests to do because killing mobs for xp, at least in the early levels, nets almost nothing.\n\nA few things that others have stated before and I would suggest as fixes for making the game more enjoyable:\n\n1. Add more slots to the crafting queue so I don't have to wait 30 minutes to make a jacket only to then add boots which takes another half hour to make.\n\n2. Premium is pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. G1 put huge limitations on Fallen Earth's free to play state similar to The Skies and it didn't work for them as Fallen Earth is practically dead now. Adding cosmetics, xp boost/money boost and even boosted loot drops (hell, even throw in ammo, just not the guns, into the shop) is all fine as long as you don't limit the basic gameplay. That's what phone games do. Don't be a phone game.\n\n3. As others have said, raiders with bats and dogs are fine, but then raiders with guns turn into elite badasses that can hit a fly from ten paces away, all the while firing much faster than your pile of garbage gun from the tutorial. Sure, there aren't nearly as many gun-toting elite snipers as there are dudes with sticks and half a tire strapped to their chest, but that doesn't mean they don't pose a huge threat. Speaking of, the scarabs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Their base move speed is just barely below my sprint speed, so running away is the only option which is good to know except for they're right next to where you get dropped out of the tutorial.\n\n4. Some NPCs will have a question mark by their icon on the mini-map. That does not always mean the NPC will have a quest for you. It may mean they have a part to play in a quest you have to go through all of town trying to fidn the right NPC to trigger said quest then get to the part in said quest where you have to talk to question mark NPC. Also the lack of direction with the quests does not help. One of the quest steps was to find a little kid in the fabric factory. There is no direction to where this factory is or where it's in or out of town (it's in town, by the way). And the kid himself was standing off in a corner trying to camoflauge into some boxes like a little ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo yeah, it has some potential, but just because it has potential doesn't mean it's good, it only has the potential to be good.","April 23","false","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The Skies also has endless play time, if you think you're done... Make a new character with a new build. Think it out and be unique. It gets harder the more unique your class. I recommend The Skies, it is wonderful. I waited for a long time for something like this. A little more simple MMO for the newer gamers, but with friends in turns into a very funny game!

It's like watching a quadruple amputee run through tar.\n\nThen there's the voice acting. It's bad. Real bad. It sounds like they rounded up the staff, made sure they could barely speak English, then had them read the lines once.\n\nThen there's the text. It's also bad. Most of it doesn't make much sense.\n\nThen there's the animations. Also bad. They're extremely clunky and look really stiff. Melee attacks just look terrible and the running animation is even worse.\n\nI could go on, but with it being a 3.3 GB download, you should just get the game yourself and see the awfulness in full effect.

Your settings are GLITCHED i.e LOW and AVERAGE are connected and HIGH/Ultra are tandam. . .

I was disconnected once and my frames went to 60(vsync) in town with everyones toons running in place so the toons animation and amount of people do not hinder the CPU or GPU .... my opinion is the bottlenecking in the network stalls... everything seems to tic at the same time when it comes to those low 20 fps in town.....p2p application may be an issue.. nothing changes for usage from outside of town and inside....

I mean there's numerous female NPCs so the rigs and skins are obviously there... but, hey, the cash shop is fully functional!!! Graphics are pretty aweful for a game coming out these days, and the load times... wow does it take a loooong time to log in. I'll check back after a few updates. Hard to find the patience to play more when it takes over 5min to load in.\n\nNo keybind list or edit option that I've found yet and tutorial barely covers any of the controls. You die super easy which is just punishing to new players especially with XP loss on death and mobs remember you even after death/revive so if you get near where you died every mob starts running after you again.","May 19","false","6.4"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","7"

It's not bad...  But it's not good, either.  It's clearly early access which means I have every reason to believe it *will* be great, but not for a year or so.  As someone who favors the MMORPG genre, here's my pro/con list:\n\n--Pros--\n-All the quests I encountered in my short time had full audio - barely had to read anything.  I like that, it's submersive.\n-Travel didn't seem to take *too* long.\n-Post-apocalypse atmosphere is decent.  If the game wasn't so early and I could have gotten into it, I would have felt submersed in an apocalyptic wasteland.\n\n--Cons--\n-Gunplay is shoddy at best.  Many times I missed at point blank with a shotgun simply because I was moving...  That's just sillyness.\n-When you're in a quest dialog it sometimes gives you 2 or 3 options to reply and for the most part it felt like the other options were just "extra" or there for asthetics, serving little or no purpose.\n-Very little guidance with quests...  This can be a good thing if you're like me and don't like the "hand holding" of recently-made MMO's, however from the time I started until the time I said, "screw this", I felt like I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing.\n\nAll in all I say it's a decent game.  Pick it up and try it.  Certainly doesn't deserve a negative review - these devs are trying damn hard and honestly this game has serious potential.  Give it a try if you like the genre.  If you're able to get past the shoddyness in it's current state and get into it, the game can only get better from here.","May 6","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Digo aparenta, porque ainda está em alpha. Acho que pode ter futuro se for bem desenvolvido, era bom que alguns jogadores de fonline dessem aqui um salto para colaborarem com os desenvolvedores.\n\nComo está em Alpha, algumas funcionalidades não funcionam correctamente, ainda que sejam bugs menores. O que considero ser um grande problema para este jogo é a falta de maturidade dos utilizadores, e scriptkiddies a tentar mandar o jogo a baixo que poderam representar a maioria da comunidade.\n\nThe game appears to follow a pattern similar to Fallout in terms of character construction, crafting system, stats. When i say it appears its because the game is still in alpha and there might be a lot of changes depending the maturity of this game comunity. This can turn out to be a great game if well developed and it would have a lot to win if members of fonline would come to colaborate with the devs with tips.\n\nWhile there's some features that do not work, they all seem to be minor bugs, glitches that can be fixed without affecting the gameplay. Ex.: (this is according to my experience)\n- mouse sensitivity bar in settings does not work\n- toggling between Character control and free mouse sometimes bugs\n- double clicking armour wont switch with the one equipped\n- stuff can be picked up from the other side of the wall\n\nThe website/servers are now undergoing stress from DDoS, hack attempts, some players are trying to exploit the game and initially it will suck but it will help devs to find the exploits and close them before releasing the game.\n\nActualização: Tendo em conta que o jogo ainda está em alpha, parece seguir o caminho de item shop extremo, craft de 15 minutos para cima e somente um item por vez, tem-se de pagar para ter mais slots disponiveis, upgrades sao cobrados pela moeda paga no jogo.\nOs mobs aparentam ser overkill mas pode ser por causa de estar em alpha.\n\nUpdate: While the game is still in Alpha, it starts to show its path with extreme item shop dependent, upgrade items are pay2win with paid currency, crafting queue slots are also paid and most crafts will be 15min up.\nMobs appear to be overkill, but it might be because its still alpha.","April 18","false","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I usually go into detail about key aspect such as story and gameplay, but the bugs and micro transactions will take main focus. Story is scattered in loading screen panels and very awkward voice acting with quests hidden behind NPC interactions. Visually the game feels like it was made in 2009, but it is not awful. The music is rather forgetful with sound effects drowning the speakers in gun fire and scarab clicks. Combat works, but the enemy AI switches from charge happy to standing until killed. UI is rather clunky with simple tasks such as sorting the inventory and interacting with the environment becoming frustrating. Alright, now to the big killers: bugs.\n\nThis game could have the greatest story ever told, gameplay that produced liquid joy and visuals which blinded you from pure beauty, but it all means nothing if it can barely hold itself up. The sheer volume of bugs, glitches and errors in this game is staggering; most require the player to exit the game and log back in just to fix. Guns and gear do not equip properly, being overburdened does not hinder movement, some stats do not do what they are suppose to do (Dexterity and Oratory for instance), selling items does not register, and other action graphics can become stuck on your character (pick axe was always visible after a failed node). Terrain appears unfinished with invisible flooring, the few items in barren homes will float in the air, NPCs are seen stuck in objects or walking into walls, enemies will just stand still when hit or appear to be stuck in place with you taking melee damage from them 6 yards away and gathering can get you stuck in the animation. I even got trapped in a staircase and a doorframe on multiple occasions. It just screams of sloppy design and poor self-checking, especially with the stats that fail to work.\n\nCrashes, disconnects, frame rate inconsistency: the trifecta of annoyance. Crashes can happen from simply changing zones to reviving after being killed. Disconnects are rather few and far between, but it happens when the server load starts to get high. Frame rate personally stuck around 20-30 on Ultra settings, but I know of other players dipping into single digits. Mix these problems in with the bugs and you can see how it would feel tiresome just to complete a simple fetch quest.\n\nNow for the controversial topic: micro transactions. It is a well known fact many games depend on them for the revenue to continue updating, but the problem starts to arise when the service provided affects gameplay so much. Thanks to the free weekend, I have been able to see the difference. XP gain, currency gain, crafting slots, time required to craft, it all becomes easier in Premium. This could be seen as a pay to win set up, especially with the amount of coins you get compared to normal player. For a game still in alpha, it is rather interesting to have working micro transactions when so many areas still need basic work. Just an observation.\n\nPvP is always an issue of grievers and balance, so when I discovered how many people decided to camp outside town before the recent update it was clear why the safe areas were constructed. The game just screams effort, but like this constant threat of player attacks the game feels too frustrating when you fear the next bug could get you killed outside your quest destination. I do not know how long it would take before this game could be considered reliable, but at this point it would be more effort than payoff to play it. There are plenty of other MMO style games out there with less pay to win influence to tied you over while this gets further down the programming line.\n\nPros\n\n- Safe zones at least promise you won't be player killed\n- Plenty to do if you can get far enough in\n\nCons\n\n- It needs heavy optimization\n- Open PvP halts most progress\n- Micro Transactions (that feel pay to win)\n- UI about as frustrating as enemy AI","April 24","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All character models look exactly the same- pale mexican men. Graphics are choppy and slow as ♥♥♥♥ even though I surpass recommended specs- no option to change settings either. The game is already PAY TO WIN and it's not even running reliably yet.  Privacy statements and transatction protection statements are hard to find and very unclear. Players who recieve a punishment or ban from servers are not allowed to ask or talk about their ban/punishment according to their statements, and can also be banned by moderators for any reason.\n\n1. This game is full of typos ("Under Constraction," "Join tof the clan"). The character creation screens alone had two. They are simple typos that would have been noticed by many people by now- how hard is it to correct a few easy words?\n2. There's an option to choose a female character but no female choices. Oh well. I'll be a white guy... Who looks mexican like everyone else. No hate to Mexicans, but I don't want to play one. Why have character creation when all the base bodies still look exactly the same in-game?\n3. There's no option to change the graphics settings, which my PC apparently cant handle. I can run Fallout 4 and Skyrim on Ultra, but clearly the graphics at work here are too good for me because it looks like I'm slowly flipping pages of a book.\n4. The Devs are already charging for simple services like stat resets... and also for XP, gold, and crafting bonuses during things like PVP. Ergo, this game is PAY TO WIN despite being unfinished. It's in it's buggy, half-built infancy, a freakin early access alpha, and they're already taking money. Maybe this is just me, but I don't think anyone should be charged for anything until a game actually runs reliably. I also don't think the winners and losers should be determined by who pays the most money- it truly defeats the purpose of having a free game. Mind you, I've spend $200+ on DOTA 2 compendiums and dress up for my favorite heroes (love that fkn arcana), so I'm not against spending money. Just against paying to be better than others, or paying for a buggy crash-filled game.\n5. Privacy statements and transatction protection statements are hard to find and very unclear. Players who recieve a punishment or ban from servers are not allowed to ask or talk about their ban/punishment according to their statements, and can also be banned by moderators for any reason.

I would stay away from it for now until it recieves major updates.\n\nAs of right now:\n\nFirst there is a game breaking bug which occurs when you try and trade with a NPC. Every single time I go to trade it opens up and my inventory is blank / the npc's inventory is blank and cannot trade anything. It also says I have 0 coin but when I look to the upper left it clearly states I have 2400. Also if you click trade and exit out and then try to speak to ANYONE the menu disappears and the only thing you can do is trade again. No accepting quests, no speaking to anyone; it just automatically brings up trade with the above bug. I end up having to quit the game every time but the bug still occurs.\n\nAI in this game isn't innovative and they have some serious auto-aiming capabilities. When you enter a building with multiple AI they go absolutely bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy. All you can hear is gun shots even though they don't have sight of you. I've had to mute my game because it doesn't cease. Some of them will even 1 shot you. Sometimes they even melee / shoot you at the same time doing double damage. They will also chase you to for what seems like 2-3 minutes.\n\nThis game looks promising and it isn't all bad. The crafting system is "okay" at best and if there weren't timers it would be great.

First the lag, I play the game on the lowest settings and it still has very bad lag. Also the game has texture issues because when I started my second character the textures were messed up, like the wardrobe in the beginning had a texture of a man's face and eyes and when I look at it at a certain angle, the texture of the table from the beginning was also on there. The lockpicking, this lockpicking system is no pin tumbler and the pins jump up and down and it made it almost impossible to pick, I've tried to pick the lock in the safe when you start and I spent over 15 minutes trying to pick the lock.

I personally had more fund running the many many side missions there are, and having immersing myself in the feeling of being amongst different people trying to make a new life.\nCombat is fun, dialogues are well written, and levelling system is well designed.

Sotto in italiano]\n\nThe first real post-apocalyptic MMORPG.\n\nPRO\n- Huge world (in addition to the maps, there are also small dungeon)\n- Well-managed environment\n- Dialogues with NPCs variables depending on the choices made (not treat them bad: P)\n- Many missions (not mandatory, but obviously help)\n- "Easter eggs" (hidden chests, "special" monsters ...)\n- Many weapons and armor\n- Possibility to improve weapons and items (up to 5 upgrades for object, with different lv of upgrades)\n- Well made tree skills (6 primary skills, each with 3 sub-skills. The primary skills start from lv 2 and arrive to lv 20. Sub-skills start at 2, arrive at 99 and are divided into 3 sub-lv: from 2 to 40 points = 1 point\nIt costs 1 point, from 40 to 60 = 1 point costs 2 points, from 60 to 99 = 1 point costs 3 points)\n- Rank of the clan\n- Revenue of passive money trammite control of flags on the map and the "work"\n- Extensive crafting (also of vehicles in the future)\n- Customization of the character (and for some armor for premium)\n- Active community\n- Updates and continuous participation of developers\n- There is primium, but fortunately there is a "pay to win", the bonuses are reasonable.\n- A lot of content coming: D\n- FREE!\n\nAGAINST\n- Some missions are still bugged, but periodically reset so that you can redo once fixate\n- Crafting requires a lot of resources and time-consuming, to balance better, but the basic work well (lv OBJECTS 1-5)\n- Various small bugs (chat, keyboard shortcuts, spawn/change map not working correctly ...) all things  passable, and they're fixing it.\n- It requires a general rebalancing, but the larger part of the game is ok\n- No wiki for the moment =(\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nThe game is very nice although in alpha, has excellent bases and potential, hoping good in a few years will become a masterpiece. Try it does not cost anything, and remember to be understanding, since it is free =).

Le abilità primarie arrivano partono da lv 2 e     arrivano a lv 20. Le sotto abilità partono da 2, arrivano a 99 e hanno son suddivise in 3 gradi: da 2 a 40 punti = 1 punto\ncosta 1 punto, da 40 a 60 = 1 punto costa 2 punti, da 60 a 99 = 1 punto costa 3 punti)\n- rank del clan\n- entrate di soldi passive trammite controllo di bandiere sulla mappa ed il "lavoro"\n- ampio crafting (in futuro anche di veicoli)\n- personalizzazione del personaggio (e di alcune armature per i premium)\n- comunità attiva\n- aggiornamenti e partecipazione continua degli sviluppatori\n- esiste il primium, ma fortunatamente NON è "un pay to win", i bonus sono ragionevoli.\n- una marea di contenuti in arrivo :D\n- GRATIS!\n\nCONTRO\n- alcune missioni sono ancora buggate, ma periodicamente le resettano in modo da poterle rifare una volta fixate\n- il crafting richiede moltissime risorse e tempi lunghi, da bilanciare meglio, ma la base funziona bene (oggeti lv 1-5)\n- piccoli bug vari (chat, tasti scelta rapida, spawn/cambio di mappa a volta non correttamente funzionante...) tutte cosè passabili comunque, e che stanno fixando pian piano.\n- necessita di un riblilanciamento generale, ma la magior parte è ok\n- niente wiki per il momento =(\n\n\nIN CONCLUSIONE\n\nIl gioco è molto bello anche se in alpha, ha ottime basi e potenzialità, sperando bene tra qualche anno sarà diventato un capolavoro.

This game has huge potential, and is definitely fuin, but they still have a lot of work to do. One big issue right from the beginning is that the storyline is very hard to advance.

It's clunky, badly thought out, and doesn't have any path to follow.  Open world games need to have a driving force to make you want to go on an adventure instead of hanging around the starting area for the first couple hours you play it.  It just drops you off in the middle of this town with irritating characters, and enemys too strong to be considered starter enemies.\nTo get a better gone right off the bat you have to take a quest from this guy magnus.  It involves getting materials for him to make you a gun because he mistook you for some rando who doesn't have a name.  To get said materials you have to raid a bandit camp or find them with unknown methods.  Even if I could kill enough of them I couldn't loot the corpse since I immediately died from the other 20 bandits.  At first I was hopeful this would be a good game.  But then I got one shot by a beetle as soon as left the tutorial area.  On top of having a crappy staring defence/health the combat of this game feels like it's a game from the 1990s not 2016.\nI will not be revisiting this game because even if i could do some of the quests the pathways to finish them are single minded and brutish.  I started off trying to get a stubborn doctor from closing his hospital because a kid stole some tools of his, and ended up having to help the kid's mother from having her home reposessed by bribing some dude in a bar.  There is very little explanation and the only common theme is this mysterious place called "The Skies."  Give me something important to do!  I want to look for this brother that is mentioned not solving the problems of poeple who are just plain idiots.\n","April 29","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall the lore is pretty not interesting, but let's be honest here - who looks for good lore in multiplayer game? Lel.\nThe combat system i pretty solid in schemes - powerfull hits close with melee weapon and good long range shooting.\n\nIn schemes.\n\nIn reality the range of melee weapons is insanely big. I had a stupid handmade assalut rifle and got killed from the other side of the spot by guy with club. Ridiculous.\n\nThe Quests are bugging pretty often. I had one with delivering the package to the mayor in the first city.\nThe bandits got bugged and one of them dissapeared. When I went out the doors closed and I am not able to do the quest (well maybe if I abandoned it, dunno if you really can xd).\n\nThere is suppoused to be a "crafting" system along with "collecting" system. Resources are hard to find and usually require tons of points in travelling skill. That's a nope.\n\nOh yea, and quests are pretty much similar: go to X, take Y amounts of Z and come back or kill X Y times to get Z and bring it to me. Smth like this.\n\nThe biggest disadvantage of this game tho is connection. You will be kicked out from the server really often. This gets annoying and sometimes breaks the quests or game experience.\n\nBUT!\nNote that the game is in early alpha and not all things are suppoused to work correcly. I do not really get the idea for "early access" or "early alpha". You should rather release a full game with no bugs instead of bugged not-finished game.\n\nBut watcha gonna do.\n\nUpdates may make this review outdated so i guess for a conclusion i may say this:\nSo far this is a decent game. It does not bring anything special to survival FPS games similar to this kind (DayZ, Nether, H!ZI, Hurtword, Rust, etc.). If you are a fan of Fallout 4 and survival and you don't mind a game kicking you each 30+ minutes - play it.","May 4","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The UI is completely unintuitive, the explanation of how the RPG systems work is awful, there are bugs in the starting area in the quests you HAVE to do to leave, and the server infrastructure is terrible, lots of players teleporting around.

It's clunky, badly thought out, and doesn't have any path to follow.  Open world games need to have a driving force to make you want to go on an adventure instead of hanging around the starting area for the first couple hours you play it.  It just drops you off in the middle of this town with irritating characters, and enemys too strong to be considered starter enemies.\nTo get a better gone right off the bat you have to take a quest from this guy magnus.  It involves getting materials for him to make you a gun because he mistook you for some rando who doesn't have a name.  To get said materials you have to raid a bandit camp or find them with unknown methods.  Even if I could kill enough of them I couldn't loot the corpse since I immediately died from the other 20 bandits.  At first I was hopeful this would be a good game.  But then I got one shot by a beetle as soon as left the tutorial area.  On top of having a crappy staring defence/health the combat of this game feels like it's a game from the 1990s not 2016.\nI will not be revisiting this game because even if i could do some of the quests the pathways to finish them are single minded and brutish.  I started off trying to get a stubborn doctor from closing his hospital because a kid stole some tools of his, and ended up having to help the kid's mother from having her home reposessed by bribing some dude in a bar.  There is very little explanation and the only common theme is this mysterious place called "The Skies."  Give me something important to do!  I want to look for this brother that is mentioned not solving the problems of poeple who are just plain idiots.\n","April 29","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
