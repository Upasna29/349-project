It's kinda like trying to jump into something like Ragnarok Online in 2015. I played this way back in beta on game n game or something. Eventually played on OG Planet for a bit. The game is different now. Way more classes and characters. An entirely different, better, and longer tutorial. One of the cool things about the game is the extensive skill system and class switching on the fly.\n\nIf you can get past the interface, playing windowed, and overwhelming information dump at the start, you may find a new old game you enjoy. I should also mention the controls. They will take some getting used to. If you have played games like Diablo in the past it may not bother you. But to younger gamers it will seem really weird.\n\nMy general tip is to adjust your stats to the gear you are trying to equip. And for skills find a skill you want to aim for and right click it to see the skill tree. This will stop you from leveling a skill you might not need.\n\nI may rewrite this review in the future because I have been awake for close to 24 hours so this probably sounds crazy.","April 16, 2015","true","4.0"," 100 of 121 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","100","121","11","4"

This game is not for the casuals let's state that right now.\nPROS\n\nThere's over 600 levels with a rebirthing system. You can use it to reset yourself back to level 1, this in turn gets you more stats and skill points.\n\nClasses they have a some pretty cool classes, there aren't many games that offer some of the classes this game does.\n\nTamers/summoner's, this class is my favorite so far they can have two summons out as well as two pets. This game has the best pet system that i have found. As you level up, you can put skill points into your stats which upgrades your pets stats. You also get a skill, where you can ride one of your pets to increase your movement speed.\n\nStat points that's right this game has them. Most games are going complete casual, where you can't build your class how you want. As you level up you get stat points which you can put point's into to increase your characters proformance. You can pick a dps class and build tank, or you can sacrfice stats to increase your luck so you can find better gear, or increase your wisdom to increase exp ammounts.\n\nDrop rates seem good, tons of stuff drops left and right.\n\nCONS\n\ngraphic's are a bit out dated, mind you this game came out in 2003 from what i have found. If the gameplay is good the graphic's don't mean much to me.\n\nGenderlock classes, this game did come out 2003. When this was acceptable, but it doesn't mean they can't change it now...\n\npay to win cash shop, yes you can pay for buff's the costumes you can buy increase stats a bit. Sadly this i can't give them a pass on this. It's an out dated system that shouldn't exist, league of legend/dota showed, you can survive without a pay to win cash shop. So why are they doing this? If anything there elimanting more people, because of the unfair advantages.\n\nClunky movement, and no v-sync option. This game has some pretty bad movement, at times you will seem to get stuck on nothing. Also the graphic option's are very limited, i can't even put on v-sync so i get screen tearing. I had to use nvidia control panel to do it, i still get screen tearing tho.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\nShould you play redstone? It depends on if you like old school games, where they gave you freedom of choice. If you grew up in this time of gaming, where bad movement/graphics/pay to win cash shops was a thing then you found a pretty nice game.\n\nHowever if you never played very many old games, nor grew up in the time i doubt you will like it. There's a lot of turn offs to the modern gamer, but it still doesn't mean you can't try. I say try the game, who knows you may like it. After all it is a free game, what do you have to lose?\n\nPretty much if you can sit down right now and play the elder scrolls 3 morrowind/diablo 2 and like it, this game should feel right at home with you. If you sit down and you don't like morrowind/diablo 2 there's no hope for you liking this game.","May 11, 2015","true","7.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

AND it caps so you cant just all join a strong guild..\n\naswell if you had a old account the website cannot find your old login id meaning you lost everything when they changed over so anything you used to have is gone now.\n\n\nall in all this game is only good if you like excessively hard grinds. without much reward the game is fun in its own right and i would almost play it for nostalgic reasons but i will pass and keep it where it belongs in the past, some games die with time its a rite of time and how it goes, not all games are classics that carry over through time and remain good forever. and this one i will keep in my little area for nostalgic memorys and i will not reccomend this to others it just isnt worth the time in this day and age... and trust me it hurts a bit to say it about a game i spent countless hours on but its the truth","April 16, 2015","false","0.1"," 39 of 69 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","39","69","5","0"

No pathfinding towards enemy mobs for example, you have to click yourself next to one enemy and then click the actual attack button. I love the genre of 2.5D RPG's, but you need more work for me to consider going deeper into the game.\nI realise that there are fans of old style games behind this, but a game needs to not be frustrating, back then we didn't have a choice in most cases, but now it is possible. Oh and one more thing, fix the required "run as admin" part of the software, it should not be needed. That just screams bad programming.\n\nSo as for now, not recommended.\n\nEdit: This game was published in Korea during Jan 2004 and the developers are currently working on a Red Stone 2 and just recently added to steam (apr 2015), so it might be unfair to say it was not up to par to todays games for sure. But the game still has terrible pathfinding to the 2004 standard, so my point still stand.","April 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 59 of 112 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","59","112","9","23"

And loot.\n\nCons:The registration is confusing as balls, it says to put down your email, but if you put a valid email down, it doesn't work. So you have to do your username with a @gmail.com or one of the other choices so you can log-in.\nAbsolutely no customization of characters.\nMenus are very amateur in design.\nControls very clunky and requires you to hold down to the left mouse to pick up items, and or attack monsters.\nControls are explained well. Sure they have it on the steam page to show you what to do. But they don't really explain it.\nQuests are hard to understand, and there are random numbers and characters in the description.\nMap is really bad and you can't understand it from the beginning, but you will after lots of research.\nGraphics were okay, not something to write home about.\n\nReccomended if you want to just ♥♥♥♥ about.\nOther than that, there is no meat to keep you around really.","June 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

This game remind me strongly of Dark Eden, in every positive aspects. The only thing is Dark Eden had more darkness and, sadly, it isn't avaible anymore. I'm really glad games like Red Stone Online are still avaible and are getting releases on Steam. I'm bored with every mmorpg game that are only sad and worthless WoW clones, or action mmorpg games - if I wanted to play action game I would pick up something for single player.\nAs new player, I think Red Stone Online is great game - with so many different classes, many places to fight, levels to made and quests to do, I don't think that I will get bored with it anytime soon.

First the game client crashes when you try to log in if you are not in administrative mode. Something I can easily deal with and hindred only the first launch. Then came the log on creation where I went to the website only to be bombarded several times by "DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT" screen, after I was already making a new account. That annoyed me but still did not hinder me. So, after doing all this, I still could not log in game itself as it didn't recognize my username/password. It also seemed to bug out every third or so login attempt.\n\nFinally, and what took the cake is this "X-Trap". This horrid horrid game protection is actually not really protection. It prevents typing outside the game screen. This seems to include steam related screens. How this got past being greenlit, I will never understand. Oh, and to top it off, there is no wiki for this game. The wikis are completely unfurbished or barely have anything other than copied text from the website over at GamenGame.\n\nIn short, if you have the patience, the luck, and the mashocist attitude to play this, go ahead.

The classes Branch off from your typical Archer(Range) Warrior(Melee) and Mage(Caster) with the Transformation system. There are so many routes a  player can take with both his Stats and Skills and some fun combo's that others would not have thought of. Another Plus is it's not your typical Pay2Win game as there have been several casual players who obtained a rather high level without ever spending a dime. With Wisdom Bonus (a Stat), Berries (an item thats available to all players) Guild Dungeons and Secrect Dungeons, Red Stone Detective (Exp Bonus while in party) its easy to level if you stick it out. Finally the Item hunting aspect is rather nifty. You chance to get some great items while random can be increased with a stat (Luck) and rather than being a "useless" item hunter the stat will actually help you deal more damage by way of crits.

What the hell, is this game made in the 1990's?  Did the devs think this was a good idea?  Absolutely stupid idea now allowing for a spectrum of different resolutions to pick from.  It's so atrocious you actually have to check a box to put it in 1024x768.\n\nSecond thing right off, the graphics.  Now I don't expect it to be top-notch graphics or anything but this is just outright lazy.  No real effort was put into the graphics and the end result is bad.  The animations don't look all that appealing either and when you are moving your character she slides all over the screen like she/he's drunk.  Furthermore there is a slight lag to the animations and lack any smoothing making them out of place to the rest of the graphics.  Spell effects and the like aren't too bad but again they are boring and unappealing to the eye.\n\nPathing.  There is no pathing that I can see in this game.  Play Baldur's gate and then play this game and you will know what I mean.\n\nClasses.  These are locked to specific genders and I absolutely HATE games that disallow you to customize your sex to a class.  Typical korean MMO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  While I only tried one class as of writing this, it's not worth noting anything of significance.\n\nCombat.  Nothing specially really.  You click you swing your weapon automatically things die.  It's very unappealing to look at and the tedium of watching it makes me wish want to watch a movie or something while engaging in combat.  The leveling system is weird as well.  I can't tell what they are trying to do with it to be honest.  I'll try to explain as best I can with the limited knowledge I have thus far:\n\nI ran up to a scarecrown in this first town I was thrown into.  As I'm beating on it, I'm getting experience?  After about 30 seconds of beating on mr scarecrow I'm what appears to be level 3.  Now I can't exactly tell if this is my overall level, if I'm leveling up a weapon skill but then again like most korean mmo's you don't have freedom to pick whatever weapon you wish, you are forced to a weapon based on your class, another reason why the classes in this game outright suck balls.  After I managed to hit level 3 it stopped.  I haven't at this point managed to come across any enemies so I don't know if there is more to the level system than this but from what I gather it's nothing worth getting all giddy about.  I opened up the skills screen and while there are plenty of skills, 2 tabs for the tamer class, the system itself is rather confusing.  I think you get skill points based on lord knows what and can level them up.\n\nMusic and sound.  Horrible to say the least.  The music is what you expect from a boring cliche` f2p korean mmo.  The real garbage is the sound effects.  I could probably find better sound effects from a royalty free website than whatever samples they bothered to use.  They actually ended up hurting my ears from combat on the scarecrow I mentioned earlier.\n\nI've had enough of this game I can't stomach playing it any longer.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone at all.  You can find way better f2p games to play if that really is your fancy.  I mean for an f2p mmo, this game is at best something to do if you have absolutely nothing to do and even then it doesn't grab my attention enough to warrant playing more than a few minutes without wanting to play something else of quality.  I've played half-♥♥♥♥♥ korean mmo's that were far better than this.  I feel ashamed I wasted the time I have on this to even bother writing a review.  If you like less than mediocre 1990'esque garbage mmo's this one is RIGHT up your alley.","April 20, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you have lousy internet speed, a slow rig, and/or you can't afford better hack and slash iso RPGs then i recommend this game for you.\nThis game seems like a browser game.  It has to be played windowed, the character control is inaccurate, and the graphics aren't so hot.  It has unprecedented character growth (over level 600) and each character essentially has 2 classes.  The biggest problem is how poor the pathing is.  My pet can't run around a bush.  I tell him to attack and he stands there.  I have to run ahead 50 yards for him to finally advance.  The obstacles are a real issue when targeting as well.  An enemy that is 20% covered by a bush you can't hit, you don't have line of sight.  In order to hit him you have to run all the way to the other side of the bush, even from the side it still won't let you attack.  No, I didn't play the game very long.  When you run into these issues and you have far better and smoother iso RPGs to play then there is no reason to continue with this.  I probably would have played it back in 2003, when it came out.  Innexcusable that such flaws are still in the game.","April 18, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Took me an HOUR just to create an account. This shouldn't be an issue.... we have a Steam account already going, why do we have to have another account just to play? It should just use our already existing account info since the Steam version is seperate anyway. After finally taking the long route and getting tired of the slow and troublesomeness of the account creation via the ingame Steam web browser, I copy/pasted the web link into my usual browser to do it in a matter of seconds. After this, I was half tempted to not bother, was already irritated at it. But I created a character anyway to try it out. Not what I wanted nor expected. Clunky interface and controls, videos and such make it look like it should play more like a Diablo clone, plays more like a typical MMORPG. Now I am a big MMORPG player so this could have turned out ok in the end. But no.... gets worse. Even for a seasoned MMORPG player like myself, there was little to no help with what you should be doing. The in game help and guides and quest system leave much to be desired. I spent more time trying to find quests than I do in any other game. I want the quests themselves to take longer than finding them in the first place. After awhile I just was so bored I swear I saw the reaper peaking in the window to see if my soul was ready for the taking.\nIf you can get past the games difficulty to learn and adjust to, I am sure it could be a real gem with all the class and skill potential I saw. But if you are a jump in and pick it up in less than an hour person or want something easy to learn, this is not for you.\nWould let it suck my soul again! 10/10","April 30, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(like me)\nBut if you are a new player... read on.\n\nThe good things, many classes to choose from. Rather than your usual generic classes.\nMany different equipments or unique gears.\nCan customise your stats.\n\nThe bad\nClumsy movement, hard to pick items or coins at times, there is an obstacle in your way, laggy client at times. Outdated graphics.\n\n\nLame quests that requires you to go to point A to B, go back to A and asked you to go back to B to kill or get quest item again.\n(But ya, if you are not a quest person, you can ignore this.)\n\nBugs not fix, for weeks to months despite reported to them.\n\nThe ingame market that players are selling is quite expensive and overpriced.\nI am pretty sure, most of the equipments are not so expensive in previous servers.\n\nSo if you are a new player, pray hard that u meet someone good enough to help you with gears, or good luck hunting on your own.","July 4, 2015","false","909.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is cuite "laggy" to, not as smooth as other games. Then the "run as admin" command im not a big fan of! They need to work on this game more to be nice.

(Though this can easily be worked around/ worked with. And is sometimes comical\n"it is cool time" instead of this spell is on cooldown)\n\nThis game is unfriendly to new players. (Sure people will be NICE to you and you'll get power leveled some but people will ditch you randomly or stop after a few minutes of power leveling)\n\nThe game is mostly lonely until you reach the levels that most of the community is at. (The game really doesn't start being fun until this point)\n\nLeveling to 100 is probably the most boring part but after you get 100 more options for leveling / gear / skills open up and the game becomes more fun. (At current xp rates and playing solo it'll take ~20-30 hours of actual game time to get level 100 -note- this does not include being power leveled by friends/guilds/nice players)\n\nXp rates are VERY VERY LOW (You can buy xp boosts with real money and you also get "berries" which are similar to rested experience in other MMOs but cost 500,000 in-game gold to aquire as well as HOURS of logged out time)\n\nQuesting is NOT the most efficient way to level...in fact it's not recommended (grinding is really the only way to level)\n\nRequires a lot of time, THIS IS NOT A CASUAL GAME.\n\nPros:\n\nNear infinite skill combinations.\n\nWhimsical classes / skills. (I mean being a Princess who can transform into a rolling log to crush her enemies or getting really fat and squishing them under her butt is pretty whimsical)\n\nLeveling up / gearing up makes you feel powerful. (Starting off doing 1-2 dmg then doing 200-1000 then end levels 20,000 per hit makes you feel strong / accomplished)\n\nStable economy for trading (prices are pretty much set in stone and fluxuate slowly)\n\nPvP is fun and different\n\nGuilds add a sense of community\n\nRewarding if you spend your time correctly. (Gaining levels actually mean something in a game with 999 levels. A level 600 and 700 are two different worlds.)\n\nThe people on this game are nice. (Not all, but most)\n\n\n\nAll in all, this game is fun. I've played it for years so I know what to do when making a new character / starting over.\n\nIt's not new player friendly, but if you are a new player read blogs people have posted and it'll help you the best it can.\n\n-If you try this game and really bite down and do your best you won't regret it-\n\nIf you sink time into this game it will be very rewarding.","May 20, 2015","true","340.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The correct method is POWER LEVELING, yes powerleveling.... When this came out on steam i was excited\nand try it out again but i thought, i was like "Hey, it wasnt a bad game the grind was just too hard and the class i was playing(warrior) was total trash according to what every high level was saying" so this time when it came out on steam i pick the other sub class (Squire) which was alot stronger and tanky and better than warrior in every other way. I told you that because it one of the stuff i wanna bring up with the negative experience i had.\n\n- Premium  ~ Renting a Portal Sphere/Gate Sphere makes you a premium player giving you 100% added exp from monsters that are killed, Access to Premium dungeon/zone which give another 100% added exp bonus, 2 spot that can be saved anywhere and teleported to at anything time. A unlimited mount(mount are only aquired by having sphere or event that give a 1 time use one) and last unlimited return home scroll. If you are trying to reach far/late into the game this item is a must have or you will need to play double the time just to catch up.\n\n- POWER LEVELING  ~Im sure you all know what power leveling is but for those who doesnt its when a stronger or higher level person joins your party and kill high level mobs and you get massive amount of exp from it. So guys i got level 400+ in about a month(w/ sphere) and i got power leveled 95% of the way, i literally didnt have to do anything because of it, even if i tried i wasnt strong enough to even put a dent in the monster. This power leveling goes from level 1-460 from what i heard.\n\n- Unbalanced Classes  ~ An example here is how the warrior is outclasses in every way to his counter part(Squire) Better damage and defense skill. Tamers hitting 20k damage cap 2x/sec with each pet(2 max) at level 300 possible to aquire this by being butt naked or having the best gears doesnt matter much for tamers, While as a level 300 squire is hit for 700s and my strongest skill doing 6k every second. Dps was 7-8k while tamers were 80k+. This also makes them great power leveler, Thanks to all you tamer scrubs for powerleveling me. Some classes were suited for pvp as they say but the pvp is endgame contents and a bonus if you asked me. Im sure squire are one of the class suited for PvP but still...\n\nHere are some minor things\n\n-Player base is really small less than 200 daily players counting the alts that used for vending.\n\n-2 PvP modes  (Siege War, and anothering one i was allowed to play in because i was still too low level (302)\n\n-When people moving around they look like they are teleporting.\n\n- Enchanting EW weapon(strong weapons in the game)  Cash shop item that increases chance of upgrading/Safety from downgrading\n\nSorry bout this awful review of me just ranting about stuff, i dont write reviews much this is like my third one.\n","May 27, 2015","false","254.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played for at least 20 hours, and i think i'll spend more time with this game. I know that the gameplay isn't friendly and has problems, the graphics are outdated compared to actual games and at the start of the game it seems that there isn´t a story, maybe some years ago it would have been a very popular game where you could spend your time with friends, but now, there are a lot of games more atractive than this.\n\nNow there are some things that you need to know if you are planning to play despite everything:\n\n1. This game is from 2004, so it´s old, don´t expect amazing graphics or big updates, from time to time the devs do some maintenance and small updates.\n2. If you like games where you need to grind like a maniac you'll love it.\n3. Some people experience a problem when they try to login the first time, but don't let this discourage if you have this problem. My friend closed and re-entered to the game and he could log in. You can find a solution if you try.\n3. There're lot of things when you start to play and maybe you'll get lost, but don't think there isn't a tutorial. The problem is that you need to speak to every NPC in the town to know about the mechanics of the game and it's very tedious for some people.\n4. The menu is not friendly, for example you can put in fullscreen the game (it's in window mode for default),but you need to do before start the game in the options of the launcher..\n\nIn conclusion, if you like these kind of korean ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes and the graphics won't bother you so much, you´ll like it.\nIn other case, just don't trouble yourself; please don't get mad at this game because you don't like it and go search for other games ;)\n\n5/10","April 16","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Had some really great times, never did get to 200.\n\nCame back on and off to play a few times for old times sake. Unfortunately the translations are messed up, updated tutorial is nice(anyone remember the lodge?!), They have a NPC that gives buffs now instead of running into town and hoping you bump into a 2xx+ mage or GM at the fountain that buffs you and going on a killing spree. You can find mini-bosses in public dungeons now that "have a chance" to drop gear for your character, so that's.. kind of nice but time consuming, even lamer when people want to "sell" low pieces to new players. What the hell people. I noticed a lot of people multi-client now, which is pretty sad playing with yourself. Extremely sad how they don't reward players for class loyalty at all, literally any average player now has their own personal mage+priest on call. Gender lock/lack of customization never bothered me since it forced the community to define themselves through their personality instead of their dressed up vain alter egos like most MMORPGS now.\n\nExtremely confusing as to where to grind now from a lowbie(without friends), thanks to my old knowledge what i've discovered was you had to go to the bee farm and hope someone was grinding their lowbie then possibly Colossus and secret dungeons(limited daily, also i didn't notice any tutorials mentioned SDs but i could be wrong). Just difficult to even find people now, let alone parties, most people i met didn't even speak English.\n\nThey need to have a better guidance system for newer players on where to go,\n\nBack before all this we use to go from kobolds, do some quests there, then HOPE to get a spot in a party to grind on Golems, Entant(tree men) if you were less fortunate, Then hope for another party at Vampires/Vamps(Holy Augusta) and have a blast trying not to die, everything else after that is a blur to me till Elves(donut, had really really great times here), then Mercs and eventually some desert with spiders which i had only dreamed to become strong enough to kill(Also messing around with quests and hoarding every title).\n\nI really missed how wonderful of a community old RS had before it died, and the memories of party synergy and incredible teamwork. Good ol' memories of  Red Thieves(sometimes accidently dying and getting upset from getting healed).  GvGs were fun back then too, really casual community, pretty rare to find anyone toxic after a gvg dunno how it is now. Since back then everyone pretty much knew everyone past a certain level.\n\nI was hoping Redstone2(RS2) would have the same feel of the first one but they completely failed and ripped off Perfect world / WoW, so that sucks.\n\nWe need more class based-party based- dungeon/huge mob train friendly MMORPGS like Redstone!\n\nI have yet to play a game that was even remotely close to Redstone that offered the same teamwork/party/class based/huge mob trains/friendly community feel.\n\nMaybe i'll play again sometime soon, last time i had horrible issues trying to even connect to the game. EXTREMELY boring playing alone.\n\nAny vets from old RS feel free to add me on steam. I'm sure anyone i knew is 20-30+ now since they were all older than me.\n\nP.s Looking for the person who took the name "Dove". Just curious to see if you knew the original.\n\n\nTL;DR I extremely miss the old fantastic social community/teamwork of Redstone, current RS is a maze for new players and sadly nothing like before from my most recent experience. Walking sucks less with new buff NPC.","June 2","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
