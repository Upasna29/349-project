Nothing really changes, the stages just get longer and more frustrating. The gameplay boils down to trial and error. Even one misstep will make reaching the goal impossible and you have to keep starting over until you memorize the path perfectly. Sometimes a failure isn't even your fault as enemies can break the path too, even if you tried to keep them at bay with the otherwise completely useless bird. (Local co-op, yeah right.)\n\nIf this were just a calm, slow-paced puzzle game, I could have lived with that. But no, there are "timed" puzzles as well and they really irk my nerves. For example, there was this one stage in which you have to keep a snowball rolling so it will eventually reach a button which opens the gate to the exit. You have to keep opening gates and eliminating enemies from its path, but over half of the time you can't even see, where the snowball is going, no matter how you try to turn the camera. So besides learning the right path, you have to have almost pixel-perfect timing too.\n\nUtterly boring game with unlikable characters and a story that nobody cares for. I paid about 1€ for this and still I think I got ripped off.

Hamilton’s Great Adventure pushes out levels that pose mysteries and threats around every turn.\n\nStory:\nHamilton’s Great Adventure starts you off telling the stories of your great exploits to your granddaughter. You relive Hamilton’s glory days as you try to get the parts for a machine required for a purpose you will learn if you beat the campaign. You and your bird, Sasha, must complete puzzles from Brazil, Egypt, India, and the Secret Islands. As the game progress Hamilton gets further into his tale and new characters are introduced. The game includes hilarious dialogue, with an interesting story that keeps you guessing, and levels that keep posing new challenges. As you progress through the game you obtain answers to the mystery and you learn all about how the story began.\n\nGameplay:\nHamilton's Great Adventure is a puzzle solving game which knowing the answer is the key. Unlike some puzzle solving games where you can see the solution but be unable to complete the challenge because of a simple annoyance in clicking a button at exactly the right time. This game puts your mind to the test to solve puzzles by completing challenges by using the correct answer. It’s fun and rather simple, yet some puzzles are a little more difficult than others. The games graphics are not the best, but they are crisp and the story is pleasant. Sasha can be difficult to control and managing two characters is rather difficult if you are not on your toes.\n\nMenus:\nOne of my major gripes is that the in game menu is annoying to navigate. They tried to make the menu look like a book, but this is not very useful as you don't actually know what information is on what page. Ultimately you may have to flip through the whole book if you are looking for a simple answer.\n\nHints:\nThe pink vials are used to power up Hamilton’s special abilities. You can play as Sasha at the start of the level before activating the timer, so if you want to you can gather lots of the pink vials before even technically starting a level. You can also scare off the flying blowfish that attack Sasha by using a taunt when they are about to hit Sasha (it causes them to blow up and float away).\n\nResult:\nHamilton's Great Adventure doesn't pull you in keeping you on your toes from level to level; yet, the game offers fun puzzles which you can solve during your spare time. I would like it if they had checkpoints. I don't play too many puzzle game so maybe they all don't have any checkpoints during levels. If you like to solve puzzles and you're tired of traditional puzzle solving games that challenge a user based on luck or precise click timing then this is for you.\n\nPros:\n+Simple gameplay without too many commands to learn\n+Smooth movements\n+Fun and rather complex puzzles\n+Fantastic difficulty curve, the puzzles get gradually more difficult rather than exponentially\n+Nice art style which makes the games simple graphics seem rather elegant\n\nCons:\n-Very difficult menu navigation\n-Not a very riveting story (though it’s a puzzle game so you're here for the puzzles not for the tale)\n-Can be infuriating when you have solved the first part of the puzzle, but have to keep resolving to get to the second part of the puzzle","February 22, 2014","true","8.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

At some point in time Nvidia changed the location where the PhysX dlls get put. This game's installation seems to only be checking the old location, not the new one. It "fixes" this problem by going and installing an OLDER version of PhysX. Which still won't work, because it's still probably in the wrong spot? There's a thread in the game's forum where some sharp users discuss a few fixes for the problem.\n\nI don't really like either fix, because I'll have to remember to re-copy the DLLs from the new location into the game's own directory. If I get this problem with enough games (haven't yet) I may do what the video a user there shared and drop 'em into the System folder.

Trying to figure out the proper paths to finish the levels was somewhat enjoyable, but in the end it came down to trial and error and memorizing the correct steps.  All of the switches that need to be manipulated have markers with symbols/colors that correspond to their counterpart objects, which made their operation trivial.  There are items to be acquired and used, but I had only received one towards the end of when I quit playing and I didn't get chance to use it, so I can't comment on that mechanic.\n\nThe first "problem" I encountered with the game is the fact that the keyboard and gamepad can't be used at the same time.  This isn't really a problem, but when the game loads, there's no way to skip the intro screens with the gamepad.  If any key is pressed on the keyboard, the game disables the gamepad and then it has to be reenabled in the menu.\n\nAnother annoyance was the game crashing to desktop when killed by an enemy.  I could not reproduce the error by reloading the game and dying to that same enemy, but as soon as I would die to an enemy on a new level the error would reoccur.  And, of course, every time I would reload the game after a crash I would either have to sit through the intros or reenable the gamepad through the menu, adding to my frustration.  Fortunately dying to enemies wasn't a common occurrance.\n\nEven if the bugs were fixed, the game just feels too easy and I can't help but feel like I'm wasting time when I could be playing something else.  I don't recommend purchasing this game, not even if it were on sale.","September 10, 2014","false","2.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Hamilton can hook you, but the routine of dealing with slow restarts and fine-tuning the camera to your liking puts a hamper on your quest for fortune. Then again, what's a great adventure without a few setbacks?It's a pity that Hamilton's Great Adventure never got its 15 minutes of Internet fame, because it has tons of charm and it's very fun to play.Fat Shark's adventure platformer has fascinating level design and admirable cooperation of two main characters.Even though Hamilton's Great Adventure suffers from a story full of cliches and some shortcomings in gameplay, it's also very entertaining. Levels are well designed, and you need to plan ahead, unless you're after winding up stuck on a lonely, wooden platform in the middle of nowhere.

I want it!  Now!  Waiting for sale.  Nope.  Sale yet?  Yay! Finally!

It's charming, it has nice graphics and the puzzles are pretty straight forward.  The gameplay consists of traversing a map from point A to point B, while dealing with things such as switches, converyors, gates, etc. that limit your movement.  Your tools to deal with this are limited to add to the challenge.  That's really all there is to it!\n\nSo like I said, it's simple but it's not bad for a cheap little time waster.  Especially if you got a 90% off coupon from badge crafting.  The controls can be infuriating at times; Hamilton doesn't turn as responsibly as you'd like him to sometimes which leads to restarts of levels for stupid reasons.  Given time though, you can adjust to these mechanics issues and still make for a nice way to kill 10 minutes at a time.\n\nThey're attempting some kind of story to go along with Hamilton's little adventure here, but considering he and his grandaughter speak in grunts and coo's, I uh...could care less about that.","August 18, 2013","true","1.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

The goal of each level is to find a key, collect treasure, and make it to the exit alive (while avoiding the traps and baddies in your way). You not only have to figure out the proper way to solve each level, but some also require a fair bit of dexterity and timing. The story is told through cute animated cutscenes every few levels or so. Most levels are pretty short and can be completed with a little effort, but there are also a few "boss" and optional bonus levels which are much longer and harder. I finished the main game in a few hours, but eventually got frustrated with the bonus levels, as some of them are too long and one simple mistake means starting from the beginning.

Refer to the game's forum and notice how almost every thread is about how the game won't start. Its possible to correct the problem, but the developer hasn't bothered to update, fix, or write a solution, and there's a lot of confusion and misleading answers on the forum on how to get the game to run.\n\n#2: some idiot designed the game to be played with a 3 button mouse. Pictured in the game's instructions is a 2 button + scroll wheel mouse. A vital action is tied to the scroll wheel, and I can not for the life of me get the god damned thing to work. There's no way to change key bindings in the game, so I'm stuck. Thankfully I can get around this using a 360 controller, but still there's no excuse for something that stupid.\n\nIf neither of these two problems turn up for you, you're left with a very simple and boring game that (from what I hear) steadily becomes outrageously frustrating. However, its framed by a charming and compelling story. This is the 2nd Fat Shark game I've purchased.

Sadly they forgot to apply it\n\nThe graphics are nice but they look pixelated (not sure if it looks better on Alienware technology but they do state that it works best with that in the intro screen... every time you open the game) and you have some visual elements that seems like they could be interacted with, like flowers for example, but are just there for looks. Sometimes the graphical elements of the game prevents you from seeing the path and force you to rotate the camera but the camera rotation is limited and only let you see sideways partially.\n\nThe controls are a complete disaster. They could have made you switch controls from your character to the bird giving you full access to Sasha (the bird) thus allowing you to see the whole map from above or to simply toy around like a bird... but instead you just click where you want the bird to go mostly to collect pink fruits that act as bonus for your final score on each level and activate levers and stuff. Hamilton has simple 4 directional controls that allow you to slowly move one tile at the time... thus limiting you in your exploration and adding frustration to the whole experience because you can't fix a mistake in this game.  You moved on that breaking platform by accident because you didn't release the left directional button in time... deal with it, restart the whole level!\n\nThe music is nice but bland and repetitive. There is no voice acting and the story is told by sliding images that are about as entertaining as reading a very simplistic children's book (Note: Some children's book are fun to read as opposed to their storytelling)\n\nIt seems like the game was rushed and that the developers wanted to deliver more then what they could and that is why this game gets the "could have been"stamp of disapproval.\n\n3/10\n\n(NB: The whole game could easily be fixed and transformed into something that deserve a 7 or even 8 on 10 and I wish Fatshark would revisit this game since it could become a nice videogame franchise.)","May 26, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

It has polished written all over it, except for one tiny thing; the bird controls. You use the mouse to guide your bird towards treasures and fruit, as well as triggers. But since you view the game from a fixed perspective (not entirely true as you can rotate and zoom) it's hard to judge if the bird is going to the right place, resulting in clicking the same place more than once, which is a shame, because that really shouldn't be necessary. Other than that, the puzzles are mostly fun to do (prepare to get frustrated), the graphics are cute and the sounds get the job done.\nHamilton's Great Adventure is great value for your money.\n\n[Rating: 80/100]","December 26, 2011","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

What could have been a mediocre game was ruined by terrible game design and controls. First off, the controls. The game does not have free movement, there are tiles and you can only move up/down/left/right on the tiles. This makes control very annoying. Half the time you will run down and hold run and then stop on a tile only to have the game make you keep running because there is an invisible sensory on the tiles that says if you are past a certain point you move down. Also if you are running down and press over if you are not exactly in the center of the tile you will not be able to move over, another stupid problem when there is water pushing you. Free running would have easily fixed these.\nThen there is the gameplay. Instead of using logic, reflexes, quick thinking, and innovation, you are forced to figure out the exact single path they want you to take, enforced by tiles that break after one use, making you get stuck if you didn't pick the single right path. This leads to trial and error which is the worst kind of puzzle game. Finally there is the level design. For some reason the dip-sh!t developers haven't learned anything from the 1990's where if you died you had to restart the entire level over again. One level had a super annoying part at the end of the level that you have to memorize a certain path of spikes and get through it twice, while sliding down a river which means you have to time getting into the traps. I spent 30 minutes on the level, only because of this part, but 9/10 of the time was redoing the entire level following their exact path, to get to the end and die because of poor level design or control design. If they were to have a checkpoint so I didn't have to keep rebeating the 2 min part that I've beaten 2k times already I would have been actually able to try and beat the part. Very stupid they didn't think of that part. If you are going to put hard parts in, thats fine, but don't make me rebeat the entire level every time to get to the end for this part, just to artificially inflate game length, ala SMB.\nI finally realized "life's too short" to waste replaying the same level to get to a part that they could have easily fixed using their brains, especially for a game that was just "meh" to begin with. 4/10.","February 10, 2015","false","2.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

(Providing you get it to work).\n\nI consider myself a very technically able person, however this took me 2 hours to get it working, after messing around with various settings and uninstalling the outdated junk that came with this. (I never managed to get the sound working, which was OK for me, I viewed a few video's and the sound was far too repetative).\n\nI love puzzles games and I've played a wide variety of them.\n\nHowever this game is just boring, repetative and the timing sections for this game are a nightmare.\nThere's no quick save or check point system, so if you've got to go somewhere or you're busy, that's tough, and some levels do tend to go on for quite a bit.\n\nThere are 4 stages in the game with about 13 Main story levels and 6-7 bonus levels. So there's about 64 levels. If you manage to find enjoyment in this game, then you'll be sure to spend a long time on the game, which admittidly is good for those that do enjoy the game. However the DLC which is for 3 levels is a joke. Not to mention the game crashed a total of 22 times for me on the DLC levels, the rest of the game never crashed, so not sure what was going on there,\n\nWhilst each stage is just a reskinned version of the previous stage, I'm fine with that and I find it understandable.\n\nThe story is pretty 'meh' but at least they tried.\n\nIf you love puzzles and have a high tolerance (I thought I did) then this game may be for you, but I'd recommend staying far away from this game.","December 2, 2013","false","23.6"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","2"

After the truck grinds to a halt, he gets out and spends twenty minutes explaining the control system, like I'm some sort of three year old who's never held a PlayStation controller before.\n\nAnyway, when Hamilton discovers that The Patriots have stolen the Chintamani Stone he rushes straight towards an Uncharted™ temple. After a mind-boggling fight with his own shadow that spoke with a heavy Russian accent (Because all Russians are evil), Hamilton finally saves the day from Captain Hook and his cronies and goes back home to have a nice cup of tea?\n\nShould you buy the game?

I regret purchasing this game at the sale price of 1 dollar. The puzzles were childishly simple, and the game encourages you to collect treasures with the bird, which is a slow and painstaking process, especially since it has nothing to do with the actual gameplay. The controls on the bird were annoyingly slow and frustrating for something that essentially comes down to mousing around the screen. All I got out of this game was dissapointing wasted time, and carpal tunnel.","September 12, 2013","false","8.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
