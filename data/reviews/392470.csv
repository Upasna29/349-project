"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkWriter/recommended/392470/","TheDarkWriter","Alpha Inu Sakuya~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkWriter/","136 products in account","Here's the deal. Koei has been making these two grand strategy game series called Romance of the Three Kingdom and Nobunaga's ambition. You're placed on a large map of China and/or Japan respectively and you take control of one of the historical warlords in the period. You're given control of the finances, diplomacy, and the military features of the realm and you're given the huge task of reuniting a tortured land and placing it under your control.\n\nHowever, for the longest time American and Europe gamers have been given a raw deal. Koei has always given us the raw game, 1.0, without any of the accompanying DLC in the Power-Up Kit. This happened time and again during the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and continued throughout the Nobunaga's Ambition series. This is DLC that added additional features to the game. Features such as new cities, new officers, foreign nations interfering positively or negatively for your faction, enchanted items or magic that change the way battles are fought. All sorts of cool stuff which never made it to us American gamers. We got the base game and that's it. If you didn't like it, you had to either pirate the game or you were out of luck. And even then, the pirated games were poorly translated.\n\nThis time, the situation is different. The game itself comes prepackaged with all DLC in the Power Kit enabled. All sorts of stuff has been added to the game since it has been released and with this special edition release, you essentially get all of that for free. The only thing you'd have to pay for is for additional starting scenarios, even these come free if you take advantage of their special release. And honestly, they're not really needed. You're getting such a good deal with this game already. Additional scenarios are just icing on the cake.\n\nThe game itself brings tremendous depth. Each individual officer in the game has their own set of skills. Some may be good at martial arms, others may delve into politics. Some officers may be good at everything, others nothing. The factions are divided in power between the castles and the stronger fortresses which protect their fiefs. Fiefs that can be improved by talented officers to produce more food, gold, and fighting men as time goes on. This will consist of most of your early game. You will want to build up your fiefs as quickly as possible. You won't be able to take over the land if you cannot bring an army to the field!\n\nIn addition to an army, the game introduces a new wrinkle in the form of tribes. There are many factions fighting over the land of Japan, but in addition to these there are several neutral 'tribes' that simply want to get along in a land divided by war. Each month, you can dedicate officers and a portion of gold each month to compete with other clans for the loyalty of this tribe! The higher their loyalty, the more they will do for you, such as providing gold and resources and helping you out in battle if you fight near their location. Eventually, if their loyalty reaches 100%, you can even get them to swear their complete loyalty to you and assemilate their tribe into one of your cities, giving them a significant boost to your population along with all the bonuses that it entails. Sometimes, the leader of the tribe will join you as an officer, giving you another asset to help improve your lands domestically and spread your influence abroad.\n\nDiplomacy makes its return in two forms. Traditional and covert operations. On one hand, you can use diplomacy and give gifts of gold and unique items to other forces in order to secure good relations with them. Better relations secure longer alliances, measured in 6th months, 1 year, and 2 year, and even permanent agreements if you have a spare daughter for a marriage alliance. Others are more brief, such as requesting to borrow troops from an ally temporarily to give you that edge in a key battle. If you gather enough allies, you can even organize a large coalition with the combined objective to take down a faction that has grown too large to take on alone. But beware! Friends today may become enemies tomorrow. Treat your friends well so that they will always return the favor.\n\nCovertly, you can send officers into enemy territory to try to convince an enemy officer to betray his lord. These operations sometimes take years to complete, but they are very much worth it, and can sometimes be the tide you need to turn a battle, sometimes even a war, permanently into your favor.\n\nWars take a while to get to, but once you do it is clear this is where the game has its focus on and where it shines the best. Everything you have done up until now comes into account. The number of your troops that arrive on the field, your allies and their proximity to the battle, the weapons and equipment your soldiers are equipped with, the amount of food you take with you, the tribes you have gained loyalty with and whether they are close to you or not, the location of the battle, the decisions you make during the battle and the deployment of your troops. Literally everything has a factor of whether you win or lose the battle and what you can do afterwards. Sometimes you will win a costly battle, but find yourself unable to follow up the victory because you have lost too many men and you cannot conduct an effective seige safely. Sometimes you have conducted bad diplomacy that has surrounded yourself with enemies who quickly jump on your now weakened clan, resulting in a game over! The wise lord who triumpths over his enemies conducts his operations cautiously, taking advantage of every opportunity he can get! As the Art of War dictates, he secures himself against the possibility of defeat and takes advantages of the opportunities his enemies present to him. If you do this, you will be successful.\n\nFinally, the world itself is an active, rapidly changing world. Events that shake the land will strike at random, such as earthquakes or tsunamis. Eventually foreigners will come, bringing along their religions and advanced technologies. This introduces muskets to the game, which Nobunaga historically used to bring a large part of the continent under his control. If you can take advantage of this technology early, it can bring you a huge advantage. There are other events that can effect you as well, such as story events that can change the very fate of your clan, but I don't want to spoil too much. You'll have to find that stuff out for yourselves!\n\nThe game in general is for the patient, calm types who like to sit around and plot global domination. The depth this game provides and the strategies you can take to bring yourself both victory and defeat are endless. A single playthrough can take several hours for a single faction...and that's if you never make a single mistake or lose a battle...which you will. There are certain things out of your control and even the wisest general cannot see everything outside of his domain.\n\nIf you have the patience, the intellect, and the courage to dedicate yourself to a strategy game of epic proportions, this game is for you.\n\nIf you want a game that provides quick satisfaction for minimal effort, go play Call of Duty.\n\nThat is all.\n\nAlso you can marry officers to cute maidens to make them part of your family. Their children will later on become your own officers and even the heir to your clan if you're marrying off your sons. 10/10 would ship couples again.","September 1, 2015","true","29.1"," 657 of 698 people (94%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","94","657","698","45","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemonekw/recommended/392470/","lemonekw","Full Potato Alchemist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemonekw/","243 products in account","UPDATE: I added a short FAQ at the bottom of the review, it is a good tl;dr if you have a quick question.\n\nIf you have ever played any of the romance of the three kingdom games, or nobunagas ambition games you must get this game!\n\nHowever chances are you haven't since those series dont have many titles localized in english.\n\nThis game is quite similar to Europa Universalis in my opinion, but with many different mechanics. The combat however is somewhat more like Total War then like Europa. And there is just so much to do in this game! I think both players who aren't new to hardcare strategy games like Europa and more casual players who play the odd Civilization, Total War, or Dynasty Warriors Empires games will very very much enjoy this game.\n\nI haven't experienced any bugs yet which is nice because a lot of the other koei releases as of recent havent been great for pc. From what I have gathered this isn't a port since it was made on pc first which is also great.\n\nThe create/edit officer this time around is very very indepth! I am still working on my first officer an hour in and am not even halfway done!\n\nPersonally I love the theme of this game, it has very beautiful artwork and music. The historical theme is very epic and has some really cool back story to it too. You can play from a historical scenario, or play the fictional scenario and do things your way. A lot of fun options to play around with to really make it your own when you start a new game.\n\nWhile not as indepth as europa, this game comes close but is 100x easier and more visually appealing. The combat is a lot more indepth then Civ 5 as is the diplomatic aspects of this game as well. The game is very easy to pickup once you get into things!\n\nYou get to command units of thousands of troops led by unique officers who all have their own cool ability and tactics that can be used to put interesting strategies into action. You can even search for hidden roads and stuff to help you plan battles ahead of time.\n\nBetween managing diplomacy with neighbouring clans, fighting a war with another clan, trying to entice an enemy officer into joining my clan, developing my states and teaching my officers new abilities I am having a lot of fun! This was a well spent $60, I would definately recommend this to all my friends.\n\nPS - For those of you who are curious this does come with the Power Up Kit (if you don't know what this means, in simple terms it's just more customization options and such)\n\nEDIT: I wanted to update my review a little to answer a few questions.\n1. How is the performance?\nFrom what I've read people are managing to run this on older system, I have a completely overkill computer so I'm not sure myself what the minimum requirements would be to run this game  however I have yet to run into any sort of lag or buggyness, I expect this game to be well optimized since it was made for the pc first (so not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port for once, thank you koei). PS I am on windows 10 64bit, i5 3570, 8gb ram and nvidia gtx 970\n\n2. How is the combat system?\nOk so I've said it was totalwar like, but that was a bit vague right? So not everyone has played total war so I will try and explain without comparing to total war. So combat seemed rather straight foward at first, it was like the classic rotk system where you kinda just sent your platoon out and watched them mindlessly kill each other. However things like passive skills, active abilities (which sort of activate randomly and can easily change the tide of battles)  and stats like INT, VAL and LEA play a important role to winning battles. There was one thing that bothered me, instead of being able to freely move units wherever on the map, they are tied down to board game like routes called roads (roadwork can be done to improve travel speed). I was wondering why the combat felt like it was built on bogged down rotk mechanics. Then I saw this little button that would pop up over an units when they are enganged in battle, clicking it takes you into a war map with all currently engaged units that is more akin to the combat system of previous nobunaga's ambition games. This is where you can freely control your units, choose when to use your officer abilitys, use terrain advantage (barricades, turrets, etc) or even choose to seige the base (if nearby one) instead of enganging in direct combat. In this mode I have both completely wiped without dealing any casualties to the enemy officer, and have won impossible (etc 7000 vs my 3000) battles with the use of strategy. There are a lot of cool abilities and you can choose to engange in melee or ranged combat here. Horses can be used to charge the enemy with great speed and a high chance to confuse them, muskets can be unloaded which can also confuse the enemy, and you can use any of you adjucant officer abilities as well (depending on how much "control" you have over your unit).\n\n3. How agressive is the ai?\nThere is a agressiveness setting you can change before starting your game, I have it set to high, so when I send units out the neigbouring states immediately send units to my border and draw close when I send them out to fight. Some times it is a bit frustrating, because often after taking a fort or so, it is immediately attacked by another clan, while I was still new to the game I lost many newly captured forts like this. It was quite annoying, this lead to me to start planning more intricate strategies involving split attacks, attempts to form alliances etc. What bugs me though is how handicapped you are if you decided to play the game starting with only 1 fort, you dont have enough labor to make any facilities and you are lacking in nearly everything, it's too expensive to endeavour in any kind of diplomacy. So here i found my self resorting to underhanded tactics (waiting for others to war, etc), and submitting myself to another clan (with this I get an ally and foreign income).\n\nI hope I've cleared up most of the questions here, if any of you have other questions feel free to ask, I will try and update my review with answers to your question!","September 1, 2015","true","31.0"," 275 of 299 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","275","299","7","7"

Coming from a Shogun 2 total war fanatic standpoint, this provides a very different experience, that somehow sits between a Paradox game like CK2 (or Sengoku) and something a bit lighter like the total war series.\n\nBattles are automatically fought out as the month progresses and you can dip in and try to turn them in your favour if you want to. There are some great positioning based mechanics at work here that make positioning your forces or paramount importance to victory, attacking from different directions and defending or bypassing choke points, are both important things to understand, and provide a lot of enjoyment.\n\nManagement of your "Officers" is a huge part of the game and I'd say this makes it more like the aforementioned Paradox titles, land management is also important, and takes up much of your time.\nThere is a fun internal and external political system to maneuver and this allows you to do some very fun things like forming coalitions against powerful enemies and calling friends to fight for you, you can even mediate peace between two antagonists!\n\nAhh! so much I could write, but to save you reading a truly monumental wall of text, I'll say this:\n\nIf you:\n\nLike Paradox grand Strategy: This could be fun for you, a little less fiddly, a little less in depth and Byzantine, but still plenty to do and the war management system is superbly good even without zooming in for the battles.\n\nLike Total War: If you really only play for the tactical battles this may not be your cup of tea, it is undoubtedly a lot simpler and very strategy heavy by comparison. For people who like the strategy side of it or are balanced in their interest, this is well worth a look, go check out a lets play or two.\n\nSengoku Jidai\Japanese history fans: This stuff is catnip for me and I loved following the historic quests, learning new things about the events and personalities of the era and loved many of the realistic touches. Simply superb!\n\nGraphics- not bad, pretty at times\nSound- great soundtrack and other ambient\Ui sounds\nStrategy gameplay- Deep with lots do do and lots to think about\nTactical gameplay- Simple but fun diversion with good impact on play if you opt in to it\nPerformance- Ran flawlessly for me, minimal loading times\nAI Performance: I really couldn't say. Easy is just that, I hear its competent on higher difficulties\nLocalisation- Pretty good though not without a few easily overlooked errors\nMultiplayer-None, so don't buy it if you want that\nControls and UI- not too bad, takes a little getting used to and vassal management takes a while (might be missing something)\n\nOverall: Great game I will be playing for a long time to come if my first impressions hold true- Ay Ay Ooooohhhhhh!/10","September 2, 2015","true","32.7"," 155 of 165 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","155","165","10","10"

Second if you want to have a long save that is enjoyable throughout then I recommend this (I'd suggest starting as a clan such as the Hojo, Amago or Ouchi for starters as they are the strongest).\n\nI've done two playthroughs. One as the Satomi (a small clan which often is crushed when used by the AI) and the Takeda (a hard starting clan because there are two stronger clans South of your land).\n\nWith the Satomi game it came to a standstill because I had all of the east and required a mere ten more castles plus Kyoto to become Shogun. Where Nobunaga Oda held most of the West par Shimazu land. With only us three factions and none able to break the other it didnt seem anyone was getting anywhere.\n\nMy new save I took over Japan fully. Even though I became Shogun and could enact a ''No More War'' Policy which would win the game for me anyway. I thought to myself ''Largest army... Best Generals.... Still got my orginal ruler...'' and continued to conquer until Japan was united.\n\nThe main thing is in this game is to make sure Oda Clan does not expand. If they do and Nobunaga takes over then you will struggle and end up like my Satomi as he becames all too powerful.\n\nGood things:\nEnding is amazing\nGame overall is easy to grasp after 5 hours\nTons of clans to play, so if you finish one you can pick another\nGood for learning\nNobunaga is a monster to face in battle\n\nBad things:\nReligion has next to no affact in this game which is a huge dissapointment for me\nNo Ikko Ikki (as far as I have noticed)\nYour not able to check your rulers age\nWould be nice for a family tree. So I can see who is in my family (Not all sons have the last name as ruler making it slightly harder)\n\nOverall I rate this game 98/100. Only issues is no family tree which would of been somewhat good and useful and lack of religion affacting clans.\nTo those who buy this game have fun !

If you're a fan of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series then you're going to like this. Even then, based on the 4x and real time battle mechanics, if you're a Total War fan, you may enjoy this as well.\n\nEssentially, you choose one of several scenarios and choose one of hundreds of different playable characters (not counting the ones you can create yourself) and attempt to unite Japan during the Sengoku Jidai period. Yes, yes, I know, isn't the Warring States starting to get a bit old? Well, this is actually a very refreshing take on it because it's a story driven experience where you receive Historical quests that creates an interesting world in Feudal Japan (as Koei is apt to do). You develop your nation, starting with just a city, using your officers and as you grow economically, you build up militarily. You attack neighbors, convert their officers and make alliances where needed to ensure victory and further grow the amoeba that is your clan. On top of this, the atmosphere of the game is absolutely beautiful, with thriving immersive cities that actually grow visually as you develop them. You just built Stone Walls? Well you actually see Stone Walls on your Castle now.  I will say, the UI can be a little troublesome at times but if you take your time and play the tutorial, you should be able to pick it up rather quickly. There are also a metric tonne worth of actions you can take as compared to ROTK games. As a fan of Koei's Strategy games, I was pleasantly surprised to see this and I'm glad to say I have not been disappointed. Highly recommended!\n\nUpdate: 3 hours in, no crashes, very good optimization as far as I can tell. AI can be ruthless. Take your time building up.

There are many aspects to the game. It runs in monthly turns. Military orders may be given during the turn, as the month passes by. Deploying and moving troops is possible. Of course, during the Council phase which occurs in between turns, military deployments and movement orders may also be given.\n\nThe economy aspect of the game is pretty neat. You can do all sorts of economic things. These include increasing your economy (agriculture for provisions, crafts for gold, and conscripts for troop increases), construct special buildings in city districts, change city district types (food, cash, troops), build new districts once city population increases, improve defenses, increase road size (impacts troop movements and city populations). There are a few more things as well, such as building a new Fortress (small city).\n\nDiplomacy is cool. You can improve your rating with another clan, persuade minor Tribes to your side (they give troops in battle or special income or you can even have them join a nearby city, increasing that city's population), give gifts to Clans (makes them friendly for a few months) or Officers (officers improve their loyalty), place a Lord at a castle/fortress, or even marry people to gain loyalty or alliances. If anoth Clan is at 40+ diplomacy you can request troops from them. Neat.\n\nMilitary battles play out on the strategic map. Optionally if there are enough troops engaged you can control the troops directly, similar to the Totwl War series. Personally I use the strategic battles as I prefer them. When you surround a castle/fortress you need as many troops as that location's defense has in order to lay siege and capture.\n\nA Castle has a larger town than a Fortress fyi.\n\nThere are a few more things you can do, such as hire ronin as leaders. This game has many things to do.\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty neat wargame.

It also gives much more information about the time, giving you visual novel style information about different clans, people and historical events which is an unexpected joy, making the country feel more alive.\n\nThere is still fights between clans, these are not as good as aformentioned Shogun 2, but you cannot just abuse the AI and win when it is 10 to 1. In this game it is much more simplified, but difficult (watch let's play vids for a good look before buying), every loss will affect you, every win will make the game hard later on as other clans start fearing/admiring you.\n\nTLDR\nWant an great strategy game that focuses on the Sengoku Jidai where there is plenty of detail and a game to waste plenty of hours, try out this.\n\nStory time\nAfter downloading the game, I started out the game playing the 'tutorial' scenario where I lost the first battle and was booted back to the Main Menu. Annoyed at this, I started the second scenario, focusing on the events of Nobunaga's father, Oda Nobuhide, Stating off in my small province of Owari, I started playing with the features, slowly building my towns and my armies. After 1 hour of messing around, I started to attack a single clan, winnning a province and stroking my ego. Choosing to follow historical missions of the time for the daimyo, I eventually came to fight the Imagawa and the Saito. After securing allies, I attacked with my petty force of around 3000 with my allies force of over 10,000, I defeated the Saito, caputing the daimyo and coverting him to my side (a real prize).\n\nAfter defeating him, I made my way south, attacking the next enemy, over the next 5 hours, I took that clan down to one base (not with frustration or Save Scumming, but with fun). Once they were no longer a threat, I started to regroup and attack the nearby TAKEDA clan because every time I play a game about this era, I always attack them. Well turns out that was a stupid idea, continually being defeated by their strategy and my poor logistic handling. When I finally got a truce, I had only taken 1 province and it was continually being attack from a northern enemy clan, trying to take it without success.\n\nLeaving 10,000 troops there, I pulled back and began focusing on the last Imagawa base I had ignored, putting together another 10,000 to try and take it. There was a catch however, on the other side of the Imagawa were the powerful Hojo clan besieging them, so I smashed their army in the side, taking the castle without loss. HORRIBLE CHOICE IN FORESIGHT. For the next hour or so was mainly diplomacy and building, making the Takeda neutral and I could ask them to lead a hand if needed. Then THIS HAPPENED, Oda Nobunaga appeared as an officer and straight away informed me that 40,000 Hojo troops are comming my way. Holy ♥♥♥♥, 40k? I have 10k left at home and 10k at the north, how can I do this? The enemies came thundering across their land, besiging my castle that I had taken, smashing my armies and forcing me to ally with an enemy clan of the hojo and requesting the Takeda (who were close) to give me a hand.\n\nTHIS is where the game started to shine for me. Losing battles against them, I realised something, I still had 10k forces north to use and they were close to the hojo, but on the other side of the clan, So I had an awesome idea. I got those 10k soldiers to storm into their land, besiging 3 castles at once. The enemy AI came to realise what was happening and pulled some of the forces back to defend when suddenly the Takeda forces showed up at two sides, blocking the force of  about 35k.\n\nWith MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TROOPS IN ONE SPOT, the game stopped and told me of the 'MASS BATTLE' mode. "What is this?" I replied before clicking this. Entering a battle with 40k soldiers, equally matched I had a battle with the enemy. Eventually winning, the Hojo were in retreat, the 'spine was broken'. Seeing this other neutral clans started attacking the hojo, becomming a land grab.\nThat is where I am up to after playing 20 hours. Still have the of Japan to go. ^_^","September 5, 2015","true","83.4"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","43","50","7","0"

Historical Strategy games that are anything more than wargames are few and far between, and this one looked really well done, and its made by a developer with decades of experience on this genre.\n\nMost of the gameplay would fall somewhere a bit closer to Total War than to Europa Universalis. The turn-based aspects, and the way you improve each holding, are very reminiscent of the strategic portion of Total War games. The character with attributes, traits, loyalties and such also greatly remind of that series, and in a good way. The game pacing is akin to that of Europa Universalis (besides the fact that this one has turn-based elements).\n\nThe combat, despite looking slightly like TW, is very simplistic. And that's not a bad thing, it goes nicely with the game flow, and the mechanics that guide combat are tied to many other aspects of the game.\n\nThe game also has (historical?) quests for each clan in each campaign, giving a pretty nice incentive for replayability. Those remind me a little bit of the main campaigns from the Hegemony game series.\n\nSpeaking of the Hegemony game series, this game also has a Supply mechanic that is very reminiscent of it. Troops need supply, and they need to refill it periodically - you can't sustain a long distance war forever.\n\nAll in all, this seems to be a really solid game for those that enjoy Grand Strategy games.","September 3, 2015","true","13.8"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","37","44","0","0"

This is a hardcore Grand Strategy game that's the newest "Nobunaga's ambition".\nIt's got wonderful graphics, Smooth Economy controls, Engaging sound, Historial Event and Light Battle field strategy...\n\nIt may look very simple on the outside but does have alot indepth hidden strategy that you need to employ to end the Sengaku Era Japan.\n\nThe indepth tactical element is much simpler then Crusader Kings 2 but it's more complicated then all previous Romance of the Three kingdoms or Nobunaga's ambition games.\n\nEach turn in this game is 1 month instead of of seasons or years make the game feel very slow at times but once combat is on.. it feels very fast at times...\n\nEverything was done really well but it will feel very repetitive to any new comers of this game serie.\n\nI have played over 30 hours now but i only unified less then 1/4 of Japan on my very first game. So this game will probably rack up the same amount of hours I have played for CK2 sooner or later.\n\nThere is a in game achievement system but it doesn't have steam achievement.\n\nPrice of this game is also very high like most japanese game that's landed in Steam store.\n\n8.5/10 but I can only recommend to veterns of this serie and hardcore grand strategy lover...

It's apples and oranges and both can be equally awesome in their own right.\n\nThe strengths of Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence as I see them are in its kingdom management gameplay, its fidelity in relaying historical events of this period in Japan, and the level of detail put into characters that inhabit the game. When managing your kingdom (or Daimyo-dom?) your various castles and towns have districts within them that you can upgrade to improve their perfromance at generating a resource (gold, provisions or conscripts) for your clan. There may be special locations in the area that if found further increase a given districts production. You can also add more districts to most castle/town areas after certain requirements are met. Add to this other infrastructure options such as road upgrades, fortifications, fortresses (not a typo, both are a thing) and you have many options on the way your clans lands look and play.\n\nIf you have never played a KOEI game and are a history fan, shame on you. Once again KOEI brings to the table a level of detail and polish on relaying historical events in the prescribed setting at a high level. If you like to read and enjoy story it is very likely you will find this aspects of the game entertaining. Unless you are a scholar in Japanese history of this period you will most certainly learn a few things. They also explain why certain characters did what they did in the context of the period.\n\nSpeaking of characters, they are what drive your clan. They have four abilities (Leadership, Valor, Intelligence and Politics) which are used to complete various actions in the game. They also have (up to 20) traits that give various benefits based on the action taken. Characters can gain traits through events while playing and you can also create your own characters and assign traits to them as well.\n\nLastly, combat can be handled at the macro and micro levels where in the former you joint point your forces at a target and let them handle it and in the latter you can direct units individually on the field, use leader special abilities and make other tactical decisions in a "real-time pauseable" environment.\n\nVery happy that KOEI decided to release this game in english. I hope they continue to release updated versions of their other non-Dynasty Warriors catalogue as well. If done at this game's level of detail and polish they will be well worth the money.","September 3, 2015","true","65.3"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","2"

This game is quite the opposite. This is my first Nobunaga's Ambition game although I've play all of the Romance of The Three kingdoms and I have to say wow. This game is great. The UI in the game is simple, yet the asthetics is beautiful. I went from thinking I'll try to game out for one hour to 6 hours later trying to battle another rivial clan for some territory. The AI management system makes this game alot for simple to handled and you don't have to micro manage all your cities...llike civilization. The information tab is  nice and doesn't blog you with popups unlike civilization where every turn you are bombarded  with the annoying ♥♥♥ 10000 popups on the right side of the screen.\n\nPros-\n-The right balance between simplicity and complexity for the user interface\n-Challenging and fun AI to fight, found myself battling another clan back and forth for like 2hrs over a few towns.\n-Dynamic ways to fite you battles, (Politics matter for once in a game)\n\nCons-\n-lack of spy game system\n- not as many stategies as the ROTK seriers\n\nOverall Great game if you are a fan of the ROTK series, if not buy it on sale or when the price drops.","September 5, 2015","true","55.6"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","0"

I have played all the RTK games from part 1 and up that had been put out in English so I was excited when this came out in English because Koei has  been skipping English releases of its war games lately and all we have gotten is DW crap.\n\nWhy is it disappointing ya might ask? Well its just a basic game, its like they took all the basics that a game like this needed. Sure theirs some fighting and some diplomacy and you can build in your cites but its all at basic levels.\n\nThe fighting is so limited all you can really do is pincer attack to in cress damage and use each officers one combat ability they get. Thats it, other then that you just mostly sit there and watch the troops run at each other until its over. No real "grand strategy" built into this so called Grand Strategy game. Pretty much every other game out there has more depth to its combat which is a real shame because this game has next to nothing else in it but the combat.\n\nThe only thing that has any depth  is the city building and  truth be told it don't have much to it either. Most cites start out with a few plots of land mostly set in groups of three and you can pick what to build on them. Crafts, farm, or conscripts and wach of these plots of lands can build a few different things that in cress what resources you get. If ya build the right stuff and have big enough city you can pick a "epic" type building for your castle that gives extra bonuses but nothing that special.\n\nDiplomacy is pretty shallow, you end an officer to talk to a kingdom every turn to build up your trust and at certain levels you can ask for troops, ask for an alliance for a few months to a year and at 100% offer to marry the two clans together for an alliance that lasts as long as they stay married. AND thats it.... Yeah really thats it, nothing ever really becomes of the alliance you still have to spend trust to ask for help from each other and nothing to ever suggest two people from your clans are married or any talk of their kinds they have together. Recruiting an officer works pretty much the same way, you send a guy to talk to them for months till they build up enough discontent to turn on their current plan. At 40 they agree not to fight for for 3 months, at 80 they agree to join you if they faceyou in combat within a set amount of months and at 100 you can just get them to come straight over to you. Their is a thing with low end tribes where the clans oaround them can buy them off to pay for them to fight for them and thats it.\n\nFamily is just the same as diplomacy you have random kids and they grow up to be officers or of they are females you can make them officers or pick to have them be maidens to marry off. Theirs no real since of it being a clan or family at any point in the game. Just hey we are a clan... then a whole lot of nothing else about it, which is soooo disappointing since clans and family are such a big part of that era in japan's history.\n\nThats pretty much the game. Yeah thats it..... Even in the Nes  Noabunaga's Ambition had more depth, you could plot and hire nija's to assassinate people or set fire to their supplies or cause riots but in this one you can't do any thing else.\n\nWhy are their so many good reviews about the game with very little to say about it? Well people wana talk it up to get others to buy it, they want to show koei that their really is a market for other games besides DW in English and like me they was willing to spend $50 for a sub par game in the hopes that we will get better ones some day. But in all honestly the game is not worth it enless do you want to support other English titles, its just so lacking and boring in every area of the game. <shrugs>","December 15, 2015","false","53.8"," 62 of 96 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","62","96","2","2"

I have had fun with it but became bored after a time, due to the repetitive nature of the game. At first there seemed to be a plethora of things to do, but after a certain time, you realize that the strategy and empire building options are limited. It is certainly not worth the $60 price tag. I would recommend the game @ $30 or less.

It is so fun and addicting. I have to admit I first pirated the game and played non-stop. I love it so much I decide to pay 90 dollars to get all DLC + the game on Steam. This game got the history right and is more focused on complicated AI, diplomacy, politics and strategy rather than combat. A lot of people compare this to Shogun 2 and the major difference is that Shogun 2 is more combat oriented and this game is much better in the things I mentioned above. As someone who love the period and knows the history, this is like a dream come true.\nPro:\n1. fairly advanced AI tested (combat, diplomacy, coalition, province control etc) The AI is much better compare to a lot of other games and it makes the game interesting. They behave like a real person. They get afraid when you grow powerful and forms coalitions against you. Your allies will respect you and aid you with all they've got. Province AI is very aggressive and very much involved with the game\n2. Politics and Diplomacy is very much functional and has drastic effects in the game. Playing without the use of these functions is very difficult.\n3. Game runs smoothly with no crash or any problem whatsoever.\n4. Allow players to fully customize the experience such as editing every character, create new ones, change development speed etc.\n5. Rich with history\n\nCon:\n1. Not very new player friendly. The tutorial is lackluster and a lot of the things are not explained making it hard to gain new player's favors.\n2. Have some errors and problems but non that will break the game.\n3. UI is a bit annoying and switching between modes can be a lot of work while you try to micro manage things on the map. Certain stats disappear but it is much better to show them all so we do not have to constantly zoom in and out. A lot of things can happen on the map if you do not pay attention!\n\nGuys, try this game out. It really is something!!!\n\n","September 13, 2015","true","133.7"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

Expand, marry to your overlord once he broke the vassalage with you. More action going on around the country than just yourself, becareful not to make too many enemy, they may all turn and march to your domain.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/basuru/recommended/392470/","basuru","Damon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/basuru/","364 products in account","Before reading: I bought this for £32 while on sale.\n\nShort write-up: This games sits between Civ and Total War. It's an odd spot to inhabit, but also a fairly unique one too. The kingdom management/overworld aspect has similarities to Civilisation, however dig a little deeper and the officer management and diplomacy options add a huge amount to differentiate this title from 2K's flagship.\n\nOfficers can oversee development of your settlements, (an essential task that can become a little tedious as your clan grows - but thankfully can be given to one of your trusted retainers to develop automatically.) they also lead units into battle, conduct diplomatic missions, sow disharmony in the hearts of that one enemy officer who isn't too keen on his current lord and much more.\n\nBattle comes in two flavours: the first is very Civ-esque and happens on the overworld, but without the turn-based element (little detail that I liked: if you march near other territories, armies will form and watch you from the borders until you're safely out range then they'll go home). This approach works fine if you have a clear numbers advantage. However, if the number of soldiers and officers is a little close then you'll want to take direct control. If you choose to do this then you are presented with a map based on the current location on the overworld and your units will respond to your commands directly. You'll have to tentatively scout for your enemy and then do your best to flank them.\n\nEach officer has a skill that can be triggered in battle to either buff their unit/allies or debuff or harm enemy units. Most units can also opt to charge - a tactic that leaves the target unit in a state of confusion, which in this battle system is a very, very bad state to be in. As the game progresses and muskets are introduced, charging becomes riskier for the attacker as any units armed with firearms can 'release', which effectively counters the charge. TL:DR - Battles are pretty fun when you take control.\n\nThe sheer number of characters is mind blowing - each with stats and skills that can be improved and added to the more you use them. Keeping your chaps and chapette's happy is pretty important - this can be done with gifts (Feudal Japan as it turns out, was apparently full of very shallow people) or by offering your disgruntled officer one of your offspring to marry. You can recruit in one of three ways - find a ronin and pay him a small stipend to join (then immediately shower them with gifts/women so they don't sod off straight away), by convincing another lord's officer that you are in fact better than he is - making the officer jump ship, and finally: employing officers you defeated in battle. This doesn't always work and even when it does, the officers you gain are often not your biggest fan. If that particular method seems like too much hassle you can just execute them all. Or not. Your call.\n\nI've not had this game long, but it's a perfect mix of strategy and emergent storylines thanks to the wide variety of characters and the events that can occur. I've rambled a bit, but I wanted to describe the gameplay a little - I watched videos on YT before taking the plunge, but even those videos didn't quite capture how much addictive fun this can be. I personally have got invested in the future of my clan (I this particular case - the Azai. Nobunaga can do one.). I've come to terms with the fact in this run through I'm not going to unify Japan, but I will at least survive. I hope.\n\nA thing that made me chuckle: I hired one bloke who told me 'Hang on. This is fine. But I have to sort myself out first.' A year later I forgot about him entirely - only to have him return on this bombshell - 'I'm all sorted out now.' Good. Get to work you scrub.\n\nDisclaimer: Menus are a bit clunky but not 'uninstall' levels of clunk. Translation isn't always up to snuff - one guy started speaking in numbers at one point - I decided he was a robot trapped in the past trying to blend in for the sake of humanity.","May 22","true","16.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","1"

The build up with empire management is very slow, so battes will not happen until you have taken the time to develop your empire.  In battles, your generals have "special abilities" that can be used to give an edge in battle; these tend to make the battles more reliant on proper use of abilities moreso than anything else.  You can also ignore the battles (let the AI run them) and just focus on the empire management and moving your armies, and given the depth on the strategic side, this is a viable and enjoyable playstyle.\n\nI've played KOEI games in the past, so this was kind of a nostalgia purchase for me.

The story of the Warring States Period is a crazy part of world history, not just Japanese history, and SOI adds infinitely more flair and backstory to this than previous editions of the game.\n\nThe game's combat has some similar elements to Total War: Shogun, but there's more art to it and fewer technical options available for directing your armies... The personalities in this game are more important, and your generals and their special talents can make or break you in a tough situation. The game has stronger RPG elements in developing their individual traits that can turn them into some serious powerhouses on the battlefield.\n\nEnemy AI is pretty tenacious. They'll do a good job of trying to outmaneuver you on and off of the battlefield, and will definitely pounce on you in a weak moment. I was also impressed that it showed the same wariness in defending itself... For several years I was allied with one major clan, and they continued to plow through neighbors as if I might as well have been a wall or an ocean at their backs. As soon as I dissolved the alliance, their aggressive behavior came to a sudden halt. Turned out they were building up to take revenge on me, which they did. /restart\n\nThe building/management side of the game is very detailed. While there are only a few core resources you're trying to accumulate, there are multiple routes to the same destination, so skillful use of your generals and placement of buildings can really add up over time. As your clan gets bigger and bigger, there are options for delegating responsibility to the AI; take advantage of this because, otherwise, the game can start to feel a bit tedious and clunky.\n\nDiplomacy's pretty simple and straightforward, and not to be underestimated in its usefulness. I'd like more options such as being able to request or hand over territory, but it was still enough to get the job done.\n\nHistorical quests are presented as optional objectives in the game, so that you can learn the stories of the major players in the Warring States Period. If you are unfamiliar with the period, are a fan of visual novels, and/or just want the free perks rewarded for finishing them, they're a nice little bonus.\n\nI do miss the ninjas. In previous versions you could stab your rivals and sabotage their lands, etc... Something special about an 8-bit katana putting an end to your foes without a single soldier ever taking the field.\n\nMy one bit of advice in playing the game would be... click on All The Things. The tutorial is there but it misses so much. Information is available but you generally have to go looking for it, i.e. click on every item for the first time so that its associated Help page pops up to explain things. There were some features I didn't know existed until later in the game, that I would've prefered to know about from the get-go. This was particularly the case with delegating parts of my empire like I mentioned earlier, and I saw a couple of reviews that complained about the burden of management because they probably didn't know about this stuff either. Just click everything now and thank me later.\n\nAnd on that note, I just united Japan so I'm finally ready to decompress.\n\nTLDR: Yes","September 8, 2015","true","106.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

It's actually very difficult, but feels rewarding when you do conquer your rivals. Like other KOEI strategy games, there is a heavy focus on personnel and on making good use of your officers. However, this game is a bit different from other "ruler only" KOEI strategy games because you can also play as a vassal clan. The game gives you a wide array of options for acquiring new officers, developing your lands and managing diplomacy. I can praise KOEI on a lot of other things as well. For once, they actually decided to release an English dub for one of their strategy games, and it's actually awesome. Additionally, this game is a translation of both the original game Nobunaga's Ambition Souzou and its PUK (expansion pack). It's the first time that KOEI has localized an expansion pack for one of their strategy games. The localization is also overall pretty good. There are a few spelling errors here and there, but nothing serious. As a PC game, this title is also better than all of KOEI's other English deliveries. The load times are practically non-existent, the game runs beautifully and it has not crashed on me once even though I tend to experience crashes with a lot of other video games. Finally, the options for customizing the game are amazing. You can edit all sorts of things and create your own unique characters/clans.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the scope of this game is enormous. It seems like there are four or five times the number of bases that existed in Iron Triangle. Moreover, due to the way troop mechanics works, it's actually not so easy to conquer the land quickly. The large array of scenarios in tandem with the length it takes to progress through each one means that players will have hundreds of hours of potential playtime on their hands.\n\nThe best thing about this game though (at least for me) is the fact that Koei included a huge array of historical events, some of which even have cutscenes. These historical events sometimes manifest themselves as quests that allow you to relive some of the historical drama of this period. Oftentimes you will have to make a tough decision about whether you want to follow a historical questline or go off and do your own thing. I would definitely recommend getting the Nagao Kagetora (Uesugi Kenshin) DLC if you buy this game. I've been having a blast with it.","September 6, 2015","true","387.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

And, boy was it!\n\nNobunaga's Ambition is a grand strategy game set in feudal Japan's "warring states" period where Japan is divided into myriad little states ruled by various clans. In the game you choose one of the clans, and are responsible for internal development (building up your agriculture, building new city improvements, passing new government policies and so forth), diplomacy (building up strategic relationships with your neighbors, trying to schmooze up the Emperor, etc) and of course, leading your troops on a conquering spree across the Japanese plains, trying to unify the wartorn land. You can play as one of the more famous clans like the Oda or Takeda and have an easier time of things or you can try your hand at a tiny, one-province clan like the Shiba.\n\nI would best describe Nobunaga's Ambition as a cross between Crusader Kings, a Total War game, and a JRPG. It has the conquest and dynasty building aspects of Crusader Kings and the real-time management of massive battles seen in a total war game. But unique to this game are cutscenes and quests, with the occassional melodrama worhy of a JRPG. These are great, and what really sets the game apart. I think Paradox would do well to have these little story moments in their games. And if you are a fan of Samurai Warriors, it is also awesome to see some familliar faces.\n\nOverall, I highly, highly recommend the game. It is a bit expensive at the time of this writing, but I believe it is worth every cent. You will get hundreds of hours of enjoyment and an infinitely replayable game.","April 16","true","99.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

How many times have you spent countless hours in games like Galactic Civilizations and Civ5 only to find the AI has just been dinking around the whole time, leaving your expectations for an epic late game confrontation completely unfulfilled?

Granted by that point it's not impossible to overcome, but I just spent the good part of a day fighting EPIC HOJO. It wasn't as one sided as it would have been in EU4 or Civ5. Hojo means business. Powerful officers and lots of resources all of which were brought to bear.\n\nThank you Koei for actually providing AI that makes all your preparation worth it.\n\nNote: you can make officers that are so powerful that the game becomes trivial. I recommend against it - make some flawed and varied officers if you're into created clans. Also, playing as Nobunaga, Hojo, or Shimazu will result in an easy game no matter what.

I need to go into the options to make it full screen with my monitors resolution every time I start playing.\n\nThis game is a real time / turn based hybrid.  Once a month, you go into council.  If you are doing something important, council interrupts.  It can even interrupt battles you are currently leading.  When this happens, you are given a set of menus.  Each month I find myself checking every menu.  I start with development, then move down the list in a very repetitive manner.  It gets to be a grind.\n\nBattles are determined mostly by army size and officer.  That is because there are only three types of units, spears, horseman, and musketeers (eventually).  The quantities of each unit are based on the total army size, not any personal decision.  There are buildings that can make them better, but it really doesn't matter, because they all play the same.  Every army is a rectangle composed of people if you zoom in far enough, and they move towards other rectangles on a plain battle map.  Then the officers use abilities and one side wins.  You could use tactics, but most of the time I just let the AI handle it, because the sphere of the battle rarely ever encompasses all the units participating in it (a unit of 1000 with a unit of 10000 behind it could get slaughtered, and the battle mechanics won't always acknowledge the 10,000 until the 1000 is gone).\n\nHistorical events are a farse.  The game has no adaptability built in whatsoever, which is strange, based on how the events play out.  If you make one mistake (accidently take something you aren't supposed to, make an alliance with someone you are supposed to fight, etc.), the historical questline for the clan is completely derailed.  The longer the chain, the more difficult it is to prevent derailment, because even if you don't screw it up, the AI can, and often will.  Somehow you have to know what the entire questline requires before the questline starts.  An example:  the name of the game is based on Oda Nobunaga.  This questline can be derailed in about 1000 different ways.  Fastest way to derail it:  enticing a nearby officer who is spectacular to join you before you finish the first two quests.  If he isn't a part of his starting clan, your events can't work.  Also, this quest chain is very long, and you can't expand at all near the beginning.  Any expansion (including building fortresses) derails it.  The AI derails it on their own.  Events that are supposed to fire won't because a clan got wiped out, or it isn't holding the right province.  That would all be forgiveable, if the historical events didn't show that they can just manipulate the game to whatever shape they want.  In one Oda event, the Imagawa just take one of your fortresses, no fighting involved.  In others, clans spring up from nothing.  If they can do either of those things, why couldn't they adapt to what the player has done?\n\nThe building system is difficult to understand.  I only just figured out last night that castle facilities (which are labeled as equipment in the help menu), require specific development levels to work.  You can't know this easily because the help menu doesn't explain the build requirements outright (no other castle structure requires development), and you can't select the pulldown menu to see the choices (and the requirements), until you can afford one.  I found out last night that you can hover over a castle or fortress, and sometimes, if they might be able to make one, a list of possible facilities appears.\n\nI could go on about how disappointing this game is, but I'll stop here.

In brief, this is an officer-centric war simulator. You head a clan of your choice and try to unite Japan as what Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Ieyashu Tokugawa would have done in the historical events. I have played Romance of Three Kingdom IV on PS and I can also say this game has alot of the game concepts similar to ROTK IV with updated graphics, more content and set in the Sengoku period. If you have played th Koei's ROTK series, this game should be a familiar face and a must buy. Comparing to modern good 4X or historical sim, this game lacks some of the info-rich interface features (mouse-over info, proper summary tabs), in-depth battles and complex diplomancy. The good news is that the sum of all parts is robust enough to provide a satisfying game-play without bogging down with too much info or excessive manual control. Here are some of the pros and cons.\n\n+Pros+\n-Fantasic artwork of the officers, staring hours into the screen is less tedious when you have your leaders and officers looking hansome and inspiring. Officer-centric approach make the game more human and helps in the immersion.\n-Story Cut scenes are beautifully drawn and historical events presented in an appealing fashion\n-Simple interface - easy to intepret once you overcome the learning curve which is not very steep.\n-Simple but robust battle and diplomancy mechanics, dont be fooled by its simplicity.\n-Provide a fair deal of automation and delegation of mundane tasks especially during med-end game if so the player choose to. (formation of province and auto-council)\n-There are unlockables to lengthen the game-replayablilty, new scenarios, movie and officers.\n- Create custom officers.\n\n-Cons-\n-Lack of in-game info like those in modern 4x games.\n-Simple interface.\n-Generic voice-over for officers, too few variations.\n-English translation errors but it is better than no translation at all.\n\nMy recommendation:\nOne of the strengths of this game is the immersion into Japanese History during the Sengoku Period. Some of the officers and clans have rich back-stories which helps in making the game more fun and interesting. I suggest reading up on history to enhance your gaming experience. For a quick summary of the events during the Sengoku period, you can search "Extra History" on YouTube, you can wiki more after that. These guys on Youtube made an interesting 5-part series to aid you in understanding the back story, you would look at some of the officers in a different way after that.

More similar to Paradox games rather than Total War, but I prefer it to both. The game boasts some really nice features, such as being able to carve your territory into provinces, which really alleviates painstaking micromanagement when your empire gets too large. With all the scenarios and clans to choose from the game is as challenging as you want it to be, and you control as much as you wish to control.

Which is a plus for new gamers in the KOEI strategy esque like game(meaning that you can use the inbuilt editor to 'train' yourself.e.g. changing the amount of stats for your generals etc, ).\n\nThe latest series introduced the option to choose an alternate war mode (when your troops are close to the opponent ones), with gameplay style similar to Total War series gameplay (in terms of controlling troops etc).\n\nOf course, choosing Nobunga as the main player unveils his life to the player with multitude of historical events (beautiful CGs) BUT at the same time letting you choose whether you would like to execute the choices that historically happened (e.g. Killing Azai Nagamasu?? Up to you , let him live and he becomes your general in the end, cant bear to kill that ATK 89 general for me : ) ). Choosing other Damiyos for this series introduces more story-life historical events with the related damiyos too(Shimazu, Takeda to name a few does have alot of events for them to play with too).\n\nDefinitely one of the better Koei strategy games I have been playing so far (having played RTK from genesis to PC platform and Nobunaga series from series 10 till now).","September 7, 2015","true","79.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

But I have played the console version of this game. And now can deliever a full on opinion about this game. So don't roll your eyes, you read the review. Deal with it.\n\nFirst off, I would like to say thank you to Koei Techmo for releasing this game to the western audience and hopefully we will see more games in the near future.\n\nSphere of Influence, takes all the good things about the Ambition series that has been released over the past years and polished it and refine it to make something unique and very enjoyable. While also taking notes from it's other series. Romance of the Three Kingdoms to deliever a historical but enjoyable turn based game. You can play as the Oda clan or a random Japanese clan as they fight for control of Japan. Now like Romance of the Three Kingdoms X. It delivers a more hisotrical approach to the game, rather than the usual "Do whatever you want" experience. Now this may seem to be a bad thing, and to some who might say "who wants to learn Japanese history while playing a video game?! It's a game not classroom". But despite what people might call this a "snore feast" this game is still enjoyable despite it's historical approach to the game. Also the battle system is really straight forward and easy to understand.\n\nThere are many events throughout the game, and some are more well hidden than others. You can once again create your own officers while also importing portraits for custom made officers. However, unlike in the previous games. the created officers were 'pushed' back. They don't have that same "equal" presence as they do in the previous games. Another issue is the quest system, while it is easy to understand and to achieve. It would be nice if the game automatically shifts it to the year of the "due date" so like if i finished things before the Battle of Okehazama, i want the time to fast forward it to 1560, not stay at 1558 or whatever. The tutorial, while enjoyable, it should've cover more things than just having giving us the basic 101. The controls work very well on the PC version rather than the console version. Finally and people have pointed this out, this game stripped out some features and some of these newer features don't seem to make any sense.\n\nAll and all. If you love Koei Techmo games, especially the ROTK series and the Nobunaga Ambitions series. I highly recommend getting this game.","November 6, 2015","true","0.2"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","0"

It allowed me to achieve victory and then go back to expand upon the choices.\n\nAs the player, I felt a little over powered with the ability to use mass battles. I think allowing the AI to trigger mass battles if it masses a large enough army is a good idea. It changes the ability for me to create bottle necks of fights while bringing in large armies from around the area to call a mass battle once I have superior numbers.\n\nI was able to eventually overpower a much stronger rival AI.\n\nOverall a good addition to the genre if you like these kinds of games.\n\nFor new players, I would have a simple strategy. Make lots of allies. You have diplomats and treasure, use it early to establish local allies you can ask to support you in war. The allied battle component is a strong weapon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nuclear-ambitions/recommended/392470/","nuclear-ambitions","DumbKappa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nuclear-ambitions/","417 products in account","A very solid entry within the Nobunaga's Ambition series. It is a must have if you love KOEI strategy games. For someone who is new to these type of games, if you're tired of the same old game formula I'd recommend trying this game. Do not be fooled by the screenshots, the game's focus is not on the battles but on managing your castles, building fortresses, carving alliances and enemies, recruiting great (and not so great) generals to help lead your armies and manage your bases.\n\nIf you love the Sengoku period of Japan, you will absolutely love this game. The officers' bios while not extensively written, give infomation on even the most obscure general during this period. The game explains so many things about whats happening and why, there are cutscenes which are beautiful times, and also make you feel engaged in the history of this era. You can also recreate history by following the optional quests given to you to reenact historic battles such as the Battle of Sekigahara or the Battle of Okehazama. But fear not, you can also completely change history, want the Oda clan to perish under the Matsudaira? Go ahead. You can create your own officers and clans, there are scenarios you can choose to start from, either the Birth of Oda Nobunaga all the way up to The Battle of Sekigahara.\n\nYou can play as literally any faction, of course this is to be expected from KOEI's flagship strategy game Nobunaga's Ambition (and also Romance of The Three Kingdoms) unsatisfied? Just create your own faction and conquer Japan how you want to.\n\nGameplay is very typical for KOEI, so if you played past titles you know what to expect. For potential new players, the game is essentially a grand strategy but not exactly. People will liken it to Paradox titles and honestly they have nothing in common aside from a lackluster combat system. At first sight it may remind you of Shogun 2 due to the Steam Store screenshots but I assure you it is nothing like that as well aside from the era. Essentially the gameplay consists of starting off at a castle (or a fortress if you feel confident enough) and raise troops, grow crops, and collect/earn money. You assign officers as overseers of castles/forts and officers are the number one most important thing in this game as of any Koei strategy game. They dictate how strong your forces will be, some will be so great they can turn the tide of an overwhelming battle due to their sheer skills. You can forge alliances by sending officers to other clans and increasing their relationship points with you, once it hits a certain number you can send the offer and they will accept. You can request reinforcements depending on your relationship points with the clan, you can coordinate attacks with other clans and form coalitions against a huge clan to cut them down to size. You can vassalize other clans, form a lifelong alliance by sending marriage offers to other clans or if your daughters have good enough stats, keep them as officers. Construct new fortresses to increase your troop size even more. While it's not at the level of Paradox titles deep, it is very respectable and offers a NEW formula to strategy games.\n\nThe AI is extremely competent. A big thing in this game is you can only control so much of an area, once you conquer outside that area you need to move your capital or create a province for an AI general to control. You appoint a general to lead the province, give him officers and a few bases and he'll be good to go. The AI can grow their own playstyle and abilties as an overseer of a province. You can dictate who they attack, assist, and whether they transport spare resources. They do this on their own after you set the settings, however you can also force them to attack someone to coordinate a joint assault or defend a important base. If you set the dificulty settings high enough, you will be challenged by the enemy AI, they will attack you with large forces (if they are large enough) they will coordinate assaults on you with their allies, they will attempt to woo your officers into not fighting them or even worse, joining them.\n\nDifficulty settings can be tweaked, Japanese voices are available (and recommended) The graphics, while not ultra-realistic or amazing in today's standards, are beautiful to behold and I found myself looking at the map and taking it all in, the officer portraits are also well done and it is easy to recognize someone from their portrait. I personally haven't had a crash yet in 55 hours of playing this game. I haven't ran into a major bug worth noting, If you were worried that KOEI may screw up the game because of their past ports you can feel at ease. KOEI has created strategy games and the Nobunaga's Ambition series in particular since 1983. This is their bread and butter, they have a formula and it works.\n\nThere will be complaints of the price point, complaints of DLC practices, and complaints how the game's battle system is lacking.\n\nIn regards to the price point, It is priced at a hefty $60. People who have never heard of this series will wonder why it costs so much and also read it is a "port" but further investigation will reveal that it is a TRANSLATION port of the game, the base game was made for PC in Japan. This version of the game also includes the PUK version of the Japanese game (which sold seperately in Japan) PUK stands for Power-Up-Kit, the equivalent of an expansion for the game.\n\nThe "day one DLC" issue many seem to have, as stated in the previous point, this is a translation of an already existing game. We should not expect to get the DLC for free that non-English customers paid for. You do not need the DLC, they simply add more scenarios.\n\nAnd yes, the battle system is lacking as it always has in all KOEI strategy games. The game is essentially a grand strategy, there are very few tactics involved in these games. If you prefer a strong battle system, this game is not for you.\n\nMany newcomers will ask themselves, if this game is so good, why havent I heard of it before? Well, KOEI had a policy of not exporting their RoTK/NA series to English speaking customers of the world for quite some time, they had released a few before, but they stopped for a while. This is the first time in a good amount of years they released Nobunaga's Ambition to western audience. This is also the first time they released the PUK edition to western audiences as well.\n\nI can only hope that they will feel confident in the western market and continue to release english versions of their amazingly well done strategy games. They were sorely missed from this reviewer.","September 9, 2015","true","69.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shariffMZR/recommended/392470/","shariffMZR","SharifMizore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shariffMZR/","95 products in account","I was very hyped when I heard Nobunaga's Ambition : SOI was released on Steam. I had been very fond to NA series, even though I had only played the NA : Iron Triangle series on the PS2. After quite a decent play time, I decided to make a quick review. Note that I hadn't played other mass strategy games such as Total War, etc. ,  except Sid Meier's Civilization 5.\n\nYou should buy this if :\n1. Are very interested in everything about the Sengoku Period.\n2. Have loads of time to sink into this game.\n3. You are proud of the Oda badge on your steam profile !   XD\n\nI'm comparing NA : SOI to NA : Iron Triangle ( IT ). SOI have many improvements and new features compared to IT, but has major flaw in its battle system.\n\nImprovements:\n1. Game Concept\nSOI has a much more enjoying game management by introducing the Council Phase every early month, which is much more sense in ruling an empire. This phase is where you carry out strategies ( diplomacy, survey, incite, etc )and town developments ( agriculture, crafts, etc ). After this phase is known as The Battle Phase. The Battle Phase is very similar to the previous NA series.\n\n2. History telling\nSOI narrates Sengoku Period in very detailed and interesting. Its CGI are very beautiful, the actors scripts are also really enjoyable to read.\n\n3. Quests and Events\nI was very thrilled with the brand new Quests concept. At times, there will be objectives for you to complete before deadlines such as capturing castles, gaining diplomatic points, or even attempting to employ Hanbei Takaneka which was very funny. Upon completing the Quests, rewards are given and some quests changes the world.\n\n4. Defined Battle\nYou actually get to completely control your units in a Battle and Mass Battle. This simple Defined Battle can actually turn the tides even when withstanding greater foes. The environment during these battles are also very picturisque and enjoyable.\n\n5. New Policy Concept\nPolicies allow you to determine your government form, either militaristic or economical, or somewhere in between. Each policy have their own merits and demerits which are makes the game very diverse. Policies utilise the " Innovation " system, which have the Progressive, Neutral and Traditional stage. Most policies can only be enacted when their requirements had been fulfilled.\n\nFlaws:\nThe only major flaw in NA : SOI I can point out is its battle system.\n\n1. Army Composition Too Simple\nYour units are basically infantry and archers. They can be equipped with horses and muskets, giving them " Charge " and " Release " tactics respectively and some officers benefit these equipments ( Nobunaga, Shingen, Shigehide, etc ). This mixed army compositon in turn make battles repetitive and boring in a long run. It would be more interesting and challenging if unit type was the absolute unit type ( Only Infantry, Only Archers, Only Dagoons, etc ). So I would place Infantry in front, Archers in back, all that kinds of formation instead of head-on fight and still win.\n\nI guess siege units were removed from this game? It's very dissapointing because siege units bring strategy diversities. Back in NA : IT, I used to enjoy blasting enemies with cannons from afar !\n\n2. Technology System removed\nIn NA : IT, each clan have their own specialty in technology (Oda with muskets, Tokugawa with Infantry, Sanada with Engineering, Mori with naval, etc ) . But this was removed in SOI, making each clan somewhat similar, repetitive and greatly reduces the replay value of SOI.\n\n3. Officers Multitasking ?\nI noticed that Officers in SOI can carry out both political and military tasks. Example is that while Toshiie was busy battling the Azai, he can still build roads from Nagoya which was quite far away. Comparing to NA : IT, an officer who is engaged in battle is not available for political tasks.\n\nBugs:\nThe only bug I encountered is when changing your clan's daughter ( maiden ) name. The GUI got all messed up after changing the name. I was super lucky that I had just save that time after a long battle of Oda with Takeda. I'm using Windows 8.1 .\n\nI guess that's it for my quick review. Overall, NA : SOI is very enjoyable to play and I'm looking forward for more NA series, and restore the Technology System , just like or even better than in NA : IT !","September 13, 2015","true","46.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Nobunaga's ambition as a series has been almost like a drug. While I found it difficult and challenging I always came back to continue playing it. Iron triangle was the first one I played and loved it. It tested my strategic thinking to the max and I always had to try and think one step ahead of the computer. This one takes it more in depth and I absolutlely LOVE the clan creation system. After putting time into my character and their blood-line I had started up the game only to find that even though I made only one character who was close to max stats(who I had die early to age so as to not get any kind of real headstart only to signify how the clan had come to power.) I found the AI in this game to be even smarter than the last instalments! Making alliances and trying to fend off higher clans like the hojo kept me at the edge of my seat as each season passed by. I had not gotten their and hoped there was no limit to years like the last game so I could take my time but the AI would not let me rest. It challenged me to my limits and beyoond and I had to think outside my norm and plan accordingly with my lesser allies to take down a stronger clan. I even found ways to make my allies stronger by pulling out of a battle and allowing them to take the land. This game definately fulfills my strategic gaming expectations and just hope there will be more to come in the future.","May 11","true","214.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've been a fan of NA for almost a decade now. Having spent hundreds of hours playing Lord of Darkness, Rise to Power, and Iron Triangle. I patiently waited for the day Koei would release another one of these titles in North America. The wait was really worth it. Sphere of Influence surpass previous titles of the series in many way, although it falls short in some areas that made the series good in the past like certain feature they added or remove that I did not like (i.e. removing officer stipend, Naval battles, etc...), and city/fief building along with some other aspects of gameplay has been simplify. Sphere of Influence however kept the core aspect of what fans love about the previous titles and is a solid good title to reintroduce fans of the series in West to Koei's strategy/historical simulation games as it delivers feature rich engrossing gameplay, taking and/or enhancing certain good aspects from its previous two english titles, such as improving on and adding more depth to diplomacy, along with adding a few new features that greatly improve the game like clan quest events. Although the battle mechanics and tactics seem good but lacking sometimes, it does not take away from the satisfying strategic gameplay element that made this series fun to play in the past, If you have enjoyed the previous Nobunaga's Ambition and /or Romance of the Three Kingdoms titles you'll likely find yourself enjoying spending hours on end planning, building, scheming, and taking city after city as you struggle and fight other clans to unify the land under your rule. Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence is a great installment to the titled series and a good game to get new and old fans interested in the genre for possible future titles. If you are interested in historical strategy simulation games then you should definitely buy this game as it is easily a 8.5/10 game. Well that's all the time I have to tell you about my thoughts on Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence as I will now be spending most of my waking hours playing this game.","September 3, 2015","true","111.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you like turn-based strategy, you'll like this game. It has elements of Civ, Total War, Crusader Kings, and similar games but there are some unique challenges. The game was complex - and not necessarily intuitive or documented - but almost everything could be automated if you prefer.\n\nManaging your officers is really fun and you have plenty of time to develop favorites among the many unique characters working for you. Diplomacy is also essential. There are many competing clans and if you go to war you'll need to have truces, if not alliances, with your other neighbors. Don't give a neutral neighbor an opportunity to attack you while you're otherwise tied up as they will take it.\n\nThe only downside, if you want to call it that, is the same-ness of the map. Over the years I've played plenty of strategy games that take place in Japan, and I quickly was slightly irritated that the map was so predictable. Don't get me wrong, it's very well done in this game. There are tons of strategic choke points, benefits to plains vs mountains, and so forth. I kept having flashbacks to Shogun 2 as I played and tbh Shogun 2 did have a prettier (and more interesting) world map.\n\nThis game is great. I doubt it will be anywhere near as popular with Western audiences as it should be. And that's too bad because I'd love to see a modern Romance of the Three Kingdoms in English. If this doesn't do well it's unlikely they'll bring that title over.","September 8, 2015","true","73.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you are more a fan of totalwar you may end up bored after a while since this is not a Totalwar clone. I would dare to say they are opposite as they aim at opposite direction. This is not an arcade battle game there is a lot of planning to make not unlike a civilization game. Don't expect to build customs armies and wreck Japan with your tactics, armies composition are statics and battles is mostly win by what officer is in charge of your army. The goal is more to create the right conditions to win than where to send my elite troops. An army whatever the size is a mob you can't really influence, not in a Totalwar style anyway. My big crush and i don't even remember the last title i can say that about : I LOVE the vanilla version. Unlike most wargames/strategy released in the last 10 years this one don't need mods to show its real potential. Honestly! I can't even think of good ideas about what to mods except remove cap for hardcore players. Its a real KOEI title that gives me the same fun and feelings i used to have with theirs SNES and PS games of the last decade.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamingfr3ak/recommended/392470/","gamingfr3ak","gamingfr3ak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamingfr3ak/","409 products in account","Once I found it, this game became my go-to for the turn-based strategy genre. I have always loved this era/setting, but I can't just play Samurai Warriors forever. This game does a lot of things right: blending turn-based strategy with real-time combat, including diplomacy elements in a military conquest game, and allowing for a great deal of development of your land holdings. Not to mention that the game is very friendly to new or casual players, as you can choose to have the game AI make many of the decisions for you, and even have it 'demo play' for you to see how the game is played!\n\nBut lets get into the finer details. I'll start with the turn-based + real-time blending element. Each turn starts with a 'council' phase, where you make all your development and diplomatic decisions. During the council phase, time is paused. You then progress to the 'war' phase, where the real-time element begins, and you can move your units to attack your foes and claim new territory. You can still pause during this phase, and do some military-based diplomatic interactions as well. I love this approach, because it allows you to have more control over each and every battle rather than just taking turns hitting your foe and rolling a die. It doesn't end there, however, as this game takes things one step further and allows you to actually go to the field of these battles if you like, and directly maneuver your units and decide when to activate their skills! This means that you can often win battles where the leaders of your units are not as strong as your foes, or if your army is not as large. In the end, strategy prevails over luck.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that is done well is the diplomatic interactions. Each clan will have a different perpsective on you, depending on your size and distance relative to them, as well as being somewhat influenced by historical factors (or, at least, KOEI's depiction of the history of this era). Some allies may be harder to gain than others, but with the right amount of work you can turn any foe into a friend and do a great deal of manipulating the various factions in the game to act in your favor. You can even take this one step further, and form a 'Coalition' of forces to fight a larger foe, allowing you to direct your allies' attacks and time your moves so that no foe can stand before you for long.\n\nLastly, but certainly not least importantly, there is a deep system of development of your territory. You can improve the system of roads in your territory to speed your army along, build small forts to defend key chokepoints, or even build new settlements to artificially increase your own holdings. You also can develop both the 'city' and the 'castle' of each territory you control, and this is where the system truly shines. It is more than just building one of this and one of that, as each plot of land you build in a city can be upgraded along several different paths to provide different benefits. Not only that, but some of these upgrades will interact with other plots of land and improve their efficiency, so it is not just WHAT you build but also WHERE you build it! The castles have a similar variety of upgrades, each with their own effect, though they do not 'interact' with each other like the city upgrades do. This means that you can take several different approaches with each settlement, whether you desire them to each serve a separate purpose, or even if you want to change their purpose as the game progresses!\n\nOverall this game is really very entertaining. There are a number of different historical scenarios already in the game, and the DLC scenarios can add to the fun as well. The one downside to this game is that it does stick pretty closely to KOEI's version of this era, so there's rarely a standard game where Nobunaga doesn't rise to power. Though I suppose the game is named after him. However, if you do happen to (somehow) tire of rising to power as any of the various factions across the various time periods, there is also an 'edit mode' in this game which provides literally unlimited replayability. The main aspect of this that provides replayability is that you can 'shuffle' the starting positions of the clans in the game, completely changing the flow of any era. On top of that, there are many more specific edits you can do to the game to re-balance it any way you like or to simply punish the last foe who bested you.\n\nOne other little note to make is that there are also 'quests' in this game, and many of them follow a more historical route. If you want to get to know the characters in the game a little better, or to know some extra bits of information about the events that took place, you can follow these quests to guide you through the game (and to get some achievements as well). Or, you can ignore all of that and follow your own path to victory as you see fit.\n\n\nIf you prefer medieval Europe to medieval Japan, then perhaps this game is not for you. Or, if you are not as famliar with this time period, or you don't enjoy KOEI's version of history, then you may be turned away by this game. But the variety of player-friendly options in the game make it accessible to players of any skill level, and even if you consider yourself a 'pro' at strategy games you can still set the pre-game options to make things much more difficult for you if you so desire. All things said, this game greatly stands out among its peers in the genre, and I'm going to be playing it at least until the next generation of strategy games around, and will continue to come back to it even beyond that time.","March 22","true","240.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Takes me back to my old Sega days with this and Romance of the Three Kingdoms. I still enjoy this as much as I ever did. Its not an easy game particularly, there can be a heavy amount to grasp, there are lots of intricacies, some a little complex to learn, but the quests and tutorials do help a lot with understanding much of it. The little cut scenes break up the gameplay a little as well as teach history. Creation of officers, is always fun but even without doing so just picking a random small clan and setting out to unite the country is a fun, if daunting, endeavor. The replay is limitless as things are random, from events to maidens being born, not to mention different ways to win and the created characters you can add. If you like strategy or management games, or history, or even putting your battlefield tactics to the test these are all elements of this game. Be the powerful general, and the silver tongued statemen, marry into other clans to give long term alliances or demand others weaker than you to become vassals. Protect your lands, form coalitions to fight others, wipe out other rivals, capture their generals or princes then hire, free or execute them.

Sengoku, on the other hand, is so extreme with the political and economic management that it starts feeling more like work and less like a game.  Nobunaga's Ambition hits the perfect sweet spot between the two.\n\nEven though the outcome will obviously be different than it was in history, I find myself constantly thinking that the flow of the game and the decision-making is as close to representative of what Nobunaga, Mori, Shimazu, Date, etc, went through in their day.  Watching the armies move during an allied or a coalition war is a sight to behold.  Development of the towns/castles is just detailed enough, and almost feels like a mini-game on its own.  Diplomacy is simple, lightweight, and extremely important to pay attention to on every turn.\n\nPossibly the best feature in the game, and one of the most historically accurate, are the provinces.  You can only directly control so many castles, and the rest you must assign to separate and autonomous provinces.  Once again this system is simple and lightweight, but extremely deep on a strategic level.  You may find yourself completely re-arranging everything in order to keep control of the castles whose armies you wish to control directly, or even to take the load off of how many development/army commands you end up making each turn.\n\nI hope this game does well enough to bring Gemfire back.  They just don't make games like Koei did anymore.\n","February 14","true","759.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Another problem about the game on diplomecy that the AI can be your ally instantly and call you for help.

How you go about combat is quite simple but in a good way and they don't drag on and on, making you wanting to invest time in those battles. Taking castles always feels good and making alliances feels like a mutually benefitical agreement, which can lead to possible coalitions against powerful groups.\n\nAll in all it is a very smart and fun game to play, and i would buy the next installment of the series in an instant.","December 29, 2015","true","53.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you've played A Romance of Three Kingdoms, but want a Japanese/Samurai warriors version, or if you're just looking for an amazing experience with a grand strategy game, this game is for you.\n\n9/10\n\nPros:\n*Historical Mode is awesome.\n*Awesome soundtrack.\n*Awesome gameplay.\n\nCons:\n*Nothing of note. Some may not like the "Sphere of Influence" (the region your base is in depends on how much you can directly manage before having to put it with a reagent and give general orders. Of course, you can change your base though to continue managing, so this isn't really a big deal either way).\n\nA great game that lets you pick a faction and lead them, or even create your own (and your own character/links to families in game!), Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence is another game in the great series of strategy games KOEI puts out. The politics, development, and management of everything is fun and addicting. I found myself upgrading towns, building new ones, setting policies and skipping out on battles just to micro-manage everything because I was enjoying it, experimenting with alliances and marriages and messing with officer's loyalty are all fun features in the game. As for combat in the game, it can be resolved automatically. General's abilities, unit's skill and abilities, and allies all come into play when auto-fighting. You can also manually do the battle, allowing some input and tactics in an otherwise hopeless situation, or simply just because it's fun. Unlike some grand strategy games, the game actually has a story you can follow too, given via historical objectives to complete. These are optionable and exist to add flavor and fun, and can be completely ignored if you'd prefer total freedom in how you rule and act.","December 18, 2015","true","57.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

The systems such as historical events, and  the dynamic choice of how you'd 'like' to fight your battles makes the game flow very quickly, and makes executing what were once arbitrary and hard to find events so much easier.\n\nThe only things I feel are truly missing from the game are a more complex technology system like Iron Triangle had, and potentially more portraits for create an officer such as some of the much earlier games. These are minor flaws, and over-all this game functions FAR better than older Nobunaga's Ambition games.\n\nOne of the best minor additions is the concept of loyalty based on type of ruler, and it makes it harder to keep rulers or other offices you acquire that are opposed to your liege based on a set of modifiers. However, you are indeed more likely to keep officers as long as you maintain a relatively strong and consistent force.\n\nEasily my favorite KOEI game yet 8.5/10","September 1, 2015","true","32.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Nothing but good things (besides dynasty warriors 7).so I've played a few of the ROTK games and all of the "warriors" as a big total war guy I was worried the tactical aspects of this game wouldn't be able to hold up. I was wrong , the game is different , it reminds me very much of Dynasty Tactics which was a really fun game to play as you could play as slow or as fast as you wanted and there was a lot of micromanaging of cities and officers.\n\nGraphics\nNice, the graphics are quite cartoony , aesthetically pleasing none the less and with the sheer scale of the map it really holds up. The portraits for all of the Characters are impressive and stick well to the description of the real life embodiments.The armies being displayed by the "jigsaw pieces" is a really nice and welcome feature.\n\nGameplay\nSimple council where time freezes and you set what you want to be built and what policies you want to to follow for a few months until the next council. Once the council is over time will progress at a speed of the users specification , and armies will move buildings will build and Events will occur allowing you to see all of your policies in action. The battles are a total war crossed with Dynasty tactics style; realtime speed but in depth tactics for each general allowing ft an in depth battle system that's easy to learn. Now I've only played 5 hours st the time of this review and I will update this if need be but diplomacy seems to be the aim of the game ,enticing enemy generals to defect keeping alliances and making surrounding tribes (minor factions) support you, so far diplomacy is interesting and is the focal point of this games different scenarios.\n\nSound\nScore is impressive , despite being modernised you can still feel the sense of traditional Japanese music , also my with the war drums before battle starts , the music doesn't feel out of place whatsoever and is in fact quite immersive!\n\nI haven't listened to the English dub actors but the option is there for those who can only tolerate American. The Japanese voice actors are immersive and all fit the character they're meant to portray (good casting Koei)\n\nOther\nThe game is made of custom scenarios , but you can play any clan of the time period and the scenarios are of decent length I've been playing for 5 hours and am still on the first scenario and I have no idea how longs left however with my knowledge of the time period I feel it'll be over within the next 2 hours\n\nThe custom Daimyo system is incredibly in depth , I've not fully tinkered with it but you can choose your family , traits and stats . You can also place your custom character in any of the scenarios as a Ronin (wanderer looking for a master) or a retainer , someone who is under the command of a clan instantly.\n\nOverall\nI'm really intrigued by this game and it's a nice breath of fresh air from Koei , the casual city management and intense battles make this game fun for any mood , I advise a strong knowledge of the time period or ancient warfare for full enjoyment out of this game. If you're a fan of Japan, strategy or just fulfilling games , then this game is for you.\n\nI'd give this a game 9/10 for me I haven't found any major flaws and I'm having a great time , great product from Koei they've set the bar here!\n\nI think from an unbiased point of view and. For someone who isn't a Koei fanboy/girl this game is probably a 7.5/10\n","February 4","true","5.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I played it on a "budget" PC with integrated graphics and it ran silky smooth.\n\nThe character system seems deep and kingdom organization is very addicting.  The kingdom management succeeds because it's focused on scarcity.  You have limited money, limited vassals, and limited "labor" (action points).  Population helps build up action points and is required for a strong military.  Investing in the economy is important, even investing in roads, building new castles, fortifying key points.  There are so many choices but they are structured in a simple way that is not overwhelming.  Your characters increase in stats as time goes on and gain new traits.\n\nThe battles are also great.  They are smaller in scale than Total War, and they play quicker.  However, this also means the computational demands are a fraction of Total War series.   You lose some of the interesting decisions of Total War, such as specific units to produce, precise formations to employ, etc, but I found myself usually auto-rolling those battles as they drag on forever.  In Nobunaga, I am excited for the battles.\n\nThe menu UI is very logically laid out.  There are a few options that could be confusing at first, like transferring vassals, but the game walks you through what each action does.   Speaking of options, the game has a great set of options both in terms of difficulty (even specificying how you want the AI to be more difficult) and for graphics/what not.\n\nThe translation is very thorough, with some good localization here and there, like the dialogue in the Tutorial.   There was only one or two points where I felt the wording could be improved significantly.\n\nI paid $50 for it at launch but, knowing what I do now, I would have easily paid $70-80 for this game and been happy.","September 3, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is pretty damn hard to grasp at first, it took me over an hour to complete the tutorial and i still had no clue what i was doing, i played the first scenario for a couple of hours and learned from experience. I restarted that scenario and still not completed the first scenario yet as i'm far too engrossed with making my empire stupidly strong, which is not easy!\n\nI was extremely reluctant to buy this game but my boredem got the better of me and i dived in head first, totally worth it. All i can say is that if you're into some hardcore strategy games like the civilization series or some of KOEI's other games like Romance of The Three Kingdoms, then you'll certainly love this! The battles are fun to play, managing your cities feels rewarding with plenty of depth to them, enemies are actually relatively smart to play against and the customization of everything is fantastic! Create your own Daimyo and family, edit all the settings before you start a new game, ranging from AI smarts, starting funds, received damage and inflicted damage modifiers. This game has plenty of depth to it and you'll be addicted in no time! GET THE GAME!","September 9, 2015","true","160.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Heh, maybe I should have paid more attention to the news. I would've bought this day one.\n\nI am a long time fan of both the Nobunaga's Ambition, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms games. We're talking since the NES era. A friend showed it to me, and all I could think of at the time was, "what kind of names are those? How am I supposed to remember who's who?".\n\nOver time, these games opened my eyes to a type of gaming I haven't seen before. Managing many aspects of a country/empire. Things most games at the time didn't do.\n\nAs time has passed, other developers have taken the leap and joined in the crowd in this niche. Which is great. Game series such as Europa Universalis Crusader Kings, Total War, if you like those titles, you will like this game.\n\nAnyways, about this title specifically. Last NA game I played was Iron Triangle. That game is tough. Easy to pick up the basics with a strong clan on easy/normal difficulty, hard to master with a weaker clan on hard. This game is showing me much of the same.\n\nThey have expanded on the domestic aspect of it. You now have to focus on improving roads to both increase trade income as well as troop movement. Planning out domestic district expansion is also key. You have to figure out if it's worth it to choose the expansion upgrade, or one that exploits what you have on that tile, and passing up the expansion (ex. You can choose an option that lets you get additional farming in the next tile, or you can forsake that to focus on lowering the cost of purchasing horses). That was a very nice touch in this game.\n\nIn former games, there was essentially one city per province. Now there are multiple cities per province. Again that opens up a new aspect to the game. Do you focus on food? Troops? Income? Innovation? A lot of strategies to employ even on the domestic level.\n\n\nI've barely scratched the surface so far, having played less than 4 hours currently, but I am really liking this title. If you're a fan of grand strategy like Crusader Kings 1/2, or Europa Unversalis 3/4, you should get this game. There is no multiplayer, but there is an abundance of single player. More than enough to warrant the purchase.\n\nEDIT\n\nI'm now about 15 hours into this game. There just seems to be a new surprise around each corner. Now I can build new fortresses in my provinces, thus increasing my harvest/income/draft pools even further. Enabling the option that allows maidens to become officers adds another dimension. Some of them are best used to seal alliances, or raise an officer's loyalty. Others, become better than officers, so why not let them loose on the battlefied?\n\nAs far as content is concered, this game is a 10/10. So much replayability, plenty of tweaking of options, and yes, make good use of the in game encyclopedia.","December 25, 2015","true","75.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

During the game you need to balance your actions in political, domestics and militaristics question, not forgetting to tell about all the others problems that may appear like, for example, treasons.\n\nYou have two options during the game, you can follow the hisical flow, learning a little more from the japanese history while repeating the same steps and decisions from the leaders from the time or if you want you can play everything on the fictional way of the history, trying to conquer and unify Japan under the flag from the clan that you choose or even in a clan that you have created.\n\nOne of the biggest problems from this game compared to others from the hitorical simulations is that, at least for me, this title is a lot easier if compared with RoTK, wherer I have played it since the SNES version and found more difficult in the IX, X and XI game from the serie, where you needed to do a better control and balance between the militaristic/diplomatic aspects of the game and needed to think a lot more in the combats where the weapon, general and skills available played a more important role in all the aspects of the game.\n\nFinally, to finish this brief review, if you like a game with all these  aspects allied with some strategy during the combats (that you can choose to fight your battles or only wait for a result) this game is for you. If not, stay away from the game and don't waste your money. If you want a better opinion, take a look on YouTube for gameplay videos and see for yourself.","September 9, 2015","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great line of games, I prefer Romance of the Three Kingdom (ROTK) line of games by a long shot, but I have not seen a PC Koei strategy game in a long time and seeing Nobunoga was exciting so I purchased it. Purchased on opening week and a good purchase too.\n\nGOOD: Fun! Fast past, Lots of scenarios, Nostalgic, Facebook post feature is cool, the macro and micro level battle options are unique.\n\nBAD: My settings never save, the AI is average, graphics are good enough, and feels like a port more than a PC game.\n\nSUMMARY: NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Sphere of Influence does not have the level of detail as even some of the older ROTK games. The general's values do not seem to matter too much in this game unlike ROTK where a Lu Bu would wipe any general away. In this game, an average general will put up a mighty fight against the best general. I think ther are too many traits/tactics and they are hard to sort when figuring out how to manuever generals around to other castles. All in all, this is a fun game and worth the purchase. If you’re dying for a strategy game that is not too complicated, this game is for you.","October 2, 2015","true","163.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It won't be a full review as I haven't experienced enough the story aspect of the game, which is now clearly the main selling point of the game.\n\nPros:\n+Ambitious and beautiful game\n+Has complex character effects on your lands\n+Diplomacy seems to be multi-layered\n+Gameplay is fairly simplistic and easy to learn\n+Is designed like a boardgame so every action is balanced fairly well\n+Has good combat mechanisms built inside\n+Has a good story concentrating on Oda Nobunaga and is relatively speaking "historically accurate"\n\nCons:\n-Not enough user feedback on your actions\n-Gameplay doesn't get complex at all and becomes quickly very repetetive\n-You cannot determine things like facing of your troops -> Way too simplistic UI\n-Forces the story down your throat if you deliberately play as some minor faction far far away from Oda Clan\n\n\nNobunaga's Ambition is an overall a good game. It seems to include very complex succession mechanisms and character influences on your feudal fiefs. In that aspect it remotely reminds titels like CK2. However it doesn't seem to go all the way there when it comes to diplomacy.\n\nWhat do you mean "seems", you might ask. Well the game does its best to hide information from you. It doesn't give you that many numbers, when deciding who to lead your castles or armies or wether or not it has some hidden effects somewhere else. And you even cannot decide which way your troops are facing while in combat mode. Everything is so automated that you don't feel like you are in control.\n\nIt would be reasonable to ask 60 eur from a PC title if they would improve UI when they imported this  to PC. Now it requires so much extra clicking to get that piece of information that you expect to find in non-existent tooltips. But as everything is so automated, you rarely need to know why things are folding out as they are. This game comes with a manual to explain mechanisms that you never get to actively use unless you really sit down and read it.\n\nIts a good game but pricing is way out there. 30 eur would be more correct if the game wants to compete on its own price tag. It is not however a fully fledged and polished AAA product.","November 8, 2015","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am also fan of Romance of the three kingdom's stories, manga and movies. This is the 1st time I play a nobunaga series and I hope it will bring the same enjoyment and interests in the sengoku period that ROTK 3 brought to me the interest/addiction of the Romance of the three kingdom.\n\nBest game tutorial ever! step by step introduction which helps to understand the basics of the game and cold jokes. 1st game that i lost the tutorial battle because i set the game speed too high. 10/10 will restart the tutorial. nice to have fast forward button for the conversations because I can't stand the jokes.\n\nFound out why i my fps was hovering around 40+ fps and occasional drop because i ran the game with my integrated intel gpu. Change to my gtx for smoother 60fps. Nevertheless, integrated gpu works fine means this game does not need a gaming pc/laptop to play.\n\nsettings will revert back to windows mode and 1280 x 720 when i restart the game.(known issue that affect most)\n\nAfter playing for a while on the scenario where nobunaga became a daimo, i have finally face my 1st true test where my alliance is being ganged by 2 of the largest clans. I realised the following:\n\n- This is a very complex strategic game where strong alliance, right buildings built, efficient resources management and and even luck (i had famine event during harvest month on both my cities when i planned for an offensive which i had to delay for a year) play a part in expanding and survival of your clan.\n\n- Build more fortresses to increase income and troop count.\n\n- Set policies to boost your clan\n\n- increase diplomacy with as many clans as possible (+20 helps with gold income +40 allows you to summon help)\n\n- I am facing the current adversity of 2 huge clan ganging up on me from the east because i was focusing on the west and naively thought they will not ally to attack my alliance.\n\n-building relationship with the shogun and bribing the official for higher ranking post\n\n-Battles can be settle automatically in the strategic map by AI or in a tactical format controlled by player\n\n\nIn my opinion, the battle system is very flawed. After so many battle in tactical form, i have yet to get a hang of where tactical movement and placement actually works.\n\nFor example surrounding a single enemy unit with 3 allies will see the same amount of troops losses on both side. having horses and musket does not seem to improve damage other than having the charge and release tactics. Using them placed the unit uncontrollable even after enemy in front had lost and retreated.\nAnother example is in an arrow battle, my unit with superior general and 3 times more troops takes more damage than a weaker opponent facing each other both with musket.\nThat means battles will most likely be the force that has higher troop count will win although not always true. (I have lost or win with more or less troops before but do not expect any significant victory using a lesser force)\n\n\nThe only times that i saw any difference are the tactics used by various units. However the tactic bar(command bar) increases so slowly which limit tactic usage to change the battle. Both side starts with the same amount even when the troops count are different or number of general/units are different. This means a smaller force can cast the same amount of tactics as a much superior force.\nThis is unlike ROTK 12 which has faster regeneration of tactic bar and troops movement placement are important. In this game it feels non-existance.\n\nTactical battle map are small and maneuvability is havoc when you want to aim an enemy unit but is near to another. Mass tactical battle map feel the same small size as normal battle and there is hardly any tactical movement to be made like flanking and sending decoy which could be made in ROTK 12.\n\nFor those who played koei ROTK games, this game battle system is more like ROTK 12 than to ROTK11 due to it being real-time. And i prefer the battle system of ROTK 12 than this game.\n\nFor those who played medieval 2 total war, the battle system in this game is nothing like total war. This is due to the fact that there is only one type of unit and medieval 2 has many different types. Therefore do not expect it to be the same or even better.\n\nHowever I will still recommend this game for its strategic part of the game, story, orchestra music, pleasant graphic, difficulty of the game and the complexity of game. There are many more reasons listed out by others and given my hundreds and hundreds of hours playing ROTK games, this is a potential hundred+ hours game for those who have the PATIENCE to conquer japan. If not I would recommend skipping this game as learning the basics and the tutorial will be more than 2hr and you can not accomplise and gain any satisfaction in a short term.","September 4, 2015","true","34.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As with any Koei 4K game, it comes as a mixed bag of gains and losses.\n\nGains:\n1.This is probably the most beautiful 4K that Koei's released yet.\n2.The AI actually does interesting things instead of sitting around waiting for you to make the first move.\n3.Streamlined gameplay, allowing for less micromanagement.\n4.Officer stat gain. Dear lord yes, this is what I needed in my life. Makes completely useless officers worth having  with enough time and dedication.\n\nLosses:\n1.Officers no longer feel personal. They definitely feel a lot less involved this time around. I usually spend a lot of time reading up on an officer's history, or checking their stats to optimize my efficiency. I noticed doing that a lot less in this game than others. It doesn't help that there's a lot of hassle involved in accessing this info.\n2. As a result, world feels a lot less engaging. This just feels like a plain strategy game. I came for the historical immersion, and stayed for the game. Come on Koei, when are we gonna get another ROTK 10? Now THAT was engaging.\n3. Regents make the game too easy. Seriously, these are super useful but also incredibly overpowered. They practically win the game for you, while you can sit around twiddling your thumbs. Nerf it.\n4. NO DUELS AND DEBATES. Arguable some of the best features from the ROTK series still remain missing from Nobunaga's Ambition. Come on Koei! Give it to us!\n\nConclusion: Gameplay aspect is improved upon vastly and keeps you engaged for the long run. Unfortunately, the game loses it's charm and personality. The grand scale doesn't leave enough time for the shorter sweeter moments that ROTK X was filled with, and even ROTK XI to a certain extent.\n\nBuy it if you're into strategy games. If you came to be consumed by a historical epic, I'm afraid Koei failed in this iteration.","September 7, 2015","true","131.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They are more than solid. They do the job but there is enough there to actually make you think the game is pretty. The artwork in cutscenes is splendid to look at. The best part for me is the castles and how detailed districts look.\n\nSound - 6/10 : Meh. The songs are a little repetative and loud personally. They do not really provide any ambience and I found myself turning off the music itself. Voice acting is brilliantly done and there is a good range of voices that make characters feel different, which is good.\n\nGameplay - 10/10 : Halfway between EU4 and Total War. It doesn't have as in depth a battle mode and it doesn't have as in depth a grand strategy mode but it is a brilliant balance. It doesn't feel "light" on mechanics. It has a nice spectrum of things to keep you busy each turn. The battle mechanics are a little clunky but it doesn't subtract from it.\n\nReplayability - 8/10 : Much like EU4 and Total War, there is a lot of replayability in so much that you have access to all of the different nations from a variety of different starting points but it isn't that different an experience. It is repetative but if you play games like EU4 and TW it is the same situation as those games. There are feats to accomplish but these aren't linked to steam achievements which is a little annoying.\n\nPrice - 7/10 : Considering games like EU4 and TW, the price point is a little higher than you would normally expect but it isn't overpriced per-say. If you like these types of games you will most definitely put more than enough hours in to make it worth it and if you compare it to a game like EU4, if you include all of the expansions, then it is a pretty good deal.\n\nI would really like to see it get some proper expansions or mods possibly in the future. This type of game in the European setting would be amazing.","September 4, 2015","true","34.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am also fan of Romance of the three kingdom's stories, manga and movies. This is the 1st time I play a nobunaga series and I hope it will bring the same enjoyment and interests in the sengoku period that ROTK 3 brought to me the interest/addiction of the Romance of the three kingdom.\n\nBest game tutorial ever! step by step introduction which helps to understand the basics of the game and cold jokes. 1st game that i lost the tutorial battle because i set the game speed too high. 10/10 will restart the tutorial. nice to have fast forward button for the conversations because I can't stand the jokes.\n\nFound out why i my fps was hovering around 40+ fps and occasional drop because i ran the game with my integrated intel gpu. Change to my gtx for smoother 60fps. Nevertheless, integrated gpu works fine means this game does not need a gaming pc/laptop to play.\n\nsettings will revert back to windows mode and 1280 x 720 when i restart the game.(known issue that affect most)\n\nAfter playing for a while on the scenario where nobunaga became a daimo, i have finally face my 1st true test where my alliance is being ganged by 2 of the largest clans. I realised the following:\n\n- This is a very complex strategic game where strong alliance, right buildings built, efficient resources management and and even luck (i had famine event during harvest month on both my cities when i planned for an offensive which i had to delay for a year) play a part in expanding and survival of your clan.\n\n- Build more fortresses to increase income and troop count.\n\n- Set policies to boost your clan\n\n- increase diplomacy with as many clans as possible (+20 helps with gold income +40 allows you to summon help)\n\n- I am facing the current adversity of 2 huge clan ganging up on me from the east because i was focusing on the west and naively thought they will not ally to attack my alliance.\n\n-building relationship with the shogun and bribing the official for higher ranking post\n\n-Battles can be settle automatically in the strategic map by AI or in a tactical format controlled by player\n\n\nIn my opinion, the battle system is very flawed. After so many battle in tactical form, i have yet to get a hang of where tactical movement and placement actually works.\n\nFor example surrounding a single enemy unit with 3 allies will see the same amount of troops losses on both side. having horses and musket does not seem to improve damage other than having the charge and release tactics. Using them placed the unit uncontrollable even after enemy in front had lost and retreated.\nAnother example is in an arrow battle, my unit with superior general and 3 times more troops takes more damage than a weaker opponent facing each other both with musket.\nThat means battles will most likely be the force that has higher troop count will win although not always true. (I have lost or win with more or less troops before but do not expect any significant victory using a lesser force)\n\n\nThe only times that i saw any difference are the tactics used by various units. However the tactic bar(command bar) increases so slowly which limit tactic usage to change the battle. Both side starts with the same amount even when the troops count are different or number of general/units are different. This means a smaller force can cast the same amount of tactics as a much superior force.\nThis is unlike ROTK 12 which has faster regeneration of tactic bar and troops movement placement are important. In this game it feels non-existance.\n\nTactical battle map are small and maneuvability is havoc when you want to aim an enemy unit but is near to another. Mass tactical battle map feel the same small size as normal battle and there is hardly any tactical movement to be made like flanking and sending decoy which could be made in ROTK 12.\n\nFor those who played koei ROTK games, this game battle system is more like ROTK 12 than to ROTK11 due to it being real-time. And i prefer the battle system of ROTK 12 than this game.\n\nFor those who played medieval 2 total war, the battle system in this game is nothing like total war. This is due to the fact that there is only one type of unit and medieval 2 has many different types. Therefore do not expect it to be the same or even better.\n\nHowever I will still recommend this game for its strategic part of the game, story, orchestra music, pleasant graphic, difficulty of the game and the complexity of game. There are many more reasons listed out by others and given my hundreds and hundreds of hours playing ROTK games, this is a potential hundred+ hours game for those who have the PATIENCE to conquer japan. If not I would recommend skipping this game as learning the basics and the tutorial will be more than 2hr and you can not accomplise and gain any satisfaction in a short term.","September 4, 2015","true","34.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

During the game you need to balance your actions in political, domestics and militaristics question, not forgetting to tell about all the others problems that may appear like, for example, treasons.\n\nYou have two options during the game, you can follow the hisical flow, learning a little more from the japanese history while repeating the same steps and decisions from the leaders from the time or if you want you can play everything on the fictional way of the history, trying to conquer and unify Japan under the flag from the clan that you choose or even in a clan that you have created.\n\nOne of the biggest problems from this game compared to others from the hitorical simulations is that, at least for me, this title is a lot easier if compared with RoTK, wherer I have played it since the SNES version and found more difficult in the IX, X and XI game from the serie, where you needed to do a better control and balance between the militaristic/diplomatic aspects of the game and needed to think a lot more in the combats where the weapon, general and skills available played a more important role in all the aspects of the game.\n\nFinally, to finish this brief review, if you like a game with all these  aspects allied with some strategy during the combats (that you can choose to fight your battles or only wait for a result) this game is for you. If not, stay away from the game and don't waste your money. If you want a better opinion, take a look on YouTube for gameplay videos and see for yourself.","September 9, 2015","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great line of games, I prefer Romance of the Three Kingdom (ROTK) line of games by a long shot, but I have not seen a PC Koei strategy game in a long time and seeing Nobunoga was exciting so I purchased it. Purchased on opening week and a good purchase too.\n\nGOOD: Fun! Fast past, Lots of scenarios, Nostalgic, Facebook post feature is cool, the macro and micro level battle options are unique.\n\nBAD: My settings never save, the AI is average, graphics are good enough, and feels like a port more than a PC game.\n\nSUMMARY: NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Sphere of Influence does not have the level of detail as even some of the older ROTK games. The general's values do not seem to matter too much in this game unlike ROTK where a Lu Bu would wipe any general away. In this game, an average general will put up a mighty fight against the best general. I think ther are too many traits/tactics and they are hard to sort when figuring out how to manuever generals around to other castles. All in all, this is a fun game and worth the purchase.

It won't be a full review as I haven't experienced enough the story aspect of the game, which is now clearly the main selling point of the game.\n\nPros:\n+Ambitious and beautiful game\n+Has complex character effects on your lands\n+Diplomacy seems to be multi-layered\n+Gameplay is fairly simplistic and easy to learn\n+Is designed like a boardgame so every action is balanced fairly well\n+Has good combat mechanisms built inside\n+Has a good story concentrating on Oda Nobunaga and is relatively speaking "historically accurate"\n\nCons:\n-Not enough user feedback on your actions\n-Gameplay doesn't get complex at all and becomes quickly very repetetive\n-You cannot determine things like facing of your troops -> Way too simplistic UI\n-Forces the story down your throat if you deliberately play as some minor faction far far away from Oda Clan\n\n\nNobunaga's Ambition is an overall a good game. It seems to include very complex succession mechanisms and character influences on your feudal fiefs. In that aspect it remotely reminds titels like CK2. However it doesn't seem to go all the way there when it comes to diplomacy.\n\nWhat do you mean "seems", you might ask. Well the game does its best to hide information from you. It doesn't give you that many numbers, when deciding who to lead your castles or armies or wether or not it has some hidden effects somewhere else. And you even cannot decide which way your troops are facing while in combat mode. Everything is so automated that you don't feel like you are in control.\n\nIt would be reasonable to ask 60 eur from a PC title if they would improve UI when they imported this  to PC. Now it requires so much extra clicking to get that piece of information that you expect to find in non-existent tooltips. But as everything is so automated, you rarely need to know why things are folding out as they are. This game comes with a manual to explain mechanisms that you never get to actively use unless you really sit down and read it.\n\nIts a good game but pricing is way out there. 30 eur would be more correct if the game wants to compete on its own price tag. It is not however a fully fledged and polished AAA product.","November 8, 2015","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The background is emense and the creators have done their research into every clan.\nGirls ayy, you get the hot grils as your generals if you really want that. (You can also turn it off for a more historical/realistic route.)\nCreate Your Own Officers Pretty obvious, but it adds a bit more RPG element into your strategy game.\nCreate Your Own Clan A nice touch to the game allowing you to make your own clan at the start of the game. You just have to survive the on slaught of larger daimyo at the start.Cons:Strategys in Battles I felt the battles were rather boring, almost to straight forward. Any strategy in the battle was usually defeated by just pure number, who ever had more seemed to win.\nDefeating Generals In a player fought battle, any time the main general of an army retreats, that entire army is destroyed, it doesn't matter if that army is larger than the other, it is completely lost.\nJust a few thoughts so far, will hopefully add more.

(can be avoided though, so it's possible to prevent honnoji incident from happening if you want to keep Oda Nobunaga alive)\n- Great graphics!\n- Micro managing the battle is optional so both casual & hardcore player can play\n- Depending on how high the AI's difficulty is, they can & will backstab you\n- Coalition battle!! This is the end game content that happen when you or someone else has grown to strong. The threatened clans across japan will join forces to destroy the OP clan. The OP clan can also make an anti-coalition too to counter this action.\n\nNeutrals:\n- The game rewards aggressive gameplay, establish an alliance quick & conquer your neighbour! Passive strategy where you build your city & only start attacking where you finally become big won't get you anywhere! (assuming you're playing a small clan like me, might be different if you prefer playing big clan)\n\nCons:\n- Western name order, goodluck searching your family members !!\n- Female Custom Created Character can't get married\n- Female Custom Created Character can't have kids (to counter thses you can create a male officer & gives him female portrait & voice .. it's not an ideal solution though >.<)","September 22, 2015","true","77.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From pushing Pushing Blocks with Sticks (TM) to computer simulated grand strategy games, none have succeded.\n\nNeither has this game, does that hurt the game? Not in the least.\n\nWhile there are some factors that are gamey such as limiting the amount of armies that can stay at a post to 3 regardless of the size of the army, it's clear they mean to insentivise the player to focus on building up holdings (Playing tall) as opposed to simply expanding their borders (Playing wide).\n\nAlso the game runs great, my laptop is kinda old and ran this game like butter.\n\nThe game also has 100% customizable officers and Daimyos, so if you're like me you may feel entitled to create a clan based on an island filled entirely with Sonic the Hedgehog OC's and laugh evily as ColdSteel the Edgehog topples the Ashikaga Shogunate.\n\nThere are problems I had with the game however, it can get kind of dull with diplomatic missions often lasting entire seasons and trying to manuever the complex web of alliances of sengoku era Japan when all you want to do is smash castles can really damper your will to play the game. The game is also really slow time-wise and if you want to follow a historical path, good luck with that because once you finish a bookmark's quest-line thats where history ends and the game becomes purely sandbox.\n\n**READ BEFORE BUYING**\nAlthough I really like this game and whole heartedly recommend it for history buffs and casual strategy gamers, there is not enough to this game to warrant a SIXTY dollar price tag. If the game is on sale for about $20 then you should definitley consider it.","March 12","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here's why:\n1) It's like Civilization from the 90's (haven't played Civilization since then) but you don't develop technologies. It's not as hard as Total War: Shogun for some strange reason. This game is easy to pick up.\n2) You'll have to consider a lot of things to keep you on your toes: 2a) season (I got to wait until September to harvest then I can sell it since that price is high, etc), 2b) placing officers (need to place him there in order to use all the available soldiers, need to place them there in order to develop agriculture, 2c) overall strategy (develop less soldiers within and more on the outskirts of my territory?), 2d) goals set for you to achieve based on history (hey, it provides an incentive to play this game on and on).\n3) doesn't eat up computer power so you can play on your less-powered laptops\n\nIn sum, I didn't think I would spend hours on it but I did. I'm middle-age and used to love thinking strategy when the jobs I had long ago involved strategic thinking and did make a difference in a society I was in; but now I'm just a desk monkey. This game is simple to learn and not as complicated as people make out to be, and at the price it is now, I think it's worth it.","March 27","true","30.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I have played many of the RotTK, Dynasty Warriors, Nobunaga's Ambition, and Samurai Warriors games. I wanted to like this game when I bought it.\n\nI played through the tutorial where you are guided into selecting what to do on each turn. The city commands it was instructing me to do felt trivial: Press button->More rice | Press button->More soldiers. It felt very uninteresting and did not make me feel like I was preparing for the upcoming battle the tutorial was eluding to. Seeing all of the grayed out buttons I could not select did have me optimistic, though.\n\nAfter too many turns of making more rice, I finally got to enter the battle. The battles in this game are like a real-time version of Dynasty Tactics, if you are familiar with this old title (also made by Koei). Troop-blob attacks troop-blob and there are officer commands that are usable that cause status effects for your troops or the enemy's. Again, what I was doing felt very trivial. As the battle went on I just sat there wondering, "Am I winning?"\n\nAfter the tutorial, I started a new game. I chose a random daimyo to play as and got into it. The next hour was me pressing buttons to make more rice and make more troops. I increased my trust with a neighboring clan (This feature, btw, makes no sense - You simply gain trust then spend it as a currency, effectively making the AI do what you want). After the "build up", I attacked a nearby clan with the help of a tribe and my neighbor's forces I called in. We walked up to the city, stood around for minute, and won. Such fun. I am not doing this for hours/days/weeks. Escape->Quit Game\n\nI understand that there may be more to the game than what I experienced. I looked around in all of the menus trying to find something interesting, or something I was missing, or not understanding. My imagination cannot even trick me into thinking there is more depth to this game than what I saw. It felt like I was playing a SNES game with simplistic mechanics but today's graphics. In all honesty, the SNES version of Nobunaga's Ambition is more fun than this. I guess my expectations were entirely too high for what I got.\n\nPros\nGraphics\nMusic\nUser interface is clean\nOfficer edit/creation\nStory events\n\nCons\nSense of strategy/tactics is lacking\nTrivial city upgrade system\nBattles are too simplistic and not fun enough to manually control\nDiplomacy system is incredibly flawed\nLack of meaningful information menus\nGame lacks any new innovative systems/mechanics to make it stand out\n\nIf you want a game set in this time period of Japan, Shogun 2 is still the go-to title.\nIf you want a complex strategy game, play Crusader Kings 2.\nIf you want a simple strategy game, play Civ 5\nIf you want a city building game, play Cities: Skylines\nIf you want a rice farming game, play Farming Simulator 2015.\n\nIf you still feel like you might want to buy this game, I implore you to watch many videos of the game actually being played. I bought the title based on being a Koei fan and the reviews that compared it to EU4 and how it was better than Civ 5. I feel lied to.","September 7, 2015","false","2.7"," 26 of 55 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","26","55","0","0"

Finally free weekend I can write what I like without owning the game. Overall the game is challenging and fun, however, it gets repeatiative over time. This game lacks multiplayer. The grand map strategy is definitely great especially when seeing those ai fighting eachother is quite amusing indeed. The lack of characters for minor clans doesnt balance the game well. Big clan always kill small clan in process, I think what helps is the edit the ability of certain character such as nobunaga, kenshin, shingen.\n\nfirst tryout not too successful as minor clan. i set to normal difficulty.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=548798456\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=548798479\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=548798506","November 5, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I bought this game based on the good reviews of the game and of course I love historic strategy games.\nThe first thing dragged my attention in this game was the wonderful map, of all strategy title I have this game has the best map ever very well detailed and beautiful, the castles the farms and the terrain blend well together, zooming in and out make the map of Japan very realistic and fun to watch, also how the army marching on the road, it’s just so good that no other games made something close to it.\nBut that is it for me, nothing more, the game seems to be deep, but not really, and the mechanism of many things doesn’t make much sense, like diplomacy, or using officer and controlling them in everything.\nThe game also requires a lot of clicking in order to do simple thing.\nThe anime art work is not my cup of tea in a historic setting.\nThe battle are just bland and bad, and I felt like playing a game on a tablet.\nI felt bored after playing for two hours and usually doesn’t happen to me with a decent strategy game.\nThe price is high for what the game is deliver and comparing to other great strategy titles.\nComparing with other similar historic strategy titles, this game is a combination between paradox title such as CK2 EU4 and total war games, but with much less depth in almost all aspects.\nIf you love battles get Shogun 2 TW, if you love depth in the camping map and diplomacy get CK2 or EU4.\nIf you want something that combine both but with overall better gameplay get Knights of Honor.\nI don’t recommend this game.\n","September 8, 2015","false","2.4"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","16","36","0","0"

Once I found out that was an option the game just went from an okay rts to being a cake walk. Like literally once you press that button you just have to manage armies and defend your realm.

While I didn't set my expectations very high....  the tutorial pretty much doomed my opinion.\n\nI don't believe I've ever played a tutorial which did a better job of turning me off from a game than this one did.  The tutorial shows you how to do about 5 basic acts within the game, so that you can have some idea how the game's interface works.  Sounds good right?   If that's all it did, that'd be fine.  But it also includes dialog between your character and someone advising them.   If you want to actually read the descriptions of what it is that you are doing - you click your way through conversations that take dozens of clicks.... click click click click click...     Otherwise you have the option of hitting the skip conversation button which fast forwards through it all - revealing just how ridiculously long the conversations are without telling you much.\n\nAfter forcing myself through the tutorial - I decided to give the game a shot.   To be honest, it's not bad.  In fact it would probably be just fine if it weren't for the fact that there are so many other games out there.   As it is, the game feels as though I have to go through far too many menus and clicks just to accomplish basic tasks.  Nothing is so encombersome that I can point to it and say "AH HA!", but it still feels .....

It lets you follow the historic path of multiple clans, or of a clan that had no major part in history. The game also lets you make new custom characters, and to make new clans useing the custom characters. The best part of the game (in my opinion) is how you can follow history or make a new clan and change history or more accurately write history your self. But the game should have put in a system were the clans follow the historic path and let your custom characters marry eachother. But over all it is a good game, that i would recommend to anyone that likes strategy games or japanese history.","December 23, 2015","true","242.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You CAN start with a small clan surrounded by huge ones, and you'll be crushed, as is logical.\n\n2/ Economy / Demesne\nSimilar to CK2 demesne limit, you can't rule everything directly, but the game is very generous, allowing you to manage everything in a given radius from your homebase. It is not until you reach a huge size that you need to resort to regents.\nHowever, you also lose controls of the armies of your regents, being only able to give them general directives like "Stay put"/"Attack this clan"/ "Support this province"\n\nThe economical management itself is pretty straightforward: develop a mix between crops/cash/soldiers and improve your infrastructure. The "Auto council" does a good job if you feel lazy.\n\n3/ Officers\nLike CK2, Officers are at the heart of the game, but in a different way. Almost all actions require an officer to perform it, so you need a pool of retainers to conduct your armies and develop your realm.\nEach officers has stats (War vs Economy) and a loyalty rating. In theory, low loyalty officers can betray you if bought by a rival clan (up to defecting with their castle, if there were alone in there), but in practice, it's merely an annoyance.\nDon't be afraid, no retainer is going to try to plot to assassinate your heir or launch a full fledged rebellion.\n\nYou can play a marriage game too, , in order to secure permanent alliances or make a promising officer you kin. But you will never inherit land that way\n\n4/ Rule of Law\nJapan is in the middle of a civil war so might makes right. You can attack anyone without any casus belli.\nThe only thing is that the Emperor can force a 6 months truce if someone bribed him enough.\nLikewise, you can abdicate and choose your successor anytime you like.\n\n5/ Combat\nNo surprise, NA:SoI is much more detailed and tactical than CK2. Even without going into Real Time mode, the mechanics of NA makes war very interesting.\n- Armies can only travel on the roadnetwork, and a maximum of 3 armies can fight at a single node:\nThis "simple" mechanics is enough to demonstrate the importance of chokepoints and an efficient road network. A strong fortress at the right place can defend access to a whole region.\n- Supplies. Soldiers leave base with 120 days worth of supplies and refill at each friendly base. This makes it very difficult to rush behind enemy lines and attackers may have to cancel a siege if it's progressing too slow.\n\n6/ Events/Quests\nin constrast with CK2 dynamic generic events, events in NA:SoI are both historical and tightly scripted.\nPlaying to recreate history makes it very awkward, since a moderatly competent player will significantly outperform history and will then need to wait for the "correct" date while refraining from expanding too much.\n\nSome quests are also "unnattural" in the sense that they make you do things that would be suicidal.\ne.g. an Historical quest with Kenshin Uesugi asks you to save a castle by destroying a 6000 strong army before they complete a siege, and it's set up in a way that you probably have no more than 1000 survivors under Kenshin unit (I had 58). If you try to muster more units from your lands, the castle will fall before you reach it, but if you charge to certain death with Kenshin, an event will trigger, with Kenshin going full "God of War" and annihilating the 6k stack by himself.\n\nStill, any fan of Japanese history will want to trigger Honnoji's Incident and others shattering events.\n\n7 / User Interface\nI'd never tought I'd say that, but NA:SoI makes me long for Paradox's UI. :)\nFor a game that relies so much on retainers, the interface for sorting through them is a nightmare, with information inconsistently split on several tabs.\n\ne.g. You conquered a new fortress and want to assign a Lord.\nYou have three buttons (move officer, summon officers, assign lord) that can potentially do the same thing.\nlet's use Assign Lord that shows all available retainers (i.e. not the one currently leading troops).\nYou can sort them by Leadership (useful stat for a Lord), but the listing includes retainers that are already Lords of existing castles, so you need to switch to another tab to know if the guy is a Lord, a Retainer or a Regent.\nOnce you found a retainer with high Leadership , you need to switch again to another tab to see if the guy is not also an Overseer, or the loyalty tab to check that the man doesn't hate your guts.\n\nLong story short, the game needs an officer search engine ...","September 21, 2015","true","251.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are so many wonderful things about the game, but for me, the biggest success it's how I actually learnt quite a bit (and started to become more interested) in this period of Japanese history and the key characters in it.\n\nOne of the most brilliant parts of the game is how it is designed to allow players to effectively set up automation. On the surface, many new players might wonder why certain things (the resource model, battle system, generation of troops etc) seem so different to other similar games. But play longer, and you'll realise the incredible design philosophy of the game. Many similar games suffer from ''big empire syndrome'', while Nobunaga's ambition is incredibly fun both for small and big empires - due to the ability to set up effective delegation. The game shifts from micromanagement of individual units and bases to overall management of provinces and grand strategy. This includes coordinating huge attacks (eg: 100,000 soldiers) from multiple bases and allies.\n\nAnother astonishing idea in the game is the design of alliances. Unlike many games, in this game a player would often truly help allies (instead of taking advantage of them or planning a backstep). Marriage alliances are permanent and coalitions can be formed, where allies help each other to take out larger empires. It is almost like a movie or real history, where an alliance of desperate armies unite to defeat the enemy. You can win the game with having active allies (instead of having to betray them and conquer their lands)\n\nSimilar to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, the other thing I really like is the ability to pick any clan in the game to play (instead of being forced to play one side). It's awesome trying to defy history, such as stopping Nobunaga from trying to conquer Japan. There are also many other features such as the ability to create custom officers, clans and change BG music settings.\n\nOverall, I totally recommend the game - I would rank it probably among the top three games I've ever played.","September 22, 2015","true","77.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The historical cut scenes and flavor are a nice touch and add a lot of depth and character to the game.   The combat system is a bit interesting and reminds me of the Dynasty Warriors Tatics system with unit commander skills and traits.\n\nThe City customization is also nice and fairly easy to grasp, but difficult to master in order to maximize your cities growth.\n\nSome of the translation issues from the Manual to the ingame tool tips can be a bit confusing, but this is to be expected frankly.\n\nIf you enjoy Japanese history and this type of simulation games, then I have to recommend you check this one out.  While it certainly does not have quite the depth of say Europa Universalis 4, it makes up for this in the robust and more personalized battle system.  All in all, its a great title and worthy of its "Very Positive" Steam User rating.","September 22, 2015","true","94.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've always been a fan of Koei's work in the Samurai and Dynasty Warriors series. While I've wanted to get into the series, I've made the mistake of using the older games as sorta my original starting ground and couldn't make sense of it.\n\nNow I'm not saying that this game is casual, but it's definitely a lot easier to get used to how controls work now. Visuals are pretty, and it's pretty fun to slowly watch your towns grow as time passes and you become more powerful.\n\nAs for battles, granted I must admit I've not quite gotten the hang of it yet, but it's fairly complex battle tactics far as I can tell. And sometimes you do get lucky and overcome a bigger opponent and feel like the king of the world.\n\nFor the history buffs such as myself, this game really places historical knowledge more at the forefront unlike the Warriors series. The events telling the lives of different warriors and lords is always enjoyable to learn. And as for the CG movies and events, they're rather well done.\n\nWhile it's not perfect, I feel comfortable recommending this game to near anyone who wants to try a strategy in general.\n\n9/10","October 1, 2015","true","75.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my first time playing any of the games in the Nobunaga's Ambition series and so far I've been loving it, its similar to total war games in a way, some things are more simplified and on the lower difficulties the AI obviously isnt that intellegent but they have custom options for difficulty that allows you to make the AI harder but not allow them to cheat in other aspects that a game would normally let them cheat in such as diplomacy, income, supplies, etc. There are also multiple things that can be done to help minimize the micromanagement as your clan increases in strength such as creating provinces, delegating cities so that development is handled by the lord of the castle, and a few others. There is also the option to follow along with certain parts of history through quests that you can choose to accept or decline as they come up in history, some people have mentioned issues with the AI interfering with quests by their actions but so far through Nobunaga's line I have yet to run into any issues caused by the AI. A few downsides that I believe would've been nice and that I had enjoyed in the ROTK series were actual castle defenses, battles near your castles are fought outside the gates with defensive turrets (if you've built them) and some log spear walls (both of which are destructable simply by ordering your unit to walk through them, it takes them a little bit of time however so it will delay your unit and towers will still fire while you are destroying them.) Diplomacy is also quite simplified through a trust system which just involves you sending an officer to them who will stay there till trust is at 100 or you order them back. One really interesting feature however is the ability to add up to 3000 portraits into the game to use for character creation. This option allows for many play throughs with different themed forces or even allows you to implement yourself into the game. The game looks very nice and isnt very demanding on your pc so low end machines should have no problem maintaining 30+ FPS which is very playable for a RTS game. Overall if you enjoy RTS games or have played any previous games of this series or the ROTK series then I would highly recommend the game, if you consider the price tag a little too high for the game then add it to your wishlist and hope for a sale (not that common with Koei games, but I personally don't regret my purchase of the game at full price.)","February 22","true","52.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
