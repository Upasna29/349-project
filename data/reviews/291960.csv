Nearly every major RPG franchise owes something to this classic series. Despite its Western roots, Wizardry has become very successful in Japan, with innumerable ports, sequels, and clones. Unfortunately we've seen maybe a fraction of Japanese Wizardry-likes here in the US.\n\nOff the top of my head there has been:\n-Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land (hugely recommended)\n-Wizardry: Labryinth of Lost Souls (ehh..it's ok I guess)\n-Class of Heroes 1 & 2 (second game is decent)\n-The Dark Spire (didn't get very far, I should give it another go)\n-Elminage Original and Gothic (I'm supposed to be reviewing one of these games huh?)\n\nThere are a number of other D-RPGs out there like the Etrian Odyssey series, a handful of the Shin Megami Tensei games, Demon Gaze, and so on. The point is, there are hardly any of these games available in this side of the world. By comparison, the number of Wizardry-likes available in Japan can no longer be considered a real number.\n\nElminage Gothic is one of the few very rare Wizardry-likes available in the U.S. That should be more than enough reason to get a recommendation...right? Eh...well sure why not? But that doesn't mean I can't give the game a good hard look.\n\nThe story of this game involves great evils, increasing numbers of monsters, sealed demon gods, etc. It's not really a story, more of an excuse to explore dungeons and kill (or be killed). Elminage Original has a similarly vacant plot but I think it had one or two interesting villains. Well, I think they had conversations with the player-character that couldn't be summed up as "I'm gonna kill youuuuuu RAWR!" Point is, this game has a non-existent story. There are 13* dungeons, most of which are optional, but you'll want to explore them all for better gear, and because it's fun.\n\nAs with all Wizardry-likes (WizLs), the first step is building that perfect party. There are several races and classes available and finding the right setup takes patience & hard work. Old standbys like the three fighters, thief, cleric, and mage are possible, but most players will want to go with the advanced classes. Valkyrie and Samurai are able fighters as well as serviceable spell-casters, summoners can get almost any monster to serve them, and alchemists are proficient in numerous utility spells . Also unlike most J-RPGs, even powerful monsters tend to be weak towards status effects.\n\nWizLs are rarely known for sensible mechanics. Expect the first couple hours of this game to be a little confusing. Yes it's normal to gain 1 HP or even lose stats when leveling up. While you can (and should...at least early on) re-roll for better HP boosts, the system is designed to work itself out.\n\nElminage Gothic is a very offensive-oriented game. Oh sure having a low AC is nice, but the monsters in this game are designed to kill, not hurt. As soon as you arrive in the second dungeon you'll be welcomed by ninjas. Getting beheaded is the most common cause of death in this game. Granted, that's not to say you won't be seeing your squishy mages nuked constantly by lightning bolts, nor will devastating status effects such as stone be a rare occurence. That's just how often death occurs in this game. If you've entered a new area that's out of your league (gear isn't good enough or lacking experience), this game will let you know in the hardest way possible.\n\nElminage Gothic isn't what I'd call balanced. In fact a lot of battles in this game are going to be one-sided. I'm not expecting fairness when I play D-RPGs. On average the difficulty of these games is higher than normal. Besides, this game offers everything from 99 save slots to an easy teleport spell, so you never really lose progress. Sometimes though, the average enemy encounter can be absolutely ridiculous. Take for example the Master Ninja. Imagine if a ninja started the battle invisible. They could attack (and behead) you, but you couldn't do anything about it for at least one round. These guys attack twice, that's potentially two dead party members. Master Ninjas can attack in groups of three or more. For maximum effect let's say you get ambushed by a group of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nAre you freaking kidding me?\n\nIt can go deeper than that. Picture a group of werewolf archers. They have a skill called lightning attack. Basically it's a first-strike move. Before you ask, yes these guys behead. That wasn't enough so the archers are paired with enemies that can cause party-wide status effects. These effects can include sleep, paralysis, whatever. So by the end of the battle every in your party is suffering from some kind of ailment. These archers have a pursuit sweep ability, where at the end of the round they automatically strike all ailing party members. Your sleepy, scared, poisoned, or otherwise indisposed party is going to suffer through potentially SIX waves of behead-capable arrows.\n\nIt's almost pornographic. How could one game hold so much contempt for a person that they'd invent all these twisted scenarios? Even Elminage Original wasn't quite this nightmarish.\n\nSome of the other changes Gothic brings to the table involve exploration. Previous Elminage titles had easily available mini-maps. Gothic however expects the player to use magic maps. These items are one-use compasses essentially. They show what you've explored and where you're currently located. It's mostly a nuisance. Early on an easily repairable map can be found, and apparently somebody has already figured out how to hack the game to make infinite magic maps. The dungeons are for the most part really good. Some involve numerous treks between different floors(Hastrana), others require switches to be flipped, and still others(Royal Tomb) are just there to confuse and frustrate. I can see why Starfish went with the magic map system, since a number of dungeon puzzles rely on the player not having a mini-map. Genre-veterans won't find a lot of new ideas in these dungeons, but they'll welcome them all the same.\n\nDelivering punishment to those enemies that held you down for so long is extremely rewarding. Still, it's nothing that I can consider balanced. Instead of simply getting destroyed in battle after battle, your party is stomping formerly insurmountable odds like so many insects. Even fights are few and far between in this game. In some cases the boss encounters can involve round to round strategies, some can even require a stout defense. However, all of the bosses automatically recover HP every round. Essentially the boss-battles -- normally the culmination of all your knowledge and abilities -- boil down to two things 1) damage race and 2) equipment check. Again, this speaks to how offense-oriented this game is.\n\nAll that said, I don't really consider this a knock against the game. That's simply the way it's designed. Everyone has their own preferences, but I enjoy the short and to the point battles, even if they can be annoyingly unfair in how they're put together at times. Unfortunately this style of game-design probably won't gel with "Iron-man" players. Some will have foresight to know when they're in over their heads, but that doesn't mean their complaints are invalid (especially when their well put-together party is undone by a ludicrous ambush).\n\nHoly smokes Steam reviews have character limits? Better cut this short then.\n\nThe game is addictive as hell. It's also rewarding.  It's $10 and pretty awesome if you can accept its idiosyncrasies.\nBut that's just my opinion.\n\n*There are three post-game bonus dungeons.","September 23, 2014","true","66.5"," 130 of 153 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","130","153","5","0"

It is not without some flaws, though.\n\nFirst, the great things:\n\n+ It's Wizardry. Grid-based maps, 6 party members, 9 different races, 16 different classes (You can recruit monsters too!). You can change classes, too, with some restrictions.\n+ 75+ floors across 16 different dungeons to explore, all with a unique environment and music. Lots of variety. Yes, rotating floors, teleporters, pitch black rooms, shoots, pits, traps, ie what you would expect in a Wizardry game.\n+ 400+ GORGEOUS hand-crafted monster models. Detailed in-game bestiary as you find more monsters\n+ 500+ different items/weapons/armor\n+ 65 quests, fairly non-linear\n+ Weapon/armor crafting. Endless customization to fit your needs.\n+ Great music, especially the 8 battle themes. Soundtrack included!\n+ Random encounters are rare. 90% of battles are from preset monster locations that respawn if you leave the dungeon\n\nNow the bad things:\n- Pretty bad menus. You get used to them after awhile though and quickly learn how to navigate them efficiently\n- Limited inventory space (Warehouse eventually gets expanded to 99 which is fantastic!)\n- Maps are consumable, but early in the game you get a reusable map item, and there are magic spells that let you view the ENTIRE dungeon on all floors.\n- Leveling up system is confusing for new players. HP gains are based on your vitality and level so don't worry about how much HP you are gaining per level, because it will balance out. If you want to min/max your stats, you have the freedom to.\n\nIf you are looking for a huge game that rewards you with exploration and experimentation, Elminage Gothic fits the bill. Having finally done everything possible in the game, I must say that it was some of the best 300+ hours I've spent.\n\n9/10 as there are some things that could be improved. Can't complain though because games like this are pretty rare.","December 13, 2014","true","340.3"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","49","56","0","0"

Why I'm I telling you this is because its my first impressions of Elminage Gothic (EG) I'm not a big RPG gamer with the exception of FF titiles and Dragon Quest. If you're thinking of buying this due to the 1st person RPG style from a yesteryear I can't think this will disappoint many. I rather have been enjoying EG however a few niggles which seem to stand out! It doesn't explain very much. This can be a + or - depending on preference. The biggest wall you will hit is getting lost and a party wipeout due to how the game has consumable maps!? Thats right single use maps, run out and its hit and miss if you'll see light again. Once this is understood and you buy lots of magic maps and remember to manage items and know when to head back its not bad. Although I could see this putting more casual gamers off. Overall this has the ability to become a favourite of mine.","September 18, 2014","true","8.3"," 49 of 61 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","49","61","0","0"

If those words start making your mouth water or makes you start thinking back to the old school Wizardry games and fond memories of late nights being glued to the warm glow of a computer screen with a caffinated soda in one hand and a pile of graph paper in the other savouring the fustrastion and the joys of trying to solve a vast deadly monster filled maze. Then this game is for you. This game is a Wizardry clone and one that isn't afraid to really hold anything back but rather embraces the old school nature of those games.\n\nMonsters that can drain your stats or levels, it's got that. Possible one hit deaths it's got that. Vast maze like dungeons made to get you lost? oh yeah it's got that and in spades(over 94 floors to explore spread out over  16 dungeons), varied monsters it's got that too, it's even has for better or worse the old school Wizardry 1-5 level up system(you know the one where you have to rest at a inn and your stats can not only increase but decrease every level up but it is balanced out), charecters that can age yup, if it was a part of the old Wizardy rule system it's probley in this game.\n\nNow this game isn't for everyone, if you are the easily fustrated type or a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ this game will be a major turn off as this game is unapologeticlly hard and is not only emulates old school Wizardry games in the rules but also in the games graphics(though admitedly it's better then the early PC versions which were just wire frames for the dungeons) which take a cue from the japan only PS1 remakes of Wizardry's 1-5 which used 3d graphics for the dungeons and static hi-res portrates for the monsters and the town(which was still a basic menu like the orginal versions). But if that doesn't bother you and your looking for something that captures the old school Wizardry era dungeon crawler then this is for you. Just keep in mind while there is a automap feature it is a limited one as you can only access it via use of the consumable one use magic map item(though you can buy as many of them as you can carry and there is a multiple use one that can be found in the second dungeon but it can break but is repairable) and a level 1 mage spell so you may want to rely on it only when you are lost which probley will be very often since many passages and rooms are built in a way to confuse and trick you.","September 19, 2014","true","22.0"," 43 of 53 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","43","53","0","0"

These places comprise of a tavern, an inn, a temple, a shop, the castle and lastly a Training school. This last one, it's where you can you choose from a list of already created adventurers to be your companions or perform "adventurer registration" (i.e, create new characters to be your companions). You can also change the classes of already existing characters or simply delete them.\nCharacter creation goes further than most RPGs: besides the common options in these games, like gender and name choice, it also includes 8 different races to choose from (including some very uncommon ones like dragonewt, werebeast, fairy, gnome and hotleat); "alignment choice" (Good, Neutral or Evil) that limit the choice of the 18 classes at your disposal (by choosing one of the alignments, there will be a couple of classes unavailable to you). You will also get bonus attribute points that also determine what class you can be: to get a certain class you need a determined number of points. You can re-roll the points you get until you can choose the class you are interested in but, fair warning, it is very hard to get more than 20 points (the best I got was 28 after many tries). To be able to pick the "Lord" class you need 30. You can also select the character's age (it affects slightly the bonus attribute points) and one Extra Skill.\nNote: Created characters will have lower level than the ones that are on the list to pick from.\nBesides the variety of traps, treasures and items there are also hundreds of different monsters that require different tactics to defeat. Traps can also be tricky to deal with. All this requires a very fine tuning between the skills and classes of your party members when in combat and dungeon crawling.\nThere is a large variety of dungeon levels too (so far, all dungeon levels I encountered are different).\nSoundtrack: Beautiful but lacks variety.\n\n\n\nThe game also has a few flaws:\nOne thing, among a few other, that this game lacks is a tutorial but you get the hang of it pretty quickly.\nTrying to return to a dungeon level after navigating through so many already makes dungeon crawling a bit dull and repetitive.\nSo far I encountered a couple of bugs and glitches that aren't fixed.\nControlling your character through the dungeons is harder than it should be.\nThe dungeons have very low resolution.\n\nDespite all these flaws, this game is actually very good. In my opinion, the best part of this game is (micro-)managing your adventurers/companions to face the many obstacules (enemies or traps) thrown your way.","May 13","true","9.6"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","27","27","0","0"

I can handle basic dungeon crawlers and while EG resembles those games superficially it lacks a soul. The closest match is probably Wiz6 gameplay wise, but it adds much more tedium to it.\n\n- Massivly limited Inventory while bombarding you with junk\n- No resting in dungeons, so if your spellcasters run out of their exteremely limited spell pool you have to track back all the way through those  Dungeons with Map layouts that make no sense other than to annoy the player and are too hard to navigate without a map which is a consumable item. And i consider that Underground Map to be a consumable too, because it breaks all the time.\n- Crap breaks all the time and due to limited inventory carrying spares restricts the limited inventory even further.\n- Losing attributes randomly and wide range of hp gains forces save scumming early levels (which based on ingame clock and steam play time so far is several hours and im lev 15 ...)\n- No difficulty indicator for Traps/Doors (just gonna avoid Magic Drain like the plague)\n\nI wanted to like this, i was craving for a new turn based dungeon crawler (sorry Grimrock), but this one falls flat so far.","May 9, 2015","false","43.1"," 59 of 81 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","59","81","0","7"

While I would reccomend the former to anyone, Elminage has a few issues that give me a little hesitation.  Some of the sound choices put me off. The music isn't that bad, fortunately, yet the menu confirmation sound is a bit over-loud.  The art direction is very very top notch and the ability to go into an art gallery mode to appreciate the beasties you fight is a welcome decision.\n\nWhat is NOT a welcome decision was that this port removed the capability to insert artwork from outside sources for your own characters! Some of us like to draw our own characters and thrust them into the character grinder that is the Wizardry series.  This was a missed feature and Starfish really dropped the ball on this.\n\nGripes aside, the real meat and bones is the wizardry gameplay and from the get-go the game does not pull its punches. If you decide to generate your own characters ( And you should! ) the starter dungeon goes from a challenge for the pregenerated level 5s to a nightmare for your level ones.  Every level you get, even if it's one HP point,  you will savor and each victory comes that much sweeter, especially since party members can now cover each other!  Having a tank character is actually a huge asset and lets your dual-wielders or two-handers take a breather if they get picked on, since he or she can defend them.  It's a nice little touch of teamwork from the usual fight/fight/fight/parry/parry/parry.\n\nSpeaking of, the dreaded fight/fight/fight/parry/parry/parry is something that no longer happens nearly as often.  Furthermore, you can also screw monsters over by putting thieves in the front line.  If monsters can't detect them, they can't target them, nor can they aim at the back line, unless they have a longer range weapon.\n\nOh that's right, kids. Long range weapons are no longer just for your characters. From the second dungeon on, your back row can be exposed to heat from spear wielders and ninja weapons that can behead on a lucky shot. Still, back line members are nowhere near as likely to get pinged off as your front line is, so there is that going for them. Oh, and on the subject of being hidden? Enemies can hide too and screw over your chances at getting at the mages in the back line. If you happen to encounter a group of mages with fighters in the back row, the fighters will gladly advance on you to keep their casters out of the line of fire.\n\nThere are also classes that are nonstandard from the classic wizardry series, and in a decision that made me smile, there are also genders that are nonstandard from normal nomenclature. I got a chuckle when I rolled an effeminate "?" gender mage, only to find out later that they also qualify for a valkyrie class change when they get the stats for it, their indeterminate gender qualifying them for the normally female-only class.\n\nThere really is a lot to like here, and the ups far outweigh the downs. I just wish that they would have included the ability for us to import our own drawings so we could play as characters we truly make. Alas, it is a fly in the ointment, but if you've ever played, and liked the Wizardry series, this is Wizardry, 110% so.  Fans of the RPG Genre should find enough here to greatly enjoy and I would gladly reccomend it to them, especially at the $10 price tag.  It's a crime not to enjoy another entry in the wizardry series.","October 29, 2014","true","218.6"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","3"

I have played another Ghostlight pub before, Agarest, and I felt that the port was acceptable, but not great.\nIn the case of Elminage, I do see a great improvement. The cutscenes are still a little choppy, though I think this may be a problem with .wmv running inside the game engine. Other than that, the gameplay is flawlessly implemented to PC. You can play with controller or keyboard and mouse and they both work equally well, though I could do with an option for mouse sensitivity because I play on such a small surface.\n\nI will cover briefly some other topics about the game:\nA lot of elements of gameplay were not covered in the manual, though by now it has been diseminated onto the internet being that this is a port of a game that is a few years old. While this is a JRPG it has deeper roots than Dragon Warrior/Quest, most notably Wizardry. If you are not familiar with Wizardry and you are wondering if you would like this game, I encourage you to do some research. This game is THAC0 based and a lot of people dislike that system, but having been acquainted with this system long ago I do like it.\nThe artwork is pretty good. It reminds me of Atlus games pre-Persona 3, but with better resolution.\nFinally, the music works well with the atmosphere the game is trying to convey and is properly implemented. Previously, Agarest had some issues with improper looping of music, but I detect none of those issues here.\n\nThis game is complex, so I do encourage you to do your research before purchasing, but if this game turns out to be up your alley then it's money well spent.","September 18, 2014","true","4.8"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","26","34","0","0"

And if you find it a nuissance, you can choose to do the grinding.  At one juncture I did a couple of levels, is an hour or two.\n\nThe game becomes more "approachable" once you get the Mage Diomente spell.  Allows you to teleport wherever you want.   Without it, it can get tediuos.  But given it's accessible for a Mage quite early, I don't see this as a negative either.\nJust plan your party reasonably and you'll be fine.\n\nMy party which has died a very limited number of times:\n\nInnocent Characters:  Brawler, Samurai, Valkyrie, Mage.\nBetween them I have 18 Diomente spells allowing me to complete dungeons without complaining about maps.  I quite literally bounce all over the maps as I like to do every square.\n\nThe other two characters:\nAlchemist and Lord.    The Lord started as a Cleric.   Is a pretty lame character at this juncture.  Wish I had done something different - Cleric to Summoner comes to mind.   The Alchemist started as a Thief.   I don't miss the Thieving abilities.  I can open chests and my char investory is usually full before I use up all the High Portal spells.  I like the Alchemist Forging skill.\n\nI didn't bother with a Bishop for Identify and the dual spell casting - too much EXP needed to level up and money is plentiful.\n\nOverall - great game.  Thoroughly enjoyable gaming experince\n\n","November 22, 2014","true","126.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

I'll modify it when I'll be more experienced <==\nThx to all who gave me tips to play better Elminage.\n\n\nElminage Gothic isn't bad game but its far to be good game.\n\n\n+ Nice looking graphics : artwork is fine even if sprite suffer of lack of good animations\n+ Nice musics\n+ Easy battle system\n+ Ex skills system : you can choose 1 on creation (some very helpful or exclusive)\n+ Nice alchemy system : if you create alchemist, you'll be able to transform ores in AP (Alchemy Points) to modify item to avoid gender restriction, add protections or elemental effects...\n+ Moddind allowed : its possible to modify files in game directory to create your own Elminage with rules modification (you need software to unpack/repack Elminage files)\n+ Alignement change : there is a way to set at opposite alignement Good & Evil\n\n\n- Bad menus system : UI suck. You have to find how & when to save, too many sub-menus (its possible to create better UI that require less surfing with more efficiency. No drag & drop system when managing items..\n- Random bonus system at character creation never allow easily to choose your class (Ninja, Lord, are very difficult to create at start because class require too much bonus points to create).\n- HP/SP recovery sucking system : even if you can camp, i never found resting option button to recover all HP/SP  from team. That mean long travel to dungeons->cities to rest in inn.\n- Too few portraits by class\n- Some Ex Skills are exclusive : Sacrifice exist only for cleric pre-generated character level 4, you can't create more characters with such exclusive skills.\n- Steam version seem to be port from PSP version, controversial version because Elminage Gothic is sequel from previous one Elminage that was better for fan to play in many ways (more classes, more advantages for some classes, more options to play...).\n- Classes problem : less classes to play than previous Elminage, some like Lord are weakness in protection now. Changing classes must be done as soon as stats match because only some spells can be passed to next class, all others will vanish (Ex Skills, stats above class requirement, class skills)\n- Level up system : you can't level up outside inn. I guess you need to rest to level up Grrrr.\n\n\nElminage isn't bad game but if you already played previous version you'll be disapointed because new rules/options not better. In all case you need to balance your team to kill hard (i think its better to kill hard & fast (aoe) than to be better in protections only).\n\nYou can buy Elminage Gothic but i don't recommend until game will allow me to rest anytime in dungeons. Elminage Gothic concept ruins my experience to play for these reason. When you start level 1 team you NEED to rest.\n\nBy luck, with community modding, Elminage Gothic can become great game or for those who master how to modify rules.","November 4, 2014","false","46.7"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","25","38","0","14"

Elminage Gothic of course keeps up with this tradition. EXCEPT THAT THEY DECIDED TO REMOVE ALL OF IT FOR NO REASON IN THE PC VERSION. Do note that since the original version of the game was made with the ability to add your own stuff in mind, it comes with very few options by default. Well, you're stuck with those limited default options. Enjoy.\n\nThe PC port is badly-done too (this was originally a PSP game), with everything looking hilarious oversized, and the localisation work is shoddy with a lot of falling back to NES era "we can't fit all the text in so let's just make it all acronyms". It's also odd how the nickname field doesn't have as many characters as the name fields which means you might want to have a character's nickname the same thing as their real name and straight up not be able to.\n\nI only got this because it was on sale at 294 yen, just a little over a tenth of what the lunatics are asking for on PSN (2571 yen), but the the near to 90% discount just simply doesn't outweigh the problems with this version.\n\nVery, VERY disappointing.\n\nThat being said, you can run it in a small window if you like that sort of thing (watch videos on Youtube while dungeon crawling? Why not?) and the requirements are low enough that it runs fine on laptops so if you're looking for something to play on a flight or something this may be worth considering.\n\nThe game itself is an alright Wizardry clone, except that Elminage 3 was better in literally every conceivable way (possibly because the series director who handled pretty much everything was fired halfway through 3's development process). Also the whole aging thing is weird.","June 11, 2015","false","0.9"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","30","48","0","0"

At my current hour count (10) I've barely scratched the surface and only haven't continued lately because life has kept me busy:\n\nHighlights:\n\nHardcore dungeon crawling with 92 or so different dungeon levels. These are not the superficial, "skin" like differences you see in pretenders, but are things like levels that are partially underwater and your party will drown if you don't move quickly, or levels full of wind tunnels that impede navigation.\nDifficult, tactics oriented combat in which you cannot solve every combat the same way. While the game starts off simple, it slowly escalates the level of threat it throws at you until you need counter several different game changing abilities so that you stand a chance at all.\nComplex character building system in which creative multiclassing will get you far, while at the same time un class changed characters (innocents) get powerful equipment only they can use.\nA large base of loot, of which many items have a unique niche instead of being exactly like x, but better or worse.\nA complex crafting system in which the bonuses provided by your items can be enhanced or customized.\nOne of the classes (Summoner) can bind and contract monsters and then use them as seventh party members. This system alone has far more depth than many entire games.\n\nThere are people with hundreds of hours on this game still learning new things about it. I only regret that I haven't had the uninterrupted time for a proper runthrough myself.\n\nWith all that having been said, if you are a casual gamer or a hardcore pretender you should absolutely stay away. This is not one of those fake hardcore games where you just grind through trivial content, Elminage will not validate you. If you're looking for a grand story... you'll find a alright one, but not for free. This is not one of those visual novel, on rail experiences falsely described as an "RPG". This is classic, old school dungeon crawling fun. About the only legitimate problem I'd say is the interface, it's really poorly designed and could definitely do with better placement of options and keybindings but I recommend it in spite of that relatively minor problem.","February 8","true","10.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/291960/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","From time to time I’ll have a disagreement between my evaluation of the game and what the Steam store’s evaluation of a game is. Games that I feel are deserving of a positive review score will have mixed or even a negative vote while there are some games where I feel the opposite. As I write this reflection a year and a half following the release of Elminage Gothic I see that the review count stands at mixed. However, it is close to a positive (62/34). So while I cannot be too disappointed I must admit that I thought that there was no doubt that the game would have a positive review score.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game from my perspective is the overall presentation. The basic things from the appearance of the UI and the menu system appear to be ripped from a game developed a decade prior to that. Given the level of modern luxuries that we gamers enjoy I can appreciate that many modern players wouldn’t find the game appealing from this perspective. This certainly appears to be the case when reading through the well written negative critiques of the game. In fact many of the positive reviews state the same thing. It’s a fair call. But it doesn’t break the game as far as I’m concerned. While you may feel that it negatively impacts your overall experience I find that it’s not one of the most important things for me. I suppose I just have different priorities.  Another issue that players have had is that they have claimed that the game has been ported directly from the PSP version of the game. I never did get around to play that version of the game but if it is it would explain pretty much everything about the presentation quality. Then there is the fact that the game, sadly, hasn’t been Steamified aside from trading cards.That means no achievements and of course no multiplayer (not that the game needs it).\n\nSo now that we’ve identified what is bad about the game we need to delve into what its strong points are. Chief among these is that it possesses varying levels of the dungeon and the different atmospheric settings of each such as semi underwater levels, It makes for a genuine dungeon crawling fanatics dream. The depth of the game systems, in loot, in actions and in spells, in specialist skills and abilities (alchemists are important in this game) and the amount of things that you can do could quite easily lead you to spending a couple of hundred hours exploring the game if you wanted to experience absolutely everything.\n\nThis is a game where you need to dig deep below the surface. Those who haven’t tend to be the ones who don’t enjoy the game.\n\n“In my day son….

There are many classes, with synergies between them, and a system that allows multi-classing, similar to that in Wizardry titles. The difficulty is nice, making every success a real accomplishment of skill and perseverence. Plus there are some little (or not so little...) things like alchemy, which allows for gear modification, summoning system, or item mixing.

No real story and what there is is badly translated, a lot of items you can equip that make very little difference to how you play, you level up your characters in random dungeons that you will never even care about getting to the end of. The things you fight attack in basically the same way...some have quirks such as they multiply themselves or whatever but you wont care..its just clicking buttons till they die either way. There are silhouettes of things that you run into disguised as encounters but really only work as map markers that you will very quickly come to hate seeing.Your characters hit harder as they level up and dont die easilly - the point is - you probably wont care even if they do die and after as little as an hour playing this you will likely decide that the contents of the inside of your nose have suddenly become wonderously entertaining by comparison.

First of all, the confusing maze of menus you need to fumble through just to save your game or equip your weapons. Even combat is 20 clicks long per round. I have yet to find an explanation on anything about this game, so I can't figure out how to load my saved game. I have to start a new game every time I want to play. Also The characters I created earlier are still listed in the "Adventure's" tab of the training area, but I can't put them back into the party. There is absolutely no way to exit the game without rage-quiting and closing out the window. Seriously!? Who designed this? I can't believe I paid money for this! Steam seriously needs to give free 24 hour trials on these games so people can get a feel for them before they waste their money. I can't believe their are people on the forums recomending this.

These games are not forgiving even on the first floor and possibly the first random encounter. A balanced party is recommended and there are premade characters if you don't feel like rerolling attribute points for the right stat.

Looks great, but virtually unplayable.  After 60 tedious minutes of play... still at level one.  Mostly because of the constant dying and the fact that while your characters swing and miss for most of the combat (meanwhile, you are killed by a single hit from the enemies).  You can't even access a menu to just re-load.  I had to alt-tab and close the game and come back in.  About 1/20 attacks actually landed.  And my three mage and thief charcacters of course can only have 2-3 magic points, which makes them useless since they cast one spell while in a dungeon and then never again - oh, and they can't melee attack, either, so half my team is literally doing NOTHING during combat.  complete rubbish.\n\nThen when I finally re-load the game I had saved, all of my characters where removed from my party, I was back in town (I'd saved in the dungeon) and I had to PAY to put my characters back in my party!  ♥♥♥♥ THAT!

It's bad.  In many ways.  And I want to like it, I just can't.  And don't.\n\nHere are just a few since I don't have all day to sit here and write about everything this one did wrong.\n\nTo start with the game has a poor interface with huge, scrolling descriptive text where smaller text would have fit on the screen and still been large enough to read.  Easily.\n\nBuying, selling, moving and equipping is tedious.  Searching chests and disarming is also tedious.  Combat... you guessed it, feels tedious.  Really, any game that has a "repeat last set of orders" button for all SIX of your characters (so push one button and repeat all six actoins) is doing something wrong.  I shouldn't want to do the same thing every single turn.  All of my (fairly few) fights have been pretty much like this: 3 melee attack, 3 support defend.  That only changes if someone gets hurt, then I heal with one of the support characters or occasionally have an attack spell tossed out there.  Otherwise support just sits there doing sweet fudge all because I don't have ranged weapons for them.  Yup, classic front row/back row crap.  That's all well and good if you can pick up rocks to throw, or buy a sling right away so characters aren't just sitting there cowering, but from what I've seen you can't.\n\nIt also has my least favourite thing in any game - that Wolfenstein 3d style vomit-inducing movement (literally makes me nauseous within 5 minutes) and overall the game has mediocre graphics.  And I didn't expect much.\n\nSo, one semi-good point -  I think the game's mechanics could be good but I can't devote enough time in 2 minute sessions, since anything longer makes me start to feel ill, to get into it enough to find out.\n\nSo, while I like the concept I don't like the game.

I tried to like this.... I REALLY TRIED!  but its exact same hallway over and over....exact same door, exact same crappy animation. Even by 1992 standards this is a bad looking game. I realize there is a depth to the gameplay,and most of you that are reading this are wizardy fan boys or you wouldnt have even clicked on this title...fine but nostalgia is no excuse to not take this type game and elevate it and make it "current."\n\nIf you LOVE wizardry you will love this. ---- FACT\n\nI however, think that it is unforutnate that the devs didnt try and make this a more modern feeling/playing game. I am sorry but this is NOT WORTH 10 bucks.I  wouldnt recommended paying more than 1 dollar for this antiquated RELIC... it plays old , feels old. I wasnt expecting Grimrock, but this is sad.\n\nPS dont hate my review becuase you are a wizardy fanboy.","September 18, 2014","false","1.0"," 12 of 54 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","12","54","0","0"

I played all of the wizard games over the years and always thought that 1-5 was the best, everything after it just had too many issues to play. I found Elminage Gothic while searching for something similar to W5 and instantly fell in love. Right off the bat you see things that are familar like the "hub town", how you create a character, rerolling the character for better stats, and even a room right at the beginning that reminded me of where you find the orb of llylgamyn.\n\nNot only is the game familiar, it is modernized. The controls are exactly what they should be. I can use WADS or arrows to move, escape closes windows, there is even a button to speed up text. Truly a great game that I look forward to continuing to polay!","April 8","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unless you like starting over every single time someone gets injured and has to heal in the temple. This is the first review I've written and felt compelled too after having a negative experience with Steam support for not issuing a refunding due to going 2 hours over the time limit trying to fix it since I do this genre and seemed like a good game besides that bug.","May 31","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThiagoFJ/recommended/291960/","ThiagoFJ","TFJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThiagoFJ/","113 products in account","Elminage Gothic is basically Wizardry on steroids.\n\nFor those who don't know Wizardry, it's basically a first person, party based dungeon crawler. You set up a party of 6 characters of varying classes and venture forth, while trying to avoid a terrible death. And it will come, since this particular Elminage game is pretty brutal and the hardest in the series. Recommended for hardcore or veteran players of the genre.\n\nWeak points include the archaic interface, lack of information regarding some mechanics and questionable design decisions, such as maps being consumable items and inventory management being a pain. Though I have to say that those things are very faithful to the old Wizardry games and are clearly by design. I also strongly recommend playing this with a controller.\n\nEverything else is stellar. The art is of high quality. The soundtrack is surprisingly good and fitting of the theme and mood of the game. Gameplay is decently balanced and all classes feel very useful, with strong and weak points. Combat is interesting, with multiple ways to approach battles. Dungeon design ramps up pretty quickly and can get crazy later on. And there's a ton of content, with 70+ (!) dungeon floors to explore.\n\nConsidering the price, it's a steal. Fans of DRPGs should definitely check this game out.","May 29","true","73.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, this version is neither the best game in the the series nor the best version of this particular game. It's still an enjoyable ride, but I still wish they would have ported the 3DS version's changes into this game.","June 2","true","69.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
