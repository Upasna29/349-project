Most of the points made in my review still apply, but I will no longer be playing this game due to optimization issues.\n\nSo im almost at the 500 hour mark... time for a real steam review.\n\nHomebrew Vehicle Sandbox is exactly what it says on the tin. There is one large map populated with several islands that you can roam around in, and there is also a garage where you can create literally any kind of vehicle you can imagine. Their is no questline or story (as of yet), just exploring the map with wacky vehicles and your buddies on the many multiplayer servers available.\n\n+The only limit to what you can build is yourself. Build planes, jets, boats, hot air balloons, tanks, jet-powered flying shlongs. You name it, it can be built.\n\n+Easy building interface. The building mechanics are a cross between voxel-based and components-based, with 'pipes' acting as frame pieces which specialized components can be attached to.\n\n+Incredibly realistic physics engine. Aerodynamics plays a massive part in air vehicles, and at least a basic understanding of real-life physics is needed to make more complicated vehicles.\n\n+Playerbase is incredibly nice and helpful. The devs are very communicative and can often be found playing on their own servers, where you can then bombard them with questions and reccomendations for the game.\n\n+Online multiplayer. Once you're done exploring the map, you can join an online "party" and blast people out of the air with hellfire missiles >:D\n\n=Large learning curve due to the realistic physics. You cant just slap a few rockets on a car and fly rings around towers, a lot of tweaking and testing is required to perfect your vehicles.\n\n=Controller support is largely incomplete, limiting controller use to the simpler vehicles.\n\n-Button mapping is just god-awful. Homebrew implements a button-mapping system that allows you to assign keys to basic functions, and then assign those functions to components. To be honest it would be a lot easier if I could just assign keys to components, rather than this in-between system.\n\n-Still very buggy. None of them gamebreaking, but it can be quite annoying when a vehicle ive been working on for an hour gets corrupted and no longer usable.\n\n-Graphics arent that great (I honestly dont give a fart about graphics, but there are people out there who think otherwise).","December 9, 2015","true","511.6"," 79 of 83 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","79","83","12","1"

Additionally, if you don't enjoy things like geometry, physics, engineering, aerodynamics, etc, this  game may not be up your alley.\n\nTHAT SAID, I personally find this game extraordinarily brilliant.\n\nThere is a learning curve, absolutely, but the complaints that there is no information available to guide you are blatantly false. Granted, it isn't the typical bright and friendly hold-your-hand walkthrough sort of tutorial that lots of full release games have nowadays. People who are capable of reading and following directions will have no trouble, though.\n\nAs an avid, lifelong fan of all means of transportation, Homebrew has allowed me to create functional versions of daydream vehicles once confined to the realm of doodles on scratch paper.\n\nThere has never been a game quite like this one, and it only stands to improve as time goes on.","December 20, 2014","true","250.8"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","48","50","3","0"

On the surface, I really like the idea of this game.  Unfortunately I have some problems getting past the distinct issues it has (as an early access):\n\n+The game is buggy - This is to be expected, and I am really hoping that they will address these things soon\n+Instructions are limited - Yes there is a "manual" of sorts, but things like not being able to delete parts once you have attached them lends to a very frustrating point where you continually have to stop and start over.\n+Random freezes - Pretty self explanatory\n+Limited parts options - Again, I recognize that this is an early access, and I am simply hoping that this develops over time.  At current, there are only a handful of parts available for creating vehicles, which lends to a frustrating limit on what the user can create.\n\nOverall, the game is conceptually very interesting, and I look forward to seeing it develop and address some of these issues.

Personal experience will tell you far better than any review whether or not you'll find this game worth the money. --\n\n\nMy "no" recommendation is MUCH more qualified than earlier. The game has been streamlined a bit, optimized a lot, and shows no signs of ceasing improvement.\n\nIn addition, the developers added a link in-game to community YouTube tutorials and improved its in-game manual. The physics are still cardboard-balloonish, but I feel like they will improve with time.\n\nIn addition, as you can see below, the developers definitely care about this game and LISTEN to criticism rather than trying to squash it, which makes them ok in my book.\n\nI still honestly think it's too rough to justify the price, but I sincerely think that could change if development continues at this pace.\n\n----------Previous review----\n\nMy "No" Recommendation is qualified; please read the full review for an explaination.\n\nIf you're anything like me, you played Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts and fell in love with the vehicle-building system.\n\nEver since I played that game, I've been looking for a game that was essentially -just- the "screwing around with vehicles" aspect of BK:N&B. When I saw this on the store page, I thought I'd found it.\n\nSo far, I was wrong. It definitely has promise; don't misunderstand me. Conceptually, it really is a neat vehicle-building sandbox. But it's in rough, ROUGH alpha shape. The physics are currently of the "cardboard balloons" variety, the camera is weird and unintuitive, and the game still isn't great at explaining how to use all its features. It's not egregiously bad and it's not unplayable, but it feels like it's a very long way from the finish line.\n\nNow, then: If I don't think it's -that- bad, why am I not recommending it? Well, because of the price. So many Early Access games do this; they take an early build and charge way too much for it. If this game was $4.99 in its current state, I'd recommend it pretty solidly, because there's enough here to be mildly entertaining for now and enough promise to keep an eye on the game. As it stands, $17.99 (or $15-ish at the moment) is just too much cash to drop on something this rough.\n\nIf the dev keeps working on it, this game CAN be the game I've dreamed of, and when it's closer to that, I'll heartily recommend it. Until then, I suggest wishlisting it and checking in every now and then to see how it's coming.","November 18, 2014","false","16.7"," 185 of 271 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","185","271","6","26"

This is a big one. The devs basically remade the game in Unity 5. Some of the systems are entirely re-done and it is overall a big improvement. I'll highlight a few great points below, but this isn't an exhaustive list of all the great changes / addition.\n\n+ much more flexible building tools (like being able to adjust pipes _after_ welding them to your vehicle, etc).\n\n+ you can save vehicles / sub-assemblies and spawn / weld them in other projects :)\n\n+ flexible plating / skin system: It's only the start right now but there are already some easy to use parts for making body panels that far surpass the rigid old dog plates from v13.\n\n+ support for the most wanted thing in this game: servos! Actuators, servo motors, whatever you want to call them. Finally it is very easy to make all manner of things from turrets and landing gear, to swept wings and shuttle bay doors!\n\n+ Great kismet / wiring system. Most of the parts input and/or output (as required) float numbers (generally normalized between -1 and 1) for their functions. You can link inputs and outputs as you want, and there are a variety of modifier parts for combining / shifting / gating / etc the values as you go along. This makes it possible to do things like have a gyrosensor used to adjust the flaps on your plane to keep it level, while still combining it with the input from the user's seat.\n\n+ better physics. I suppose that matters. Center of mass / lift calculated in much better fashion now. It means if you make something that looks like it should fly, it probably will ^___^\n\n+ waves on da ocean\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate Jan 2015: The devs removed the orbs a few patches ago, and now it is a proper sandbox mode (once you complete the initial tutorial). Now you can unleash your creative potential almost immediately!  It is much better this way.\n\nAs the game stands now there are lots of things to play with in terms of vehicle parts, and the devs have a lot of cool things in the pipeline too. It's damn fun. Looking forward to future updates :)\n\n\nPre-update review: This game would be great if you didn't have to go about collecting annoying little orbs to unlock parts.

SANDBOX GAME!"\n-No BS mods required to make it fun, its got it all (Including weapons :P)\n-Advanced design engine, the way you design things is simple and easy to get for sandbox vehicle builder meaning you dont have to google tons of videos to find out how to use it\n-Information, you dont have to but you can read about every parts origin (History lesson in a game!)\n-No lag, it may say it needs 3 cores to run, but it really doesnt it runs great at decent settings on my dual core laptop with dated graphics card (I have better ones, I ain't no scrub!)\n-"123 No lag for me" cheat command takes you to a less laggy world even if you do have issues\n\nBy no means am I saying this game is the king of all sandboxes, but if want to design things and test them with your "friends" then this is the game for you.\n\nBad things about this game (even though you read this far in a posative review)\n-Can be labourious at times, such as wielding a part rather than a quick place without having to do multiple clicks, but for Beta I can accept this\n-Not many parts, again  I reviewed this when it was EARLY ACCESS but the amount the game gives you is sufficient to keep you occupied (Not saying that there isnt enough, rather theres thinds I'd like to see in the future E.g. Stairs)\n-Graphics outside the valley can be a little lacking such as "streched" textures but its not frustrating you dont need to leave the valley unless you are using the ocean (water does look nice tho)\n-Getting round the map, sometimes this can be fun such as making the player use vehicles they have made, but if you just want to use a new boat you've made then you have to go quite some distance to get to it.\n\nI dont want to knock this game for what it is right now, to be fair you couldnt tell this was a Beta release from what it is now.\n\n-S.C","May 4, 2015","true","32.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

As with all Early Access Games, there can be bugs, please exuse them as they are constantly being searched for and squished. Do not purchase unless you fully understand this.\n\nAnother Sandbox Vehicle game, But wait.... this might be different,\nHomebrew opens the mind up to a few more challenges than usual and even offers a multiplayer that we haven't seen in many sandbox vehicle games besides those stricly with PvP. When you spawn into the world for the first time you might be amazed with how much stuff there is to do, and plans for more and much bigger maps are in the works, so you can expect to have a fair bit of exploring to do. From quarter pipes to insane ramps launching you over waterfalls, you'll have a fun time doing stunts and flipping your vehicle all over the place.\nThere is a vehicle editor that allows you to build your own creations. The building system is a little difficult to master at first but once you figure it out, building your own rides is actually the best part of the game. Pit them up against your friends on a racetrak or go for the most airtime on a quarter pipe with your rocket powered dragster.  Sharing will be made available to upload and share your creations with your friends and others, I'm not sure if this is going to be via Steam Workshop or not but sharing is planned for the future.\nThere is a story line planned as well which could add a lot more playability to the game in the future, could we even possibly see a coop mode?\nAs of now, it's still a little buggy at times but the future of Homebrew is looking really good. If you like creating and building, I suggest you pick this up when you get a chance. Just remember, It is in early access.\n\n\n\n","November 18, 2014","true","1.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","2"

Lets see, where to start?  Is the game good?  yes.  Am I good with reveiws?  Absolutely not.  But how else are you gonna know it is good unless people tell you it is.  Whether or not they're good at telling you it is good.  But enough of that, on to the actual reveiw I guess.\n\nSo yeah.  Homebrew...  Obviously this isn't game about brewing moonshine in your back yard over a can of beer.  Which is kinda pointless, since you're drinking other alchohal that you payed for while making alchohal that you sell to pay for buying other alchohol, so WTF.  Anyway, we're not doing any of that in Homebrew.  In Homebrew Vehicle Sandbox, you're making your own vehicles and enjoying created vehicles within a sandbox environment.  So sorry all you moonshiners, but this is not a game about making moonshine.  Instead, Homebrew is about embracing creativity, in whatever form that may come in, and making vehicles with it.  Be it cars, trucks, planes, boats, airships, helicopters, Gundams (though I haven't seen any gundams yet.  Someone get on this, please), trains, hoverbikes, rockets, etc.  You name it and, with enough creativity and the right know-how, you can make it.\n\nHomebrew does this by offering an expansive vehicle builder allowing you to combine all kinds of parts to make whatever you want.  Including a unique take on logic systems that most other vehicle building games simply don't offer.  Certainly not Space Engineers.\n\nHomebrew really has somethign in it for everyone.  If you like a certain car a lot, you can replicate it in Homebrew.  If you've got some crazy idea for a plane, you can build it in Homebrew and enjoy all that wackiness from the safety of your living room.  If you're an artist, Homebrew certainly isn't any kind of sculptign or painting software.  However, you can still make brilliant artwark by using it.\n\nNot to speak lightly of it by making it my third point, but Homebrew also has amazing developers and community.  If  you're having trouble with anything related to the game, or even things not related to the game, shoot the community a question and you'll get a friendly answer fairly soon.  And if not, the devs themselves will usually come help you out!

That, and the only things you can make end up looking like dune buggies, even blimps.\n\nThe UI needs serious work, and remapping controlls is an absolute nightmare.\n\nBut besides that, this game is unique and fun. It is aiming for a realitively untouched genre and so far handles it quite well. The tools are simple enough for a beginner, but complex enough for people who want to fine tune things down to the fiftieth decimal and create extreme, realistic things.\n\nI just hope that this does not end up like starbound, which ceased development right after being put up and was left in alpha for a shamefully long time, with only a few fun things to do. If these developers could NOT do that, it would be great.\n\nUnless you cannot resist the idea of making your own space rocket submarine blimp that looks like dune buggy, you might just want to hold off on this one.\n\n\nEDIT (Half a year later):\nThe dev team working on this is amazing! They listen to all forms of ideas and recommendations, applying as much as they can at an unbelievable pace. I remeber recommending them to add panels to make the vehicles look more realistic. Sure enough, just look at it now in the screenshots. They added it. This is truly a great early acess game that promises so much, while delivering at the same time. It sets the standard for how an early access game should be managed.

It's not so much a game as a great kit for building things and trying them out in an expansive world. In fact, it's the closest thing I've found to an actual sandbox game. On the upside, the tools are easy to use and there are enough parts at this point to build a wide range of wacky contraptions. The world is simple, but it's attractive enough to enjoy, and it provides a good sense of space and motion as you invariably crash into it - repeatedly. The physics are solid and flexible enough to give you feedback on your design choices, but on the downside, they aren't realistic feeling. Just like any driving/flying game, it's a compromise. Once you stop trying to make it behave like the real world, it turns into a lot of fun. I'm experiencing some graphical flickering here and there, but I'm sure that will get straightened out. The devs are actively updating and involved in the forum discussions. There is no free build mode. You have to gather orbs to pay for parts, but it's easy enough to get a full kit of parts pretty quickly. There is apparently a way to get around the orb gathering, but I'm not smart enough to figure out the hints on the forums and I got tired of standing around in the pyramid with a dumb look on my face. :) Anyway, if you like to build and test and basically fiddle around with mechanical systems, this game will keep you entertained for many hours.","November 28, 2014","true","50.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Even with their fancy mods and workshop items. This game is a sandbox that goes down to the pipe, to the engine, to the little motor you wouldn't think to place in a plane. It's exactly what it says on the box:\nStep 1, Make object.\nStep 2: Fly/drive/boat (soon)/etc object,\nStep 3: ????\nStep 4: Profit may vary.\n\nAs a bonus, there a sort of free roam aspect to the game where you can roam around as an actual living human being instead of just an entity that inhabits the menu system. Along with that, I downloaded this getting something I didn't even expect to get: Multiplayer. I don't know how it works yet since I haven't forced this game onto a friend, but that'll change.\n\nAs of this review, there've been many updates over these past seven days alone. A good sign that this is constantly being worked on.\n\nOn the downside,however, this game is still taking some getting used to even now, and the controller settings really aren't optimal yet. And it's not really just the controller, but the keyboard controls sometimes either don't work, or are just weird. There's a TON of Engrish in just about every bit of dialogue (while it doesn't hinder gameplay, it does hinder game quality), and do I even lift? (An engine? Into a freaking plane without glitching the wing into the other one and forcing a tail fin onto the ground without breaking it off?).\n\nFinally, the price tag as of this moment is probably not worth it if you're into waiting for Steam Sales only to buy all of your games. Maybe at a later date when issues are fixed and a lot of things are added, sure, but until then, maybe $9.99 USD.\n\nDespite all of the bad, I still recommend it if you want more detail out of your building time.","November 19, 2014","true","1.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Though at its current state, its not very detailed, in the way the mechanics work. If this is changed, then this could become a very fun tool to create new ideas in. Though at the moment, it feels more like a lego game.\n\nThe Tutorial System Is very odd, and brief. Though if you can notice the little "?" Icon, there is more detail within it.\n\nUnfortunatly, when you finally finish creating something, it doesn't react the way you wanted it to, at all. Not because you failed at realizing the physics engine, but because it just isn't indepth as it needs to be.\n\nPhysics, are, well to say the least, quite bad. For instance, If you were to make a basic plane, put four wings on it, and One Prop, and go full RPM, you will just go up in the air, and spin chaoticly in circles. Also there is no individual part physics involved. What I mean by this, is it doesn't seem like the prop (for instance) has its own weight, causing it to have no centrifugal force. Meaning there is no torque/pressure rotation in the given direction the prop is spinning from.\n- Aswell, as there is no way to view (while building your vehicle) where the weight lies within the vehicle parts and/or the completed vehicle. Which partially leads me to believe, that the weight is only cut into a hand full of segments on your final vehicle, instead of each part having its own weight. Now this may not seem big now, but it will make a significant difference of  a realisitic inventive experiences, down the road.\n- Due to the lack of realistic physics in this game, It makes your inventions feel... well, not so inventive. More like you've put some lego together(for an hr or two) and then started running around your room going... VROOOOOM!!! (not saying those weren't epic times, Just saying theres a time and place, and this isn't it.)\n\nThe Keyboard layout, is boarder line. There are some odd keys like, P & M, that adjust your given throttle. Where R & F, would be significantly more suitable. (In opinion)\n\nHowEVER, if they can fix these things in updates, then it will become very rewarding. Though at the moment, when you are finaly done your craft/vehicle, the reward is very underwhelming.\n\nThe way this Game sits, it should be roughly $9.99 CAD. Not $19,99.\n\nFuture Updates, like Gear boxes, and/or Gear Systems, and 360 Degree hinges, Would add much more diversity. And of course, a better physics engine. :)","November 15, 2014","true","1.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","9"

I have purchased many early access games on steam and while I wouldn't mind it if games had to be a bit better before being released to the public, I still enjoyed the process of just about every game I became a part of.  Some early access games I have been apart of took years to get to a playable state.  Maybe I'm just too patient.\n\nNow on to the review!\n\nAs others have said, this is a sandbox building game where you can connect various pieces to make various things to drive and fly around a fairly large game area.  The build system, while a bit tricky at first, is surprisingly flexible and for those of you who know gmod/source welds, it is refreshing in how rigid the various components are and how easy it is to lift the hood and really customize things from gear ratios to fuel tank sizes.\n\nAt this point in development, there are few different components ranging from small gasoline engines to vectored thrust jet engines plus all the necessary connectors and logic components needed to make them do what you want with them.  A huge selling point here is that it is not a voxel based assembly system but rather more like legos where some of the legos come in different sizes and you can even bend them to meet the way you want them to.\n\nOnce you bring your creations into the world they behave more or less how you would expect them to.  The physics need work but they are quite usable and in a lot of cases the developers took the time to really get things right rather than "cheating" like some other games do when it comes to the calculations behind the scenes.\n\nI personally like making 6 wheeled monster trucks to drive on a tight cliff track or to try to optimize my propeller on my small scout plane so that it rotates just shy of the speed of sound to keep it at optimum efficiency.\n\nHaving followed the forums a little bit, I can see that there will be some upcoming updates to physics _and_ multiplayer which is quite exciting as I can't wait to race my solar powered cars around a huge oval track or try to find and shoot down other planes that encroach on my building area.  I won't use the word potential here because you really never know, but from what I see as an armchair designer/engineer, I can't wait.\n\nIn conclusion:  Don't buy this if you don't want to be in an alpha test of a physics sandbox game that changes a lot for the better.  There are other games out there in a high level of development that will satisfy your desires better...but I can say I have never found a game like this that quite captures what it is I love to do-design and test vehicles in a varied and interesting environment.  Sprinkle in some multiplayer and some exciting new parts and you're looking at an excellent addition to the world of sandbox games.","May 19","true","67.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

On the 16th of this month, a letter was found, and was followed by two other clues, and a huge hint from the dev's. Everything is easily accessible, you just have to do a little metaphorical digging on the forums.\n\nThe reward for the searching, well, it's really something special. It's worth putting some time into finding the secret of the pyramid...\n\nA big thanks has to go to "Neothehitman" for the hints that he created and placed around the Homebrew community. He didn't just come out with the solution, instead he made something of a mystery from it, giving me and others a good time investigating and trying to work it all out. Look out for more from him in this game.\n\nOf course, the Dev's need some love too, they've created an already fantastic game, filled with easter eggs and mystery. As well as the obvious great gameplay, which lets you build pratically anything. I don't think I've been unable to make something I have imagined.\n\nIt's true that the game is tricky to get to know and learn at first, however it more than makes up for this with the amount of content and freedom it gives you. Even at this extremely early point in development, I haven't faced any game crashes, or even that many bugs. Which for an early access at this stage, is extremely good going.\n\nAll in all, this game is a must buy. Why are you still reading?

The physics are not quiet there yet, but its still fun to play with. It does take awhile to understand the building system, but it is complex and great to play with, I spend hours building my vehicle, then hours tuning it to get it how I want it. It is unlikely to put something together and then expect it to do everything right, you will be spending alot of time making alot of small adjustments to your parts to get it where you want it, but to me that is the fun part. If you dont feel like putting the time in to learn the building system, building vehicles, then tuning vehicles this game is not for you, but if you do it is rewarding.","June 23, 2015","true","97.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This will be my first review I believe.\n\nFirst off, I'm not that drawn to alpha/pre-alpha games. I've gone broke on previous alpha games in the past. But this game, this game is different.\n\nLike most others have said, if you like building in Robocraft, you should like this game. Sometimes it's annoying though. Clicking the wrong ring will destroy your build. Trial and error. Done it many times. ;p\n\nYou really are only limited to your imagination. And your ability to figure things out. Again, trial and error. This isn't your normal build stuff game. Angles, weight, lift, drag, thrust, center of gravity, physics...everything comes in play with this game.\n\nWanna build a flying tank? What about some sort of floating air fortress blimp? Harrier wannabes? Mechs? Motorcycles? Gliders? Done and done.\n\nAlthough the learning curve is kinda steep(IMO-see bottom*), once you get into the swing of things you will have a lot of "ah ha" moments.\n\nThis game is set up for LOADS of potential. Checking forums and stuff the devs are very active and very eager to see what us players have to say about the game.\n\nAlso would like to thank them for the x-mas gifts. Gonna work on using that V-TOL after this review. :)\n\n*About the learing curve---I have combat PTSD and possible TBI, so simple things like this are a little more difficult being my brain doesn't function as well. Regardless, I recommend this game to all those who like to be creative and learn. :)","December 21, 2014","true","52.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Ever wanted to spend hours designing it - tweaking every joint until it was perfect?  Ever wanted to feel the satisfaction of the physics engine realizing your genius and completely submitting to this amazing design?\n\nIf so, move along.  This game is a dreamshatterer - in a way.  I have so many ideas for vehicles and I can build them in a few hours, but that is just the beginnng.  After it is built, you still have real world physics to deal with.  Take KSP, throw in tons more customizations, and of course remove the whole space thing (for now?), and you have this game.  ;)\n\nMy only complaint is a minor one.  The world is really small.  I finally built a jet that could get up to 4500km/h, but I hit the end of the world before it reaches its full potential.  When this happens, you just pop back up at the garage.  It is a minor complaint, because I am sure the world will be vast and much more populated (with challenges - like inside the arena area).

That crazy Hotwheels car with 4 engines you saw as a kid? Yup. An offroad crawling jeep? Yup. A high speed vehicle that breaks the sound barrier? Yup. A monster 6x6 truck? Sure. Flying toaster? Yup.\n\nLearning some of it's features and the tuner menu may take some getting used to, (It's not as complicated as it looks unless you have a million working parts.) but it's rewarding spending time on something and seeing it brought to life.\n\nThere are occasional crashes while skinning (Adjusting metal plates to form a body) but it is a work in progress.\n\nThere are a few odd things Iv'e noticed in the physics though, like the amont of engines you install and wire up don't affect speed or acceleration, but simply having bigger wheels does.\n\nAlso traction and friction could use adjusting. Even at maximum traction in the tuner, the tiniest slope, even a 1 degree downhill spot of terrain causes your vehicle to slowly slide as if the terrain is made of black ice.\n\nSmall issues aside it's great. Once it gets weapons, it will be the best and most powerful vehicle builder there is.\n\n","April 6","true","52.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Those who say it's extremely confusing, didn't play the tutorials. Which you should almost always do considering some games give bonus currency or something for playing them through (wink wink, nudge nudge, devs ;)). With that said, there are some things that could/should be added/fixed. The devs have heard enough about the UI, I think they know it needs some patching. So glossing over that. There's almost no control over the helicopters (and I know they're adding joystick support, but not everyone has one). Vehicle part deletion; it's a serious pain the way it's set up. Wrapping this up, the game is still amazing.

There are weapons and enemies to use them against but I don't want to spoil too much. You can obviously fight other players in your vehicles which is good fun, and since the devs have an armour plating system planned, thats gonna get really interesting.\n\nThere is a varied map with roads, a swamp, large bodies of water, mountains and sand - so you can test your vehicle offline or with friends on a variety of surfaces/environments. The map hides lots of secrets, I haven't found them all and the community is still trying to figure out a few of the more enigmatic ones.\n\nPeople seem to be complaining that it is difficult to use, I have to say I wouldn't agree. I have nearly 42 hours on record at the time of writing this plus more before it was on steam. At hour 42+ I'm obviously a much better builder than I was at hour 0, but even at the start the system seemed intuitive and anything I didn't understand was cleared up by tutorials or help from the amazing community and dev support on the website.\n\nIt's in alpha yes, and I am apprehensive about buying games in alpha sometimes but not with this one. There are bugs present as with all alphas, but there are no major gamebreakers. There has been regular updates and the devs are literally in constant communication with the players, and I know if I had a pressing issue with the game or needed help with mechanics of the game I'd be able to get it faster than pretty much any of the other games in my library, plus the community are always happy to help on the chat on the homebrew website or the group chat on steam.\n\nOverall a really good sandbox vehicle builder with massive potential that is going in the right direction. I'd reccomend it, just take half an hour to learn the building system at the start using tutorials (like you have to do with all other sandbox building games like KSP etc) and you'll have a blast.\n\n","December 1, 2014","true","68.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Building aint that hard as long as you aren't one of those types that just want to rush everything.....if the default tutorial aint specific they do have pics of what to do...plus a more detailed tutorial if you still have problems. Also a big help, in the menu for each part there is a blue question mark that gives details on what each setting for that part does and is for etc. I mastered the building within the first 5 minutes once i got to start, but thats just me.....i ain't a mechanic or engineer etc, so i originally know nothing of what everything means so i occasionally have to check the parts question mark description until its burnt into my brain. Yes the interface needs a bit of work, and its hard to control any ariel vehicles making it hard to acquire any orbs within the air (orbs are currency for parts....there are 3 colours,   and one is harder to get then the other.....and some parts recquire a certain amounts of each orb. This makes you work to create your mean machines but once you get everything its rewarding enough making your sick ride....but a creation obviously never works as intended on the first get go....like real life there will be adjustments over and over. Yes there are physics so if you spawn your vehicle on a hill....it will go down duh!!!! Textures need work as well as shadows. there are a lot of parts to buy with orbs to create your own vehicle. the only part you dont have to buy is frames/pipes to build your vehicles shape. Give it moment of your time, and if you feel like its not enough then wait for some updates. I believe it is worth it, and if you still think that the tutorial isn't specific enough to you, then please just go to there sight, log into forum and ask questions like a human being instead of right away complaining, and or wasting a reveiw like i see some people.

First of all, the physics makes vehicles very difficult to control.  If you stop a vehicle on a hill, it just slides down.  I haven't built my own planes, so I'm not an expert, but for their example plane, it flies nothing like a plane, it has to use a gyroscope, so the whole plane spins, but it doesn't even change direction very easily.  Second of all, the building process, although now a little simpler, is still overly complicated, and sometimes parts which you place don't even appear in the menu to connect to other parts, so you have to find the part, disconnect it, and add another.  This game has neat, fine, and classy building tools if you can get past all the flaws.  If the idea of the game appeals to you, I might suggest Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts if you own an Xbox 360, or Scrap Mechanic looks good, and similar, with less fine tools, but better physics and such.","April 2","false","14.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","5"

While the game technically lets you do almost anything, in practice the building system is very complicated and confusing, and there are no in-game tutorials whatsoever.\n\nOn top of that, the physics are glitchy and buggy, which results in your vehicle bouncing around uncontrollably more often than not.\n\nThis game is not worth anything near the asking price at this time. The fact that it came out in 2014 and is still in this sorry state is baffling to me. The devs are still working on it at least so hopefully it will be a good game some day, but right now I really can't recommend it.","May 17","false","1.0"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginSaint/recommended/325420/","OriginSaint","Origin Saint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginSaint/","523 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHomebrew is exactly as the title states, a vehicle sandbox game.  You create your own vehicles from scratch, frame, gas tank and all, and then take them into the medium size sandbox world surrounding the garage area you created the vehicle in.  You can design and craft anything from go-karts, golf carts, 4-wheelers, cars, dragsters, tanks, motorbikes, planes, helicopters, hovercrafts and more.\n\nThere is a really extensive crafting system in this game, although I feel the tutorial and instruction set is lacking and the overall crafting system feels a bit cluttered, very unrefined, and generally clunky and lazily put-together.  There is multiplayer, which is a nice touch, but really doesn't fix any of the problems with the game itself.\n\nThe vehicle controls are clunky and weird, making many of the vehicles hard to control, and the fact that the physics system in the game is very odd certainly doesn't do this problem any favors.  Also, not that a game like this should be about graphics, but the developers have obviously tried to bring something at least mildly modern-looking to the table, but last I saw, they have failed terribly.  The games graphics look like the industry standard as of 2006, and for a game that tries to have decent graphics, I consider this a failure.\n\nAll-in-all, I do not recommend this game in its current state.  The graphics are outdated and poorly designed.  The physics is quirky, which compounds the issue that the controls are touchy, buggy and generally difficult to use, and the crafting system is really unrefined and includes part names like pipe_001, pipe_002, curvepipe_001 and so on.  The whole game seems like it's just way too early in development for any kind of early access release.  I have hope that the developers can improve upon the games issues, but until then, I will advise people to not make this purchase.","October 28, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I think there are way more user friendly ways to build a complex and customizable vehicle. The concept is nice, but it's really finicky to even build the base for a car and how to connect all the parts with each other that they work or what parts you even need for a working car is nowhere explained nor (how an editor should be) self explanatory at all.\n\nNOW I KNOW that this is still an early alpha, but this is not what i would call "playable". Instead of trying to invent a own vehicle editor, they should better inspire it by the editors that Kerbal Space Program or Scrap Mechanic uses. Especially Scrap Mechanic has a pretty nice editor, but the turn down there is that it has basically no settings for its parts.\n\nAlso the wierd inaccurate physics are... not quite there yet.\n\nMaybe, with many month of developement this game will become "fun to play" but its no fun yet.","January 24","false","2.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

Start the game and it asks for the key that you have copied to the clipboard. No problem except you cannot paste it in. So restart having written the key down. The key boxes do not skip to the next when each is flled neither do they switch case for you. Not serious, yet. Then its time to start the game but it pushed hard for you to create an online account. Do that and start again, having noticed the offline option.  You are then dropped next to a building within which is a broken beach buggy. The screen keeps going very dark and there is no clue about what to do. By no clue I mean nothing, nada. Then follows blundering around, pressing random keys, getting stuck in a corner of the building and having to crash out of the game which by this time has gone dark, yet again.\n\nI need to slow down with buying games and try the demos first. The game key messing around would be enough for me to walk away. Maybe its getting old but I have zero tolerence for any fluffing about. Everything has to be slick, obvious and work the first and every time. Any crap and in the bin it goes.\n\nThe developers need to revamp the game start experience. Its rubbish. Then maybe have tutorials, and a video. Maybe they are there  but I have not found them and am not going to waste time finding them. So this game is going to get another 15mins of effort and no more. It might be fabulous but I simply do not care if it is this imvolved to even get started.","December 21, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

It doesn't seem to be the case here, so there might be changes to all the downsides i consider for this game.\n\n1. Physics:\nWhile this game tries to cover water, land and air at the same time, i don't expect a overhelming great physics in each part, as in a simulator. However there are some parts to the physic that i consider too flawish for a game like this. Mainly how breaking and a reverse vector applied to the resulting vector seems lacking.\nAlso using a handbrake on a slope, should not give you more speed....\n\nWhen it comes to flying, it is quite clear that you need to consider how you balance the weight is important. That is a plus, but unfortunately some of the engines seems to be a bit extreme and will put you in a loop regardless of your controls.\n\n2. Game loop is too simple.  (build -> test)*\nWhile The game is indeed all about building and testing, it just seems like the testing aspect could use some sub-loops to create some kind of challenge or a feeling of achivement.\nWhile removing the orbs, from what i read and would determine myself, was a really good idea. Perhaps there could be some challenges which could unlock some non essential, or bonus like content.\n\nThis is one of the things i hope will be improved in the future.\n\nThese issues are the ones feel is most worth mentioning, as they make the game feel incomplete or borken.\nThe constructing part is really good and interesting, so if those issues aren't important to you, then it is worth giving it a go, especially if you can get the game at discount.\nThere are a chance that these will be improved, but it depends on how far the development is at the current stage. Hence I suggest people to wait a bit and see if these parts get any changes to the better.","December 22, 2014","false","7.1"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","1"

Once you finally get a vehicle (remember to press x to start the motor), it is very hard to control it, there does not appear to be a button to press for brake, also it says to press page up and page down to zoom in and out, nothing happens. Not being able to zoom out a little makes it hard to see where your going. Editing vehicles is a little daunting at first, being unsure which parts fit with what, the tute vehicle requires a motor (when putting this in, it would be handy if the default angle of the motor would be suitable to put it in with out having to rotate it first), which I gave it, but when I went out side, it did not have a motor or even a left front wheel. Going to quick edit, it had a motor so you can not give it another, it also had all of the wheels, then switching to tune it had no motor or wheel (wtf). They could make this game a little more user friendly. Maybe add to the tute a highlighting function that lets you know where to place the parts that it is telling you to install!\n\nControlling the ground vehicles is very hard, because the camera is doining its own thing, so not controllable by the user. Most of the time is will go behind the vehicle, so long as you are going in a straight line, so it is not too bad. What is bad, is that the angle of the camera is not high enough off the ground behind the vehicle, so you will have trouble seeing where you are going when going over hills. It would be much better to provide an option for the user to have some controll over the camera.\n\nControlling the vehicle is also rather hard, especially at speed, it has major oversteer problems at speed, as well as the camera problem already mentioned, of not seeing where your going when going over hills.\n\nThere does not seem to be much to do while driving, collecting objects and going over ramps. I have not progressed to air travel at this time, so don't know what there is to do up in the sky.\n\nAt present they need to make it more user friendly, they are actively working on it and answering comments left here so I remain hopeful that this will end up being a really good game!!!","November 29, 2014","false","1.7"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","1"

Building area should have more of a sem-locked camera view instead of the same view and reaction as walking around as the character. This makes it very difficult to build when your camera is bouncing up and down as you try to move forwards and backwards. There are also some areas in the map that are not solid and you fall right through. Traction for the vehicles also needs to be looked at. Almost felt like I was trying to drive on ice. Developers may want to up their minimum requirements as well.\nOverall, game seems like it could really be great though.

I like minecraft but it gets real boring real quick! but this I burn hours upon end building and testing and pushing the limits. Where has this game been all my life. To the developers I would like to tip my hat and since this is in the dev stages, I would like to put my two cents in if you dont mind.\n\n1. I would love to be able to crash and break what i built and then go back and rebuild. gives it  that element of realism that I would enjoy\n2. physics. I hate chasing my vehicle down as it slides mindlessly side ways into the water down a hill and what not. so yeah, add some physics\n3. the planes and helicopters i have tested are hard to control in order to get the orbs on the top of obstacles in the air and what not. I know this is not ms flight sim but that kind of aerodynamics and air plane vs helicopter control would be awesome.\n4. Full support of my xbox 360 controller or my joystic.\n5. Please stay motivated on this. programming is tedious and daunting. I know this, plus you have lives and families, but you have already started forming a pretty good fan base. the dislikes i have read are from people who want to just mindlessly point and click and push a button and bam a vehicle but for the serious and the inventors out there, man what a game I give it two thumbs up and rate it 9/10 only because it is not finished I love this game already","December 7, 2014","true","67.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course, building a vehicle is hard if you just started to play the game, but in 5-6 hours you can get a good grip. Thus, with that said, controls are a bit quirky. Sure, it is still at dev stage, and I am really amused by it, but you will have a little hard time getting around things because they are a little bit irregular. There is no objectives as far as I can see, so this game is a good companion for those who love open-world games like minecraft and terraria.\n\nIf this stage was the last stage of the game, I'd rate it as 6/10. Altrough it is still alpha, so in this case, I really believe that this game has the potential to be 10/10.\n\nI just wish that we can create our own systems for auto control, and develop some stuff. This goes to developers : Think of a on-board computer that you can adjust your outputs accordingly to your imputs. What will it do? For example, You want your thruster to be activated only if you are above 20kmh. Maybe gradually increasing thrust to avoid the vehicle to flip. Which language? Lua would be ok, since it has been used on ComputerCraft in Tekkit, Minecraft, and it is indeed easy to learn. Maybe python or ruby would be good as well.\n\nThe thing that I requested is pretty complicated indeed, but if it could be done, this game would be skyrocketing trough other simulation types. Think about you can program like a plane autopilot or something. Wow.\n\n10/10 for a game that is in alpha. Good job devs.","April 25, 2015","true","442.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are more complete sandbox games out here on Steam, such as Beseige or Autocraft (or vehicle games such as BeamNG).\n\nAs far as the game goes, The main thing that stood out to me was the textures. This game puts me right in the early 2000's when I look at the environment. It's a step up from Minecraft (in the graphics department), but not too much.\n\nThe vehicle physics leave something to be desired as well. You couldn't be able to perform any of the acrobatic stunts that this games' video depicts, due to the poor handeling of the machines. The dirt and grass are actualy like glass or ice when racing on it.\n\nI like the Idea, but this game has a long way to go before I would consider buying it again (got a refund).

Being greeted with no clip glitches and random yellow balls flying out of you when you left click, is not the best. I really like most of the vehicle designing mecanics, but it is confusing with the stages of the process.  Im going to say that I recomend this game, but I recomend you wait for future updates, after all it is early acess.

Had many parts to use to make about anything you could think of, but still had a few bugs which I put it on a shelf to await a few patches to try again.  Well its NOTHING liket he game it was, and to be honest has gone BACKWARDS!  I have very few parts to work with, and no way to do Multiplayer, or anything.  I would even go as far to say this is about as much as a demo version may have to give a taste of the game.  I will not recommend, nor tell you not to get this game until I figure out what is going on.  I will only say if this is what the game is now, then its the first time I seen a game go BACKWARDS in production of a game.  (But as for the game I have played yes its GREAT, just hope it gets there again soon!)\n\n* After going to the website and downloading the older version I am use to, I am changing my review.  I really hope they combine the items in the old version into the newer set up which is better at building in my view.  Going to keep my eye on this game and hope to see it reach a ledgenary status when out of Alpha / Beta.","December 17, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

If you watch the youtube tutorials it makes everything easier.  That said I spent 4 of the 5 hours trying to build a airplane but i couldnt get it to work good.  Ill try to make a truck next.  I have never played a game like this though, you get to build the frame of the vehicle and you just add on from there.  What makes things easier is that things like motors and other things that need to be next to each other in real life, can be far away and still work in the game.\n\nI recommend getting this game!","December 28, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The limit is your own creativity and what you can figure out. Tho there are people in the community willing to give a helping hand/tips if you need it.
