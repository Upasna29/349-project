Perhaps this review is my attempt to sort out these feelings, but I hope it also gives others an idea of just what type of hell it plays on one’s mind.  First, a warning: Masochisia is dark, bloody, brutal, unrelenting in its depravity, and unflinching in its portrayal of evil.  If you have a weak stomach or are sensitive to visceral depictions of violence, do not play this game.  Yes, I realize that I’m starting a review meant to encourage people to buy it by dissuading others, but not all stories are made for everyone.  However, if you are indeed courageous enough to drop into the pits of despair, read on.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552724180\nAs I sit here thinking upon what I have just witnessed, I am simultaneously appalled and blown away. I feel sickened, dirty, disgusted, and yet somehow enlightened at having seen a glimpse of humanity (or the lack thereof) that we rarely admit exists. The story is loosely based on serial murderer Albert Fish  whom I had read about years ago, and is like nothing I've ever experienced prior.  Having researched the game a bit before playing, I had an idea of what I was getting into, but was in no way prepared for the unsettling nature of placing myself in this man’s shoes as he traverses the path towards oblivion.\n\nSeveral disturbing themes are present including abuse, self-harm and severe mental illness. The story is raw and unforgiving in its depictions of these things, which makes it all the more compelling.  There is no sugar coating the nature of its violence, no apologies made for what it is.   Masochisia shows us a broken man forced into despair only to find respite in the evil he embraces.  And as a narrative adventure, I felt complicit in his demise as I made decision after decision that I knew would only lead to his ruin; and yet I was compelled to keep moving forward.  I wanted to see the depths of his depravity, and that is where I felt the most disturbed.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552724210\nI’ve watched and read about evil, ruminating on what brings a man to commit unspeakable acts of horror, but never have I found myself so close to it personally, and in some perverse way enjoying it; that is, until I’d realized how far I had fallen down the rabbit hole, well past the point of no return.  Sure, revenge is easy to rationalize, even justify, but when things took a decidedly less “altruistic” turn and I began to see what I had forced this man to become, I was not only horrified at the game but also at myself.  Masochisia does not let you escape from your decisions, and that is where the real horror lies.\n\nAnd so I sit here stunned, nauseated, but also mystified.   It is an odd thing to go into a story expecting to learn something about others only to come away having learned things about myself.  Despite the revulsion I now feel, there is also a sense of peace in this new found knowledge.  Understanding just how easily one can slip beyond the grasp of redemption, there is comfort in knowing that fate can be avoided if only one realizes it before it’s too late.\n\nHere I was only trying to convince others of like mind to embark upon a truly profound experience, and I have gone and waxed philosophical.  If I have not yet driven you away with my musings, buy Masochisia, play it, experience it, and perhaps discover things about yourself and humanity that we deny exist.  I promise you, this is an experience unlike any other, if only you have the stomach to get through it.\n\nBottom Line:  Highly recommended for those who are brave enough to endure extremely disturbing themes and horrific acts of violence.   All others, stay away.","November 14, 2015","true","6.5"," 185 of 190 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","185","190","8","13"

I'm not too sure where to start as it's clearly not a game for everyone. It touches base with pretty dark and disturbing topics, such as, domestic abuse, murder, depression and various other mental illnesses.\n\nIf you are however into dark, grim stories, Masochisia is incredibly disturbing and will toy with your mind in numerous ways.\n\nYou play as Hamilton, an innocent boy that just wants to make his parents proud. Your older brother is a complete failure in your father's eyes and Hamilton just wants to be a good example of what could've been. Your mother is bipolar and constantly switches from loving you to threatening she'll have your father beat your skull into the floorboards. Your father is a drunken sadist and beats everyone because he is unhappy with the life "god" had "chosen" for him. Your brother is an unhinged maniac that takes solace in pain and loves every single beating your father inflicts on him.\n\nLoosely based on one of the most twisted serial killers in the U.S, Albert Fish, Jon Oldblood has created a clever fictionalization on his life. Now I don't suggest researching him prior to playing due to potential spoilers, but it was as I started getting deeper into the story that I happened to notice the resemblance to this man's life.\n\nAs for gameplay, you move around from scene to scene, sometimes picking up various objects and solving a few simple puzzles here and there. It's simple, but it fits the game oh so well.\n\nThe backgrounds were so subtle and did a fantastic job of highlighting every little character. The soundtrack is incredibly charming; yet what feels like a relaxing tune can quickly turn into something far more sinister.\n\nI dove into this game expecting a couple simple scares and then that would be the end of it. Little did I know, I'd be left with my own thoughts, heart racing, trying to figure out what the hell I had actually done.  You come into this game expecting to leave having learned about others and instead just learn more and more about yourself.\n\nThis game is worth every penny and is guaranteed to be an experience like no other. Completely recommended for those who think they can handle all this game has to throw at them. For those faint-hearted people, this game isn't for you.\n\ndon't forget to check your desktop after you play ;)","November 28, 2015","true","6.5"," 68 of 70 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","68","70","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/396310/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account",""...and when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you." - Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nMasochisia is easily one of the most disturbing games that I ever played. For the sake of a fair warning, only a limited audience who'd have an interest in abnormal psychology would prefer trying this game, and even then, I doubt anyone would actually "enjoy" it. As illuminating and as interesting it may be, Masochisia starts a journey towards the boundless depths of the human soul, towards an untapped potential for darkness that we'd very much prefer uncharted. Thus, it is anything but enjoyable. But it surely is appreciable.\n\nSurrounded by obviously mentally ill family members, young Hamilton is trapped in a reality defined by pain. For one reason or the other, a four letter word echoes in his all being, trapping his soul and sealing his future: fate. He is to be evil, and only evil. Such is his fate. He is to bring deliberate pain onto many, starting with his own blood. As he slowly slips away, sinking further into insanity and meeting the border that lies between the man and the beast, he desperately tries to overcome what's been expected of him. Or does he, really?\n\nThere are things, I have done.\nThere's a place, I have gone.\nThere's a beast, And I let it run.\nNow it's runnin' my way*\n\nAs an experience, Masochisia makes one's blood run cold with distorted symbolisms, philosophical implications and aphorisms of a disturbed mind quite successfully. It defines the need, the impulse of a crippled individual to cause harm on one's self or others to establish a sense of existence. I'd say its success does lie in its boldness of portraying the creations, moral justifications and delusions based on a real life case. It is probably necessary to note that the game is based on the life of Albert Fish, one of the sickliest serial killers of all history. One would ask oneself if Albert Fish would be as he was without the family, the environment and the living conditions that molded him into what he has become. Was it fate? Was his mind and actions were only the creation of one sick individual, or something "created" Albert Fish?\n\nThe gameplay can be defined as a basic point & click adventure, with some symbolic puzzles and map movement. Even without any voice acting and a limited selection of soundtrack, the atmosphere is a huge success. The artwork consists of overwhelmingly creepy imagery, blatant with the morbid. The game time is fairly short, yet doesn't fail to establish an atmosphere of dread, disturbance and nausea. You complete a chapter within half an hour, save the game and exit to take a break away from Hamilton's nightmare world, only to find that he left a letter for you on your desktop! The game works slowly and deliberately to strip you out of your sense of control, making you taste the utter desperation, the helplessness and inability to make a willful choice.\n\nAs Hamilton either sinks or wallows in the gutter of his own mind, you live through the experience, numb and nauseated, only to realize the worst of all within all circumstances is that even though that Hamilton didn't have a choice, you did. And you still decided to go through this simulation of his reality. Even as a self-claimed, sane individual, you kept committing his acts just for the sake of being a witness to his story. Whence you complete the game and came to that realization, you'll be mortified by not the character's evil and capability; but your participation in his creation.\n\nWell done, Oldblood. You gave me a restless night.\n\n*Lyrics by Black Lab - This Night\n\nDisclosure: A key has been provided by the developer for the purpose of this review.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 19","true","4.8"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","55","58","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/396310/","snortcannon","Snort Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/","1320 products in account","Few things before starting the review:\nThis game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\n\nWarning: This game is only suitable for ages 18+, the topics and images are quite disturbing and not suitable for anyone under that age.\n\nMasochisia is a disturbing horror point and click adventure game that covers the topic of domestic abuse, but will you want to play this game for yourself ?\n\nIn Masochisia we play as Hamilton. Hamilton is growing up in a strict home where his family abuses him constantly. One day he finds out that he will grow up to become a psychopath. Is it possible to change fate ?\n\nMasochisia is a simple point and click adventure game in the vein of Year walk, where you walk from side to side, pick up items and solve puzzles. This game doesn't have difficult puzzles and it's more story driven.\n\nThe atmosphere in Masochisia is beyond fantastic. The game sets up this mood that will make you feel uneasy the entire time of playing, making you feel something is following you the entire time you're playing.  The mood is built on the soundtrack and nature sounds. What feels like a relaxing tune can quickly turn into something far more sinister building up on the anxiety you will experience playing the game.\n\nThe game messes with you the entire time you're playing and pretty much the entire time you will feel chills running down your spine from the incredibly disturbing imagery. The entire time you're playing the main characters sanity descends into madness and the game changes along with his sanity. Not to mention the game leaves you "notes" after you finish playing it.\n\nI finished Masochisia in 2 hours and 30 minutes. I felt that this was the perfect amount of time and I enjoyed every single second of this story.  Apart from the one playthrough, you can try and do other playthroughs and ask the characters you meet along the way different questions and get different responses which maybe will reveal something or open up more questions.\n\nThe game has one major problem I dislike. The save system is broken. When you load in you lose every item. Meaning if you Restart an act or if you load in a game in the middle of an Act, you will lose two items and you will have to pick them up. The good thing is that the items are always the same and they have the same spawn every time so you can quickly find them, but I still wish if you load in you get the items and you don't need to backtrack to get them.\n\nIn the end Masochisia is insanely disturbing and I would say it's one of the scariest if not the scariest game that came out in 2015.\nAs stated at the start of the review this game is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18. If you can handle the incredibly disturbing story and imagery, this game is a must play.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9/10 - A must own\n\nGet Help.\n\nThe topic of domestic abuse should never be taken lightly. If you, or someone you know is suffering from abuse there are people who can help.\n\nIf you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked please post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 12, 2015","true","4.1"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","40","44","0","0"

Something so different that it might not be everyones cup of tea.\nOne question ... are you a terrible person?\nDeveloper: Oldblood\nPublisher: Oldblood\nRelease Date: October 9th, 2015\n\nWarning! This is not a game for everybody! In fact it’s recommended for ages 18+ because of the following: pervasive language, violence and opressive themes.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=532954699\nDevelopers Note: Masochisia is an experimental take on psychological horror games as a narrative. Individuals struggling with depression, abuse or mental illness may be uncomfortable with some of the themes. The experience is intended for mature audiences.\n\nIf you’re still interested in this game … May God be with you and read on!\n\nYou might be wondering why. Well the developers note and the Warning was the first text that I've seen in this game and my next course of action was to click on Get Help in the menue, which I've included at the end of this review. I think that says a lot about what you should expect of this game. Let me tell you this right here … you won’t be prepared for it. Trust me on that one.\n\nStoryTaken straight from the Steam store page:\nA young man discovers through a series of hallucinations that he will grow up to become a violent psychopath. How will he respond to these revelations? Can he change his fate? Can you even... change fate…\n\nI found the story to be incredibly fascinating and I’ve found myself literally longing for answers through out the game.\nAm I a terrible person? Can I change my fate?\nWhat will happen to me?\nWill there ever be an end? Or do I have to keep going on and on and on …\n\nYet again I have to point out that the story and the game truly isn’t for everyone.\nIts a n unique and special experience and I really recommend to give this game a try based on the story alone since it’s a game you play for the story/experience and not for the actual gameplay.\n\nGameplayWe’ve come to the, once could say, weakest part of the game but then again it wouldn’t be fair to say that but … It fits actually.\nThe thing is you move around from scene to scene and interact with certain objects using your mouse and that’s nearly about it. You have to complete certain puzzles though and I have to say that the Time one was my favorite and I really liked the idea behind it.\nThe other thing that you can interact with are your pills and magic needles.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=532955640\nI won’t get too much into it but they’ll help you and you’ll need them.\nOverall Masochisia is not a game that you’ll find yourself enjoying the actual gameplay. I mean it’s not bad by any means but it’s all about the story and experience and to be honest … The gameplay fits the game just fine.\n\nVisualDisturbing. Freaky. Weird. Wrong. But so oh, so good!\nThe characters, all of them seriously, are just looking so good and everyone of them is unique and full of little details and characteristics. I loved the effect once your heart started to race and to be honest I quite enjoyed the look of the game in general.\nPersonally I liked how the whole background work was so subtle and really highlighted the characters in Masochisia but at the same time there’s always a little detail that you’ll stop and just take a closer look. Either because you find it good or disturbing.\nI’d even go as far as to say that the art style suits the game perfectly. I couldn’t imagine it in any other style to be completely honest.\n\nAudioThe art style in combination with the incredibly dark and disturbingly soundtrack, for the most part of the game, really give this game a rather fascinating and unique, though a very dark, kind of charm. The music is subtle and you won’t even notice any sound half the time you’re playing because you’re just so immersed into the story … well at least I was. I found myself longing for an answer. Yet the sound effect were the best and worst part of the game. During specific scenes, which you gladly don’t see, all you hear is the sound of what you’re doing. And it sound so real and so spot on … Kudos on that part. I really gives you a chill down your spine.\nOverall I’m really impressed with the use of the audio in this game and it’s really spot on.\n\nAm I a terrible person?I’ve contacted the developer Jon Oldblood and asked if he’s a terrible person to which he replied:\nYes, I am a pretty terrible person. But I don't mean to be.\nAnd personally I really liked this response because the exact same thing can be said about Hamilton.\nHe is, but he doesn’t mean to be … or is he?\nI mean what do you think after you’ve been playing this game … Are you a terrible person?\n\nLettersNot going to give too much away but … Keep a good eye on your desktop once you start to play this game …\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for Masochisia in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\nPersonally I really, really, really enjoyed Masochisia.\nNot entirely sure what that says about me though …\nI hope to see more games like this in the future. It’s just a game with an entirely new, different and unique idea and I really appreciate it. I even have to say that, despite the games rather short playtime, the price is justified.\nSo I can safely recommend this game for everyone who’s fully aware of what he’s about to dive in to.\n\nI just have to put this here:\n\nGet HelpThe topic of domestic abuse should never be taken lightly. If you, or someone you know, is the victim of domestic abuse. There are people who can help.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=532839325","October 10, 2015","true","6.3"," 44 of 51 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","44","51","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/396310/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1583 products in account","WARNING! THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! THIS IS AN 18+ GAME!This game deals with issues such as murder, domestic violence, mental illness and self-harm. These issues are very serious and I would advise that you not play this game as it may provoke a very serious reaction or terrible flashbacks.\n\nI’ve played my share of disturbing games but I feel this one truly deserves a stern warning to anyone considering purchasing it. It’s not a bad game by any means, perhaps it is too good of a game in that its writing and execution can conjure very real and heavy emotions in a player. Masochisia is more than a game, it is an experience.  It is a trip into a very troubled mind and the equally troubled minds around it, a story of a broken family and broken dreams.  I feel it’s safe to say no one in this game is very happy and I doubt you will be very happy after playing this game.\n\nAll that being said I do recommend this game for those who can handle it. I’m usually ok with these sorts of games but this one deliberately tried to get into your head and I found hard to avoid. I think everyone who plays this will probably be affected differently, but you will be affected.  It will leave thoughts in your head to ponder long after you finished the game. I will share a personal moment I had with the game before going over specific details of Masochisia and that would be Walter. Walter is the main character’s older brother who is in a straitjacket and muzzle, he is a masochist and begs to be beaten. He tells the tale of what happened to his face, going into uncomfortable details on how he bit his lip until it bled and then chewed off as much as he could. This unsettled me greatly for personal reasons, I even had to turn my head from the screen. The well-crafted words and unsettling art truly struck me on a very deep level. I didn’t stop playing after this but it was a scene that will haunt me for a while, signs of good writing.\n\nAnd the writing is one of the main aspects of the story. You play young boy named Hamilton who has a mother that is manipulative and verbally abusive who also suffers from delusions and is probably mentally ill. Your father is an alcoholic who hates his life and is both physically and verbally abusive. And lastly is your brother Walter is a masochistic self-harmer who may very well be psychotic. Of course Hamilton isn’t safe from mental issues as he hears voices and sees things and also takes pills, though compared to the rest of his family he seems the most normal at first. As the game progresses, Hamilton loses touch with reality more and more and his actions become more drastic, killing because the angel Michael told him to do so. The story is written as it’s hard to tell what part of what Hamilton sees is real or in his mind. It’s a twisted psychological romp that I wish I could tell you more about but that would spoil the game.\n\nWhat I can tell you about is the artwork. Just by looking at screenshots and the game’s trailer it’s easy to see that the art style in Masochisia is very dark and twisted. The people are gangly with drawn in faces, the trees are foreboding and monochrome. Buildings are dark holes you don’t even want to enter but know that you must. While the story is very good it’s the artwork and eerie music that complete this package. It’s not pretty at all and it shouldn’t be because this is not a pretty game. The art style looks like it’s coming from the point of view of someone mentally disturbed, a twisted view of what reality really is. The music is never perky, always grim and spooky adding to gaming experience.\n\nYes, in the end this is a game. It plays very well, all you have to do is point and click to move about, you talk to people and make choices during conversations while also sometimes using objects. While the game gives you different choices in the end things seem to end up the same way, just with different dialogue. The game also leaves text files on your desktop that are letters from Hamilton to the player. My only gripe comes out of laziness, it would have been nice to have a map to teleport to locations by after playing the game I realized that would take a player out of the game’s atmosphere. It would also cause one to miss out on some of the jump scares. There aren’t many, don’t worry, the game relies more on narrative to freak you out.\n\nThis game is sick and disturbing but it’s good to play a game that makes you think and feel. Masochisia is a bit on the short side, you can finish it in three hours or less which isn’t a whole lot for the price tag. However, I think the game packs a lot into those few hours that do make it worth the price and most definitely something to look at during a sale. Whatever price you pay for it I highly suggest owning this game. It’s very loosely based on the life of serial killer Albert Fish and I suggest researching it a bit more once you’re done playing the game if you don’t know the story already; it will put a lot of things into perspective and up the creepy factor a lot.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","March 15","true","3.3"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","1"

A dark, psychological horror, Masochisia ventures where other games do not. Dealing with sensitive subject matter such as child abuse, depression, true sadism and masochism, this is not a game for the feint of heart. Heed the warnings, my good friends. I will say that if you have had issues with abuse, this may be worth trying to stomach. It worked for me at least. Minor spoiler about the abuse:game ratio: there are 6 acts and the abuse is really only rampant in the first and second. Beyond that, the game takes a different, albeit equally disturbing turn.\n\n"Based on a True Story" is something that we have been desensitized to view as, "Loosely taken from a true story," or even, "a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized version of a story incorporating some true to life elements." Not in Masochisia. Verily, I tell you, this game was *so* delightfully well put together by Mr. Oldblood. I suspect that only a small target audience will recognize the clues and piece together the inspiration of this story, but after you play it a few clicks into a search engine with some key words will lead you to the source.\n\nA game that the developer created to help himself deal with his own issues, with such absolutely (excuse me) SMASHING attention to detail from NYPCBA to "Ham and Eggs" has touched hundreds if not thousands of us by now. I urge you to join us in discovering who you really are and what decisions you would make if you were put into the position of Hamilton, the protagonist.\n\nDo you believe in fate?\n\nAs an addendum: Windows players are in for an extra treat when the game is "finished". If you have a Mac as well as a Windows, I would suggest playing the Windows version once as well. I shuddered the next morning when I started my computer. For those of you who HAVE played this game and DID enjoy it - the word must be spread. You have been chosen to be the mouth for this game. How often have we felt alone, as if no one could properly understand? Alternatively, how far removed from your reality is this game?

And you choose to either "unravel the reality behind the narrative or ignore its existence at all." It was designed to be "horrific" rather than a standard "horror" tale, the game's hand-drawn art style and colour palette serve to juxtapose the "pleasant visuals with twisted content".

This is really the kind of stories you hear about with mentally disturbed people. It was very interesting to see inside the head of these people and see what it could really be like. A horrible thought to think about and to see but i've always been intrigued by how they might think. Obviously we can never be sure but this is as close to the experience, that I hope i'll ever get to.\n\nIt is definitely not for the faint of heart in the slightest. Scenes of horrifying violence are constant in this game. While most of the actual killing isn't scene due to having a black screen you can hear the scenes in gruesome detail. You also see the aftermath of the crimes and it's definitely not nice to see. If this is not your thing then don't even consider this game.\n\nThe story of masochisia is told very well. I don't want to go into the actual story or how it is told cause I feel this would really ruin the experience.\n\nI am not really a fan of point and click games. I didn't particularly enjoy the actual gameplay because of this. I got bored and infuriated exploring about looking for what to do. The story was what made me throughly enjoy the experience though. The gameplay is standard point and click formula with not much different. But if your not a fan of them like me don't let this put you off.\n\nThe graphics style is also a thing of beauty. The colour pallette really catches the darkness of the game. Characters look amazing as well. Animations aren't incredible but since not many exist in this then it's not too big of a deal.\n\nWhile masochisia is mostly based on the shock element of the scenes it does also feature some mild horror elements. There are a few jump scares that exist that definitely did catch me off guard. They got a bit of a reaction out of me but not much. If your purely looking for a horror game then you won't find that here.\n\nThe game also has a lot hidden behind it. When you've finished the game you won't have found out everything. There are hidden codes throughout the game that reveal a lot about the story. After completing the story I would definitely recommend you look these hidden codes up cause it really does reveal some fascinating details.\n\nOverall masochisia was a truly horrifying but amazing experience. Definitely worth playing. It's a short experience at just over 2 hours but it's worth the small asking price. The only thing that stops me giving it "a must play" rating is i'm really not a fan of the tedious point and click game formula.\n\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nNot recommended\nMaybe consider it on a sale\nAn average game\nRecommended\nHighly recommended\nA must play!\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 20","true","3.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Masoshosia captures the essence of what it means to be a phychological horror game in very fine detail, the game never lets you feel comfortable with choices you make in the game (in some cases it forces your hand) and has a over all feeling of despair for your character, there is not a ton of gore in the game however through the music, sounds, discussions in the game, the feeling of being watched and the breaking of the 4th wall make it disturbing and thats one of the ways it truly shines, I will say what everyone else says, the game is slow paced and short, most people will beat the game in two hours, however Masochisia left a bigger mark on me as a gamer in its short two hours that most 10 hour games could muster up. There are still a lot in the game that i feel i missed in one play through, a lot of unanswered questions (even when i went back and tryed different things) so personally ill be playing it more than once.\n\nSo congratulations Jon Oldblood you have made a Horrifying game and I applaud you for that, This game isnt for everyone but for those who are ready? your in for one hell of a ride.","October 12, 2015","true","9.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It touches on very dark and disturbing topics like domestic violence, lunacy, abuse and murder.\nNot recommended if you are under 18, easily upset/disgusted or expect to have a "fun" time playing it.\n\nIf you are however into dark stories, Masochisia is an interesting and unique gaming experience that will compel, upset, disturb, make you feel unconfortable and leave you with an awkward feeling of "What did I just play".\n\nIt's less a real adventure game than an interactive story:\nYoung Hamilton grows up with an abusive father, his whole family a wreck, and no help to be expected from his mother or brother. He reaches a point where he has to deal with the situation, deceived by inner (and outer) demons. Hamilton gets deeper and deeper into a maze of violence, his vision blurred by nightmares and schizophrenia....\n\nWhile Masochisia does have classic P&C gameplay elements of exploration and dialogue, it's very limited in execution. Exploration only serves to find a handful of story-relevant items, but other than that inventory can be neglected. The strict linearity constantly forces you to explore the game world to find the sole spot/dialogue that will make the story advance.\nJudging Masochisia as an adventure game, I was quite disappointed by its many flaws in game design.\nYet  - also after having personal conversation with developer Jon Oldblood - I understand that the game aspect is only a tool to transport a story he wants to tell.\nWith that in mind, I recommend having a look if you're into dark and disturbing games.\nExpect to hate it as much as you like it, I certainly do. ;-)","October 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

I can whole heartedly say that Masochisia is by far, the most abominable narrative horror I have ever experienced. It doesn't sugar coat anything, it vividly portrays atrocious topics including domestic abuse and extreme masochism.\n\nMasochisia has taken a HUGE risk in gaming, but the outcome is impeccable. I cannot explain through words on how this game manages to achieve what it does. It is a game of no voice acting, repeated sound tracks and constant narration to read. BUT I wouldn't want the developer to change a thing.\n\nIn Masochisia, you can only move to the left or right of the screen. To me, this accentuated the illusion of being 'stuck' and being forced to only left or right, never forward. The dialogue options don't give the player much opportunity to refuse the obscene acts and escape, rather, it is forced to comply and obey. Delving deeper into the sickness of Albert's mind, the inability to move forward.\n\nI've read many warnings about this game and I completely agree. I only recommend this game to players aged 18 years or older and to be in a stable mind frame. This game would be best suited to those whom are interested in burrowing deeper into the psychology of the human mind and are intruiged in the horror genre.","January 23","true","1.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","2"

I really like it, but I think it fell a bit short of what I was expecting, and because of that I'm giving it a positive review but encouraging people to pick it up during sales.\n\nI really appreciate the art style, and the atmosphere that the characters (the characters are pretty interesting, really), story, and music create. There are a few jump scares, but they aren't overused and they are incorporated into the story well, so I'm not mad at the usage of them. I also appreciate the "extras" you discover as you go through the game, and I've read that the dev had to take out a lot of his ideas, but I'm still happy with the extras you get with the game as it is.\n\nThe "mechanics" of this game are a bit dodgy at times, and getting through the different areas can be a bit of a hassle at times if you don't click on *just* the right spot, but I think that can be forgiven since it doesn't take much clicking to figure out where you're supposed to go.\n\nThis game is very, very short, though. There are several acts, fine, but the game in total takes under 2 hours to complete, and I was honestly expecting so much more gameplay because I judged the game from the trailer. I am actually really disappointed that this game starts and ends so abruptly, that so many bits felt rushed, and that there wasn't more done with the story. For example, without giving anything away, you basically know what you're getting into pretty quickly, and I think it would have been much more effective to just be naive at the start and discover things slowly. There are cryptic messages hidden everywhere that you can decipher on your own time (you don't have to for the story), and then you can use those hints to discover who the game is actually based on. Unfortunately, I feel like mentioning this game was based on a true story was a tool used to draw people in to purchase this game-- and I can't be mad, because it worked, but I do think that if you're going to make a game based on the life of a serial killer, you should flesh it out a bit more.\n\n\nI wouldn't go as far as saying this game resembles The Cat Lady like others have said-- I think the two are very different games, although this game does incorporate disturbing themes as well. The dialogue options are brilliant, and I like how you can go very, very different ways with your choices there. I'm excited to see what else Old Blood will make in the future, because this is a decent "draft" game despite its flaws. I encourage people to buy it on sale, because it is something different and you *can* appreciate it as long as you don't pay too much for it because it's so damn short, and I think it's fair to label this as more a graphic novel than a game. But the horror aspect is there, and it is somewhat disturbing, so  I think fans of those types of games will appreciate Masochisa.","April 16","true","4.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Masochisia is dark and brooding with a very gaunt atmosphere. There are movies, games and books where if the audience does not get/undertsand the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) understones they will find the game very shallow and not enjoy it. This is one of those games. Although the game in itself is story rich and pulls you in, it will still feel quite lacking to those who miss the understood theme of game.\n\nFortunately a simple google search can inform the audience on all that they may need to know to truely appreciate Masochisia for what it is.\n\nI highly recommend that you give this short yet rewarding game a try if you are pining for a good point and click story.","October 16, 2015","true","3.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It would've been better if it showed the phases of how abuse effects a person, rather than beginning when the catharsis is already on the doorstep, it would've been much more.. personal maybe? Don't get me wrong, the game has quite a psychological madness going on, but I'd have loved to see more. These are my only complaints, I've gone to this without reading about it, so I may have expected a little bit more than I should have.\n\nThe selling point for me is that the game shows us how easy it is to justify doing horrible things to other people... Abusing, manipulating, killing someone. We see how abuse can change someone to the worst. Making people feel like that if they suffer everyone else should, justifying their actions, making them just as cruel, or worse, as the people who made them feel the way they do. There are bad people in the world, using and abusing people, but do they really deserve death? As soon as we see it in a personal level we can very easily judge, but doesn't that make us less.. human? Can we play god?\n\nI don't want to go really in-depth about it since that's not my style, but if you look for something dark and human, go for this. It's very short, but the psychology behind it gets more genius the more I think about it.","February 15","true","1.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/recommended/396310/","SilvaOfWind","Silva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/","338 products in account","Masochisia is a deeply disturbing game, covering such happy topics as masochism, sadism, physical and emotional abuse, murder and madness. In it's brief runtime it managed to be more horrifying and memorable than many other games several times its length. Every piece of the game works together to create an atmosphere of growing dread and revulsion, not just at the game's dark subject matter but the warped lens it is viewed through. Hamilton, the game's viewpoint character, is a particularly warped individual. The player is encouraged not necessarily to justify his actions, but sympathize with the madness that drives them.\n\nHere's what the game does right:\nThe art, soundtrack, and subject matter combine to make a unique and memorable psychological horror experience.\nThe game approaches madness and mental illness in a surprisingly nuanced way, neither glorifying nor entirely condemning the aberrant thought patterns and impulses of the afflicted. It's an interesting approach, given the relative rarity of horror portraying psychosis as more than people who want to stab anything within arm's reach.\nThe viewpoint perspective, as mentioned above, is well executed.\nThere are some missteps, however.\nWithout being told directly from another review, I would have never known the subject of the game was  the serial killer, cannibal, and child ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Albert Fish and without that knowledge context for much of what occurs in the game is lost.\nEvery so often the game shows coded messages that are not required to progress but reveal additional information. Someone with little patience or preference for ciphers, such as myself, is consequently left with an incomplete picture of the game's portrayal of its subject matter.\nThe way the game portrays the murderous nature of its protagonist as a matter of "destiny" could easily be misconstrued as justifying murder in general rather than that being the self-rationalization of a deranged and murderous mind.\nSo do I recommend this game? If you can withstand it, yes. Will I every play it again? HAHAHAHAHAHA.... no.\n","February 25","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've done a few others in the past, but nothing more than a few lines and before I started streaming and caring about making a name for myself, the effort really wasn't there. I don't know how long this one will turn out as I type this, but I imagine it's going to be a little longer. I'll try and keep it short, but you'll probably have to skip the first bit before I actually give my thoughts. Maybe the story telling leading up to it is bad and you guys only care about the actual thoughts, so fair warning. This may contain some spoilers, mostly subtle ones, so be mindful there as well, I'll try and spoiler tag them.\n\nTo set the stage for this, a friend of mine asked if I liked horror games. "No." Easy answer for me, I hate them, I like happy games with puppies and other happy things. I've played a couple other "horror" games: Kholat and Amnesia. I only played them because viewers had requested I play something scary and then a few hit me with donations to get jump scares from the alert (it worked most times). Other than that, I've mostly stayed away from any real horror games, though I'm always open to playing anything good for the entertainment of my viewers haha. So when my friend told me about Masochisia and how he lost sleep because of it and I'd heard others talk about feeling sick while playing, I was leery. Suddenly the "Gift" window for Steam popped up. "Well, it's there for you when you decided." Now I couldn't not play it, he'd guilted me into it...jerk. I put the word out on Twitter that I'd be playing it and there seemed to be some interest so I was locked in.\n\nThe day came around I jumped in. A bunch of regulars started coming into the chat and seemed excited to see me play so we dove in. Jon Oldblood himself even stopped by the stream and chatted as we played. It was really awesome to have him there and hear his thoughts and insight into everything, it was a very nice bonus to playing the game.\n\nSo now for my actual thoughts. The game was fairly short, about 3 hours or so and that was while I was streaming and interacting with chat, so it might have been stretched out. That said, the emotions came with some real power, it got the job done in that time. Jon told me the game wasn't meant to be enjoyed, it was meant to be experienced and boy was he right. It was disturbing, the things I was made to do, the choices I had to make, they were all extremely tough, some times I didn't even realize I was making a choice that would affect things. The story was powerful, it really gave insight into your character. It gives you a glimpse into the mind of an extremely disturbed person, the confusion, feeling like you have no choice and you're being forced to do something, it's really powerful and not something I've experienced personally. There's a few jump scares, but the real horror of it all is the psychological horror. Jon hit it right on with this one, there's just enough of the gritty details of the actual events that this is based upon to be impactful, but doesn't cross the line into the extremely disturbing reality of it. We did a whole after segment of reading the Wiki of the actual story and it's disturbing, I hadn't realized just how bad it was until I read that Wiki. That said, the Wiki helped pull together the little bits in the game that you may not have realized, the needles for example. Jon said he needed a bit of a break after making this game and after reading all of that and realizing how deep he would have had to research for this game, I don't blame him at all.\n\nSo that's it. A powerful story based on real events and it was done just how it needed to be. Again I need to restate what Jon told me; this was a game to be experienced, not enjoyed. That's a weird thing to say about a game, because typically that's why we play a game, to enjoy it, but with the nature of the content, I don't think a normal person can "enjoy" it. The experience though, is completely worth it. This is a game among a sea of others whose experience will stand out and stick with me for a long time to come.","February 17","true","3.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I wouldn't say it's as deeply affecting and moving as other reviewers have, however.\n\nThe premise is good, and although it has been done before, the game steered clear of the risk of becoming cliched and  predictible. Instead, the story kept me engaged and pushed me to unfold more. The cast of unnerving characters stay with you, although some of them seem too exaggerated to the point of becoming a parody of what they are trying to convey.\n\nI'm not a massive fan of the art style used, but it does seem like a good fit to the game, and whilst I may not find it nice to look at, it isn't supposed to be. It's meant to leave you feeling uneasy, and it definitely fits that purpose well. I feel the same way about the navigation in the game. It became quite tiresome dealing with the slow movement, restricted to just scrolling left and right, but it adds to the feel of the game and I think it was a great move by the developer.\n\nI do, however, feel like the game falls off a little at the end. The suspense seems to dissipate a little, unfortunately. I really enjoyed Masochisia, especially the few chilling curveballs thrown in by the Dev, but I feel like something is missing. I'd still highly recommend it, but I do feel like it's oversold on being "upsetting."","February 13","true","1.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I've never before met a game where I was happy, in retrospect, that aimless searching gave me some breathing room and a short break. In this sense, by the story depicted, the roots in real history, the actions of the characters and definitely the utter feeling of hopelessness, dread and horror this conveys, it is not for the faint of heart.

But has replayability as there is more than one ending.  A lot of work went into this and i'm almost certain that this was made by one person.  The story is horrifying and touches some very real subjects.  This game is not for the feint of heart as it is very psychological.  Masochisia is unlike most horror games, even though the graphics are cartoon-eqsue, they are in my eyes perfect.  If you like horror games that have jump scares and will also mess with your mind.  Then buy this game.  Well worth the money, expect around 3 hours of gameplay for a full run through.  10/10 indie title.\n\nIf you'd like to see my playthrough check out my youtube channel. :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLA7qgrYZWI&list=PLe3eyhT27R1Buk0rgD0h6FQSeWTdp0FBR","November 8, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

A very well made point and click game, it's certainly not an adventure. You certainly won't enjoy it, but you will appreciate it. If you enjoy it, then there's something very wrong with you imo. The game affected me and drew some parallels with my own mental illness, but I am not a killer fortunately.\n\nIf you are of poor mental health, this game will probably make it worse because it indulges in the darkest recesses of the mind. It explores a topic that no other game has touched, perhaps for Manhunt, except that is by comparison childish to this. It's very much an adult story and one that has resonated and left a lingering impression upon me.\n\nIt comes highly recommended by me, but with a caveat that it's not an enjoyable experience, but one that may make you decidely uncomfortable with the choices you are faced with","February 14","true","3.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

First of all, the actually game play was terrible. It felt like I was turning pages in a book to move around and was very slow and boring. The art was alright, but once again felt more like I was in an interactive book. The best parts seemed to happen while the screen was dark (aka the actually horror parts) with a  few jump scares added in. The story was confusing.\nThe best part about this game was when it ended, and not because it was finally over. It left me needing more information and an explanation. Even after this game was over I couldn't stop thinking about it. When my roommate and I did some digging and finally found out what the game was based on (yes, it is based on true events) we were horrified. In a great way. It made me have a new appreciation for the game that I would have given a 2/10 before.\nFor anyone who wants to know what the game was based on, google "The Grey Man" and you can find it from there.

I can safely say I've never played another game I'd described using the same terms.\n\nMasochisia is NOT a fun game to play. At all. And I mean that, entirely, as a compliment.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nYou navigate the dark, hauntingly beautiful world by either mouse or keyboard. You can traverse by going left or right, and by clicking to go to different areas. There is an inventory for a few items you come across as you play (helpful hint: click and drag to use items). You also get access to "pills" and other non-inventory items. There are not many puzzles, as this game is mostly story and dialogue driven, but the few it does have are well done. A big puzzle, in particular, had me stumped for a little while. But, to be honest, I'm not a good puzzle solver, so you might find it all very easy. Just know, while there is some exploration and some puzzles, that is not really what this game is.\n\nGRAPHICS/MUSIC\nThe art style is a real highlight. Combined with sparse yet effective sounds and music, the mood of the game is perhaps its biggest strength. I recommend watching the trailer - it gives a good idea about the art and mood.\n\nSTORY\nThis is what you are buying the game for. And it will not be for everyone. It is very dark and depressing and unrelenting in that tone. I most enjoyed how the game played with ideas of fate and your (in?)ability to change it. It breaks the fourth wall (in-game and out!), it provides moral conundrums, it tells a true story, and it always knows where it wants to go. The story messes with your mind, it challenges you not as a gamer but as a human being. While not for everyone, it is a very good and well told story.\n\nVERDICT\nI won't spoil anything, but I do need to talk around the ending. Masochisia has a very bold ending. I can see many people being frustrated with how it ends. Others might see a kind of audacious brilliance. I can say, if narrative games appeal to you, and the oppressive themes and dread-filled mood don't turn you off, then you should absolutely play to the end. Just know that when you're done, you will be asking uncomfortable questions about your own self.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","October 9, 2015","true","2.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

A story that has you trying to piece everything together for days after you've played through the game? Psychological horror that'll most likely force you out of your comfort zone? — If yes, then this game is for you.\n\nMasochisia is a game that plays a lot more like a Visual Novel interspersed with some walking segments rather than an old school Point & Click Adventure or a Telltale-inspired game. It's not for its gameplay that you want to buy this game; you want to buy it for its twisted story, its deranged characters, and the way it'll mess with you. While the game does use jump scares, the true horror of the game aren't the monsters that are hiding in the dark. Oh no, the horror lies somewhere else entirely.\n\nIf any of that sounds appealing to you, then I can only urge you on to immerse yourself in this dark tale.\n\nIn case this is important to you:\nHow long will it take you to play through this game?

This game is INCREDIBLY ♥♥♥♥ed.\nIt deals with a lot of dark seated ♥♥♥♥. Things that nobody wants to talk about or think about, but as humans we do, as much as we regret and abhor it. It deals with a "protagonist" who ends up finding out what kind of monster he will become. The game is apologetic. It does not hide itself and it does not coddle. The feeling of oppression that exudes from this game by the atmosphere alone is a pretty god damned good indication of the concept of depression and the related illnesses. It speaks of the human condition upon dealing with our thoughts we do not want to think or actions we do not want to do.\nIt will make you feel uncomfortable. You may not even want to continue, considering some of the ♥♥♥♥ it asks you to do. But there's this innate curiosity- Maybe, somehow, some way, you can make it all okay. According to the developer, there are multiple endings. But you have to be extremely careful on what you say and when you say it. You have to choose when to use items and when not to. It very subtly tells you what kind of path you will end up taking, and whether or not you can stop it.\nIt's a very, very short game. I got the first ending within an hour. But believe me, this man knows what it's like to have a battle within your own mind. He understands what it feels like. This game has spoken volumes about the concepts of mental illness and the struggles of depression. Also the battle of keeping your head on your shoulders and being in control of your own existence.\nI get headaches sometimes when I'm in periods of extreme tension or distress, and this game made me feel that, even though it wasn't obvious.

Or what this game is truly about. There is an entire aspect to this game that you have to think about. The codes are part of the hexadecimal alphabet, if you need a hint.\n\nI'm glad that the game does not spell it out completely to you as to what it is about. You have to research it.

That may be because I cannot really relate to some of the abuse related themes in the narrative, but that's hardly the game designers fault.\n\nIt just didn't appeal to me, and having no real control over the narrative means you just watch the story of someone in terrible circumstances go down the deep end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/396310/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","FULL DISCLOSURE: I was given a press copy of this game prior to release. It is your right to disregard my opinion based on this fact, but I assure you that this has never affected, and WILL never affect, the way in which I construct this or any other review I write.\n\nIf you'd prefer a video version of this review, have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lxWK773mjc\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nIts visuals are entirely appropriate. I really liked the style and designs of the characters, they lended to the overwhelming atmosphere of, just, pure dread. And I’m serious when I say that; you feel like you’re drowning when you play this game. But next to all that, there were a lot of moments when I noticed that the visuals and music seemed quite pleasant. And in many ways, that made the game feel even more disturbing; 95% of the game is seen through this old TV screen style filter, so even when you feel that everything you see and hear are not disturbing, there are still elements - like the TV filter - that remind you that things are not quite right. I’d say the one thing that takes away from the atmosphere, is that maybe 5 times throughout the whole hour and a half experience there are jump scares and they don’t really fit into what is going on. This game works best when it’s being psychological with you, not when a wolf-man jumps out of the trees.\n\nMECHANICS\n\nMechanically there is very little to say. I already mentioned that the game plays more like a visual novel than it does a “game” so be aware of that before you purchase. There’s some puzzles, and you often have to remember details from earlier in the game but, honestly, I though pretty much all of it was very simple. I figured everything out almost immediately because the game does hold your hand. It telegraphs the answers to puzzles pretty unsubtle-ly, which wasn’t a big issue for me but it may very well be an issue for some people.\n\nSTORY\n\nBut I wasn’t in the game for the puzzles, I was in for it’s twisted look at human psychology, and it does not limit itself to behind the screen. The game is entirely dark. There is no bright light, and I mean that in the sense that there’s no hope, almost anywhere in this game, and it is specifically designed to wear you down. That in itself will be enough to make a large number of people unwilling to continue with the game, and I think understandably so. But the game is trying it’s hardest to put you inside the mind of the protagonist, and in some ways put the protagonist inside of you. This game challenges you; it challenges your morality, it challenges the decisions you want to, or do make, throughout the game. It criticizes you for trying to justify the actions you will probably take when you play, and is ultimately unfair in the way it tells its story, and I mean that as a compliment. It sets you up for failure at the very beginning of the game, and it uses some really sick tools to send you its message. It also breaks the fourth wall in a lot in ways that are really inspired and cool, and really helps to make this experience a memorable one. I did feel that sometimes the dialogue was kind of up it’s own ♥♥♥ and melodramatic; I got a little sense of that, but I do feel it fits with the tone of the game and the person you’re playing as. And that’s all i’m gonna say about the game. I think I’ve given you enough information that you know whether or not you would like it, but the question remains; is it priced reasonably?\n\nVERDICT\n\nThe game is $8 and I think that’s pretty bang on, if not, maybe a couple dollars too expensive. You’ll really need to judge that for yourself; but I think it’s pretty obvious that if you're the right kind of person I’m definitely recommending this to you. If what I’ve said in this review seems appealing, then I have to say you won’t be disappointed spending that $8. As I said, it’s only an hour and a half long but one; I think that length fits, and two; I think there’s enough quality that the brevity doesn’t matter too much. Really if you're playing this game, it’s for the experience, it’s for the psychological ♥♥♥♥-ups that it does well, when you finish it you will feel like you’ve been THROUGH something and that it’s had a relatively profound affect on you. I can’t say that none of that is due to raw shock factor which is a little cheap, but it’s the combination of shock, atmosphere, design, music all the elements of the game that really give it this force that hits you in just the right places to make you feel worn-down, upset and disturbed. There’s no way around it, this game makes you feel like crap and it might have something to do with it being called Masochisia. The only thing that really brings it, in my opinion, away from that goal is the unnecessary jump-scares. I recommend this to anyone who feels like this is something they might enjoy, and I have to say, I’m one of those people. I guess I should put it like this: If you enjoy being compelled, feeling strong emotions or challenging yourself, then you’ll like it. I’m tempted to say it’s not even entertainment -- there is little chance this game is going to entertain you in the usual sense of the word.","October 9, 2015","true","1.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeanRelax/recommended/396310/","DeanRelax","Alexander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeanRelax/","228 products in account","First of all, let me just say that this is not a bad game, it's actually quite entertaining for what it is. I've spent a few days now arguing with myself whether to give this game a thumbs up or down, if I ever wanted an "in between" button this is the time. Sadly, I came to the conclusion to give this one a thumbs down based on a few points that drags this game down.\n\nThe first thing that disappoints me about this game is how short it is. This game really has potential to be a great horror point and click/puzzle/adventure game and there even are some puzzles in the game that makes use of this (the TIME riddle, amazing one). But it felt like the developer rather just focus on the creepy/gore factor. It's a hard one to explain, but you'll understand it when you play it. I'm not usually the person who complains about the length of a game, I've played my fair share of short games that just blew my mind. This however could be so much more. I completed it in 60 minutes or so (the rest of the time is spent on exploring things) and it's really not worth it for that price tag.\n\nThe second thing that disappoints me is that this game is supposed to be based on a true story. And I can't really agree there. I've read up on the true story and even seen the movie and documentaries about this serial killer, and that story had almost nothing to do with this game. I don't want to spoil the game too much, but let's just say that the parents play a huge part in this game, while the parents didn't exist in the true story. I might have misunderstood the game at some point, but the only reference that I got from the game to the true story is the name of the little girl, nothing else really. So saying this game is based on a true story is like saying Star Wars is based on a true story just because we've been to space.\n\nThere is one thing left that disappointed me, this might be considered a spoiler, so if you haven't played the game and intends do to so, please stop reading here.\n\n\nSo, throughout the game you get choices, if you've ever played a Telltale game you know what I'm talking about. This leads me to believe that you could change the outcome of the story (even the info section of this game hints of that). You start off as what seems like an innocent person and this quickly escalates to the worse. All my choices during the game were the "good" ones, and still the game forces me to brutally murder an innocent boy and chop up his body. Now I don't have a problem with the gruesome content itself, what I do have a problem with is the game, letting me believe that I can end up on the "good" side but all of a sudden deny me to spare a little boy. When did I turn so evil, even though I always picked the "good" choices? This is really where this game falls short, you are a good person one minute and then bam you have a dismembered body in front of you. That might have been the point of the story all along, that you can't change your fate. And I do kind of respect that story telling, but it feels frustrated to play an active part in a story just for the story to take a U-turn for itself and spit in your face.","February 16","false","1.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

Some of this was accurate.\n\nIt is short. I spent a bit more time in it than necissary because of a bug that caused me to lose all of my inventory items and forced me to hunt them down and recollect them. This is the only bug I encountered and it did not seriously impede my progress. The writing is also fine. The art direction, while cartoonish in style, is fairly well done. The music is excellent.\n\nHowever, I did not feel that it was a particularly impactful exploration of psycological horror. It certainly has some unpleasant content and some harsh language. It does portray or at least suggest both physical and emotional abuse which might be triggering for people who have experienced these things. But for the most part it felt trite, particularly in its implication of being "based on a true story."  This element felt exploitative, if anything. There was nothing informative here. I did not feel that this game gave me anything in particular to think about in retrospect. And, as many have said, it certianly is not fun. As far as being "creepy" or "disturbing," these are subjective experiences, but honestly I have seen episodes of Millennium that were far creepier, and for that matter, even campy, less serious horror films like The Devils Rejects are probably more disturbing in general.\n\nMy main objection to giving this "game" a recommendation, however, is that it isn't really a game. Its more of a visual novel, if anything. This alone would not be so much of an issue if it was genuinely interactive in any particular way. You can obviously move about and make choices in the dialog trees, but ultimately these choices have no effect whatsoever on the outcome of the "story," despite the description of the game implying that the character's fate might be subject to change.\n\nThis is a very linear experience with very limited interactivity. It contains graphic visuals, language, sounds, and suggestions. It isn't fun to "play," its extremely short, it ends quite abruptly, and its unlikely to leave you with any feelings other than repugnance and possibly boredom.\n\nSave your money.","April 14","false","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As someone who knows a lot about the case of  Albert Fish  , yes, it is accurate, and it does have an impressive amount of information about the man and about his life. I was impressed by this at first. However, upon meeting the characters  Grace and Billy  , I could not with play it anymore with a clear mind.The creator did a great job of creating the game and showing people a story they have not heard before, but there are some historical facts I believe one should know about the game.  Billy Gaffney and Grace Bud were real people, real children. You reenact Billy's murder, cut him up into pieces, just like Albert cut up the real child. He was whipped, his ears cut off, eyes gouged out, and cannibalized.  He was only four years old. Grace Budd was ten, and she was also eaten by Albert Fish. He sent her parents a letter, detailing how he murdered and ate their child. I imagine there is no horror, sorrow, or pain like the kind the Budds felt.  I left a more negative review earlier, but after speaking briefly to the developer, I feel I was being unfair. It was a game with a lot of work poured into it, but I personally could not stomach it. Listen VERY closely to the warnings, and please try to understand the historical even this game was based on. IF you can continue after that, by all means.

But there are som stupid things about it.\n\nPositive: Nice art, the dialogues really sound like its coming from a person suffering with schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder. The art is nice, the music as well, and the character design is rough and sketchy. Backgrounds are creepy, and honestly, i havent gotten much further so if you will please just drop down to the second part of this review...\n\nNegative: There you are. First of all, I did not expect this game to be so stiff. You can only move the picture either left or right, which kinda sucks and limits you from moving, and gives you a feeling that you are "stuck". I would have prefered this game to be 2D mixed with 3D or something more movable than this slideshow. Second of all, its WAY to cryptic. There is a shed where you are supposed to open a hatch, but theres a 4 digit code on it, and you cant use any tools in the shed to break it open (Please learn from Life is Strange) you MUST get this 4 digit code, and the only way to do that is to dig even deeper into the schizophrenic psychopath you are, and oh, did i forget to mention that as you play along, scary bears and shady people show up who tell you wierd stuff that makes absolutely no sense? Yes, its one of those games which can only be explained through a very VERY heavy interpretation of your own mind. No, im kidding, but its ridiculous... The answers that you can choose from during a dialogue is almost as ♥♥♥♥ed and twisted as the person asking them, specially since the persons you meet are either faceless girls, odd young boys with no pupils or big, red eyes satanists who have crosses in ther faces. Im stuck at the shed trying to open the hatch, but when you ask your mom (Btw, your mom is a sick twisted ♥♥♥♥ , and your father is a sadistic psychopathic drunk who beats the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and than has a personal dialogue with God) . Eitherhow, there is nothing clear in this game. Ever once in a while trying to find clues you go into this psycho-mode where your heart beat rate, and all of a sudden, you have scary creatures coming up close to your screen, screaming, and you do kinda get scared, but when you take the pills (yes you infinite amount of pills) you turn back to "normal". Sometimes the game goes back to "reality" and you are some dude named Alfred sitting in a hospital with a shrink. In the "other" reality your name is Hamilton. Anyway, on the game,your mom wont give the combination to the hatch, saying that "time will tell", what the ♥♥♥♥ does that even mean? Trying to scout every pixel of the game leads to no where, except this other voice keeps telling you cant go to certain places, despite that im ♥♥♥♥ing armed with 2 knifes. In the house you live in you got a neighbor or a brother or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ he is, who is tied and has a mask on his face. Trying to ask him to help you results in him saying "Im gonna eat your ♥♥♥♥ing heart out" and if you try to talk to him again, he just laughs.\n\nThis whole game is hard and its ♥♥♥♥ing wierd. And why the ♥♥♥♥ are there no voices? Reading text is boring.\nThe music is nice, the art, the characters, but the story is BORING and it makes no sense. Its way to cryptic, and the whole left-right slideshow controll is boring.\n\nI give this game 6/10.","October 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 33 people (9%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","9","3","33","3","3"
