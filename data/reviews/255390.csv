I've played the game for about 2 hours now and am about 25% in, with exploring the areas and getting most collectively. Can't speak about the overall length or difficulty for now as such.\n\nThe platforming is really slick though. Max is agile and moves quickly. This is something I really like about the game.\n\nThe puzzle element meanwhile is novel for me. Your magic marker gains new powers, and you can draw vines, branches, pull up earth from the ground etc. initially they may be very direct since there are visual cues but as you go on there is some thinking required.\n\nSo far, there is one notable performance issue. The game occasionally has it's frame rate set to 15 or 20fps and I need to Alt Tab out and back into the game to get 60fps. Nothing major and this usually happens only after loading screens, and that too not always.\n\nOverall, I'm enjoying the game. Nothing out of the world extraordinary, but slow paced and well made.","May 21, 2014","true","6.6"," 180 of 225 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","180","225","0","0"

There are also six languages to choose from.  The game automatically adjusted for my widescreen, but it can be played Windowed by hitting Alt-Enter, if you wish.\n\nThe game begins in a very Labyrinth[www.imdb.com]-esque way, and it's up to you to save your brother from the trouble you caused for him. ;p  Gameplay starts out as a very basic platformer, but it's not long until you start gaining some powers, and that's where the true charm of the game starts shining through.  The puzzle mechanics are brilliantly realized, ranging anywhere from easy to perplexing, but not to the point of frustration.\n\nI was enjoying the puzzle aspect of the game so much that I was actually a bit disappointed when, in latter levels, we started needing to depend on quick decision-making, and at times, good reflexes!  It wasn't until the final sequence of the game that I remembered -- Oh yeah, this is what platformers used to be all about! (ie. Donkey Kong Country, etc.)  The beauty of these sections is that, while they may be difficult, they are still doable!  It may take a dozen tries, but it CAN be done, AND you don't have to keep starting the level over again to achieve it, as the automatic save-points are well-spaced.\n\nSomething I truly love about the game is the graphics.  Sure, they're pretty, but the devs did an amazing job making a side-scrolling platformer *feel* like a 3D game by periodically changing up the perspective.  Beautifully done, devs, I'm very impressed! :D\n\nThe music was nicely-chosen, and I enjoyed the voices, as well -- especially some of Max's "YEEES!" moments. lol~\n\nPoints to remember:\n- You can attach vines to a myraid of objects, ranging from branches to boulders and more.\n- Items can be cut at the base OR the tip!\n- Be creative and don't give up!  The devs give us a lot of freedom with our powers, and sometimes it's going to be trial-and-error figuring things out.\n\nThere are a couple of things to be on the lookout for whilst you're running around.  They are beholders (plants with eyeballs at the end of a stalk that allow the user to spy on the world) and pieces of an amulet.  These collectibles are not *needed* to complete the game, but they sure do add an extra bit of fun. XD  You can replay a chapter at any time (even after you've completed the game) from via the menu, and looking at the menu during gameplay will show you how many you have left to find on your current level.  In addition, there are 27 Achievements for you to earn, another plus in my books.\n\nOverall, I found Max: The Curse of Brotherhood to be a delightful game, full of beauty, danger, excitement... and tempered with just a splash of good old fashioned platformer-frustration.  I would say that it's OK to play with older kids, but perhaps not little ones.  There's a big scary monster in there (whom I find to be absolutely fabulous!), but it might upset younger children.\n\nHighly recommended!","April 25, 2015","true","10.7"," 63 of 70 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","63","70","0","5"

Sometimes, during a steam sale, I grab something that looks interesting and just hope it pans out.  This game looked nice. Puzzley platformifisizing and all that.  Figured, why not it's only $3.75.  What a fantastic surprise.\n\nIf you are like me and tend to gravitate to action platforming a la Prince of Persia and Tomb Raider as well some some puzzling going on then this very well might fit in your library quite snuggly.\n\nMax's brother is abducted by an evil villain named Mustachio - WARNING:  This title is very anti-mustache and any facial hair aficionados might be offended.  His lil bro is then sucked into a netherworld from which only Max can save him.  I don't know why.  If it was *my* little brother I would be turning his room into a new play room and stealing all his legos.  But I suppose brotherly love must overcome and all that.\n\nOff the bat you'll encounter some tutorials on drawing with your mouse or controller.  Yep, I know it sounds bad, right?  But it's actually pretty easy. I even did it entirely with my controller.  You solve puzzles by drawing vines, branches, water spouts, exploding fire, earth columns, and probably some other stuff I have totally forgotten by now.  These things you draw not only to solve puzzles but also to make up the framework for the platforming.  The puzzles are good, some even causing me to say "what the..".  While being somewhat casual a few  will actually stump you for awhile.  Now, the  platforming is on the medium level until level 6 where is bumps up to a bit-more-than-medium, the majority of the tougher bits towards levels 5 and 6.  And it's done well, usually with a giant monster chasing you.  Very action oriented and guess what?...you have to solve puzzles on the fly while being chased by an evil monster and timing the platforming.  YES.  It's that type of game.\n\nIs it hard?  Before level 5 it is fairly casual gamer friendly.  Level 5 requires more brain activity and Level 6 requires some quick maneuvering.  The final boss is hardish, but once you figure out what to do it's a piece of cake.  Hardness...7/10.  For an extra challenge there are some artifacts and eyeball spy camera plants to uproot.  I got some of those, but frankly my steam library is too damn big to try to 100% a lot of games. Time management yo.\n\nGraphics are sorta kinda Pixar looking. They look great and run well.  I would not say it was stunning, but definitely pretty.  Had zero crashes using a few PC's and ran pretty well overall at 60 FPS with a mediorce system.  Sounds are well done and the menus are easy to navigate.  Save spots are set in good places, and I have to say it was a wonderful produced game all in all.\n\nIf you like action puzzle platformers, then give this a go.  Wonderful title and quite enjoyable.\n","September 19, 2015","true","16.4"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","41","43","5","2"

The controls are simple enough to learn, and much of the game is merely setting up your next move: figuring out how to get from point A to point B with as little dying as possible. While much is possible to go slow and steady, there are many points in the game that requrire precise timing and vine-laying and otherwise to ensure that your enemies die or are trapped, and that you don't fall down a sudden hole that opened up underneath you.\nFor those that are story oriented, Max has a nice storyline that progresses kinda predictably (ish), but its a great story that'll be relateable for anyone with siblings who have at times wished they would disappear. . . who weren't aware that they might actually be taken into another world.\nFor those not sure whether the game would be worth it or not, here's the basic premise: You play as a kid named Max trying to save his brother from an old magician named Mostacho, who like his name entails, boasts a moustache. You take him down using a magic marker, in both senses of the word (its a literal magic marker, who doesn't wanna play with that?),  that has been imbibed with the soul of an old woman (the guide of the story, gotta have one of those).\nSo yeah, I'd recommend trying this game out and seeing what you think!","May 22, 2014","true","11.5"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

You have a magic pen that you can use to transform your environment into a platform for you to interact with and to help you on your journey to find your brother.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/255390/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Having grown up with two younger brothers, I can empathize to Max’s annoyance at his younger brother Felix fiddling with his stuff, making a mess of his room, and seeming to exist only to get on his nerves. I might not have gone so far as to enact an occult rite and banish my brothers to an unknown fantasy world (though I might have wanted to at times), but at least Max realizes the gravity of what he unintentionally did pretty fast and sets off to save his brother from a creepy old man who intends to steal his youth, Gruntilda the Witch style.\n\nA sequel mostly in name and lead character only to Max and the Magic Marker, The Curse of Brotherhood almost entirely ditches the free form drawing that made up the core of its predecessor, opting instead to streamline its mechanics and add a significant amount of cinematic flair, coming together in a far more focused, inspired, and varied experience.\n\nThough it is still referred to as a marker, Max’s tool of choice has been reworked into a powerful instrument with which you can now control various elements in order to help Max traverse through levels. The implementation of this still bares a resemblance to Max’s marker of old, allowing you a small amount of freedom to direct elements into specific shapes and paths, but it’s far more natural and embedded in the experience than before and works well within the constraints of a controllers precision, rarely requiring a great deal of precision and only occasionally imposing any sort of time limit.\n\nThe Curse of Brotherhood has rather obviously been designed so as to rarely frustrate the player, or tax them with tricky platforming segments or puzzles, and this simplicity and hand holding is in some ways a bit tedious when the answer is almost always immediately apparent, but overall I actually found the breezy pace rather refreshing. It allowed me to appreciate the gorgeous environments and enjoyably cliched story without many threats or pauses as I got stuck. It provides just enough stimulation to remain engaging, but is accessible enough that it’s a game I could feel confident recommending to a younger player or a parent wanting to play with their child (which is a disappointingly low number of games).\n\nAt around 4-5 hours it’s a fairly brisk adventure, but I never felt as if something was cut or missing, nor did any moment feel like needless filler. Every segment is interesting and important to the game, and this consistency and constant variety makes it easy to wind up playing through the entire thing in but a few sittings. That’s not a slight against the game by any means, but a complement to its excellent pacing and inspired level design.\n\nThe handful of moments that stand out as poor in my mind are actually those near the end which begin to ask more of the player than before, and the slightly awkward controls have a bit of trouble keeping up. The end boss fight also proved the most disappointing part of the game, with an uninspired encounter that ups the difficulty just enough to be frustrating and would have ended the game on a rather lackluster note had it not been for the charming cutscene immediately following.\n\nIt’s probably an understatement to say I was rather taken aback by how much I ended up enjoying The Curse of Brotherhood. Its beautiful scenery pulled me in, and the leisurely platforming and puzzle solving kept me there throughout an experience that continued to surprise me the further I got in. Some may scoff at the low difficulty, but in terms of simple fun and creativity I haven’t played something quite as nice for too long.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","November 2, 2014","true","5.2"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","1"

Max(you) in disbelieve as to what happened quickly decides to follow his brother in an attempt to rescue him.  The game starts of slowly introducing each mechanic one at the time, the pacing is excellent. You can control natural elements(on fixed positions) within the game world with your magic marker. This is required to get to the end of the level, which are designed very well and look very good in terms of graphics. The puzzles that you need to solve are also well done... though they are not that challenging, but remain fun for players of all skill levels.

I cannot stress enough how fun this game is.\n\nIt starts off pretty chill and mellow, allowing you to get a handle on things. You have an infinite about of chances to carry on from your previous self-saving checkpoint (which is throughout several places in the game) so you don't ever have to go back and redo and entire portion of the game itself, this also applies when you exit and re-enter the game. Once you get further into the game, your item (a marker) gets better and the puzzles become a lot more complex, but not too much that its frustrating.

Many major design elements are well done. There are optional puzzles requiring more innovative solutions that result in their own achievements. There's also a steady build in your abilities as you advance. Yet I stopped playing about a third of the way through, and I didn't have much of a desire to continue.\n\nThe missing element is player ingenuity. I'm not personally a fan of entirely linear puzzles. I like games where I can develop a strategy on the fly. Some of my favorites in this genre are Mark of the Ninja, Trine 1/2 and Gunpoint. Those games are characterized by an ability of the player character which the game does not guide you in how to use. It only makes opportunities to use it available. I like the lego set mentality of game design. "Here's a really cool thing with something you could build, but do whatever you want with it."\n\nTo me, a magic marker that changes the play environment promises a whole lot of player experimentation, but there isn't any. Every puzzle, every movement you make, is completely linear. It's pre-determined, and there's no alternate way to solve it. The abilities can only be used on pre-marked 'ability areas' that provide the solution to the puzzle. The puzzles are not difficult. I found myself fighting the controls more often than an intellectual challenge. In the end, it's like playing an FPS where every really cool kill you get automatically switched your weapon, highlighted your target, and all you had to do was click. The rest of the time you just proceed where the directional arrow tells you to.\n\nI think the game doesn't deliver on its promise of a magic marker in that respect. There's still quite a bit to be enjoyed here if the completely linear aspect doesn't bother you. The animation is great. I found the controls a little clunky but hardly unusable. Some of the puzzles are entertaining even if not hard, and the story is almost worth playing through in itself. Gameplay is king though, and I wanted something that would beg for a second playthrough just so I could change things a different way the next time.","September 7, 2014","false","3.4"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","27","40","0","0"

This one drew me in from it's art style to it's way of solving puzzles. You get this marker which you can raise platforms, create vines, branches, water waves and more. Not only can you create these things but you can actually draw, cut, pull and push them...like if you wanted to make a circle out of a branch, cut it and then let it roll down a hill you can. It makes really unique and interesting puzzles you won't see anywhere else.

(And occasional moments of frantic timing).\n\nMax is beautifully animated, with a stronger focus on puzzles than platforming;  in most areas you're constructing your own "platforms" made of earth, branches, vines or (the most fun) water, in order to progress.\n\nThe world has fixed points where you can spawn the different items by "drawing" them with your magic marker.  This does mean that typically there's only a single approach to a problem, but it keeps the game flowing nicely; you're unlikely to be stuck for too long on an area, and if you are the checkpoints are very forgiving.  (Getting the optional collectible amulet parts  can involve a little more head scratching).\n\nAn extra element is added as  branches and vines can be detached from their spawn point and then dragged (or rolled if you managed to draw a circle) around.\n\nAs a platformer, it's naturally made for the gamepad.  However, I'm playing it with both gamepad and mouse - the mouse really helps when drawing platforms to get the right shape/curve. As you can't move when drawing in any case, the switching between mouse and gamepad is seamless - great work by the devs.","June 3, 2014","true","8.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's not hard to beat but certain sections require the players to be very careful in what they're doing, yet not a single is to be found in the entire game. Also it offers a series of specific challenges (like, "don't ever die not even once in the most difficult level") as achievements, so even "hardcore" gamers can be satisfied. +++\n- Cute story. Another reviewer wrote "do you have a sibling? If yes, GET THIS GAME" and I couldn't agree more. I allow myself to add "...and play it with him\her". Very simple yet nice story, no matter if you're a kid or an adult. ++\n- OK graphics. Not the best selling point of the game, but still decent. +\n- Bugs free. I recorded 13 hours of playtime and only encountered one problem, once (game stopped working for no apparent reason and had to restart it). No graphics issues, no controller issues, no savegame issues whatsoever. +++\n- Collectables. Every level bar the first and the last ones have a series of collectibles to fun and they not only extend the playtime but also make the levels less linear and thus even more interesting to explore. +++\n- Plays smooth with a controller. Haven't tried playing it with mouse+keyboard, but controller is perfect. +++- Well-designed achievements. That's always a plus in my book. +++\nIi got this on sale at 75% but I think it totally worth its full price.","January 12","true","12.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The ♥♥♥♥ you will pull off in this game is exhilarating. The levels have great verticality, and the vine swinging, oh man that vine swinging. So much of it! And over many vast, vast expanses of open air. Whether it be climbing up the side of towers or plummeting over massive waterfalls, you will have lots and lots of fun.\n\nThe magic marker mechanic is fun, the highlight being branch+vine creation (and destruction - you can chop off branches/vines from their source to reach higher/lower places). It's the most flexible, figure-it-out-yourself of all the elements you can manipulate, versus the earth pillars, which are fun, but very specific and limited. The player movement controls are precise. You won't find yourself overstepping platforms very often.\n\nThe dynamic camera definitely carries some of the epicness of the game, and it's still very effective in letting you see what you need to see. There were two moments when I wish, after zooming out to get a large view of a room, it would zoom in a little sooner so I could control my character with more precision, but it never caused any problems. Overall a great feature.\n\nThe tone of the game is silly and childish. The characters are very stock, but that doesn't detract from the experience at all. The tone (plus the enemies in paticular) remind me a lot of Rayman 2. The voice acting and music are all good, and the art/scenery is beautiful!\n\nNot sure how long it took me to beat the campaign the first time, but overall it took me 14 hours to complete the story, grab all the collectibles, get all the achievements, and then go back and complete every level without dying (a really fun challenge - you even get little badges to show for it). The puzzles aren't exactly hard, but there were a few that had me scratching my head for a couple minutes. It's definitely more constant satisfaction than frequent perplexity. You could argue that the game is shallow, in a "no investment of skill or emotion" kind of way, and that would be true for the most part, but there's nothing wrong with that, if you don't mind that kind of thing. It's an Indiana Jones, not a Moby ♥♥♥♥, and that's ok.\n\nMax: The Curse of Brotherhood is great fun, epic, and satisfying. I look forward to replaying the game (and hopefully a sequel) in the future.","February 12","true","14.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

But it is not a big loss. Out of couriosity I checked the other game on YouTube and my conclusion is, that developers where toying with the idea before delivering the real deal which is Curse of Brotherhood. And I'm suprised it didn't get the hype and reach as wide as Ori and the Blind Forest, as both are released by Microsoft studios.\n\nThe kid named Max, who got rid of his brother via magic spell that he found on the internet. His brother Felix is captured through portal into another wolrd and Max jumps right after him realizing the consequences of his action. From now on you control Max, who get to use a magic marker. A simple item that let's you solve the puzzles throughout the game mixed with platforming. The marker allows you draw rock pillars, branches, lianes, water geysers at certain spots leaving you to figure out how to do it to proceed further or solve the puzzles. Not all of it will be available from the beginning, but as it is straight-forward side-scroller, there won't be any backtracking.\n\nNow, I need to mention that I play with my X360 controller and I have no idea how the game works with keyboard control. As for the gamepad it felt very smooth, both for controling Max and drawing stuff with the marker. Smooth and nice graphic won't obscure anything and light tutorial won't leave you clueless as to how to interact with objects. You will be able to draw Os from branches, cut them by the base and use it as an object you can climb onto. Some enemies apart from hazzards also serve as a solution to the puzzle. You also have to combine marker's abilities. All of that is explained in the game so you know how, but thankfully doesn't serve as a guide. The difficulty of the puzzles is various however. Normaly you'll be able to go through with very brief moments of reflection. Sometimes you may be stuck for longer, but never long enough to make you frustrated. Colorful and childish theme of the game may suggest it is for younger players and I encourage them to try it.\n\nThere are collectibles in the game, but they serve no other purpose, than to chill your eventual OCD. There are evil eyes to collect and these may be placed in the areas that will take you longer to figure acces to. There are also pieces of the amulet of the Old Lady (she's kinda guiding you through the magic land), much harder to get. The main problem with it, is that the camera is very stiff and concetrated on Max. Sometimes you may be able to spot evil eye somewhere on the corner of the screen, but getting some of them requies leap of faith.\n\nThe artstyle is simple but gorgeous, there is also superb voice-acting, a bit unexpected from a small game. Normally I play on my PC connected to 32" LED TV so I can enjoy the graphics of such colorful games. However, considering the overall quality of the graphics it shouldn't struggle on older gear, but it does. I own 8GB RAM Laptop with 1GB RAM graphics card and quad core processor and had huge problem with cutscenes. I got the sound without visuals or got it with miserable framerate. No struggles on a PC, though.\n\nAs Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is puzzle-platformer, have in mind it will play different than a straight-forward platformer. It is not very demanding game, there's a free demo available on Steam, that I would reccomend to try out first before buying the full game. It was fun for me.\n\n7/10","October 9, 2015","true","9.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The puzzles themselves are very-well thought out and will make you stop to think as they increase in complexity as you unlock the progressively more powerful (puzzle-solving) abilities that force you to combine and employ them in unconventional ways.\nI also didn't find the trial-and-error method to completing some of the potentially aggravating chases and other such sequences to be an impediment to my enjoyment as I still remember gaming on the Atari/Nintendo/Genesis and this was part-and-parcel of the experience back then. Some people may find this 'cheap' difficulty to be off-putting in this modern day and age of gaming but to them I say "Suck it it isn't that hard!" :P\nThe major issue I did have with the game was with its control scheme where the game is best played with a gamepad where movement is concerned but can be somewhat cumbersome when drawing with the magic marker. With the latter it may be best to use your mouse as it is smoother and more effective and I found myself switching back and forth during the more complicated parts of the game.\n\nAlso, all achievements baby, yeah! xD\n\n8/10","November 25, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So what I find myself doing is using the controller and my mouse (to use the marker).\n\nAt any rate, the graphics are nicely done and well rendered.

I use my Logitech F310 and I find it works excellent with this game. The only downside is the marker is a bit cumbersome and a bit of a downside in this game. So what I find myself doing is using the controller and my mouse (to use the marker).\n\nAt any rate, the graphics are nicely done and well rendered. The pace is good... at times it can be fast and others you'll slow down just to think about what to do. One moment drawing out branches, and the next trying to run from an enemy. A real well detailed platformer with good music, soundeffects and a nice atmosphere.\n\nThe marker feature can be cumbersome for some, but it isn't an issue for me. Even if I use both a controller and a mouse for this game (that just seems easier and quicker for me when I need to do so).\n\nSo far I've just made it to the 2nd stage, and from what I've read it gets a lot more difficult. Definitely a game I would recommend... the price point at $14.99 isn't high for a game like this (though I did buy it 75% off).\n\nSo a definite recommend from me if you like well paced platformers.","September 6, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you do you're probably not a kid any more. The time has come to take on another similar quest. This time you are going to save your annoying brother Felix. Max the curse of brotherhood is fantastic looking puzzle platformer for everyone from 6 to 106 years. It may look like a kids game but it is actually for everyone because of nicely dosed difficulty. Reminds me also of another game I adore -" Limbo". In the beginning it is a bit on a easy side and at the end it gets little bit hard. Most of the game is just right. It will take about 11 hours to complete 20 levels and that too is just right. Your only weapon (beside your wits) is magic marker with 5 magic abilities: ground elevation, branches, wines, air flow and flame balls. You use magic marker to resolve greatly conceived platform puzzles. Puzzles are just challenging enough for maximum joy without much frustration. As I come from 20 years of console gaming my default setup on Steam is Xbox 360 controller. It held it's own until the last segments of the game when it became impossible to control magic marker with speed and precision needed. Not to worry. When this occurs you grab your mouse for marker control and all is well again.You'll feel omnipotent with controller in one and mouse in another hand :-) Or just play on keyboard and mouse - maybe that is even better, I haven't tried. If you have any interest in this type of games buy this and enjoy. It is just as good as "Limbo" or "Heart of darkness".","March 1","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Oddly enough, it seems that it would be best suited for touchscreens (you "draw" columns of rock, branches, etc. to advance) yet it appears it has always been a PC/Console game.\n\nPros:\n\n* Graphics are very good for a platformer, both for character movements and for cutscenes.\n* Movements are swift.\n* Plot is simple, but ok.\n\nCons:\n\n* Too simple: just keep moving, everywhere where you need to "draw" something is clearly visible in the game so you need almost no thinking.\n* Control: you move with keyboard and, when you get to a place where you have to "draw" something, you have to position your mouse again. Not an issue when you are not in a hurry, but sometimes the baddies are pursuing you. As I said, this game would have made lots more of sense in a touchscreen.\n\nSo? If you find it discounted (5€-6€) and you sometimes like simple games to have some relaxing playtime, it may be a good purchase. If not, probably it is not what you are looking for.","January 4","false","6.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/255390/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","The game LOOKS fantastic. The basic platforming is adequate. The real attraction of this game is the magic marker, which works SORT OF (very big emphasis on "sort of") like Okami in that it lets you draw things into reality that you can use to overcome obstacles.\n\nThe magic marker is an interesting idea that is not very interesting in execution. You can only draw lines when and where the game has predetermined that you are able to draw lines. And you have no control over the kind of thing that you draw, because the game decides that too. It is literally like the game saying, "Now you will draw a vine right here." And you do, because that's all you CAN do. That, in a nutshell, is how the magic marker works. Sometimes there are situations that are somewhat puzzling, but the game always gives away the solution by having the blabbermouth protagonist just flat out tell you how to do it.\n\nThe thing that really turned me off on it, though, and decide that I wasn't going to play it anymore, is the way the game spams the abitrary "think fast" type situations. I would have been fine playing it to completion if it were just a sort of platforming adventure with some magic marker puzzles. But as you are making your way through a level, the game likes to suddenly throw a random "think fast" hazard at you, where you have to figure out what you need to do to avoid the hazard in just a few seconds or die and go back to the previous checkpoint. These are made worse by the way the game hijacks and repositions the camera to show you the incoming hazard, so you are also disoriented in addition to needing to think fast. And there is an element of these "think fast" hazards being completely arbitrary, because sometimes the glowing objects you can use via your magic marker don't even APPEAR until the instant the "think fast" hazard appears. This results in most of these moments feeling ill-considered and frustratingly punitive. You know the kind. The trial-and-error, die-repeatedly-until-you-guess-what-the-developer-wants-you-to-right-here type of rigamarole. Apparently most players who picked up this title are cool with it, but it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. I have very little tolerance for it.\n\nIn the end it is a beautiful looking game with adequate platforming, a draw mechanic that is an interesting idea but not very interesting in execution, and (in this player's opinion) a sorry overuse of arbitrary "think fast" moments and chase/forced-momentum sequences.\n\nThere is some good to be found here, but it just tends to overuse too many things that are not to my taste and completely turn me off, so I probably will not finish it.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.\n4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.","January 16","false","1.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

There is no challenge, once you die then see how something is done then you should get it nearly 100% of the time on your second try. Also, checkpointing is some of the worst I've ever seen mainly because I don't think there is any. I had to exit the game to leave home then later came back and started up the game and had to redo an entire tedious level that personally I never wanted to see again, ever. It was just not fun in the slightest bit to have to do it again and I just felt super p-ssed off, and neither is a automated trial and error journey. If there is checkpointing in later levels, you would never know it because the game never shows a saving checkpoint icon like all other games do, so it's one of those "well I better not exit the game or quit until I finish the entire tedious level" type of games. I'm pretty sure levels have no checkpointing, but who cares.\n\nIf it weren't like a Disney kids movie, I might play it some more. Then again probably not because of no checkpointing. Levels aren't horribly long, but with boring, automatic-win tedious levels with a seen it done before already drawing mechanic, I just can't force myself to care because it keeps putting me to sleep. Much more fun platformers exist if you look. They are more fun because they are infinitely more rewarding than this.\n\nI gave it a thumbs up because like I said at the beginning it is not a bad game mechanically, just mind numbingly tedious.

The last time i really enjoyed a side scroll game like this was back when I 1st starting playing the Commander Keen series back in the 90's which yet i haven't had a chance to get on steam. This game at some points do become a little challenging where you have to act fast and sometimes do it over a couple of times. The graphics are pretty good using the Unity3d engine which I know from creating 3d objects for a 3d VR chat/build environment called ActiveWorlds. If you are looking for a fun game to play than this game is for you. Game seems to run smooth, game seems to be well balanced as well. Also wouldn't be a bad idea for the developers to add modding for custom levels and put in a workshop so others can download other's levels,etc. that would bring this game to a higher level. Would I pay full price for this? well yes if I had the money all the time to buy things full price. I bought this game on the last sale that was running. Even the wife thinks this game is pretty cool with the magic marker.","September 1, 2014","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But the adventure doesn’t quite feel next-gen. With unintuitive controls, puzzle mechanics that’ve been done better elsewhere, and a story with the depth of a coloring book, it’s hard to stay invested in this short adventure.\n\n\n\nUsing a giant marker to color your way through the puzzles of Max: The Curse of Brotherhood offers a great-looking and clever twist to the platforming genre. Well, it would if it weren’t so frustrating half the time. Once the novelty of drawing wears off, the curse we’re left with isn’t brotherhood, but awkward controls.\n\nI generally like the idea that I can make drawings to help solve platforming puzzles, even though it’s not as freeform as the concept implies. You get the marker early on, but before you do, climbing ladders and jumping over endless gaps as Max in the beautiful 2.5D environment gives you your first taste of the floaty controls. Cruelly, our little hero is a complete platforming pansy who can't even double-jump; one long-ish fall or hit from just about anything and he'll go down faster than that kid in Limbo. And he went down a lot. This game isn't as cuddly as it appears.\n\nNew marker powers come at a nice pace though, and each one has its own vibrant chapter full of briefly interesting ways to use the mechanic. The water temple is dripping with clever puzzles that had me drawing spouts of water to create paths and making boats out of vines. The fire temple, on the other hand, is more of a thrilling race, where the marker helped me to quickly find an escape route from a fiery lava beast. Discovering new ways to utilize the power of the marker is entertaining, and each area offers some fun surprises.\nWhen I could get the marker working, successfully navigating Max through areas using vines, branches, and water spouts together to create a sort of mousetrap sequence was seriously satisfying. Some high-pressure levels towards the end where you’re outrunning lava are particularly epic as well.","February 28, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of them are easier to get but others can be annoying. I started the game and after ~25% of the progress, the game unfolded its full nature.\nFirst of all, you can see the lovely graphics and surroundings, the brave hero named Max, who tries to free his little brother. Simple Story, reminds me a bit of "Heart of Darkness". Nevertheless, it is not just a copy.\nEvery chapter has new Challanges and the game itself develops.\nYou'll get a magic pen as a wepon and from chapter to chapter you will learn new abilitys concering to this pen.\nI did not play in one go, because I needed a break to prevent insanity. This game is awesome, but sometimes you will be very frustrated. Some Ideas may be the right ones, but thinking and doing is not the same progress.\n\nTechnical aspects: I played it with a xbox controller, very good and accurate control. Ingame sound is okay, you'll hear screams of death quite a lot, so maybe you wont use ingame sound ;-) Simple settings, no problems with crashs/install etc.\n\nAll in all, it is a very good game, beautiful and scary at once. Nice optic, good riddles and the best thing is to resist your frustration and solve everything without checking a let's play.

While there were no brain stumpers, the puzzles did require a bit of logical thinking to progress. The story was quite good considering there wasnt much of it.  The graphics were pleasant despite the lack of graphical options in the menu.  I enjoyed this game more than I thought that I would.\n\nI originally downloaded the demo version to get a grasp on the difficulty of the puzzles before I purchased this for my kids.  After playing the first couple of levels, I was hooked.  So, I bought a copy for myself and one for my kids.  Hopefully they will enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nOverall I would give this game an 8.5/10...taking off points for graphic options and controls that were just a tad clunky during the timed sequences.  I would recommend this title to gamers of all ages.","August 30, 2014","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lighthearted adventure aimed towards a younger audience that's still fun for an older one as well. Another review hit the nail on the head that said this game was like the Ps1's Heart of Darkness. It is, in all forms, the spiritual successor to said game.\n\nMy only gripe about the game would be that I wish there was more Boss type areas. They reuse the "constantly run and use the environment" gameplay a bit to much, and replacing some of those with a boss fight, much like the last level, would have made the game feel a little less repetitive(and added a much cooler experience). Aside from that I felt it was to easy, but I can't complain much cause it was clearly aimed for a younger player.","September 2, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love how it's so similar to Trine. The beautiful graphics really makes you appreciate the game a lot. At $3.75, I think it was worth okay. It took me 5 hours to complete the game so it didn't really hit the $0.50 per hour mark.\n\nPROS\n1. Graphics\nFantastic. I love the foreground/background effects. E.g. The Monster carrying Felix away.\n\n2. Water Streams\nLoved it. Like a water log ride at the amusement park except in all directions. I would have loved more long water stream combos.\n\n3. Puzzles\nSome of puzzles got me stumped for a while or made me assume it was supposed to be done some other way. It was extremely fun and funny to pause on a kid's game.\n\n4. The Monster\nI don't know why. It seems to resemble the monsters from Critters, yet I loved it. Too bad it died in the lava.\n\nCONS\n1. Missing Reappearing Marker\nThe marker automatically disappears the moment you start moving and reappears the moment you pause. This on and off behaviour is very annoying as it makes it hard to gauge the marker's appearance.\n\n2. Collecting Amulet/Eyes is Worthless\nIt's just an achievement. You don't even get anything impressive. It's not even for more fun.\n\n3. Incomplete Story?\nWhen the game ended and I saw the concept ideas, I was surprised to see dragons, underground lairs, gear movements, Smile Town residents and even strange forest critters.

Well, it's a 2D platformer, rendered in full 3D, wiht a rotating camera the changes angle slightly depending on the scene, and it renders beautifully. I genuinely wish I had a 3D Screen of some kind to try this out with. Often times you will see a path leading off here or there, and you feel like you should be able to follow them, but they are no in the 2D space, and are purely cosmetic... awwww.\n\nIt's a great looking game, it has a fairly simplistic, yet entertaining story line, it is just long enough that you can enjoy the immersion, yet don't get bored of the game or it's mechanics, and it has a few secrets that temp you to replay levels to find them.\n\nNone of the puzzles are so difficult that you will need to look upa guide - at least I ddin't have to, I just had to sit there and think about it for a minute. I think there were about 5 puzzles that wern't immediately obvious, and 2 of them actually had boxes that you could use, but they looked like part of the environment. (just a quick heads-up). Also, a couple of the secrets you only realise are there because you fall/die and see them on the way down. There are many 'no return' areas, too - where once you go through this door, it slams behind you, or a moster wrecks the path, or you slide/fall and can't go back. So make sure an area is clear before you carry on.\n\nVoice acting is well done, story is simple, cute, but servicable. the magic marker can be a little hard to control on th eodd occasion, and it got me killed once or twice, but nothign that I would shoot the Dev's grandmother over :- ) Checkpoints are very forgiving.\n\nGreat little game to burn a  few hours in.","September 11, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tolodk/recommended/255390/","tolodk","Tolo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tolodk/","595 products in account","Nice little platformer which I very much enjoyed.\n\nThe game reminded me about the cartoons that I used to watch as a kid, and I was actually quite impressed with how well the developers managed to carry this theme through. The game basicly nailed it, everything from the very basic storyline, the hero and the villain, the dumb evil forces, the big monsters, along with some very convicing voice acting, cartoony graphics, and its very fitting music.\n\nThe game itself wasn't super hard, but it wasn't easy either. I am by no means a expert at platformers, and I am sure alot of people would manage to get through the game with less deaths than I did. The game can be enjoyed by people of all ages, although younger kids might have a hard time at certain points in the game. I personally played the game with a controller, so I can't really speak for how it plays on a keyboard, but I found the controls easy to learn, and even the magic marker was easy getting used to.\n\nPros:+ The magic marker added some very interesting mechanics to the game, that certainly made me think.\n+ Good pacing of game, with new mechanics being introduced through out the entire game.\n+ Lots of checkpoints, which is nice for people who are horrible at platformers like me.\n+ Achievements, and in-game collectables, which adds some replayability to the game.\n+ Most cinematics can be skipped, which is nice for a second playthrough\n+ The art style, the music, the cinematics, and the voice acting, all matched each other and was very well carried through. Which made for a very good experience.\n\nCons:- The game has certain parts that require some fast thinking, and change of controls. This means that the game wont be playable for everybody, and that younger kids might not have a fun time. The many checkpoints however helps a great deal with this, so you will rarely have to start all over again, in case you die.","September 13, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love how it's so similar to Trine. The beautiful graphics really makes you appreciate the game a lot. At $3.75, I think it was worth okay. It took me 5 hours to complete the game so it didn't really hit the $0.50 per hour mark.\n\nPROS\n1. Graphics\nFantastic. I love the foreground/background effects. E.g. The Monster carrying Felix away.\n\n2. Water Streams\nLoved it. Like a water log ride at the amusement park except in all directions. I would have loved more long water stream combos.\n\n3. Puzzles\nSome of puzzles got me stumped for a while or made me assume it was supposed to be done some other way. It was extremely fun and funny to pause on a kid's game.\n\n4. The Monster\nI don't know why. It seems to resemble the monsters from Critters, yet I loved it. Too bad it died in the lava.\n\nCONS\n1. Missing Reappearing Marker\nThe marker automatically disappears the moment you start moving and reappears the moment you pause. This on and off behaviour is very annoying as it makes it hard to gauge the marker's appearance.\n\n2. Collecting Amulet/Eyes is Worthless\nIt's just an achievement. You don't even get anything impressive. It's not even for more fun.\n\n3. Incomplete Story?\nWhen the game ended and I saw the concept ideas, I was surprised to see dragons, underground lairs, gear movements, Smile Town residents and even strange forest critters.

The graphics are amazing and the cut scenes look like a real animated movie. I picked this up on sale and I nearly didn't because I was spending too much money on a load of games but I'm so glad I picked this one up because it's quickly become one of my favourite games ever. I wanted a break from playing open world games and wanted a little puzzle platformer and this is EXACTLY what I wanted. This game is absolutely perfect and I highly reccomend.\n10/10. Though my review could change by the time I finish it but I doubt it. 4 hours in and I'm still in complete awe.","December 4, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh how i was wrong! I haven't had this much with a platform since Crash Bandicoot!\nThe story has been seen before many, many times - but it's still cute.\nThe cutscenes are SO well-made, and the feeling you get when swinging your magic marker, is really quite unique.\nIf you wan't a crazy-fun platform - this is most definantly a must-buy!","June 3, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its very playable and wonderful to look at.  The controls work well.  The graphics are very polished.  The sounds are good too.  I particularly liked the attention given to providing a range of noises emanating from enemies.  The plot is a little cliche but that is not particularly important. Its not that long but I can understand why.  The main game mechanics are fully implemented.  Any longer and it would be as boring as the average FPS from a decade ago.  8/10","April 10","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
