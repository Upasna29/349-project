There are even two important "skills" without any button...yeah you have to klick it manuell with your mouse in the right lower corner...the same mouse that leads the flying-direction by the way. So you will end up flying into the right corner every time you need to look the goal-island up and fly out of the map.\n\nTha camera is made by someone who hasn't played the game I think.\nThe cam points diagonal from the right side onto the squirrel...that means you always fly to the right side out of the map.\nConstantly you have to change direction to not fall out of the map.\nFALL is a good point too....sometimes I fly sometimes I fall and it seems pretty random even if I am 16m/s fast I keep falling.\n\nI don't want to tell you about every bug now but in only 20min I found nearly 4 of them and all appeared not only once.\nFor example "glitch into an island and don't stand up again".\n\nI think they just want to make more money with this game but without any effort. So they put the accect same portable version onto the pc.\nDon't spend your money and your time on this one...it feels unfinished like in an alpha.\nI don't think it plays better on the acctual devices for what it is made.","May 30","false","0.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djaxn/recommended/473490/","djaxn","Djaxn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djaxn/","926 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis is the second title I've played by  Rai Studio Games.  It is just as simplistic, shoddy, and worthless as Base Squad 49.  It just looks a little better.  I have not yet played their second Steam title, Land of Devastation, and will not do so unless I get a free key, as I did with this one and BS49.  The only penny I'll ever give to this sorry excuse for a "developer" is the penny they'll get when I sell one of their trading cards.  And that's more than this game is worth.\nSeven levels, all of which involve doing what you see in the video on the Store page, and nothing else.\nThe tutorial level (which is one of the seven), only has instructions for tablet controls.\nThe mouse/keyboard controls—once you figure them out yourself—are good, if you like clicking the bottom corner of the screen over and over.\nCannot remap controls.\nNo options screen at all except to change your squirrel's color (three choices: spotted tail, striped tail or plain tail, all of them with the same-colored squirrel).\nMusic is annoying synthesized loops that gets tiresome almost as soon as you start listening to it.\nNo save/load system.  There would be no point.  There's nothing you'd want to save.\nTrading cards still don't work, nearly three weeks after the game's launch.\nAchievements are simplistic and meaningless.  All of them involve merely completing levels and tasks x number of times.\nAɴᴅ Mᴏsᴛ Iᴍᴘᴏʀᴛᴀɴᴛʟʏ: loaded with fake positive reviews from the get-go,  just like Base Squad 49.  Ignore them.  They are bogus.  No one could possibly enjoy playing this game.  I did play it.  And it did suck.0/10","June 1","false","2.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
