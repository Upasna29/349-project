Terry Crews as Satan!)\n\nIf you loved the zany, crazy, madness that was Saints Row 4 - yes, thats including the superpowers and extremely insane themes. Then you will definitely get your money's worth with Gat Out of Hell.\n\nGat Out of Hell is short, but still very worth it for the price, especially if you are an SR4 fan. I would say that I hurried through the game, and with a time of about 6 hours 12 minutes, I finished the main story, all activities with gold and collected all collectables on Hardcore difficulty (97% game complete, plenty diversions and kill quests left to do, but those are just timesinks).  Of course this is quite short, but considering they marked the game down to 20 dollars (compared to 60 dollar releases of the same quality), I would still say its well worth the money, or at the very least on sale.\n\nThe story is.. a love-story!.. In hell! Without spoiling anything that isn't in the description of the game already, the President is kidnapped by Satan. He is to marry his daughter, Jezebel. And on top of that, the story is portrayed as a musical in a few instances. Additionally, regarding the story, if you are a fan of the story in the Saint's Row genre in general, you will find many references or even characters throughout the game that will make you either laugh or reminisce. The ending is one of various choices, that you get to choose yourself.\n\nOn top of the story we also have activites, as in previous Saint's Row games, these often tie into the story in a way that you have to finish them to progress, personally I find most of these fun, even in previous Saint's Row games, so I did not have much of a problem with them, but I know some people are less inclined to do them - or even to strive for gold.\n\nThey have added a dozen variations to previous activities, and a bunch that are based on the new flight power - such as "Salvation", you have to fly to falling souls and catch them before they reach the ground, without landing on the ground yourself.\n\nGameplay is very similar to Saint's Row 4, in the sense that a lot of the superpowers are very similar, if not the same - with a few exceptions, such as "Summon", an ability to summon, for instance, an army of imps! Yes, that's right, your very own army of imps that will jump and attach themselves to your enemies while gnawing at their heads/limbs.\n\nAs for bugs/glitches, I have yet to stumble across any - I did find a few activities that seemed like they could do with some tweaking in time, but to be frank, this might just be a matter of getting through the learning curve and optimizing how I do it better.\n\nI encountered a single bug that made me only get 939/940 of the soul clusters needed, this was a little annoying. (Edit: Turns out it was simply not on the map, but it was ingame, I found it now and have 940/940, link to map in comments).\n\nSo would I recommend this game? Hell, yes.\n\nEdit: Pros and cons after finishing the game\nPros:\nSaint's Row Insanity at its best.\nNew activities/variations of old activities. (Salvation, Torment Fraud, Hellblazing with flight)\nNew targets (Most are similar to SR4, but again, have a variation).\nNew Map (Uses the same city-theme as the others, with a hell twist - but it is a new map)\nCharacters from the older games (Dane, Dex, DeWynter sisters) + a few new original ones (Shakespeare, Vlad, etc).\nPlenty of new awesome weapons (7 deadly sins).\nNew superpowers (Summon is entirely new, and all the others have new "Elements"/variations).\nStory is as cheesy as any good Saint's Row story should be.\nIt's cheap. At $20 you still get much more content and usage than a movie ticket. (Now imagine the inevitable 75% off at $5).\n\nCons:Game is not reinventing itself. And while this is not THAT bad, because I am a huge fan of the SR series, it would be nice with some more variety from SR4.\nIt's short - took me 6 hours to beat the story, gold all activities, and find all collectibles - could probably have been done faster. Still worth the $20 pricemark though, and definitely 50%-75% off if you can wait.\nNot enough Genki, although you do get to kill him at least once.\nNot enough old characters - Why not let us fight more old baddies again, let Gat kill Jyunichi (Aisha's killer) some more? Or Killbane for that matter?\nNot enough Shaundi and Pierce. Gat and Kinzie are great, sure, but couldn't they at least have had some more banter between them?\nThere was no gang-war at all in this one, again, sure it's hell and all but..\nNo radios - Who wouldn't have LOVED a hell-themed radio-set? Imagine talkshow hosts in hell, maybe even interviewing Satan?\n\nConclusion:As a Saint's Row fan I will be inclined to recommend this at its full price no problem, if you love the series and cant get enough of SR4 - then get this for sure. Otherwise, you might want to hold off until it's 50% off. It's still a great addition to the series, and I've had a lot of fun with it already - and will most definitely continue doing so.\n\n\n\nUpdate: After 14 hours and 51 minutes, I 100%'d the game - this could definitely have been done faster, but I wasn't exactly speed-rushing through it. Of course, this is excluding 1 achievement (Spend 20 hours in hell).","January 20, 2015","true","40.7"," 344 of 399 people (86%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","86","344","399","79","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IvanDankov/recommended/301910/","IvanDankov","Ivan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IvanDankov/","547 products in account","My thoughts and impressions on this game are a little split...\n\nThe game itself is - as old fashioned Saints Row fans would expect -.. gloriously stupid and over the top. Though the Story is with ~4hrs of playtime not really that deep or as good as the ones from the whole franchise. But for a legit price of 20 bucks it's justified in my opinion.\n\nYour task is basically to play Gat / Kinzie from former Saints Row games, to save the Boss' soul  which he lost between SR IV and this game (he appears the way you created him in SR IV game if you own it), and make your way through Hell and face Satan to achieve just that (it even got short musical parts in the cutscenes which I could listen to over and over again). It's short but there are 6 different endings...which motivates (at least me) to keep on playing from time to time.\n\nThe game feels unique to me because the developers may have not put a lot of effort into story driven parts but they were damn creative concerning everything else.. 7 deadly guns (wrath, lust, sloth, etc..),\ndifferent challenges / sidequests that are easy to beat but damn fun to play and the fact that new superpowers were added since SR IV ...though some are "imported" (stomp f.e.) but all in all a nice addition.\n\nAnd finally there's a Saints Row game where you are not forced to buy DLC's to get all of the achievements....some of them suffer from "standard shooter game gameplay"- grinding  (achievements for making XY kills with that weapon etc)  but even that makes fun. The others though are very creative and you actually have to do some insane tricks to achieve them...sometimes frustrating but it feels so satisfying after ;3\n\nI loved Saints Row since Part 2 and this one might not be the best of them all but its definitely worth a shot if you are a fan of the franchise and want to play from a new perspective (Kinzie or Gat) in Hell.\n\nWhat matters the very most to me in games like this is the fact that you are able to play it with friends..Saints Row has taken all that to a whole new level for me...it just makes too much fun running, driving or even flying around together and mess with everything... not that i dislike GTA but i had my early Steam days with Sr3 and 4 ..not GTA V Online...but they are all good games!\n\nHope you weren't too bored while reading this and I was able to help you out to decide whether you should get this or not. Have a good day =)","May 25, 2015","true","11.9"," 161 of 180 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","161","180","12","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/301910/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account","Saints Row Gat out of Hell is a standalone DLC for saints row 4 featuring Gat and Kinzie as playable characters. Game’s main length is around 3-5 hours long and full completion is 10+\n\nStory\n+Audio logs are nice way to flesh out allies\n-Princess of Satan feels underused (more missions would have helped)\n\nSatan has taken the president’s soul and it’s up to Gat and Kinzie to bring him back home. Hell is full of disgruntled citizens, a promising avenue to recruit new allies for the confrontation against Satan, and his armies. Your allies all have hidden motivations to fight against Satan that is revealed as you discover tapes scattered throughout hell\n\nProgression\n+Doing what you want advances the story\n+Repeatable last mission (Ability to watch all endings without loading)\n\n-Only 2 main missions that feel unique (Operation Rescue + Defeat Satan)\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Satan fills up the gauge, once filled leads to the final confrontation. Side missions are the fastest way to fill it up, which ranges from collecting souls, taking over the city, fulfilling weapon and power challenges, and obtaining more elements.\n\nThe gauge has two events that trigger before the final confrontation. The first one being anti-air spires planted around the city to shoot you out of the sky. The second involves freeing the allies you gained throughout the story. There are multiple endings to pick from once defeating Satan in the final confrontation, since the boss is repeatable, seeing all endings is possible, without loading a previous save or restarting the game.\n\nSIde-Missions\n+Abilities to increase time needed in activity is handy\n+Flying is fun without being too difficult\n\nThe side missions are fun just like the previous saint row games. They range from murder with powers, collecting souls by flying into them before they disappear into the air, throwing yourself into cars, and more murder with weapons until you survive all the waves.\n\nThere were minor cosmetic done to the side missions that separate it from the previous games for example instead of fraud being paid in money its been substituted by years.\n\nThe missions that put your powers to the test, gained throughout Saints Row 4, have returned as alter missions that you can find throughout the city, to unlock further elements.\n\nAchievements/Co-Op\n+CO-OP still fun to play with friends!\n\nThe achievements in this game don’t require you to do the online profile thing which means getting 100% is a lot easier now, especially with CO-OP since the only achievement I saw requiring it was the 3 hour one.\n\nNote: You play as the opposite character of whoever your friend picks.\n\nGear/Customization\n+7 Deadly Sin Weapons are a treat to use\n+Ability to upgrade weapons\n\n-Customization is gone\n\nThe customization is gone the only cosmetic change you can really make is for people who have the alternate wings from the pre-order dlc.\n\nThe 7 deadly sin weapons are great fun to use and I do enjoy how diverse they are in both manner and execution similar to how creative previous saints row games have been with their weapons. Having jackpot weapons that explode enemies into gold is great fun and while I would rant more about the other weapons I’ll leave it up to you to discover them :)\n\nThe ability to upgrade weapons in various ways is still here. I tend to upgrade clip size even though I got the infinity ammo perks which made… that completely pointless (I never claimed I was smart!)\n\n\nPowers\n+Abilities are complimentary and worth to switch back and forth from.\n+Summons have replaced calling up allies\n\n-Losing the ability to fight alongside your new allies\n-There are two less abilities than previous game (SR 4)\n\nThe abilities this time around in my experience feels like they compliment each other alot better. For example I can summon a titan that likes to charge enemies while i switch to stone spell and cast it on enemies for him to break into rubble. Another example is using stampade to vacuum up enemies while you have vamp drain active which drains enemies that are close to you. Due to the vacuum element of stampede this allows me to get enemies within range and clustered up for maximum effect supposing they don’t die.\n\nRemoving the ability to call up homies is the biggest con in the game. Being able to call on homies you unlocked throughout your journey was always fun in other saint row games. Considering you have new allies like shakespeare and Vlad the impaler it would have been interesting to fight alongside them. Summoning unlike calling homies doesn't require menu navigation and flows better.\n\nThere is two less abilities in this game than the previous one. If they are in the game I must have missed them (98% of game done) and I am only missing Kill X with Y powers/guns and some souls to collect. They could patch in either new powers or sell them as DLC we will see what happens in the future.\n\nEnvironment\n+Fresh Setting: Hell (allows for some interesting cosmetic choices)\n-Where the physical barriers are can be misleading at times\n\nThe game looks very fresh and different from the other saints rows considering the setting and all it allowed for some interesting cosmetic changes. I believe its map design is structured after steelport (and mentioned in the game as looking similar in that sense) though I could be wrong. It looks different enough as a result of the setting to not feel like a clone.\n\nThe physical barriers can be quite misleading at times, what i mean by this is when i shoot at a enemy and I thought i aimed far away enough from a spire for example it still gets blocked magically. Other times I would be above a hole and go a bit closer and fall through the metal floor.\n\nNote: Cars look horrible and explode randomly after curving off into buildings - awesome\n\nNavigation\n+Flying is a vast improvement over gliding\n\nNavigation in Saints Row 4 focused super speed and gliding while Gat out of Hell switched up gliding for a pair of wings. One would think that it would only be a small improvement but since it was designed with momentum in mind and upgrade abilities its actually pretty big improvement over gliding. It feels more rapid and exciting especially to fly down from great heights or flapping your wings to gain speed and maneuver around buildings at a rapid pace. It’s also quite fun to shoot down those pesky Spire missiles that home-in on you.\n\nCollectibles\n+Collecting souls for skills\n+Stacked data is replaced by a mini-game of grabbing a series of souls quickly (4-5)\n+Commentary collectibles for both characters (Adds amusement/personality)\n+Finding Glyphs unlocks treasure chests\n\nThere are 5 audio logs per ally that you can obtain in order to understand their motivations for helping you. There is also audio logs that Satan himself personally records that you can collect. The commentary for the two playable characters is spread out throughout the map in key points to comment about their surroundings.\n\nCollecting 3 glyphs per distract allows you to open a chest for nice soul rewards and a weapon once you finish getting them all. The souls you collect throughout the city are useful for upgrading your powers.\n\nInstead of grabbing stacked data like in saints row 4, you have to grab a series of souls after initiating the mini-game by touching the big glowy soul in the sky that is pointing at the direction it will launch the souls to. So it’s best to be facing that way whenever you plan to win them since they are TIMED.\n\nConclusion\nSaints Row: Gat Out of Hell is alot of over the top fun with a variety of creative weapons and some laughs here and there at the absurdity of it all. I recommend getting this game if you're a fan of Saints Row the 4th.","January 22, 2015","true","39.9"," 239 of 284 people (84%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","84","239","284","32","9"

That being said, I just cannot recommend this.  Sure, it's a standalone DLC, but the price for 4 hours of gameplay is just too much.  I tried hanging on to do more of the "activities" but those were always the most boring parts of the series to begin with.  There is really no story to follow and the surroundings are just drab.  If the price were at least half what it is now, I would say go ahead and give it a shot.  For this price you should pick up Saints Row 3 if you don't already have it.  Again, I love the series.

Not many people are playing it online right now, and none of my friends decided to buy this game really. So for time/money 10/20. Thats not to say I don't like the game, but it's $2 an hour for the average user.\n\nExactly what is this game? Let me start off with what this game is not it is not saints row 4 with a hell theme, it is very much not that. This is a new map, a whole bunch of new enemies, all new weapons, 1 new super power type (2 if you want to count flying vs. gliding), all new super power elements, the same type of mission resking as we saw with sr4 and the 2 playable characters Johnny and Kinzie. Things removed from the SR4 experience: Character customization and the radio.\n\nAnd if you haven't played saints row 4, you really should, while this is a standalone expansion to the game, it is not at the same worth as SR4 (which is 10$ more with all of it's DLC rounding to about 20-30 hours of fresh gameplay)\n\nAnd lastly, WHILE I DO SAY ALL OF THE THINGS ABOVE THIS EXPANSION IS WORTH IT. My reasoning for it is pretty simple, it's the same type of game that I came to love in Saints row 4, Except with new... things. You don't have to change too much to a game, this is pretty much a theme change (which is why it's not a new game but a standalone dlc) and a story expander, you do get to find out what happens after saint's row 4's ending and how more insane ♥♥♥♥ happens with the 3rd street saints, now rulers of everything. And the whole ride is a lot of fun, Best to enjoy with another person.\n\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 9/10 (Saints row tries to keep it fresh by adding in a few twists here and there, and it really works out.)\nGameplay: 10/10 (Saints row 4: The best superman game never made. Gat out of hell: the best angel simulator ever made.)\nPresentation: 10/10 (The game looks beautiful, they didn't take a generic cheesy look of hell, no they made it pretty bad ♥♥♥ and in their image of the saints row universe.)\nSoundtrack: 6/10 (Lacking as opposed to other games, not to say that there isn't any music, because there is some... but not a lot. Didn't make for much of a difference though, there is the steam music player now.)\nReplayability: 7/10 (Oof, I would say play it with your friends, like really no matter how much time you've put into it, you can always play it again with a friend and it's fun. other than that it's singleplayer replayability wears very thin at 16-18 hours)","January 23, 2015","true","21.5"," 122 of 151 people (81%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","81","122","151","20","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngryBoz68/recommended/301910/","AngryBoz68","AngryBoz68","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngryBoz68/","377 products in account","A standalone expansion for SR IV, Gat out of Hell lets you make the Devil's playground your own.  Satan has kidnapped the President and the player as Johnny Gat or Kinzie Kensington are going to hell to get him back.  What is Gat's plan to get the boss back? -- Simple! Shoot the Devil in the face!\n\nIf you enjoyed Saints Row IV then you should enjoy this game.  Gat out of Hell is a trimmed-down version of SR IV with a hellish theme.  You get a new city with New Hades that weighs-in approximately half the size of the Steelport map.  Super powers make a return but have different elements to reflect the new setting.  A new flight mechanic is introduced and it feels real good.  Many existing weapons also make a comeback, but new weapons reflecting the 7 deadly sins are introduced, which are very amusing and fun to use.\n\nMission structure is somewhat different than previous games.  There are no scripted story missions.  You are introduced to 4 allies which you gain favor by completing side activities.  Finishing all of the activities for an ally will usually grant a new weapon.  The completion of side activities will also leave a trail of destruction that will gain the attention of the big red man himself.  A progress meter will fill as the player completes more activities, and once the meter is full, Satan himself will finally show-up and confront the player.  There are some good cutscenes as the player is introduced to allies and completes their tasks.  Story specific cutscenes also play at certain points as the progress meter fills which includes an amazing musical score.  So the game mainly plays as an open world sandbox where the story ends after completing a certain amount of side activities.  Surprisingly enough, once the game ends the player gets a choice of 5 different endings.  This is merely a choice that results in a cutscene and none of the actions during the game will influence the outcome.\n\nThere is a lot to do as I spent about 20 hours completing the game to 100%, but one can actually complete the main story in 5 to 10 hours.  Additional time can be spent attempting to complete all of the numerous challenges in the game so the $20 price tag seems fair.  The numerous side activities are a lot like those from SR IV but with a twist to fit the theme.  A few new activities are also introduced to mix things up a little.\n\nThere are a few downsides that may disappoint fans of the series though...\n\nYou get to play as Gat or Kinzie, which is fantastic, but there is no customization for these characters at all.  There is also no weapon skin customization (though you can thankfully still upgrade weapons and powers).  In fact the only customization that you get in this game is the ability to import your unique "boss" from SR IV, but you only get to see the boss in a select few cutscenes.\n\nThere is no licensed soundtrack like in the other games.  There is also no special celebrity guest appearance this time.  I guess the $20 price point made these features prohibitive but it would have been awesome to see something like Ozzy Osbourne show up in hell as one of the four allies and some heavy metal from Black Sabbath blaring in the background.\n\nOther features cut are vehicle upgrades and garages.  The player can still hijack vehicles, but the variety of those are few, and vehicles cannot be stored for retrieval or upgrade later.  I suppose these were lesser used features anyway since the super powers rendered them mostly useless.\n\nAnother minor quibble is that there is little difference between playing Gat or Kinzie other than mainly appearance.  The player may easily switch between either at the Ultor building and there is no separate upgrade path.  So the choice is mainly a cosmetic one.  Although both Gat and Kinzie has their own set of 30 audio collectibles and the player has to be playing as the respective character to find those collectibles.\n\nI found the game to be rather entertaining as a SR IV expansion.  Definitely worth a look if you are a fan of Saints Row IV and want a little more of that kind of craziness.","February 3, 2015","true","26.4"," 82 of 97 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","82","97","4","4"

I played the hell out of it, doing every side mission, spending hours upgrading every weapon, customising my character, vehicles and upgrading my abilities and powers. I loved the writing, the antagonist, the loyalty missions and the radio stations. It was one of my most favourite games of the 2013.\n\nGat Out of Hell is such a disappointment and it left me feeling very sad, with no desire to play on after spending just a couple of hours on the side missions and basically stumbling upon the ending without realising it. It lacks so much of the joy and love that SRIV had. It's stripped of any customisation, the missions are generic and all of the loyalty missions are exactly the same. The writing was a big let down too, with a lot of the comedy hit and miss. The musical was great, but it was a complete contrast to the rest of the game. It didn't feel natural or absurd. It felt more of a sweet release from an otherwise dull atmosphere.\n\nThe lazy excuse to "remove all sins" from the citizens of hell, simply so they can get away with using the same model for every pedestrian adds to the feeling of a very unloved game. I feel like the ambition of taking the Saints to hell was let down by either timing issues, budget or just the team wasn't up to it.\n\nIt's Saints Row 4 without the customisation, the writing, the diversity of the loyalty missions, the range of assets and the radio. It's Saints Row 4 on a budget, which leaves me asking whether Saints Row is actually any good without those things. Gat Out of Hell answered that for me. It simply left me feeling very disappointed and with just 4 hours of gameplay, I feel like I've done everything I wanted to do in that game and instead would rather go have some more fun in Saints Row 4.","January 25, 2015","false","7.8"," 184 of 253 people (73%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","73","184","253","18","0"

I'd rate it as "mixed" but unfortunately Steam doesn't have this kind of rating so I must give it thumbs down. It's fun to play, I must admit, but it takes only 10 hours to complete and there's absolutely NOTHING to do later. It lacks a lot of basic SR features and for me it's really big dissapointent.\n\nPROS:\n+ Crazy idea and concept.\n+ Musical.\n+ Well done new city.\n+ The weather is different depending on the district.\n+ Activities (most of them are copied from SR IV but still, they're fun).\n+ Upgrade system.\n+ Really good optimization.\n+ Awesome weapons and superpowers.\n+ Audio logs and commentary.\n+ Historical characters.\n+ Lots of references to previous SR games.\n+ Very few bugs.\n+ Modding.\n\nCONS:\n- Really primitive storyline.\n- 5 storyline missions. (!)\n- Lack of Boss appearance.\n- Very few characters overall.\n- No radio stations.\n- Small amount of weapons.\n- No vehicle storage.\n- No customization of ANY kind.\n- No minigames nor text adventures (it wouldn't be too hard to put something like that, come on).\n- Lack of easter eggs.\n- Only ONE type of pedestrian. (!)\n- No homies.\n- They finally put Dex but it's done really sh*tty.\n- There are five endings but only two of them actually don't suck.\n- No weapon skins.\n- Outro includes more storyline than the whole game.\n- Kinzie and Gat don't have any differences except model and voice lines (also, you can't complete the final mission as Kinzie for some reason),\n- Again, no mission nor cutscene replay.\n- Again, no cribs (except Ultor Building).\n- Again, pretty weak car damage system.\n- Again, there's no way to toggle upgrades.\n- The whole game looks like a poor overlay for SR IV.\n- Literally nothing to do in the freeroam.\n\nI rate it 5,5 out of 10. I find this game fun but way too short and unfinished. I know it's just a standalone expansion but for real, just take a look on Episodes from Liberty City. It shows that you can do a standalone expansion without cutting out literally everything.

Satan is trying to force him to marry his daughter, Jezebel. Johnny Gat and Kinzie follow them into hell to rescue the President.\nIn Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell you play as Johnny Gat or you can switch over and play as Kinzie Kensington. While the superpowers from Saints Row 4 are immediately familiar, they are at least in new flavours. There are no shops to change the clothes and no homies to call up and fight alongside. Johnny and Kinzie's entire mission in Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell is to get Satan's attention with murder, mayhem, and chaos.\nIt takes something around 5 hours to beat the game, to get all achievements it takes 20 hours ( the final achievement is to spend 20 hours in Hell).\nThe graphics are nearly the same as in Saints Row IV, no real improvement. The city, New Hades, is not Steelport. There are similarities, but it is nonetheless a new place to explore.\nSaints Row: Gat Out of Hell has all of the character voices from the previous game. Unfortunately there is no in-game radio stations like it was in the previous games.\nOverall I think Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell is still a lot of fun to play if you play with a friend.

Its the same size or it seems as other Saints Row games but its in Hell.  They made a HUGE world for such a short game and most of the world isnt used at all.  The stylistic look of the world is like seen in the movie Constantine, cars are all corroded and the citizens are all husks.  The cars have no radio, and players get wings to fly around.\n\nThe flight controls are set to inverted so if having difficulty switch the controls to normal in the options.  The controls for flight are amazing, and after using them for a bit feel very intuitive.  The world has tons of detail but not t first glance, the husks copy citizens behavior from other Saints Row game which means using the phone, eating hot dogs, or just yelling because their in hell, these husks are very amusing.  The gas station has signs that say things like "No Skin, No Service".  Many locations are new or totally unused like the HUGE Satanic Church of the VIpers, or the Arena of the Vipers.  There is no Viper gang or Viper anything in the game so it musta been cut, they also modeled a whole prison that isnt used.  Weird... Point is its a HUGE world with very little gameplay but alot to look at as a Saints Fan, and even better you get to kill Dex over and over.  Only fans will care about Dex or know who he is, and its funny how he says "i was better off forgotten about", which he was until now.\n\nNon-fans will get real bored after beating it and not mess around much, the online is dead due to the default setting for the game being private not public and its so short by the time people notice the option, their done playing the game.   As a collector this game is an interesting experience, modeling cities costs tons of time, energy and money, yet none of it is used.  All their hard work is impressive, so odd that so little if any of the scenery created is used, but feels nice knowing when looking at the details that they did put alot of love into it, the "devil" is in the details.

What's even more disapointing is that there is only two actual story missions in the game, those being the tutorial at the begining, and the final boss. Everything else is filler.

Apparently, the supreme devil has been quite impressed with the legions of creatures killed by the boss of the Third Street Saints in all of the previous games in the series, so he abducts him in an attempt to find a suitable match for his rebellious daughter, Jezebel.As you can imagine, this doesn't exactly sit right with the rest of the Saints, particularly with Johnny Gat, who got saved by the boss in Saints Row 4. As such, alongside birthday girl Kinzie, they go to hell to rescue their friend and put a stop to Satan's plans.\nThe whole plot is hilarious from beginning to end and hell is filled with all sorts of outlandish characters, from famous Romanian count Vlad the Impaler to Blackbeard and even Shakespeare. Throw in plenty of characters from previous games in the series, not to mention other original NPCs, and you're in for plenty of laughs while completing Gat out of Hell.There are also different endings that are possible in the campaign, and there are some great things to explore in terms of story, even if it can be completed in several hours.\nIn terms of gameplay, the new title retains the core mechanics seen in previous Saints Row games, but as you can imagine, even more outlandish mechanics are present. Sure, you can still roam around the world using your own two feet or cars that you jack from damned souls throughout hell, but the main addition to the recipe is flight.Soon after you reach hell, you get your hands on Satan's broken halo, which allows you to sprout wings, and provided that you upgrade them by collecting orbs scattered across the inferno, you can develop your ability to fly.\nThe actual mechanic feels really good and makes traversing the environment much easier, just like super speed or super jumps transformed Saints Row 4, and they're both present in this new one. Of course, there are also plenty of other elements, including crazy vehicles like a chair fitted with two gatling guns, weapons that fire locusts, and other things. Special powers from blasts to foot stomps or auras are also present, which also helps keep gameplay quite varied.\nThe environment is all new this time around, instead of recycling the same city seen in Saints Row 3 or 4. Hell is an atmospheric place and this is obvious almost in all areas, not to mention in the different creatures scattered around the place. Special flight paths, visible in the Hellblazer activity, do much to highlight the environmental design, as you fly through holes in buildings or tunnels through the ground.\nLike previous games, you can play Saints Row: Gat out of Hell with a friend online via the cooperative mode. One will play as Johnny while the other controls Kinzie. While in the single-player mode, you can freely swap between them as there's no gameplay distinction.\nSaints Row: Gat out of Hell looks good, largely thanks to the atmospheric design of hell and the many new creatures scattered around it. Even so, it still suffers from some low-res textures, and some character models are in dire need of an update. Fortunately, the framerate is rock solid, even in hectic scenes.\nThe soundtrack is impressive, as with past games in the series, and although there aren't any radio stations this time around, the voice acting is top-notch, as Daniel Dae Kim reprises his role as Johnny Gat, while the rest of the cast does a fantastic job.\nSaints Row: Gat out of Hell is a welcome entry in the series. It takes things to new heights in terms of story, while adding a few impressive gameplay mechanics, such as the flight one. There aren't that many different missions and the environment is a bit small, but don't forget that the game costs 20 USD/EUR, so don't expect a full-fledged experience.","February 13, 2015","true","77.7"," 55 of 73 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","55","73","6","2"

If you enjoyed Saints Row IV you will also enjoy this short expansion.\n\nI'm writting this strictly under the line set ever since SR3 was out, because that's when the Saints Row franchise jumped completelly out of the GTA like type of story telling and into overdosed craziness and hilariousness.\n\n\nPROS\n✔ Hilarious script writing as always. The game stays true to the new humor stadarts set ever since Saints Row 3 was out and keeps it up to the very weird crazy level that suits.\n✔ You get to have parodies, easter eggs and references here as well. The whole game is like a reference to teh Constantine movie and there's some hilarious Disney parody hidden in it, I should let you fidure out the rest.\n✔ If you liked SR4 and the special powers concept then you will love this as almost all of the skills you had exist here as well but this time with difference forms/ effects/ visuals and animations (for example you get to fly with wings instead of gliding).\n✔ You get to play as Kinzie and Gat (can choose between any of the two) and it's not a bad chance of pace.\n✔ Story makes little sense but keeps you interested enough to go on, like a Saints Row game should.\n✔ You character, sadly only existing in cincematics, is imported without the need of connecting to online community, which shows that the developers are now able to auto-import your character into a different installation.\n\nCONS\n✖ The game is pretty short. Was able to do all missions and side quests in a bit less than 6 hours and took some extra time to roam around and see what I can do for challenges, my interest for which quickly fade away due to repetiveness.\n\nMIXED\n☢ The price is not fair for what the game has to offer. Must get it during special offers.\n☢ This game felt a bit needless to have come out as a different title. It's nice but it feels more like a way to support the developers. And I gladly did, but I would also like it if this was possible to appear as a special DLC mission inside the SR4 game instead of a different title (not even sure if it would change much).\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nI loved it. If you loved the crazyness of Saints Row IV then get this and have some more fun.\nOf course it has nothing to do with traditional sandbox gang war gaming so be sure to buy this while knowing what youa re getting into. It's a 7/10 for me, recommended to try, and defo worth checking during special offers.\nI really wonder about where this franchise can go next. I kinda wish to see something like SR3 again. SR4 was nice but having super powers during 80% of the game makes it meaningless to enjoy romaing around the city and pay attention to vehicles and their customizations.\nI wanna see more from where SR3 came from and I wish to see that overdose of easter eggs, parodies and references again.\n","July 9, 2015","true","6.6"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","44","55","3","0"

You still can't finish Saints Row IV in co-op without the game entering an infinite loading loop that you have to attempt to find your own workaround for fruitlessly, and end up settling for finishing single player instead.\nThis game is even more unstable than SR IV. The first Fraud mission cannot be completed in co-op, with 5+ attempts, after a certain amount of time (not enough to actually complete the mission) we would disconnect every time. Regardless of what we did.\nWhile playing in the open world, aside from situations where you're standing in a handful of buildings, there is no music. Nothing. No radio stations for cars, which might have something to do with re-licensing or licensing new songs; but also, no original soundtrack while you're out exploring Hell. None of the character customization has carried over, either, which I guess is to be expected since this is a standalone game rather than DLC. To progress the "story", you complete side-mission after side-mission - side-missions that existed in previous games, SR3 and SR IV, but in Gat Out of Hell, they are forced if you want to progress the story's cutscenes. Side-missions are way more enjoyable for me when they're not forced, and you can do them at your own pace. I also like side-missions in co-op. But unfortunately, it's hit or miss whether or not the game will remain stable enough to let you finish the mission with your partner.\nThere was also an instance of my co-op partner randomly jumping inside of a wall, and out of bounds, just by attempting to fly. He remained stuck there until I was able to trigger a mission which teleported him elsewhere.\nThe game's also crashed a couple of times. I have 4 hours on record and I've already encountered enough issues to make me put it down.\nI'm very glad I didn't pay for this myself (a friend gifted it to me, and I feel terrible for him for spending the money), because I don't feel like this game is even remotely worth the $20 price. I'd have more faith (or any hope period) for a patch to address these issues if I hadn't experienced Saints Row IV, and its lack of patches to address game-breaking issues that have been present since release.\nIf you want a fun Saints Row game, I recommend Saints Row: The Third. Even Saints Row IV is alright, if you're okay with some co-op instability every now and then, and being unable to finish the final mission with your partner. Just don't touch this.\nThat's my recommendation.","January 25, 2015","false","3.9"," 78 of 121 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","78","121","2","6"

Firstly, I will start off with what I liked:\n\n+Flight is much more enjoyable than in Saints row IV\n+Even though most of the powers are the same, they changed them up enough that combat felt different\n+Cool new weapons\n+Musical\n+Decent Story\n+Saints Row humor\n\nNow for the sad truth. Those positives were not enough. Flight was fun, but Saints Row isn't a flight simulator. I enjoyed the new guns and powers, but I don't play Saints Row for the combat (that's why I play Dark Souls.) The story was fine, and as always I enjoyed the satirical humor of the Saints Row games, but the story was far too short (less than 4 hours froms start to finish) and so there wasn't that much humor. It's hard to have many funny moments when the game itself doesn't have very moments at all. The musical scene was fantastic, but it was just one scene with a single reference later. The missions themselves were never bad, but they didn't impress either. Saints Row has always been good at steadily building up the craziness and zaniness so that every time you think you've seen it all, something new leaves you wondering. With Gat out of Hell, it feels like they through everything they had into the setting and the single musical scene. Once you accept the fact that you're in hell and have powers, the game doesn't really have any more surprises.\n\nIf you're not like me and get your enjoyment from being a completionist, then this game may keep you interested, but I had trouble staying interested in a game that seemed terrified of trying anything new. The game is cheaper, but even with its low price, I wouldn't say it's worth it until it goes on sale for 75% off. It is being sold as a third of a Saints Row Game, but in terms of content it has less than a fifth.","May 3, 2015","false","4.4"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","29","38","0","0"

Might have spoilers, watch out!\n\nSaints Row: Gat out of Hell is just a standalone/expansion game of Saints Row 4. It doesn't really has a long story line. You can easily finish the main quests in 4 hours or less.\n\nTechnically, it's just a continuation of SR4. The Saints are celebrating Kinzie's birthday. As a birthday game, they played ouija and asked some questions. Shaundi asked the board who's gonna marry the President. The board answered Jezebel. The President got sucked by a portal from hell. Now, Johnny Gat and Kenzie must save the President. That's about it. Nothing special.\n\nProsYou can fly now (Lucifer's Angel Wings)\nYou still have your super powers\nYour favorite activities are present\nConsGlitches!\nYou can only play Johnny or Kenzie\nNo Customization or whatsoever\nNo On-Foot radio station (You can use a mod if you really want an On-Foot Radio Station. Just ask me, or google it!)\n"Hell" looks like Steelport\nFinal verdict: Don't expect too much. It's just like a mini version of Saints Row 4. But I think, you're still gonna have some fun playing it. If you really want this, just buy it on sale.

I'd say it takes only a few hours to complete. This makes me a little bit sad because I value the main story just as much as all the open-world gameplay that comes along with the game.\n\nThe challenges weren't too bad. Nothing too grindy or tedious.\n\nCars have become even more useless due to superpowers. I would really like to see them enhanced in future installments. It also kinda sucks that you can't collect cars anymore or that there weren't that many vehicle types.\n\nThe new-ish map design is pretty damned cool. I enjoy looking over New Hades just to see how each quarter of the map is unique.\n\nAs you can see, the game has its ups and downs. It's still a good Saints Row, just not enough Saints Row.

I get the impression that this was made because Deep Silver wanted new content for the XBO/PS4 versions of SR4 and gave Volition/High Voltage 10 months and a shoestring budget to do it.\n\nInstead of having set missions, basically the game gives you a new city with a collection of side missions, and once you do enough you trigger events that advance the plot.  This isn't inherently a bad thing, since some of these side missions (like the Hellblazing races and the Torment Fraud minigame) are a lot of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/301910/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Saint's Row: Gat Out of Hell is the newest installment of the Saint's Row Franchise. It is a standalone expansion to Saint's Row IV, and as such shares a lot of similarities with it, mainly the gameplay and superpowers.\n\nLet's get the obvious question out of the way: you do not need to have Saint's Row IV installed to play, although Gat Out of Hell will automatically detect a Saint's Row IV savefile on your system and import your custom Boss into the game for use in cutscenes.\n\nThe story begins right where Saint's Row IV leaves off. Having conquered Simulation 31 and taken down the Zin Empire, the Saints are now living aboard their "borrowed" spaceship which now houses the entirety of whats left of the human race.  We are introduced to Kinzie's birthday party, where Matt is getting the Saints to try out a Quija Board. Spoilers aside, this does not go well and a portal straight to Hell opens up and drags the Boss in. Johnny Gat and Kinzie decide to go in after him.\n\nWithout spoiling too much more, I will say that this game is still as fun to play as previous Saint's Row titles. You can expect your fair share of awesome weapons, including many themed after the 7 Deadly Sins. My favorite of these are the Diamond Gun that literally shoots diamonds (Greed) and the recliner mounted with a chaingun and rocket launchers (Sloth).\n\nThere is a brand-new map with plenty of the usual diversions and activites to participate in aside from the main story. Many of the activites from Saint's Row IV return, but with their own Hellish flair. For example: Trailblazing is now Hellblazing, requiring you to fly through orbs and checkpoints to complete it. Rather than a traditional progression of missions, Gat out of Hell has players completing diversions and causing general chaos in an effort to raise the level of a meter called Satan’s Wrath. Once certain milestones are met on the meter, a cutscene is triggered. The game turns into a musical at times during these scenes, which may be quite enjoyable for some as they are played out in fully-voiced cutscenes with decent dance and lyrics.\n\nSuperpowers return from IV, and they’re upgraded by collecting Soul Clusters that are scattered around hell. Most are returning powers (blast, stomp, aura) with some new elemental powers, but Summon is exclusive to Gat out of Hell. Depending on which variant you use, it allows you to recruit imps to your side, make towers explode out of the ground, or produce a giant demonic ally.\n\nAll of this is fine and dandy, as the game is such a blast to play, but fans of the franchise may be disappointing in the omission of certain features that have long been established in the series. For one, since you play as either Johnny Gat or Kinzie Kinsington, you are pretty much stuck with the outfit they have by default. There are no clothing stores in hell. Also omitted was the ability to whip out a cell phone and have an ally deliver a vehicle to you. This isn't too big of an issue, as you can at anytime sprout wings and fly wherever you need to go. Flying controls are pretty smooth, with upgrades allowing more refined control while in-flight. And finally, there are no "home bases" to upgrade or radio stations while driving, not even an option to import music from your PC to use in-game.\n\nGat Out of Hell isn't a long game, and as a standalone expansion I didn't expect it to be. After about 2 hours of play my save completion percentage read a modest 45%. Gat Out of Hell delivers what you'd expect from the Saint's Row franchise, just in a smaller package. Overall, it is worth shelling out the asking price of $19.99, especially if you are a long-time fan.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382549789\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 20, 2015","true","22.8"," 36 of 59 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","36","59","4","0"

If SR4 was a game you enjoyed, go ahead an get this one, it's just as wild and crazy. The Boss has been kidnapped by Satan and taken to hell to marry his daughter, so Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington go after him/her. To get Satan to confront the duo, you have to destroy hell to get his attention.  A pretty thin story, but it works well as an excuse for raising hell all over hell.\n\nA number of old characters return, like the DeWynter sisters (SR3) and Dane Vogel (SR2). There are some new characters too, like Vlad the Impaler, Blackbeard, and Shakespeare. Oddly, though, they're not recruited as homies, only as “allies.” Single-player Gat Out of Hell is a solitary effort. And short. Others have claimed 6 hours for completing the story; I took 8, but that's still a quarter of the size of the other Saints Row games (maximum level is 20). If you want to bring the game to 100%, getting all the collectibles and completing all the activities, there's a lot to do, but the game devolves into a collect-a-thon at that point.\n\nSuper powers return; Stomp, Minion-summon, Aura, and Blast each have three elements to choose from. The geography of  hell is new. Most of the activities are back, though in some new forms. Insurance Fraud is now about removing years off of souls' sentences in hell; when Adrenaline Mode is active, there is an explosive fire effect that can really heat things up. One of the best parts of Gat Out of Hell is the flying, which is good because you'll be doing a lot of it. The weapons are also a highlight; shooting frosting at enemies to make them attack each other? Yes, please. Shooting love dust at enemies to make them break into a sexy dance (even the titans)? Oh, yeah. If there is a downside, it's that the game is easy, even on the hardest difficulty.\n\nI had fun with Gat Out of Hell; Johnny was missing for most of Saints Row 3 and half of Saints Row IV, so this game was like catching up with an old friend. No, you're not playing as the Boss, but “Who wouldn't want to be Johnny Gat?” - Johnny Gat.\n\nNote about Kinzie for single-players: you can play as Kinzie throughout the campaign and switch between her and Johnny whenever you want; you just have to return to the Ultor lobby to do so. For the final boss battle, though, you will play as Johnny; Kinzie enters the room, Johnny shows up, they high-five, and you play as Johnny for the boss battle. It is called Gat Out of Hell, after all.","January 4","true","28.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

Sadly it doesn't live up to the hype, nor is it worth the $20 price tag.\n\nLet's get the good out of the way first:\nFlying is friggin awesome.  I can't wait for it to be ported into SR:IV\nThe musical cutscene.\n\nThe bad: (There is a LOT)\nThe game takes away your ability to easily fly rather early in the form of anti-air towers.  You can destroy these, but it's a pain.\nKinzie. She only has a few dozen lines of dialog and the game always refers to her as Gat during the missions and cutscenes.\nThe mission system. Doing ANY mission advances the story bar.  Once it reaches the end you have free roam back again, but if you're in the middle of a mission and trigger it a cutscene immediately plays. I was going to call it a fluke but it happened with EVERY transition.\nNo music. In a SR game.\nAll of the events are boring rehashes of main series events.  And since you can trigger the endgame without doing many of them, they are pretty pointless filler.\nFinally, the ending. It's a freaking "Choose the ending" choice that plays 20 second clips of the aftermath and the game is over.\n\nSo do I recommend it? Not at $20. $5 is completely acceptable and if you wait long enough it sure to drop to the 80%-90% range during a sale.  I had a couple really good laughs with the game, but a couple good laughs to an otherwise boring game don't save it.","January 29, 2015","false","3.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","16","23","3","1"

Instead, most of the game are filler side missions, which you are probably already tired of doing when you completed SR4. Remember the well crafted missions back in SR3? Yeah there's none of that.\n\nHow about the soundtrack that made SR3 and SR4? Which song is this game's "Holding Out for a Hero" or "The Touch"? Well...there's not a single song in this game, all you hear is ambient noise and explosion most out of the time.\n\nAs for the superpowers, Blast, Buff and Stomp are basically the same, Teleknesis got replaced with Summon. Super Sprint is exactly the same as before. The only thing really new to this game is that you can flap your wings to fly instead of gliding in SR4. I admit I really enjoy it.

So don't be confused that you only got 6 powers now.\n\nIn the end, all you've got is a sandbox that's less interesting that Steelport in SR3/4 and a game that lacks the production quality of SR3/4.\n\nI know that this game is an expansion standalone. You shouldn't except too much from it. But Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was also standalone, look at what UBISOFT did with that game?

There’s only a few of them. The majority of the game is about side missions and collectibles. Fortunately those are all well done. I give them a pass because of just how limited of an audience they were aiming at with this. This isn’t Saints Row 5, this is fan service. And as that, it does its job well.

It is true that the game consists solely of side missions, with each set getting you closer to a cut scene that progresses the story along. The main campaign can easily be beaten in 4-5 hours of gameplay, although the game will hit the end credits before you run out of things to do in the city.

The superpowers are both more overpowered and less enjoyable to use than the SR4 counterparts. Flight being introduced very earlier in the game as a major transport mechanic relying on your stamina. However the missions are very unvaried and quite linear, short and really shouldn't be counted as a storyline, more so a forced interaction with the various side missions (also less interesting variants of their SR4 counterparts, save one where you fly around saving souls from being damned or rising to the heavens [makes little sense, but it is SR so that is a minor part].) Cutscenes are void of existance with replacements being offered in the form of a story board with narration. If this is what we are to expect from Deep Silver with the Saints Row franchise, expect to be dissappointed with no real progression, consistant repetition, little explanation and near zero of the classic SR humor found so commonly in SR2 and SR:TT. Overall Saints Row: Gat out of Hell was a money grabbing release, offering no real improvement to the base game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unseatingkdawg/recommended/301910/","unseatingkdawg","UnseatingKDawg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unseatingkdawg/","166 products in account","Personally, I found this expansion to be enjoyable, but with some flaws.  While I had no crashing or glitching problems (the game ran pretty smoothly for me, actually), I didn't care for a few features, such as the following:\n\n-Lack of Story - While the story isn't bad, it isn't fleshed-out enough.  There could've been a lot more put into the story, like more detailed legacy missions (like in Saints Row IV, for example).  What irks me further is that certain characters from past games do make appearances in cutscenes near the end of the game, which could've been made into more missions (I won't delve into too many details since I don't want to spoil).\n\n-Certain Challenges/Achievements - By this point, why would we necessarily need to drive a vehicle?  We have the ability to run faster than nearly every vehicle driving around, not to mention we can fly anywhere we wish.  I also don't like how the monster trucks handle - they're very unwieldly, at least to me.  I also don't even know how to ride a car on a comet - they don't exactly explain that to you in the game.\n\n\nWell, that's what I didn't like.  Here's what I did like:\n\n-Playing as Johnny Gat - Always did want to play as him.  Sure, there's no customization, but Johnny is just awesome in action.  I also like how he slices and dices enemies with his knives.  That was a nice touch.  Most of his commentary blurbs are pretty funny too.\n\n-Weapons - While I didn't care for certain weapons (such as Last Supper), I really like some of the deadly weapons and plague-related weapons - specifically, the Armchair-A-Geddon, the Exodus 10, the Lil' Croaker, the Gods Hammer, and the Gallows Dodger.  They cause so much carnage!\n\n-Arcane Powers  - I do like what they've done with twisting the powers from Saints Row IV - such as turning enemies to stone, making them bow before you, and creating a vacuum by stomping the ground which sucks in all loose currency lying around.  Watching Imps tackle demons is great too - especially when you decide to blow them up.\n\n-Flying - Oh my God, FLYING.  It's great!  A lot better than SRIV's gliding setup, and its exhilirating.  The wings' look is just icing on the cake.  It's the quickest way to travel in any Saints Row game too, aside from warping using towers.\n\n-Location - While I didn't have a problem with Steelport being in Saints Row IV (I liked exploring and seeing the differences Zinyak put in), New Hades is a nice change.  Sure, it's not as big, but it's something new to explore.  I like all the sadistic stuff too - like the High Fryer Ferris Wheel, for example.  Really makes it feel like you're in a godforsaken place.\n\n-Carnage - Blowing people (well, husks) and demons up is a great way to relieve stress.\n\n\nIn all, I'd recommend this game, if not for the story, but for the gameplay.  There's plenty of carnage to be had, and it's a good expansion to Saints Row IV.  $20 is a tad steep though - I'd say $10-$15 would be a bit more resonable.  Make of that what you will.","January 26, 2015","true","22.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/301910/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nSaints Row: Gat out of Hell is a Open World, Third-Person Shooter developed by Deep Silver Volition and released in 2015. You will probably fall into one of two camps: "Camp: Gat out of Hell is the same as Saints Row IV, therefore I dislike it" or "Camp: Gat out of Hell is very similar to Saints Row IV, I liked Saints Row IV, therefore I like this game".\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nIf you were not a fan of the Saints Row Series, you very well might utter the phrase "Burn in Hell Saints!" ...that or if you were eavesdropping on Roman Emperor Nero. (what's that? no religion jokes, oops) Well this game is the almost literal manifestation of that phrase.\nThe saints started out as a simple street gang, became public figures, became  politicians, and the boss became the president of the United States. Then Earth was destroyed and they are now in space! you very well might be asking "well, where else can they go? What else can they do?" Enter the Super Natural.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=644803840\n\nGameplay: Just between you and me, I feel like Gat out of Hell is more of a collectathon then "third-person shooter" or "open world", but you don't NEED to collect all the things, there's just a lot to collect to 100% the game. Basically you land in Hell, need to screw around, blow up all the things, do some activities... really you can do whatever you want to ♥♥♥♥ Satan off, once you've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ him off enough you can enter the final confrontation, and tada, games over!\nBeing an overachiever, there's more to the game for me: I need to unlock all the achievements, get 100% completion, all of that jazz. So for completionists whom enjoy open world games, or just liked the Saints Row IV style, this game is enjoyable.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626781467\n\nThe controls are the same, the powers are almost cookie cutter, (the colors are anyway), you have a thrown super power, a summon super power, a stomp super power, and aura super power. The most notable change to this game is the addition of flight. Instead of "jumping" upgrades, you get wings and get to fly around.\nI happened to have "must play flight simulator game" in my blood at the time that I was playing this, so I would fly around and make airplane noises and got quite a bit of enjoyment of trying to fly as fast as possible and dodge obstacles like a drunk buzzard flying a 747. (Yes, I went splat, and yes, it was very fun)\n\nAchievements: Most of the achievements in this game are easily doable, although some require a fair bit of work. Naturally you have your typical "unlock while you play" or "you can only miss this if you refuse to play normally" achievements.\nYou also have the "conditional achievements" which require special events, none are really noteworthy, the descriptions are all very self explanatory, (Shatter kill 100 demons, fly from the roof of the snowball's chance to sinisterpol HQ without touching the ground", "kill an arch duke with a melee attack" etc.)\nThankfully there's no "sync your character with our website which didn't work for the last two years", that was a load of (more complaints go here), but this seems to be a pretty doable 100%, I'll get back to you once I finish getting 100%. the toughest achievement seems to be "Complete ALL of the Challenges".\nUpdate 03/16/16: I successfully completed all the achievements for Saints Row Gat out of Hell, and my final conclusion about the achievements is "yeah, this is kinda what I expected".\nThe final few hours were rather boring, but I had already milked the game for all it was worth, thankfully I was able to pop a few extra achievements in between grinding sessions.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=646497736\n\nPrice: Saints Row: Gat out of Hell is priced at $14.99, those of you whom know my price/value model, I want an hour for every dollar, or at least a comparable substitution of replay value or enjoyment. To get 100% city take over and finish the game I spent 7 almost 8 hours.\nThat's close to matching the value, the best gauge is to ask yourself "did you like SR4" if the answer is yes, ask yourself "Do you want to play more SR4... but as Johnny Gat", if the answer is still yes; this game is for you.\n\nConclusion: Hey, there's an achievement for spending 20 hours in Hell. My point is that I'll definitely get my monies worth out of the game. Oh wait, this game was actually gifted to me by Angfucious, so it's actually HER monies worth (thanks for it by the way, we've enjoyed playing it co-op over twitch)\nQuestions to ask yourself: Did you like Saints Row IV? Do you like Johnny Gat? Do you like Kinzie Kensington? do you mind if the game is just about them? Do you have 7 hours to play through a game? If you say 'yes' to most of these then you'll enjoy Saints Row: Gat out of Hell.

Gat Out of Hell plays very similarly to SR4, so if you weren't a fan of beating everything to a pulp in some of the most comical/creative ways possible, this game isn't for you. Sorry. Also, because of that fact, there will be more than a few comparisons between the two games.\n\n\nCONS:\n\nStarting with drawbacks, the game is, as probably expected, very short. Runs from beginning to end can take as little as 5-7 hours, tops (unless you're an achievement hunter). The same amount of time would translate to roughly 40% in its predecessor, just to put things into perspective.\n\nThe final boss fight against Big Red was, in a way, less intense than the Zinyak fight due to the fact he can be stunlocked. Yes, the Devil himself can be kept from doing ANYTHING. The Archdukes of Hell put up more of a fight than this guy, and to be perfectly honest, that's a little sad.\n\nLack of customizable weapons. In hindsight, this is more of a nitpick than a legitimate critique given the location, but a little creativity beyond the "fire and brimstone" themed weapons would have been nice.\n\n\nPROS:\n\nWhile the game is short, it is VERY fast-paced. Depending on whether or not you like a little breathing room between missions, the side activities have you tearing up Hell in a way no one could do in the Simulation. I often found myself content with dodging missiles in mid-flight (improvement from the UFO laser blasts while gliding).\n\nPowers make an encore with a vengeance. Instead of doing homie missions to unlock the next element, you're encouraged to go out with what you have to activate the next one, get a crash course in using your new ability against waves of enemies that CAN kill you (no safe zones in Hell, genius), rinse and repeat. Oh so satisfying.\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins - weaponized. Haven't found them all yet myself, but this was a large part of what sold for me during the trailer. Name at LEAST two other games that let you kick back in a virtual recliner and blow the s*** out of stuff.\n\nClever writing is not lost here! Thank God! Seriously, find as many of Satan's "Orientation Books for the D***ed" as you can. Just do it. Oh, and something about a musical...?\n\nFinally, next to being able to play as Kinzie and Gat at anytime, is flight. Admittedly, it takes some getting used to, and feels a little clunky early on, but with practice and the Manuevering upgrade, you'll not want to go back to gliding anytime soon. Not to mention it makes collecting the Soul Clusters that much more fun.\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 8.3/10 Would fly again. (Please turn to page 528).\n\n\n/EDIT/: Plus, shawarma after. /EDIT/","January 21, 2015","true","37.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","0"

Not to say its bad...."If it ain't broke then don't fix it". However for this game the standards are slipping now, you could complete the game in under an hour and even then I wouldn't be surprised you can go below 30 mins. The game is really REALLY small and empty with most (95% of the game) being a "collect all 9999 bla-blas".\n\nEven though its so small I admit its still really relaxing and fun to fly around and collect the Soul clusters, and I got to give credit to only charging half of normal game's price so I cant give it a bad review for that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/recommended/301910/","xpliciit","Xpliciit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/","178 products in account","First of all before i go into the review for this game i just want to put a couple of things out there. When this game was announced i was actually super hyped because i loved Saints Row 2, 3 & 4 and i had been excited to play it ever since. I ended up buying this game recently during the Steam Summer Sale 2015 at 50% off (£7.49) and because i had not looked into this game very much except seeing it announced plus a trailer, i wasn't aware that this was actually a Standalone DLC for Saints Row 4.\n\nSo the review, unaware that this is Standalone DLC i jump into the game and start the story and it has all the usual Saints Row characters and humor etc etc. I found that incredibly early into the game you were able to fly assuming you have the stamina (which is upgradable in the exact same manner as Saints Row 4) so i was free to do whatever i wanted in this openworld City inside Hell and im able to fly.\n\nThe first thing i see to do is collect Soul Clusters which are also the same collectables found in Saints Row 4 (possibly with different name, i can't remember) and i decide to collect all of the visible ones of these while flying around exploring Hell.  After collecting in the region of 300 of these Soul Clusters (out of 940) i had also found a couple of Audio Tomes which are humorous audio logs from some of the characters within the game including Satan.\n\nI was then pulled unwillingly into a story mission due to having ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Satan enough for the story to progress. I won't spoil all the details for this game but to give you an idea as to where this is going, i had around 920 Soul Clusters just from flying around right off the bat when i was able to finally shoot Satan in the face thus ending the story for this game. At this point i thought to myself 'is that it for the story?', so in total i think there were around 5 story missions.\n\nThis for me was mildly disappointing but there is so much else still to do within the game such as collecting all the Audio Tomes, Soul Clusters and also Commentaries (similar to Audio Tomes but for the TWO playable characters - Gat & Kinzie). Plus there are challenges, activities and achievements to complete, which for me has taken 28 hours of taking my time while playing. Having read various comments and reviews both during and after this time, it seemed some people were able to achieve around 97% in about 6 hours, but im assuming this is mostly 100% takeover of the city by completing activities and the main story missions since the collectables and challenges were only a couple of percentage.\n\nA couple of things i should also note is that the highest level you can achieve in this is 20 and considering i put 28 hours into this first playthrough i could have achieved level 50+ since i hit level 20 so early into the game. Also one of the challenges in the game is to upgrade ALL of your weapons to maximum capabilities, which is fine but the only way you seem to be able to make enough money late game is to kill enemies over and over again because either there arn't enough paying story missions or activities or the upgrades cost too much. So i spent alot of time after completing the story and activities killing enemies for all the challenges and to make enough wages to spend on upgrades.\n\nSaints Row: Gat Out of Hell is also the first game in the series that allows you to play as more than one character. You can switch between either Johnny Gat & Kinzie Kensington as often as you like, both of these characters also have their own commentaries which are quite funny to hear.\n\nThe upgrade system for both Health, Stamina etc and Arcane Powers are exactly the same as the previous game which for me is a bonus because it works really well and the prices for each of the upgrades is very well balanced for the length of the game. The powers themselves from what i can remember of playing Saints Row 4 are fairly similar but i feel like i had alot more fun playing through this game with these powers and even game myself a mighty shock at one point using summoning powers, which made me literally laugh at myself not realising what i had done. The powers do seem more powerful than the previous game too but having used all of them for completing all the challenges i think they work really well for the game.\n\nAll in all, for the price i paid and unaware until pretty much after completing the story, that this was Standalone DLC, if you are a fan of the previous Saints Row games i think this is a fantastic game despite how short it might be and i would definitely recommend it.","June 28, 2015","true","43.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

New Hades (aka Hell) is a decent size and very diverse city to explore with a ton of side quests and collectables to find. the story is a little bit on the short side but is still pretty good and there is multiple endings for replayability. the gameplay is mostly the same from SR4 but has been slightly refined and unlike SR4 New Hades was designed with your superpowers in mind unlike Steelport so you find yourself generally having a little more fun using them in this game.\n\nit is true however that most of the well known Saints Row features have been stripped from this game like character customization, editing the characters apparel, car customizations, radio, etc... and it is a slight bummer but I won't dock it any points for that, this isn't a full-fledged $60 dollar Saints Row game. for only asking $20 bucks I don't think they could've financially afford to have things like music considering everything that you already get in this game and as the game is about playing as Johnny Gat, character customization and apparel don't really make that much sense. all in all I think for what you get it is definitely worth the asking price and I would recommend picking this game up if you're a fan of the new crazy Saints Rows.\n\nFinal Score: (7/10) Good :)","April 28, 2015","true","22.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's not meant to be a full game, and it could have, very well, just been released as a DLC for SRIV.  The primary reason that this is not simply a DLC is (in my opinion obviously) because you will not be playing the character that you were using in SRIV.  You are playing as either Gat or Kinzie.  Likewise, you will not be using the same powers as you did from SRIV.  While some of the powers are very similar to what they are in IV, they are very different from them in most regards.\n\nSo, here are the things that I liked.  Running around as Kinzie or Gat is fun, simply put.  They have interesting quips they spout as you play through the game; they are always characters that have interested me.  The powers are also really well done and allow you a lot of diversity in how you can play.  Unlike SRIV where I question why they bothered putting some powers in the game at all, none of these feel like they are useless.  I have found a purpose for every power in the game and I like that.  The array of weapons you can choose from is also very interesting.  Unlocking the 7 deadly sins weapons was fun and now they are pretty much my favourite weapons in most cases.  If you are familiar with the gameplay of SRIV, you'll find a lot of the same here, though the ability to fly for as long as you want once you max out the flight powers is really nice.  Lastly, the game is only twenty freaking dollars.  Anyone complaining about a AAA title at this price is an idiot, quite frankly.  The game is very well done and is well worth the price.\n\nMoving on from the things I like, I'll now cover the things that I think could have been done better but didn't really mind.  The dialogue and story for this game is, understandably, short of SRIV.  The reason for that, I believe, would be because SRIV set a really high bar and it would be difficult to reach that again without a good bit of effort.  While some effort clearly could have been spared, I wouldn't say the dialogue is terrible.  A little bit of a spoiler, there is a musical scene in the game that is fantastic and I really wish that they'd done more with that.  It was a really welcomed break from the usual blatantly foul language that persists through the franchise.  The lack of music in the game to listen to while driving around is disappointing, but I have plenty of music of my own to listen to and this does, actually spare me from having to listen to the same songs over and over again, or just listening to one radio station because I don't like the music on the rest.  While it would have been really nice to customize Gat and Kinzie's clothes, I think that would have distracted from the game and I'm fine with it not being in the game.  It would have really been nice to get to use more of the characters as you progressed through the game, such as being able to take the war on Satan as the DeWintre sisters or even Jezebel.  DLC perhaps?  No homies to join your cause, but they'd be more of a burden since you can freely fly around and they wouldn't be able to keep up.  I'm pretty sure a lot of the dead Saints are down there, though.\n\nThings I didn't like about the game.  Really, there's not much.  I didn't like that you couldn't do any sort of vehicle customization, though you'll rarely want to touch a car anyway since you can fly around at will.  No garage or headquarters was kind of annoying as well.  Starting locations were arbitrary when you died, either at the Ultor building or some spot on a different island that wasn't always clear as to why you started there.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the forces of hell is entirely too easy and in the early stages of a (hardcore) game, you are super squishy and very likely to die before accomplishing anything signficant.  There are only 20 character levels, so the stuff you can level up ramps from really weak in the lower levels to really strong later one.  The price jump between levels of abilities is hefty enough that you most likely won't have bought everything by time you finish the storyline unless you are just grinding for cash.  Just playing through the story and doing the loyalty missions, I reached level 20 long before the end of the game, but not before dying a whole lot before I reached level 8, where many of the better abilities start to unlock.\n\nHope you find this review helpful.  I did enjoy the game, and the shortcomings of this title weren't significant enough to make me unable to have fun, just not as much or engaging as it could have been.  Was I disappointed?  Mildly so.  It could have been more, but it wasn't.  I don't regret making this purchase though and hope that it will be expanded favourably with good and affordable DLC.","January 31, 2015","true","31.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

With only half a dozen or so actual missions which fly by in no time, thoroughly pointless loyalty missions, and literally hundreds of mindless collectables littered around the city, this feels like Padding: The Game.\n\nWhile the chatter around the future of Saints Row has been "should the series go back to basics and ditch the super powers and zaniness?", I believe the question really needs to be "should there be any more Saints Row at all?"\n\nAll I know is that this game got numerous sequels after the shitful first game, yet Volitions 'other' game Freespace only had two releases in total.

However, it has it's own flavor despite having less customization with the characters.\n\nThe story works like SR4. You do the "games" to finish quests. Some of them are only unlocked during the quests themselves. The combat is similar and there are basic human style weapons in addition to the demonic guns available.\n\nKind of sad I didn't get to bring my own character over and can't change clothes, but the rest is what I loved about SR4.\n\nMinor Spoiler:\nIf you have a save from SR4 (or possibly the game still installed), it will bring your character over for the cut-scenes.\n\nThe game is supposed to be shorter then SR4 (rumor is five hours) but we will see. I'll update this when I finish the game as well as post the stats.\n\nFinished! Game took about 5 hours of play, on easy with 83% of the content completed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/recommended/301910/","Auburok","Auburok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/","581 products in account","Playing this cooperatively was almost a complete disaster. If it wasn't for LAN, I'd never have been able to do most of the coop we managed to squeeze out of this game. You see, Gat Out of Hell has a weird issue. At least for me, anyway. Every time I play it with coop enabled, it literally chokes out my online connection multiple times. My connection will try to struggle and crawl its way back to Steam, but Gat Out of Hell drags the connection back into the bowels of my home network, pummeling the everloving ♥♥♥♥ out of it until the connection gets brave again and tries to leave the abusive relationship. The problem is so intensely bad that the connection ♥♥♥♥ing stutters in a LAN setting.\n\nNot a single other title I have does this. I've never had a game put down an iron curtain over my net connection before. There's a ton of other bugs on top of this, but realistically we don't know if this was due to the terrible netcode, or from the game's mechanics.\n\nOn to the actual game. First off, it's short. We're talking maybe 7 hours tops to do everything in coop, and that's if you're collecting all the books and ♥♥♥♥ without using the collectable finder. The story is typical for the franchise, though I get from the writing that they are getting bored of the Saints, at least with how things are going. I can imagine it's hard to top being the POTUS and battling aliens and losing Earth. Hell is a really cool setting, but they really didn't add a whole lot of detail. There's nothing to do outside of the basic activities on the map, you can't dress up Gat or Kinzie, you immediately have no reason to drive vehicles (you have more reason to avoid them; they all handle like buckets of ♥♥♥♥) and there isn't even much to look at. Many of the moments you'd expect to be thunderclaps of eye-candy or something end up as written pages narrated in a story. In fact, the main improvement over SR4 is how flying works. Flying is great. It's fun, it's better than gliding in SR4. Aside from the fun weapons, there's not a whole lot new here.\n\nGat Out of Hell seems highly derivative of SR2 in story, but I wouldn't be able to confirm it, because I've only played SR3 and SR4 aside from this. As a random person playing, I don't get Ultor, Dane, Dex, etc; they are just sort of thrown in and there's not a lot of reaction or fanfare in bringing out these previously established characters.\n\nI think I'll probably end up finishing the game, just to see if the massive amount of bugs was strictly from coop, but I wouldn't really recommend this game. Buy Saint's Row: The Third or Saint's Row IV instead, especially if you want any working coop in the first place.","July 16, 2015","false","26.5"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","13","23","3","1"

Compared to SRTT that is the best game of the series IMO, a major percentage of unfavourable gameplay details of SR IV can still be observed in this game, along with some new ones.\n\nFirst of all, there is no radio station.\n\nAs same as the gameplay style in SR IV, you even need not to use any motorized vehicle due to your wings' functionallity. Deep Silver had better give up getting the gameplay style of the SR series closer and closer to the Prototype series where Alex is the major winged hero flying and jumping between high-rise buildings. Most of players have been embracing the SR series as an unserious form of the GTA series.\n\nThe lack of the property of customizing our char and almost all NPCs' having the same model are two of the primary cons of the game.\n\nThe main story of the game can be said to be short. Like SR IV, there are plenty of boring side quests whose formations are almost the same: collecting specific items, getting rid of enemy waves etc., and getting why you're doing them seems so nonsensical. Just do them to increase the progress percentage within the gameplay, and maybe to gain the related achievements; nothing else!","January 30","false","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, if you're one to go for 100% then that also doesn't take much long\n\nThe cons of the game are probably related to the price.

All you do is side quest like jobs.  insurance fraud is replaced with a mode where you are a husk hitting cars for years of their torment instead of earning cash, Trailblazing is Hellblazing where you fly around in a point-to-point race and mayhem and survivals are the same as all the Saints row games.\n\nYou should know everything you need to know about this game if you played at least IV as its the same except shorter and a little more refined and as a result you should already know if you will like it and want if you played Saints Row IV and liked it.\n","January 24, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

It's a direct sequel to Saints Row IV and even reads your character file so the introduction has your old Saints Row IV character intact, including the voice you selected. This actually drew me in to the story quicker and was a nice touch.\n\nYou play as Johnny Gat (and possibly other characters as you're allowed to switch with Kinzie right from the get go) I'm certain at some point you'll have your old Saints Row IV character available to you.\n\nEither way, the game is mindless running around and slaughtering just like the previous games... nothing new here. They've adopted the "Super Hero" system from Saints IV so expect to be running up walls and flying over the map again. Run and do your fetch quests and level up Johnny to 20. Yes this time the level cap is set at 20, again this is a pocket version of Saints Row IV, so don't expect a lot of content.\n\nEven if the game does lack in variety and content when compared to the previous entries, the creativity of the plot doesn't get cut short. It's still a hilarious franchise and keeps on finding new ways to keep it feeling fresh... despite the aforementioned similarities.\n\nIt's basically Saints Row IV with a gothic theme. The weapons include locust swarm SMG's and Grenade Launchers that shoot out a plague of toads, it's all quite thematic and fun.\n\nI haven't played much of it but I've already ran in to Black Beard the pirate, William Shakespere and Vlad the Impaler (Dracula) as my first batch of homies to help out. So far I'm digging it. If you enjoyed Saints Row IV, you'll probably love this as well because it's more of the same, only different. I grabbed it for a small discount price and it's definitely worth the 20 dollar tag.","May 3, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

The gameplay is mostly the same as in SR4, you have similar super powers like stomp, aura and blast plus a new one where you call minions to aid you in battle. The powers have some new upgrades but nothing really new.\n\nNew Hades is dark and dirty, it looks a bit like Stilwater Shivington with occasional lightning crashes and explosios, cars blow up for no reason and all the inhabitans are husks, imitating peoples behaviours like sleeping on benches or standing at publich telephones and digging in trash cans.\n\nThe Boss looks just like you left him/her in SR4 and playing as Johnny Gat or Kinzie is really fun.\nYou cannot change their appearance or clothing.\n\nThe enemies are demons wich look a bit like the Zin from SR4, the big ones behave and look like Brutes from SR3. Also theres Minibosses similar to the Wardens from SR4.\n\nThe city is fun to explore especially when flying, but it is quickly done because most of the buildings have no insides. The plot is through in about 2 hours, the rest is just challenges (like kill 1000 demons with weapon xy).\n\nThere are some funny features like the Rambulance or Barnstorming locations (flying through tight spots) and a huge amout of collectables to find. But since this is just a big dlc and not SR5 it is not too bad, mostly a fan-thing you can play while you wait for the next part of Saints Row.\n\nSometimes the game stumbles over its own ideas, you hit start and it seems like after a few minutes everything and everyone bombs your picture. I activated three audio files at once accidently, one from Johnny, one from a weapon and one I collected without noticing.But this is not a bad thing, since the audio logs are stored in your menu.\n\nI strongly recommend to play the original SR (or watch a lets play) and SR2 first since there are many cameos you will not understand otherwise.\n\nSo, if you're a fan of the series and were happy with that turn SR did starting with part 3, you liked the super powers and silly stuff and you have some money left, go buy it.\n\nIf you liked the original Saints Row and SR2 as a GTA styled game better and hated all the new stuff, don't bother and go get GTA5.","January 24, 2015","true","18.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/recommended/301910/","strangemodule","strangemodule","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/","339 products in account","I liked Saints Row 3 and Saints Row 4 quite a bit, especially after playing through the game cooperatively with my boyfriend. After those game, I was on board with more hot SR gameplay! However, Gat out of Hell disappointed me greatly.\n\nBasically, Gat out of Hell consists entirely of those side activities you did for people in SR3/4. While SR4 had side quests done for people to get bonuses but also had unique main quests, this game has you doing ONLY side quests. The only real "unique" quests are when you rescue people who defy Satan, but these are short lived.\n\nYou do these in order to ♥♥♥♥ off Satan and get his attention, so you can draw him out to kick his ♥♥♥. The progress for this is shown on a meter on the TAB screen, and it fills as you do these quests as well as cause chaos around the town. Once you hit certain milestones, cutscenes play and things change slightly for the overworld. When the meter fills, you unlock the final mission, which is a boss fight against Satan. Beat it, you win the game.\n\nWhat I just said is hardly a summary. Side activities are ALL you do for the large chunk of this short game. If you've played SR3/4, you will recognize them because they're basically the same save for some slight modifications (Blazin', where you race through arrow checkpoints, now involves flying instead of sprinting).  The only three new side activities involve powering up an altar with one of your superpowers followed by a short hoard-mode sequence, one where you unlock teleport points by activiting statues then defeating a big brute enemy, and one Domination-style one where you must activate three zones to take over a building while preventing enemy minions from taking said zones back from you. These new activities still feel like retreads however, and lack much variety.\n\nSwitching gears to talk about some minor issues, there generally feels like a lack of care put into the game. The voice acting lacks any sort of enthusiasm or emotion, and the writing comes off as terse, even forced at times. When doing online coop, sometimes the activities would not activate for my coop buddy and required me to finish them (thankfully he still got the quest completed after I did it).\n\nWhat made me very sad is that this game just isn't funny, either in its written gags or visual jokes. I can only think of one moment that I found pretty amusing, but the rest of the game only has a few visual jokes (such as billboard ads or business name branding) and, as I mentioned before, poor writing and VA execution results in a lack of charm I've come to expect from the Saints Row games.\n\nThe streets of Hell do not excite in the least. The starting industrial area feels drab and lacking in life, and only really matters since that is where you start when you reload your save. The most interesting area has to be the market/amusement park/red light district New Hades, but even then it feels empty with little to do or see.\n\nLastly, and perhaps the thing that made me the saddest, must be the complete lack of customization! Gone are the various clothing stores, the taunts/complements, or even interesting vehicles to drive (save for a monster truck police vehicle). The only store provided consists of a vending machine that lets you buy ammo, upgrade weapons, and pay to get the Hell-cops off your back. It feels so impersonal and, adding with what I said about the writing, sucks a lot of charm that this series has.\n\nI really am disappointed. I feel like this game was made on a budget, which its default price reflects. However, I'd argue that the good kind of budget games are those that put a lot of polish, charm, and love into a small experience rather than a large, average but bland one. Unfortunately this game is the latter. If you've played SR3 and/or SR4, just avoid this game. If you haven't, go play both those games because they're fun, especially with a buddy to tag along!","July 8, 2015","false","4.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You will more than likely experience the game crashing consistently after the opening cutscene (which there are solutions online) and at the ending cutscene (This has no fix or solution currently available) which is stupid as you could not get a 100% completion of the game. I have tested this game on three different Windows computers and the same crashes still happens. There are currently no official solutions or fixes to these problems and the developers have apparently gave up on fixing this game! I would not recommend buying this game as it is a waste of money and time to play a broken game.\n\nIf not for it being a buggy mess, this game is actually quite fun and amusing. If you like saint rows 4 and it's super powers, Gat Out Of Hell offers pretty much the same experience as it has a few of the previous powers such as super sprint and super jump as well as multiple other new powers. This game was meant to be an expansion to saint rows 4, hence do expect a pretty short game and story. Luckily there are multiple different challenges and a few side quests that you can attempt to earn experience and currency. There are a few new weapons and some old ones, some of the newer weapons are pretty interesting to used once upgraded fully as each weapon has a unique power.\n\nThe map in this game is smaller in scale and there are lesser varieties of vehicles running around. There is no form of customization as well, which is a main component in the previous saint rows games. You can only switch between two characters, Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington. The new characters in this game are not very relatable due to the short time given to spend with them and only a few characters from the previous games are given short cameos.\n\nOverall, this is not a really good game due to flaws mentioned above and the major issue of game crashing. I would not recommend anyone to buy this game at all unless you are a diehard saint rows fan who does not care about multiple game breaking bugs.","April 9","false","27.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

Gat out of Hell is like the Weezer album "Make Believe". It's sell-out pop garbage and you're sitting there wondering what is happening to your favorite band, but all I'm thinking is: 'Well...The Green Album wasn't great either. I can't say that I'm surprised."\n...Ehh..Okay that doesn't really work. I don't listen to Weezer.\nHere's a much better analogy: Gat out of Hell is the equivalent of sneezing so hard that you crap your pants.\n\nLook, I'm not critical of Saints Row because I get paid off by Rockstar, I do it because I'm passionate about the series. I've been here since the beginning, the demo for Saints Row 1 being the first game I played on my brand new Xbox 360. Even though I don't like Saints Row 4, I still applaud Volition for its success, they deserve it. However, it seems like no matter how low I set my expectations, Volition/Deep Silver have to find ways to disappoint me. Saints Row $: Gat out of Hell 44 1/4: All Saints go to Hell: The Final Insult is a blatant low-budget cash-grab. Here's a transcript from an actual* conversation at Volition.\n\nDeep Silver: "Sup? What are you working on?"\nVolition: "Currently I'm developing content for a new Saints Row game."\nDeep Silver: "Excellent. What is it about?"\nVolition: "Well, we decided to expand on what made SR4 so popular. This game is going to take place in Hell, and the Boss is going to have a lot of really unique demonic powers. There's also going to be this really good story, with lots of twists and turns. This is definitely going to be our biggest game yet."\nDeep Silver: "Hmm..About how far along are you?"\nVolition: "Ehhh only 10% at best. Right now it's mostly just place-holder content."\nDeep Silver: "I see..*gasps* What in the world could that be!?"\nVolition: "Huh?"\nDeep Silver: "YOINK!"\nVolition: "Hey! My workstation PC!"\n\nHigh Voltage: "Why are you giving me a PC?"\nDeep Silver: "Just...do something with all this."\n\nGat of Hell is a strictly Gat (and/or Kinzie) affair. The Boss has been kidnapped by Satan, and it's up to a couple of Mary Sues to save her. It seems odd that Kinzie would get involved, and not...Shaundi. Shaundi's been there for the boss since Saints Row 2. If I had to guess, it's because she doesn't have a personality. Anyway they arrive in Hell, get superpowers, and do a bunch of activities until the final boss battle unlocks. Note the word activities, there are no actual missions in this expansion. There are a few interactions with various "wacky" characters like Vlad the Impaler and Shakespeare, but they don't amount to anything beyond cut-scenes and a lot of talking while you're exploring. While the city feels new and different enough, its inhabitants are soul-less husks. Yeah I know, eternal torment and all, but Hell still looks very much like an actual city. There are bars, clubs, and all sorts of other places to go, but they're all closed-off to you.\n\nThe chief superpower you receive in this game is the ability to fly. I...I actually can't hate on this at all. The flying in Gat Out of Hell is great. I loved soaring around, through narrow passages, diving, and even collected all 940 of those freakin' orbs. It's a damn shame that nothing is actually done with this ability. There aren't any missions, no enemies that specifically target flying Saints (aside from the lame spires), and all you really can do is stupid pet tricks like flying through hoops. While a few of Satan's minions can fly, Big Red never got the bright idea to finance some demonic flying vehicles to complement his tanks. The rest of the superpowers are reskins, and just like SR4 they are ridiculously over-powered. Satan himself isn't immune to the coldfire aura, he spent most of the final battle frozen. Several new weapons round out the Saint's arsenal. My personal favorite is Sloth. Nothing says effort like sitting back in a chair while twin-miniguns and rockets do all the work.\n\nWhile is is appealing having 666 methods for wrecking adversaries, it all seems wasted due to the pitiful level of difficulty. Like most other gamers, I like big explosions and huge body-counts, but I also want to feel like they were earned. I want close-calls, near-deaths, or even just to be slightly threatened. I'll admit, I'd be happier if Saints Row went back to the early games, where explosive options were kinda limited. But if we're planning on sticking to this route, at least go all the way. If I'm going to be an ultimate badass, I want ultimate odds to match.\n\nActually, I take that back. I suddenly envisioned the end-game. Imagine a Saints Row MMO. It'd probably play like Marvel Heroes 2015 or DC Universe Online. It would take place in a bland feature-less city (like Steelport), and you'd create a Saint to go kill gang-bangers, aliens, and demons with dozens of dull super-powers. It'll be challenging only in the sense of "you can't go here yet because you'll get one-shotted". There would be all these quests with punny titles, and I'd probably be the only idiot wondering why I can't drive a car. I'd ask someone and they'd say "Why would you drive a car?! You have super-sprint and flight already."\n\nIt sounds ridiculous but what other conclusion can I draw? Saints Row has fallen into the trap of constant escalation. When your last game ended with the world getting blown up and the Saints getting a sweet space-ship and time-travel, you have to wonder what could possibly happen next. Well apparently it involved going to Hell, but that was basically wasted. What's next then? Do we just go back to thug-life and stealing cars? Or do we time-travel to the distant future to save neo-earth from the cyborg-dinosaurs? Nobody wants to get stuck with a pistol, when they can shoot lasers out of their finger-tips that cause massive explosions.\n\nAnd yet with all that said, I've barely talked about Gat out of Hell. You know why? Because there's nothing to talk about. This expansion is for SR4 fans that want a change of scenery. If you've already played through SR4, play through it again and save some cash instead. All you're actually missing out on with this game is a half-baked city and the (really sweet) ability to fly. The activites are retreads or stupid stuff like hitting frat-demons through giant hoops. There aren't any missions, and all you ever really do is kill things. Sadly, that isn't even the worst part. There are those times when I actually want to mindlessly kill stuff, but then some Archduke(mini-boss) appears, all of the other demons leave, and I think to myself "Maybe I should wait for the F2P Saints MMO".\n\nOh! Before I forget. The cutscene before the final boss bugged out on me. I'm not sure how this got past testing.","January 22, 2015","false","11.6"," 87 of 170 people (51%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","51","87","170","35","9"

Yes.\nIs it as great as SR2 (or SRIV for that matter)? No.\nI haven't done too many "serious" reviews unless they are games I feel should be talked about. This is going to be a "serious" review from a Saints Row fan.\n\nPros:\n-Funny and Great writing\n-Great superpowers\n- Ties up some loose ends with some previous characters\n-Ok story\n-Great Visuals\n-Allows you to import your boss from SRIV\n-Creative weapons\n\nCons:\n-No Customization IN GAME asides from changing characters and (presumably) DLC wing skins (you need to own SRIV to customize the boss)\n- Very short story. Without trying to even fill up the "Satan's Wraith" bar, I managed to fill it up quite quickly. Also, there's no story missions, but rather filling up the "Satan's Wraith" bar by doing activities and Side-Missions\n-Opinion based, but $21.99 CAD. IMO, While this IS a good price for the length, I feel like this would be better if it was $16.99 CAD or something, but it's still a good price for standalone DLC to SRIV, (which was meant to be DLC for SR:TT, so what is this? Saints Row 3.75?)\n\nI can't really think of more things, but please trust me about the TL:DR below this sentence.\n\nTL:DR Great game, but wait for a sale that's at least %25 off to get full value.","January 22, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The writing is still funny, the references are still referencey, and the side activities are still about as fun as they were in IV (or even more fun in some cases.  The addition of a narrator through most of the work really helps the (admittedly somewhat sparse) plotline.  In short.  If you have Saint's Row IV and want more, this isn't a bad buy...but at the same time, I'm getting a little tired of not stillwater.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/banditcoon/recommended/301910/","banditcoon","Rusty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/banditcoon/","145 products in account","Gat out of Hell is a game that's difficult to list as recommend or not.\n\nAlthough it is Stand-Alone, it's really an expansion pack for Saints Row IV. It's the same idea as expansion packs for other open-world games that take place after the main story and are shorter, take place in just part of the main map (or a new smaller map) and after the main story but still offer fun game play and a decent, albeit short story. The difference here is that it's Stand-Alone as opposed to launching it from within Saints Row IV.\n\nWhile short, this is still a fun game. Even in the small(er) world (at least compared to SR IV) in which the expansion takes place, there is still plenty to see, do and collect.\n\nHowever, because of the structure of the missions (i.e., there are only a few main ones and you do side activities to build up Satan's anger enough to fight him), you will likely find yourself able to fight the last battle with much of the world still left for you to discover and play. You may well find yourself feeling a sense a disappointment as it only takes about four hours of play to reach this point.\n\nThere however still will be plenty left for you to do and collect. Couple this with the last battle being one you can repeatedly fight and the expansion can last well beyond those initial four hours.\n\nThe activities themselves are sadly mostly just Saints Row 4 activities in slightly different clothing. The exception being the two based on the new flying ability. That's not to say they're not fun. It's more that they feel like more of the same.\n\nSpeaking of which, flying is a lot of fun, especially once you've purchased upgrades. You may well find yourself wondering how you were ever happy without it.\n\nThe collectibles are more or less the same as in Saints Row IV but again, in slightly different clothing. I don't want to spoil too much. However, I will say that listening to them did give me the feeling that the team put a lot of thought and effort into this game. It does feel as though there could have been much more of a story here. I.e., that though they could (or perhaps even should) have expanded this from an expansion into a full game with a full set of missions.\n\nGat out of Hell ends up being a game that is fun and it is good to have another adventure with the Saints, albeit only a couple of them and a short one. It feels like a game that could have been a lot more and does suffer more then a little from feeling like a re-skin of Saints Row 4. However, when it does have new things, it does a great or at least decent job with them. The team did a lot with what they had to work with.\n\nWhile Gat out Hell may seem to be missing something (maybe even a lot), I think it's important that we remember that (iirc) they did advertise this as a stand alone expansion rather then a whole new game. Could it have been more? Yes. On the other hand, it wasn't as though they were claiming it was going to be.","January 28, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Weaponry is the best: 7 deadly sins weapons waits you and your infinite laughs behind them. Cutscenes are really really exhilarant. Sadly the bad news is that its really really short.

If you don't go for all the collectibles you can finish the game in just over an hour.\nThere really isn't much content in the game aside form collectibles and a few activities (5-8 each but limited variety). Even then, getting all the collectibles adds on 4-5 hours (thats how many there are and how much running around it takes to get them...) and if you do the challenges (get x kills with x) it'll take on 6-8 hours... I skipped the challenges and just replayed the final fight 5 times to see all the 10 second endings.\n\nIf you're a fan of Saints Row it is worth checking out (If you thought 3 and 4 were okay at least) but at 20USD the price of admission is steep.

Saints Row 2 & 3 are 2 of my all time favorites.\n\nSaints Row 4, very meh. Feels like a standalone expansion for 3. I couldnt get into it. Everything was rehashed from 3.\n\nAaaannnd now we have the stand alone expansion for 4, hmm?\n\nSo the should-have-been-DLC spawned a should-have-been-DLC? What do you even call that, an expansion of an expansion?\n\nIf you get it on sale at an extreme discount like I did, go for it. But its definitely not worth the asking price. The main mission is like what 4 quests? Maybe 10 hours of gameplay?\n\nGo play 3. Its a lot more fun.

In this review , i wanna talk about this game from the Presentation , Gameplay , Graphics , and best of all Features .\n\nPresentation\n\nThe main story is , we (Johnny Gat and Kinze Kensington) have to rescue the President (the previous main protagnist from Saints Row 1 to 4) from the abduction of Satan who wants to marry her daughter , Jezzebel , to the President . In order to get rescue him , Gat and Kenzie must deliver a fulll destruction and wrath to Hell in order to get Satan's Attention . With the help of Dane Vogel , the previous main antagonist of Saints Row 2 , the character will have numerous quests from him and the other hands of Allies , like Blackbeard , Shakespeare , Vlad , and DeWynter sisters . In the progress of the game , you as a player will gain their trust after completing every quests that they gave it to you . But the main problem from this point is the lack of the main storyline that has no motivation for you to save The President . For the players , the only reasons you get here in Hell is because you want to mess with "the taste of hell" . The other problem is that the characterization of each character are not developed well , even with the two main protagonist , Gat and Kinzie . In this section , this is the first critic\n\nGameplay\n\nIn Gat Out of Hell , Power is the main thing that leads you in every way of this game . You will gain a lots of power in the progress of the game . And most of my favorite is the weapons itself , especially The 7 Deadly Weapons - Sloth . This baby is the number reason why you wanna put some mess in Hell . With powerfull Minigun in the left and right side of this couch , and also with the powerfull 5 missiles everytime you want to shoot some explosive , this one is the Over Powered weapon . And with upgraded power of this weapon (where you can upgrade the weapon until to the unlimited ammo) , you almost can create a massive riot in one area , no kidding . Although The 7 Deadly Weapons - Sloth was the best weapon in this  game , there are still a lots of weapons that still blow your mind , from SMG to the explosive weapon etc . Beside all of that , the game also provides you with 4 magical powers that were given from your allies . Each power will give different impact to the enemy . But my favorite is THE STOMP . This baby is the second reason why you wanna go to the worst of place in the end of the universe . With a lots of upgrading option , this one will put your enemy in a misery . Overall this section was one of the best point for this game\n\nGraphics\n\nAlthough it's been upgraded since the previous Saints Row's game , but the graphics will not lift up the hype . Maybe some special effects are cool , but not gonna put your jaw drop for a long time . That's all\n\nFeatures\n\nIn this section , it's the same thing like the Gameplay , it's cool , mostly to the upgrade options of weapon , characters , and magical powers . Unfortunately you can't customize your own character . You can't buy some clothes etc . Maybe the reason is that they are in Hell .... so what could they bought in the worst place of eternity . But the upgrading sections in this game is why i love this and the reason why I don't want to finish the main story quest .\n\nIn the end , The Good and The Bad of this is\n\nThe Good\n\n+Powerfull weapons\n+Over Powered Characters\n+Simply , powerfull options that lead you to become the most dangerous guys in HELL\n+Well imaginative world design\n\nThe Bad\n\n- The Story doesn't live up the hype with the lack of characterization\n-  Mediocore Graphics\n- No customization\n\nI will give 8/10 for this\n\nMUST BUY IT\n","May 16","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This one doesn't disapoint. The game delivers the same silly humor found in the last two games in the franchise and it keeps you entertained while you dominate the streets of New Hades. The only way to progress through the story is to complete activities given to you. Completing these activities will increase Satan's rage which will allow you to face Satan himself! That's basically the whole point of this expansion. The game has similar graphics compared with the last two titles. Meaning you won't be needing a high-end Graphics card to play this game on the highest possible settings. With all that said, I wish this game was longer! But it's considered acceptable for a standalone expansion (took me 10 hours to complete the story.) Despite all the above, if you like blowing things up, and enjoy some good humor on the side.

You play as Gat and Kinzie, instead of your character from the Saints Row 4.  You can switch between the two of them at any time, but the story revolves around Gat.  Basically the story starts right after Saints Row 4 with the President (your character) getting thrown into a wormhole to Hell.  You come to find out Satan has kidnapped the President to marry his daughter.  Gat and Kinzie volunteer to follow and rescue the President from Satan.  Surprisingly, Hell looks very similar to Steelport.  You end up meeting Blackbeard, Vlad the Impaler, the Twins from Saints Row 3-4, and William Shakespeare?  William Shakespeare apparently is in hell which surprised me.  Anyways, you play the game essentially like Saints Row 4.  Collect orbs to redeem for power ups and earn money to upgrade guns and abilities.  If you haven't played Saints Row 4 or 3, I'd recommend checking those out first.  Especially 4, since this is pretty much a standalone DLC for Saints Row 4 anyways.  If you've played 4, you'll probably enjoy this.","January 23, 2015","true","22.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

A better narrative with more involvement of side quests as part of that and this could’ve been a really good expansion. F*cking collectibles take about two hours combined in flight time to gather.  Some of the challenges are fun and creative but the amount that require you to farm kills and cash is insulting. A huge chunk of the twenty hour game time is taken up by this & the main quest barely gets you started on the majority of them either. There is no radio which doesn't help. You’ll have to put the game volume to zero and play your own stuff to ease the pain. It's a decent game but overall this is one for achievement hunters or a rainy day.

How far you have come since your gangster origins. From Stillwater, to Steelport, Whitehouse, to Outer Space, the Saints have seen it all. But now comes there greatest challenge, Satan himself. Yes it would seem Lucifer has actually taken interest in the "The Boss" (Generally YOU in every other Saints Row game) due to his ability to cause mayhem, fight for power, and still get the job done at the end of the day. Due to this interest, Satan ends up kidnapping The Boss after the gang decides to play with a Ouija board, thus opening a rift to hell pulling The Boss into his certain doom. Sounds ridiculous right? Well it is!!! That being said, I absolutely loved this game, and here is why!\n\n[Pros]\n- Play as Johnny Gat or Kinzie Kensington whenever you desire.\n-Tons of weapons unique to hell and a few classics, including the 7 Deady Weapons, one for each of the 7 Deadly Sins.\n-The Glide Ability from SR4 is replaced with the Winged Flight ability, a much more maneuverable means of travel.\n-Team up with the likes of Vlad the Impaler, Blackbeard the Pirate, and William Shakespeare.\n-Meet up with old cast members such as The Twins from SR3, Dex from SR1, and even Dane from SR2.\n-All of the "Super Powers" have been replaced with "Arcane Abilities" which act similiar, but have unique differences.\n-Tons of collectables filled with lore, and lots of side challenges to help keep you busy.\n-Up to five different endings, some serious, some silly, some very random.\n-Tons of upgrades between your character, weapons, and powers.\n-Great dialogue with equally as great voice acting. You can tell the whole cast has fun filming their lines.\n-Possible cliffhangers hinting at Saints Row 5.\n-Co-Op available through the whole game. Whats better then one person beating up Satan? Two people!\n\n[Cons]\n-Very few vehicles to drive around in, tho you will likely spend most of your time flying or running.\n-No radio stations, this stinks because things can get quiet at times.\n-Very short (Only took 4 hours to complete the story), tho this is ment to be a standalone DLC at a $20 price so that kind of was expected.\n-Once you finish all of the quests, side missions, and challenges, you really have nothing else to do but run around.\n-Some side missions are recycled versions of missions from other games, just renamed and slightly reskinned.\n-You cannot use your phone to call any holmies, this is replaced with the ability to summon creatures.\n-You cannot change the custom skin of your weapons, a feature that was refreshing to see in SR4.\n\n[Neutral Thoughts]\n-This game is NOT for everyone, especially for die hard fans of Saints Row 2 and prior. This is not the Saints Row game you remember, back when it was all about forming a gang and running the streets. I would recomend it to people with a good sense of humor and who can handle a game that doesen't take itself too seriously. This game is alot of light hearted fun, and does a great job at making references to all Saints games prior this one.\n\n[Final Thoughts]\nContrary to popular belief, the Saints Row series stopped being relatable to the GTA series ever since midway through Saints Row 3. This is NOT GTA. If you want a serious, more realistic experience, then this is NOT the game for you. If you want an open world, gun slinging, super ability whipping, wing flapping HELL of a good time (PUN INTENDED) then I would definetly recommend this game to you. If you enjoyed the whackiness of Saints Row 4, and maybe even Saints Row 3, I would highly suggest giving this game a try.

Weiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/","149 products in account",""Punching the Devil in the face" is every gangster's dream, isn't it? No? Well, you haven't been paying attention to the descent into madness that is the Saints Row series, have you? With the last full release Saints Row 4 devoted to sci-fi and fantasy much more than gangbangers, it was perhaps inevitable that the follow-up standalone expansion would go even farther in abandoning its supposed genre. Gat Out of Hell is once again narrated by Jane Austen and the writing within the cutscenes is at once literary and puerile. I just wish there were more of them - the open-world diversions like flying on angel's wings, shooting demons, and fraud are all great but it's over far too quickly.\nThe story is familiar if you're into that whole liberal arts English major thing. Most of the gang is celebrating the birthday of Kinzie (I wonder how old she is?) Kensington when a portal opens up and the Boss of the Third Street Saints (your player character from SR4) is pulled into Hell. Johnny Gat and Kinzie talk to shoot a Ouija board to convince the spirit within to open their own portal and, voila, the pair of heroes enter the Hellish cityscape to rescue the Boss. Oh, and punch Satan in the face. That bit's important.\nGat Out of Hell eschews the normal mission-giver narrative that rules most open world games, but it's still has some decent structure in its three acts. You meet some old frenemies like Dane Vogel from Saints Row 2 and the twins from The Third, as well as new allies Vlad the Impaler, Blackbeard and William Shakespeare. Yes, the Bard has set up a club in Hell called the Tempest because of course he has. These personages don't give you specific missions other than unlocking some arcane powers, but they guide you through playing through the many different diversions available in the open world of Hell to get Satan's attention.\nThe activities are mostly rehashes of other challenges in Saints Row games like the rag-doll fraud and surviving waves of enemies by shooting them up, but the new "salvation" bit of collecting souls falling from the skies showcases the flying mechanic. You'll use an arsenal of Hellish weapons such as frog-shooting guns and a minigun-equipped armchair, and the arcane powers quickly become second nature in big fights. Stomping the ground to send a blast wave throwing demons into the air never gets old.\nCompleting any bit of mayhem progresses your Satan meter and getting it up to a milestone essentially unlocks a new cutscene advancing the story. The most notable of these is the extended musical number in which Satan, his daughter Jezebel, and the heroes sing about their emotional states. While the song is campy as all Hell (and rife with puns), it's played completely straight and I love it if only to hear Daniel Dae Kim struggle with talk-singing his part as Johnny Gat.\nThe real star of Gat Out of Hell is the city. Hell is gorgeously wrought, and it's enjoyable to just glide along on fallen angel wings taking it all in. Skyscrapers transform into Gothic pillars, lava flows from the sky into pools of fire, and the canyon slums all make the city of Hell a terrible place that's beautiful to behold. Rusted-out vehicles move around the streets and spontaneously explode, while lightning strikes randomly with a thunderous crack. The regular populace is meandering grey souls called husks, and they are just fodder in the war between the Saints and Satan. The whole city of Hell has a wonderfully consistent feel to it.\nWhile many of the superpowers from Saints Row 4 return, such as mega jumps and super sprinting, flying is overhauled and it's just exquisite. Flying takes some skill to master even after the prolonged tutorial - you have to keep up your speed through diving or the limited wing flaps to prevent stalling. Falling into lava sucks. Once you do master flying, and invest some power into upgrades, it will be your preferred method for getting around the city. Hell, you can spend hours just flying around collecting the hundreds of blue orbs stashed in every nook and cranny.\nHow many hours you can devote to the open nature of Gat Out of Hell will determine whether it's valuable enough for you to invest $20. The main story, such as it is, can be played through in about four hours, which feels a bit on the short side. That doesn't touch anywhere near 100% completion, to be clear. There are multitudes of collectibles, challenges and hidden objects that can certainly occupy your time if you enjoy that sort of thing. Gat Out of Hell supports 2 player coop out of the box - one player occupies Kinzie while the other embodies Gat - and playing the completionist with a friend might make it all worthwhile.\n\nGat Out of Hell is a comedic romp through myth, literature and video game tropes. The writing is smart, the gunplay is solid, and the city of Hell is a blast to fly though. Some may miss the more traditional mission design or lament its brevity, but Gat Out of Hell is a great way to cap off the story of the Third Street Saints.","August 15, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","1"

I am glad to say I was wrong, because Gat out of Hell is one... well, hell of a postscript. The boss of the Saints (who looks like whatever you made them look like in Saints Row IV) has been kidnapped by the devil himself, and Johnny Gat, the most dangerous man in the world and the last surviving founder of the Saints, must rescue them. You can also play as team genius Kinzie Kensington, since its her birthday. In some ways, it is the most barebones title in the series- not only are there no customization options, there aren't even any story missions save the finale- the gameplay is made up entirely of the series' staple activities, like fraud and survival, with a few new ones, such as an aerial twist on the blazing activity. Speaking of air, Gat out of Hell takes your mobility to the final frontier, adding full-on flight to your already overpowered repetoire of super powers. Your offensive abilities return with elements, such a stomp that vacuums in enemies and pickups and an aura that forces the demons of hell to bow before your Saintly presence. There's also a whole new set of super-guns (and a sword) that correspond to the seven deadly sins, each with nasty side-effects for your enemies. Gat out of Hell is the best elements of Saints Row distilled into a pure form: the mayhem, the power, the guns, the unparalleled sense of catharsis. Not even the legions of hell can stand in the way of your fun. However, it is also the shortest title in the series, though it is priced accordingly. If you've been on a ridealong with the Saints from the very beginning, like me, Gat out of Hell offers some much appriciated continuity nodding, which is remarkably one of the series' strongest points. Much as in IV, you will run into a number of old familiar faces, beginning with none other then Saints Row 2's main villain, Dane Vogel. There's plenty of collectibles and audio logs to find if you'd like to cover every square inch of the city of the damned.  The Saints conquered a street, then a city, a nation, an intellerstellar empire and now hell itself, and STILL there seems to be more for the Saints to do. I hope to don the purple once again sometime in the future. If you have enjoyed ANY of the Saints Row games or crave a sandbox experience that makes you the center of all the fun, Gat out of Hell is a game for you.","October 22, 2015","true","10.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

How far you have come since your gangster origins. From Stillwater, to Steelport, Whitehouse, to Outer Space, the Saints have seen it all. But now comes there greatest challenge, Satan himself. Yes it would seem Lucifer has actually taken interest in the "The Boss" (Generally YOU in every other Saints Row game) due to his ability to cause mayhem, fight for power, and still get the job done at the end of the day. Due to this interest, Satan ends up kidnapping The Boss after the gang decides to play with a Ouija board, thus opening a rift to hell pulling The Boss into his certain doom. Sounds ridiculous right? Well it is!!! That being said, I absolutely loved this game, and here is why!\n\n[Pros]\n- Play as Johnny Gat or Kinzie Kensington whenever you desire.\n-Tons of weapons unique to hell and a few classics, including the 7 Deady Weapons, one for each of the 7 Deadly Sins.\n-The Glide Ability from SR4 is replaced with the Winged Flight ability, a much more maneuverable means of travel.\n-Team up with the likes of Vlad the Impaler, Blackbeard the Pirate, and William Shakespeare.\n-Meet up with old cast members such as The Twins from SR3, Dex from SR1, and even Dane from SR2.\n-All of the "Super Powers" have been replaced with "Arcane Abilities" which act similiar, but have unique differences.\n-Tons of collectables filled with lore, and lots of side challenges to help keep you busy.\n-Up to five different endings, some serious, some silly, some very random.\n-Tons of upgrades between your character, weapons, and powers.\n-Great dialogue with equally as great voice acting. You can tell the whole cast has fun filming their lines.\n-Possible cliffhangers hinting at Saints Row 5.\n-Co-Op available through the whole game. Whats better then one person beating up Satan? Two people!\n\n[Cons]\n-Very few vehicles to drive around in, tho you will likely spend most of your time flying or running.\n-No radio stations, this stinks because things can get quiet at times.\n-Very short (Only took 4 hours to complete the story), tho this is ment to be a standalone DLC at a $20 price so that kind of was expected.\n-Once you finish all of the quests, side missions, and challenges, you really have nothing else to do but run around.\n-Some side missions are recycled versions of missions from other games, just renamed and slightly reskinned.\n-You cannot use your phone to call any holmies, this is replaced with the ability to summon creatures.\n-You cannot change the custom skin of your weapons, a feature that was refreshing to see in SR4.\n\n[Neutral Thoughts]\n-This game is NOT for everyone, especially for die hard fans of Saints Row 2 and prior. This is not the Saints Row game you remember, back when it was all about forming a gang and running the streets. I would recomend it to people with a good sense of humor and who can handle a game that doesen't take itself too seriously. This game is alot of light hearted fun, and does a great job at making references to all Saints games prior this one.\n\n[Final Thoughts]\nContrary to popular belief, the Saints Row series stopped being relatable to the GTA series ever since midway through Saints Row 3. This is NOT GTA. If you want a serious, more realistic experience, then this is NOT the game for you. If you want an open world, gun slinging, super ability whipping, wing flapping HELL of a good time (PUN INTENDED) then I would definetly recommend this game to you. If you enjoyed the whackiness of Saints Row 4, and maybe even Saints Row 3, I would highly suggest giving this game a try. It has a great price, a great cast, and great fun all around.\n\n9 out of 10 would raise hell in hell again.","January 28, 2015","true","25.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First, was the base game of IV itself. No garage, no cribs, no stores save for weapon vending machines; the map has never seemed more barren. I understand, for story reasons, why Gat and Kinzie are the main characters, but it would have been a nice reward to let the player go around kicking ♥♥♥ in Hell after the main storyline is resolved with their beloved Bosses. Who cares it if makes no sense? This is Saints Row!\n\nIV managed to strike the balance perfectly between frustrating and boring, keeping things more consistently challenging throughout the lifespan of the game than the Third did, but Gat Out of Hell was not quite as inspired in that regard. While a few of the superpowers introduce new mechanics that are fun to play around with (such as Worship in Aura), others just seem to have switched around elements from IV into different powers. Legionairres and Archdukes are initially tough to deal with, but after grabbing certain powers or pretty much any of the Seven Deadly Weapons, they become trivial.\n\nThat said, I thoroughly enjoyed exploring Hell as much as any locale from the SR series so far. Coming from a fantasy RPG background, cutting down scores of supernatural fiends with magical weapons just feels right, and it complements the lunatic arc of the series well. If it had been more of a full game, with the sandbox elements of the SR series intact, I likely would not have waited for it to go on sale, but picked it up as soon as I finished IV.","December 5, 2015","true","28.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well this might be the game for you.\n\nIf you have played either of the last saints row games then you have already played this one. It is literally the same as 4 but with a new shiny coat of pixel, now this is not a bad thing in my opinion, but I just wanted to say that before I begin.\n\nSo the president has been kidnapped and it is up to Gat to get him/her back from the evil clutches of Satan and his rather cute daughter Jezebel. Kinzie is also there but no one cares about her so moving on. So following the president down to hell on a rescue mission you go about causing the largest amount of havoc as you possibly can whilst making a few friends and allies in the along the way.\n\nThe main meat of the game is its rather large and very well detailed open world filled to the brimstone with diversions, side quests and things you just want to killerize. I had a lot of fun with everything that was thrown at me, from speed flying to tank rampages the game has it all but as mentioned it’s not much different from previous titles so if you are into those activities then you will have a great time\n\nThe world is awesome in my opinion, I loved just floating around and gawking at everything, the hellish landscape fits the theme perfectly. Flowing magma falls from floating islands that just hang in the sky like clouds before cascading into the giant glowing lakes of fire that litter the ash filled city whilst hapless damned souls wonder around doing what the damned do on their daily routine, to me it seems like bursting into light when you shoot them is the highlight of their day.\n\nNow weaponry, the good stuff, I am not going to spoil it. You of course have the standard guns, all with a hellish theme, but when you eventually get hold of the seven deadly sins you know you are going to have a great time. A hammer that shoots lightning, a reclining chair that fires missiles and a sentient revolver all await you in your hellish arsenal of goodies.\n\nAnd I can’t talk about weapons without mentioned super powers; they are back, but this time its arcane magic. You can super sprint your way around the city and destroy all the cars that get in your way or take to the sky with your own pair of fallen angel wings, just a side note flying with those is awesome, when you get used to them and have a few upgrades under your belt dashing through the sky is phenomenal. Then there is the offensive magic, 4 spells each with 3 different elements changing them completely. Not going to ruin them but you can summon imps and suck the life from people, enough said.\n\nOver all this is a super fun game with enough to keep you busy for a while. The plot is thin at best, but the world and everything in it is enough to entertain. I would recommend this for sure if it’s on sale and if you enjoy this sort of game then full price then it’s still a deal.\n\nOh and one more thing, play as Gat and use unarmed melee… trust me.\n\nHave fun ^_^","December 23, 2015","true","32.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Third, is my favourite.\nThere is no main quest for this game, a main story sure, but no main quest. It's extremely short as well.\nAll you do is activities, I get that this isn't an actual game, but more of a spin-off. I get that, but this is ridiculous even by spin-off standards.\nYou get to play as Gat or as Kinzie, which is... okay, but you can't change them, or what they're wearing. The NPC's all look exactly like each other. This game feels like a cash grab.\n\nI tried to spend as much time on this game as possible, I spread out my gameplay throughout days, and I still only got 6 hours through. Yes I haven't done all those....activities... *shudders* just too many of them, incredibly dull and boring. Spent most of the time flying around lol.\n\nNow for the good points.\nIt's playable, there's lots of fighting and good gameplay.\nYou can use your wings to fly all over the small map.\nLots of activities (which is literally the whole game, but I've already mentioned that...)\nNew weapons and upgrades.\nThe dialogue is okay, what you would expect from a Saints Row game.\n\nOverall this game is disappointing, it's not to Saints Row standard, in my honest opinion, I would only recommend this game if it was cheaper. The game has dropped its price since I bought it, I paid £15.99, and now it's £10.99, but I wouldn't even pay that now.\n\nI rate it 5/10, it's good if you got nothing to do, and try to not complete all at once because you will feel disappointed and angry at how terrible the story is.\n\n","February 24","false","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You are the Legendary Gat or the exhilarating Kenzi. You can change between them at will. It's a display of power, determination, cunning, and perseverance.\n\nPros:\nGreat Story: connects fluently from Saints Row IV. Makes you laugh a lot, yet it's compelling.\nWeapons: If you watch the trailers you get the more interesting weapons shown to you. But we also have Crossbows. 'Nuff Said.\nPowers: Epic new powers for you to enjoy that are an awesome display of power. Really fun to play with as you progress.\nVehicles: Rambulance and other Death Machines (Pun not intended. Actually, pun TOTALLY intended.)\n\nCons:\nStory: It took about 8 hours from start to finish, skipping nothing and doing sidequests (not religiously, but when I happened to come across them). Includes flying around on your sick wings (Upgrade them for more fun sooner).\nThe ending doesn't seem too be completed. Feels like it's missing a couple cutscenes.\nWeapons: You get a main feel for the weaponry as you watch the trailers. Nothing as fun to toy with as the Dubstep gun.\nDriving: While you don't really do it at all (Flying + Sprinting = No Car), Hell doesn't have nitrous.\n\nRating: 8.9\nIt's tough to spend $20 on a game that you can finish so early.","January 20, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Getting gold medals in events, collecting collectables, finding secrets, 7 Deadly Sins.  There is probably 20+Hours worth of game in the game.  It feels similar to the Saints Row 4 style with crazy game play and an out of this world story.\n\nIf you are a huge fan of Saints Row games you'll notice right away the voice actors aren't the same as the older games, but equally as good if not a little better.

Add to that the lack of a proper story mode and main quests, I ended up uninstalling the game in less than 2 hours. Which is truly a shame since I have almost 40 hours in SR3 and SR4 and I've enjoyed every last second of that time.\n\nI'm not sure why the game ended up being so terrible, but this is the first entry that has been developed entirely under Deep Silver so I'm a little bit worried about the future of the series. Hopefully, Gat out of Hell was just a fluke and Volition will surprise us with SR5 in the future.","March 15, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

In my opinion it is the worst game in the series. Here's why: They've taken out just about everything I think Saint's Row games are about and didn't put anything worthwile in to make up for that.\n\nThere is almost zero customization available, the only thing you can change is your wings color - and that's only if you bought a DLC for that. To me that is ripping the heart out of this particular series, because for most of the franchise you could tailor almost anything to your liking - your gang style, your homies, your character, your cribs, your vehicles, later games even your weapons.\n\nMissions are extremely unimaginative outside of main storyline missions of which there are very little as the game is incredibly short.\n\nYou can't even "legally cheat" anymore because you don't have a gang anymore. I'm referring to the "phone menu" through which you could in previous games order a vehicle delivery or zombie uprisings, that is also gone. While the lack of the phone/spawn menu is not as essential part of the game as the customization, the lack of a gang really is a downer and has removed a very essential part of the series. Alright they barely existed in SR: IV either but they were still somewhat there and recruitable.\n\nOn an even more personal taste level Gat out of Hell isn't even as funny or entertaining to me as the previous installments, I admit that is perhaps partially because I wasn't a huge fan of either of the protagonists in the game - while I didn't hate those characters, they were not my favourites. Well, not even in the top 7.\n\nOverall if you have any similar preferences to mine, I wouldn't recommend this game at its full price - if you can get it in a sale, by all means, go for it. Like I said it IS essentially a reskinned Saints Row IV, just with a much much shorter storyline and without most of what makes Saints Row, Saints Row, to me at least.","October 20, 2015","false","2.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I'm a little disapointed in this because I would expect a expansion for 20 bucks to have like 8 story mode hours and have activites/modifications for an additional 12 hours. But no, 3 hours of "story mode" and another hour to collect 70% of the clusters and get the collectables. I put the story mode in quotes becuase it was 90% activites and two story missions. Also, The cutscene before the final boss is broken as sin. Tried to watch it three different times and decided to go to youtube instead when I got fustrated. Very neat idea, but was poorly excuted. I would be very angry if i cashed in 20 USD for this but thank Gaben, Gamestop had a pricing error and I obtained a key for 5 USD. I know im complaining but I feel like this shouldnt be worth 20 USD and should be a 5 USD saints row 4 DLC. If you love the story of the saints, just watch a youtube let's play of it (shouldnt be long becuase its just 2 missions). This is all my opinion and I just really wanted to vent and warn any users on the verge of purchasing this game of my concern and complaints. Dont let me discourage you from playing it if you really want to. It was fun, but not worth the money.","January 20, 2015","false","8.6"," 35 of 69 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","35","69","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strider_rider/recommended/301910/","strider_rider","Strider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strider_rider/","105 products in account","To be honest I was fairly disappointed in how much this game was lacking in. Don't get me wrong I love the Saints Row franchise, especially when they decided to take a turn in how the content was written in a much more humorous and less serious tone that sets the franchise apart in comparison to your regular "let's run a gang and screw the city over while we're at it" open world kind of game (e.g Grand Theft Auto, which was what a lot of people compared it to in SR I, II). I understand that this game was not produced to be the penultimate sequel to be taken as Saints Row V, but it isn't what every fan-boy here is calling an "expansion" either. It's a stand-alone game, using the engine and assets from the previous game, it is NOT an expansion or DLC to Saints Row IV, which is what everyone seems to be using as an excuse for defending the lack of gameplay. For the sake of everyone's personal subjectivity, I'm going to avoid arguing about the price tag altogether in this review because as it stands, it is a very humble asking price for this game.\n\nFirst of all, I wasn't disappointed in the story at all, oh no, I loved the idea of the Saints actually BEING in hell and wreaking havoc, not a simulation of it gaining sentience (a-la Enter the Dominatrix) which was what I originally thought this was going to be. Overall the story was cool - it wasn't the best thing you could expect from a follow up of the moments after overthrowing the Zin Empire, but it was cool nevertheless. The game uses several sets of loyalty missions in the form of side quests/mini games similar to the ones from the previous games to progress the story line, which is in my opinion was a terrible form of execution. The 7 deadly sin weapons featured in the trailers are not obtained through story progression either (save for one, the other is purchased as any ordinary weapon), but through taking over districts in New Hades and other forms of mini-game completion. There were a decent amount of animated cutscenes (yes, I love the in-game cutscenes, it's a thing I've grown fond of when you can see your own Saint in one) but a lot of them relied on actual cuts in the cutscenes from one scene to another through a story book page reading in between, it's a nice style but it really shows that they opted not to animate these scenes entirely and just went for story book page camera pans. Many interactions with the supporting cast lacked a cutscene altogether except for an introductory cutscene the first time your character meets them.\n\nThe final boss battle  was severely underwhelming, Satan teleports around his temple taunting you with the same lines over and over again and repeating the same tricks with no additional dialogue as you progress whatsoever. It was basically the same thing as the final battle with Zinyak in SR4 minus the dramatic undertones and in a smaller room. You kick Satan's ♥♥♥, and you get to choose 5 different possible endings, each of these probably connecting to SR5.\n\nOne thing I was disappointed about was probably the potential for this game to have replayability: it has close to no replayability, sure there are 5 different endings but you could just revert your save and try again. I think the lack of customization options was one of the biggest problems here in addition to that. I'm fine with not being able to customize the outfits of Johnny and Kinzie, but no other customization options whatsoever? Also besides all of that, my major disappointment is the lack of screen time for Kinzie - she was advertised to have an equivalent role in saving the Boss, but where is Kinzie in the majority of the cutscenes? The cutscenes always show Johnny as the main character taking the reigns and Kinzie will always be the supporting character instead, the whole game is a homage to Johnny Gat's awesomeness (hence the play on words in the title), but could they not have gave Kinzie just the same amount of glory? Yes, you still have the ability to play as Kinzie but the point here is the cutscenes and certain addressings do not acknowledge Kinzie's presence and role in the rescue the same way it does for Johnny.\n\nNow I've had a lot to complain about but let's get to the good parts of this game including improvements on old aspects. First of all, let's bring up the flying mechanics, at first they were a little hard to grasp but after a while of playing the game and gaining upgrades, flying is probably the best part about this game in all honesty. While in Saints Row IV I still liked driving around because the cars looked cool and over long distances driving can be a lot easier not to mention running around gets a little boring after a while, in Gat out of Hell the cars are rust buckets of the cars from SR4 and have no radio or aesthetic modifications. It's pretty obvious that you were probably not expected to pay attention to any of these cars because there are only about 6 different vehicles in this game - a majority of which are reskinned models. It's apparent that you were expected to enjoy the flight mechanics, which I really did! Some of the new superpowers are pretty cool too, though they are a little nerfed down version of their SR4 counterparts, certain base functions of the versions from SR4 need to be unlocked as upgrades instead. The 7 deadly sin weapons are great too, they are all fantastic in their own right, as are some of the new hell-themed weapons included along as part of the base armory, and if you're not comfortable with new weapons, Ultor has supplied you with some guns you are more familiar with.\n\nAs I have mentioned earlier, most of the story is great too. What the game lacks in quantity they make up for in quality, in the form of supporting characters, three historical figures who are now residents in hell: (DJ) Shakespeare, Blackbeard the pirate and Vlad the Impaler. Casted along side them are old enemies: Viola(holy ♥♥♥♥ I did not know she was voiced by Sasha Grey) and Kiki Dewynter, Dane Vogel of Ultor and Dex from all the way back in the first game, which you kill whenever you see what's left of his body wandering the streets over and over again. The dialogue between all of the characters in this game are golden, Vlad has spent hundreds of years in agony in an asylum using children's music as psychological torture, Blackbeard has been hiding away trying to rebuild his ship, Shakespeare speaks in the 3rd person and is also a DJ at a nightclub in hell, Dane Vogel is still an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who wants to make money no matter what, and the Dewynter sisters are still making enemies. Your interactions with these characters are interesting to say the least, but there was potential for so much more character development among them all, especially for Jezebel, Satan's sweet daughter who refuses to agree to her arranged marriage with the Boss.\n\nI'm gonna close this review with my least favorite and most favorite part of this game: the amount of content presented to further the plot progression AND my favorite part would be the one scene in the game where Satan and Jezebel, Johnny and Kinzie perform a full-on Disney musical duet number with each other which goes on for a little under 5 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvAJIVSLqK4","January 24, 2015","false","5.8"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","12","24","2","4"

I couldn't wait to finish it so I could stop playing it. There's a lot that makes the Saint's Row series one of the most amazing things to me, and this is NOT it. I was looking forward to a cool game where I can play as one of the best Saints and play a cool game. If what I had been promised was literally playing SR3, 4 and everything after it so far, AGAIN, with literally nothing different and really lame. It dragged a lot with the things that weren't good, the missions, which I loved in Saints Row 4, seemed misplaced and absolutely clunky in this game, and really, I can't say ANYTHING was really fun in this game, and I really do love the SR games, but this stripped everything I loved from the series, and even my love of Gat couldn't make me love this game. Really, by the end, all I could ask myself was, "When do I get to play as my boss with the cool wings?" because honestly, the fully upgraded wings was the only good thing in this game, and I would have been happier if it had been another DLC for Saint's Row 4, at least then, I wouldn't feel as cheated out of 20$ for something totally glitchy and unfinished.

The expectation is that while the game isn't going to be a 30 or 60 hour game that you'll at least get a decent chunk of time out of it. When playing through Gat out of Hell I actively was trying to avoid triggering the story events. Somehow I still managed to complete the story in a mere three hours. Meaning if I had been actively trying to blow through the story rather than just flying around collecting clusters I'd have probably ironed it out in an hour and a half to two hours.\n\nThe activities are very short, and especially with the time bonus you can acquire for your character very easily it is almost trivial to get gold. So again, I screwed around and wasted time and I still managed to blow through it in about five and a half hours. What that means is if I was just going balls to the wall, the entire map could have been 100% completed in three hours. All that remains after that is some "kill this many of this enemy" challenges that equates to busy work just to justify the achievement to play the game for 20 hours.\n\nI enjoy killing stuff in games as much as the next person, but if I've 100% completed the game I'm very unlikely to just sit there killing things just to complete pointless challenges when I could very easily direct my time toward a different game which would provide me with a much more fufilling experience. Having pointless little challenges is fine. They did it well enough in SR3, and SR4. Having it be the bulk of the game is terrible.\n\nThe flying feels good. The gameplay is very similar to SR4, and thus remains fun. Gameplay wise the game is enjoyable. If this was a simple five dollar DLC for SR4 it would have been fine. As a stand alone game for 20 bucks you will likely feel as if you have been ripped off. It's for that reason I am unable to recommend the game.","January 27, 2015","false","14.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Sure, the “story,” which I have put in quotation marks more than once now, only lasts a meager four hours playing at a casual pace, taking time to distract yourself with collecting things, the game is repetitive and easy, there’s no customization, I have zero desire to go back and get the last thirty to forty percent completion, and, despite letting you choose your own ending, you get an anticlimactic ten second clip with one more joke that’s completely unrelated to the ending you chose, the game isn’t completely terrible. It just isn’t substantial enough to really feel that it warranted its own release. I’m not even sure it could have been justified as DLC. Saints Row story DLC is traditionally short but still has a real, full-fledged story behind it. The Loyalty missions in the previous game gave insight into the characters and served a real purpose. You don’t get any of that here. The premise was a promising one but the result is just so half-baked that I can’t really recommend it at the current price. If you got in on the GameStop pricing error, and you’re a Saints Row fan already, you will probably get your money’s worth. I can’t say that many others will, though.","January 26, 2015","false","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The historical characters are super cool, and the little mentions of various Saints Row characters are a nice little touch. As always there is the ridiculousness of Saints Row games around every corner! Plus the plethera of strange guns is always welcome in my mind. The have brought back the mini-games from Saints Row IV but they put a hellish spin on it. You also get the option to play as Gat or Kenzie which is super cool. And YOU GET TO FLY!!!!! There are somethings that arn't here that I wish were. Such as the clothing stores and car custimization. This is minor but I dislike the gun stores being vending machines.

There are just very few main missions, most of game stands on activities and city takeover to get satan mad, but its fun. You can play as everyones favorite Johnny Gat or Kinzie to save boss (Character loads from SR4 if you have one). New activites and new takeover minigames, including stealing APC s, killing Dex. Also there are collectables, again clusters and texts, comments and pirate chests, drive thrus. Instead of people, now are souls and instead of police are demons, its fun... new weapons (7 special ones). Did i say you meet again with Nade and Ultor, there is also pirate and shakespeare, and some musical concert at half of story in the game.\nFlying is better, now you have wings, and also harder until you get used. About bad things, less vehicles, no radio, no tuning, no clothes and things like that...\nAfter all, its a great game and alot of fun... Short, for story goes about 4 hours, 8 hours to do 100%.\n\nDid i mention that demons drive monstertrucks, and Ambulance kills people instead of saving them? :D What more do you need?","January 24, 2015","true","10.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","5","10","3","0"

What I mean is, that you'll probably find yourself finishing the game before you get some actual nice stuff, and feel, like it lasted too short. Maybe it'll get a bit longer in an update, or something, but I'm already quite far through and barely know the area.\nThe second thing being, that it feels too much like a reskin of Saints Row IV. Although it's not so bad, but you'll notice the similiarities pretty quickly. If you've never played any Saints Row, disregard it and go try out the game. But if you did play Saints Row IV, reconsider your purchase. Because some of the side missions are pretty much the same with a different name.\n\n\nAnyways, the game is enjoyable and has nice graphics, multiple enemies, unusual humor, regular weirdness, and will make you enjoy it while it lasts. 8/10","January 23, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love open world games but I play them for the engaging story that needs to be woven through.  Saints Row The Third and Saints Row IV got this exactly right, with the story parts and the open world distractions finishing up at about the same time.  Sleeping Dogs (another favourite) did a great job of this too.\n\nGat Out Of Hell frustrated me because at the point where the story endgame began (and was fairly unavoidable), the "city takeover" parts were only about half done.  In fact, it was so early on that I was convinced this must be a false ending with more stuff still to happen.  Once the story was finished, I didn't feel much motivation to go back and finish the other bits because my story-focused brain told me they didn't "matter".\n\nThis is mostly irritating because it would be really easily fixed.  Push the arbitrary endgame-trigger back.  Demand more city-conquest before the boss battle.  That way I get a few more hours where my actions "matter" before it turns into a storybook again.\n\nOn the other hand, the city takeover stuff WAS fun.  The flight mechanic was well put together and the silly weapons like the armchair gave it a sense of whimsy.  Thumbs up, but only just.  Buy it when it's on sale, or just replay an earlier Saints Row game.","September 7, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure, the “story,” which I have put in quotation marks more than once now, only lasts a meager four hours playing at a casual pace, taking time to distract yourself with collecting things, the game is repetitive and easy, there’s no customization, I have zero desire to go back and get the last thirty to forty percent completion, and, despite letting you choose your own ending, you get an anticlimactic ten second clip with one more joke that’s completely unrelated to the ending you chose, the game isn’t completely terrible. It just isn’t substantial enough to really feel that it warranted its own release. I’m not even sure it could have been justified as DLC. Saints Row story DLC is traditionally short but still has a real, full-fledged story behind it. The Loyalty missions in the previous game gave insight into the characters and served a real purpose. You don’t get any of that here. The premise was a promising one but the result is just so half-baked that I can’t really recommend it at the current price. If you got in on the GameStop pricing error, and you’re a Saints Row fan already, you will probably get your money’s worth.

I felt Gat out of Hell was so short that after I finished it i was still in the state of hype i got from starting up the game in the first place.\n\nwhile i do pick on alot of things this game has done badly i will admit the overal looks and design of the game and its characters are fairly badass and certainly make the experience fun and enjoyable. like, who the hell doesn't find it fun to fly around hell then slam down, sit your ♥♥♥ into a recliner and blow up a bunch of demons? the concept alone sounds enjoyable. the guns are all very creative aside from the obvious ones that are there for those who prefer normal guns which cant really be excused. i found it kinda easy once i got the Diamond sting as it basically buffed itself up to max level in less than 10 minutes and carried me through the rest of the game.\n\nThe game itself I feel i enjoyed but it was more because I spent so long hyped up for this i found it hard not to enjoy it. i WANT to say this is a good fun game but with so many things I feel i can pick out wrong with it i cannot help but say its more worth a pass or watching someone play it on youtube. i got this on preorder for a fair amount but i cant see me saying i'd pay much more than £7.50 for this game which is more or less double what steam is asking for it at the point i write this. It hurts me so much to see this after the games from the past in the series because i love the Saints Row series to death. To sum my end views on this game in one scentance i feel this one is a good scentance to go with:\n"Mad?

Its ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥''\nI had no idea how to start this review so I took a suggestion from a friend of mine. Annnyyyyway, where do I start with this game?  Aight i'm going to go through the pro's/ con's of the game and then I'll let you decide if you think its worth or not. And Just FYI i'm a big SR fan so for me, It was a a must buy no matter how ♥♥♥♥ it was going to be.\nPro's:\n.The humor's still there.\n. Coop's bangin as ususal!\n. You get to play as Johnny Gat\n. New powers I guess.. If you like that kind of ♥♥♥♥.\n. You get to punch Saitan in the face.\n. Some cool new activites I guess.\n. New guns and ♥♥♥♥.\n. Get to see some old characters that we knew and hated.\nCon's:\n. Really short but for £15, what did you expect?\n. Distinct lack of music, I had to play my own gangster music through Pandora.. (Recommend you do the same!)\n. Can't customize jack ♥♥♥♥.. Everything we loved about SR, customizing our cars, our clothes everything.\n. These ♥♥♥♥ing powers again man, whats the point in having cars when you can run and fly faster then one?\n. No story progression but to be honest, I didnt expect there to be.\n. Those ♥♥♥♥ cunt clusters.\n. No shops what so ever to go in. You don't even have a crib with strippers.(I MEAN COME ON!?!?!)\n\nSooo Overall do I think you should buy it? It heavily depends on who you are. If you are a big SR fan debating wheather to get it or not, Id say  go for it! Its pretty entertaining and for £15, why not? Just don't expect anything huge. Its pretty good for what you get though I guess.  If you're new to the series just dont bother.. Just buy SR2. The best in the series and you can get it really cheap! I think you can get it on ♥♥♥ for like a Quid so just buy it.\nA rate out of 10? 6.5/10\n","January 28, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","1","2","4","0"

This stand alone expansion is made by a different studio and you can tell, it is bare bones to the extreme, the second you start playing it you can immediately tell that little to no effort was put into the development of this title.  You can tell this was done with limited everything by the lack of any meaningful voice acting and cutscenes everything is portrayed through still images.  There is no interaction between Kinsey or Jonny they are just clones of each other in game with no variation between the two.  Your homies are pretty much nonexistent unlike how they were in SR4 so have fun not getting attached to them at all, since there is no main ship you can interact with them that way either so again pointless.  There is no driving force behind the "main story' you just continue to do activities until the arbitrary amount have been done, forced and clearly done as a cash out in order to garner just a bit more money just because it's a Saints Row title.  There is no variation for the population of Hell just the same husk, again adding to the empty or hollow feeling of the title more showing off that it is simply at mod for Saints Row 4 but a very poorly made one with the original voice actors in it.\n\nOne of the major selling points makes a big deal about you helping out major figure heads of Hell, historical figures who ended up in Hell and so on but there is no tangible connection between the player and those NPCs, unlike SR4.  Thus this makes doing quests for them completely pointless and nothing but wastes of time.\n\nWhen you look at your activity and quest log you'll understand what everyone means, there are literally pages of lines worth of these "quests" and after doing a few of them or heck if you did all of them in previous games then you will get very tired of them VERY quickly thus making this game a complete waste of time.\n\nI kept looking at the sheer number of “quests” that the game had listed and realized how little there was to this game, if any which made me reconsider even bothering to fully play through this stand alone SR4 expansion.  This is a shame because I enjoyed 4 quite a bit, it had it’s low times as some of the activities are rather difficult especially alone but at least you had something that was story driven, but this……… no there is zero story here and I really don’t even care enough at this point with my meager one hour and forty minute play through but I just can’t push through the ridiculous number of pointless activities just to increase my “Satan attention bar” beyond what I have now.\n\nI can not suggest this; to me this is not really more of the same Saints Row rather it is just a skin covering a title that revolves around doing activities as it’s main source of gameplay.  If you enjoy doing SR’s activities that much then go for it, otherwise……just stay way.  This will be one of the first games that I just can not push myself to beat and I will be attempting to get a refund because there is really nothing to this title and it’s very sad.  This title commits a major cardinal gaming sin, which is making the player feel like he/she is doing busy work rather then progressing through the game through activities and quests.","March 5","false","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Because some of the side missions are pretty much the same with a different name.\n\n\nAnyways, the game is enjoyable and has nice graphics, multiple enemies, unusual humor, regular weirdness, and will make you enjoy it while it lasts. 8/10","January 23, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really enjoyed all previous SR games, so I just couldn't miss this one. Here's my experience:\n\nPros\n• Gameplay is familiar to the SR4 (which was pretty good).\n• Good flying mechanics.\n• Several different endings.\n\nCons\n• Very short.\n• There is no main quest, just a lot of sidequests.\n• Can't customize your character.\n• Can't customize your cars (but who need cars here?)\n• All neutral npc have same model.\n\nOverall, I can't say that game is bad, it's easy playing and fun as previous titles, but the disappointing part is that it ends just in the time when you start enjoying it. And that's kinda sad.","January 4","true","166.9"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","0"

The story was short so I felt like I needed to do and complete EVERYTHING! I got allot more imersed in this game and I felt so overwhelmd even though it was such a short game. The one thing I don't (well two) like is that you cannot create a character and the cost of the game. The cost of this game should not be what it is, it's $20 USD and I think for how much gameplay it offers, is not acceptable.

Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington find themself from New Hades, on their path to save the president of the United States.\nWhat you can expect from the game is variety of weapons, variety of deamons to use as target practise and of course humor which is at this point more than expected from the series.\n\nAs Saints Row IV can be thought as a big expansion to Saints Row: The Third, Gat out of hell is just more compressed version of it. Maybe the most noticeable change is the new enviroment, which includes enough astonishing architechture and designing. For example the Infernal landscape is filled with lava rivers and fires. and that's about it from the changes.\nIn Gat out of hell, they have drastically cutted down the amount of main missions to a mere handful. And most of the story is proceeded with a cutscene. Though, they do work for the storyline very well, butt still they don't immerse the player as they did In previous versions.\n\nStoryline itself isn't that astonishing, because the main objective is to help citizens of new hades to take power off from the Satan itself. Plot has it's funny moments though, as can be expected from the game. For example, In one part the whole thing turns into a musical, and punchlines are thrown every now and then. Sadly the story can be finished pretty quickly, and after seeing the 'the end'' text, it feels like the stroy was written in a hurry.\n\nCapturing zones frome the grip of infernal demons can be done by doing various missions. Most of the tasks are already familiar from previous Saints Rows, where they acted as optional side-missions. But now, some of these distractions are included in the main missions. new addition to these is a mode called salvation. Where the player has to catch souls falling to the inferno (even though you are ending up in hell, doesn't mean you can't get a soft landing)\n\nOn technical point of view Gat out of hell continues with the old scheme, and at least I couldn't see any screen tearing or frame drops. Yet the graphical presentation was quite the same as in Saints Row 3 & 4. And hopefully Saints Row V will offer more eye candy to the players.\n\nBut the series have never been a mindblower on visual side, but more built on the good humor and atmosphere which sometimes rises in very absubrd spheres. Dialogue is still fresh and tasty, and guns bring joy and variety to the player. Or what does a armchair-a-geddon sound like.\n\nJohnny and Kinzie learn new skills along the way, so you don't have to play for too long with average joe. Powers are upgradeable the same way as they were in IV, and the basic skills are useable very early in the game, but after few upgrades you noticed your character to be a hulking death machine who eats iron and ♥♥♥♥♥ barbwire, so therefore it is good for more experienced players to start with harder difficulties right off the bat.\n\nGame itself is relatively fast paced and the main storyline can be completed in about 5-7 hours, you can easily double that by hunting for all the collectibles and trinkets around this infernal sandbox.\n\nAs a summary, though Gat out of hell has it's pro's and cons, It still can offer entertainement for couple evenings and nicely seems tied to the previous installation.\n\n7/10 (Not regretting of the time I used to this)\n\n","January 25, 2015","true","30.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtnapalm/recommended/301910/","sgtnapalm","Cherchez la Steak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtnapalm/","272 products in account","Gat out of Hell is an entertaining standalone expansion to Saints Row IV. You play as Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington in an entirely new world on a quest to rescue the Boss (your player character in the previous four games.)\n\nA side effect of this is that the game is nowhere near as in-depth as the previous games. You cannot customize your wardrobe or appearance past swapping between Johnny and Kinzie, car customization has been totally removed, there is no radio soundtrack (though there is an original ambient score similar to playing IV with no radio,) and the story mode is very bare-bones. It sort of returns to the form of previous games where you need to cause havoc in order to trigger cut scenes that progress the plot. There are very few actual story missions, as the story is mostly told through these cut scenes.\n\nInstead, the game is mostly progressed by completing the activities scattered through the world. Most of these are classics returning from the previous games with some added twists, but the most fun new one is Salvation, where you must save souls that fall from the sky by flying around to catch them.\n\nWhat story there is, however, is immensely satisfying. It gave Johnny Gat some much needed character development, some old faces return, and nearly every inch of the script is hilarious. Dane Vogel in particular surprised me, with an immensely witty dry streak that adds tons of character to the world. There are some blemishes, though. The game is very self-aware, almost to a fault. Sometimes it hits it out of the park, but other times it relies on breaking the fourth wall.\n\nThe setting is wonderful. Hell is a very interesting environment. There is no time cycle but the map is definitely more interesting than Steelport. Each district is remarkably different, from the slums that look like they were taken straight out of Francis Lawrence’s Constantine to a bustling entertainment district to a dystopian metropolitan city.\n\nThe game builds heavily on the super power framework from IV. Some oldies but goodies return such as blast, stomp, and aura. Some have been reworked such as super jump becoming flight. Finally, some are entirely new such as the summon ability. The powers are very similar, but they’re different enough to make the game interesting again. Flight alone is graceful, exhilarating, and immensely fun to use, breathing life into the somewhat dated superpower framework.\n\nThe new weapons are very satisfying. A few biblical plagues appear as an explosive frog launcher and a locust swarm launcher. The Seven Deadly Sins appear as the Seven Deadly Weapons, each immensely satisfying to use. The Sloth gun is just a recliner that you drive around with giant miniguns and rocket launchers, and the Greed gun shoots diamons that force enemies to drop more money (which is convenient because the varied weapons will require tons and tons of money to fully upgrade.) Unlike most other open-world sandbox titles, money is actually an important resource to collect and spend.\n\nThe graphics are average. The game isn’t ugly, but it’s not amazing either. The game will run fine and the world loading is responsive considering the insane speeds you can achieve, but it won’t be winning any awards either.\n\nThe bottom line is that this is more of the same of Saints Row IV with a few added twists. If you’re a fan of IV, Saints Row, or superpower games in general, you will have a good time with this and will see your $20 well spent for the entertainment you will get out of it. If you are somewhat interested but are otherwise bored with IV, you might want to wait for this to go on sale. If you disliked the Third and IV outright, this game will do little to sway you and you should give it a pass.\n\nNote: I got this game for $5 thanks to the Gamestop pricing glitch.","January 26, 2015","true","24.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","45","5","11","7","0"

Play as Gat or Kinzie to takeover Hell. Lots of minigames, activities, challenges and tons of collectibles as the others were. The flight system with wings in this game is in my opinion amazing and I personally liked it more than the superpowers in IV, bit tricky to learn at first but becomes very fun very fast. Of course with every saints row game the weapons are always a selling point and it didnt disappoint this time around with the Seven Deadly Sins. What this game lacks however is a structured main campaign and from that a lack of dialogue. If you are a fan of saints row then this will be just as fun as the third and IV, but if you are semi-new to the series you might find the lack of campaign very off-putting and as such I can only recommend this game to true fans and if you arn't wait until a sale to pick it up. 7/10","January 31, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Having about the same amount of replay value (maybe less) as its predecessors, the story is just about as ludicrous as a Saint's Row game always is, but even the story admits that the plot is very loosely tied together and a stretch altogether. It's basically a Metalocalypse-themed SRIV, only you get to play as Kinzie or Johnny Gat; the powers/missions/challenges/bosses/weapons are all pretty much the same, with minor hellish modifications. Got it on sale, and it has the cheap thrills of achievements & trading cards, so again, I'm not knocking the game... I just can't recommend it to others in all honesty. SR3 was the best in my opinion, but I would even recommend SRIV over Gat out of Hell: SRIV had a longer gameplay, and more of a story with characters to follow so I found it much more entertaining. 4/10","May 8","false","4.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

On the plus side, you play as Gat, or Kenzie, and thats nice. Flying is a lot of fun, as is the wacky weapons, like the Frog Launcher. The story seems to be good in Saints Row fashion, and I suppose the voice acters do their part. But frankly, there is a lot of cons. The game has some really low-res textures, even on Ultra. I've been playing for an hour, and it says i'm 15% done with the game. The guns lack any ooph, and there isn't as many as I'd like. There isn't any selectable music, which makes me cry.

However, there just doesn't seem to be any flow to this.  Every goal and quest is repetitive, the plot is almost completely narrative in 2D book form compared to the original cutscenes with the main characters, and it's WAY too quick for any other Saints Row game.  Beat the "main" story in under 5 hours, which is very dis-satisfying.  Not to mention it also took away the creativity of making your own main character, which has been a statement of the entire Saints Row series since the very beginning.\n\nHowever, I do have to admit that I enjoyed this game.  It brought back some old and favorite mechanics from SR4, along with some more new wacky weapon choices and powers (personal favorites being the super stomp and armchair machine gun).  And although the flying was a pain in the ♥♥♥ learning the first time (both keyboard and gamepad), it was probably my favorite part of the game.\n\nI'm hoping this is just a filler of sorts, to keep long-standing SR fans sated for a while.  Hopefully something bigger comes out of this for everyone.\n\nI'll be generous and give this a 7/10.  Even with the problems I had, it was still a fun game.  Still had the SR silliness to it, and kept me entertained for a couple hours.","January 20, 2015","true","17.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Is it fun? Ya. As one of the people who bought it for $5 at Gamestop, I'm naturally going to think its worth the money.  I mean, I have a few problems, and pros, with the game. On the plus side, you play as Gat, or Kenzie, and thats nice. Flying is a lot of fun, as is the wacky weapons, like the Frog Launcher. The story seems to be good in Saints Row fashion, and I suppose the voice acters do their part. But frankly, there is a lot of cons. The game has some really low-res textures, even on Ultra. I've been playing for an hour, and it says i'm 15% done with the game. The guns lack any ooph, and there isn't as many as I'd like. There isn't any selectable music, which makes me cry. And you cant pick the clothes of anyone. But, as I've said earlier, I'll have enough fun to warrent $5, and can see someone spending $10, MAYBE $15 if you're a diehard SR Fan, but not $20.","January 20, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It was just fun to play something after SR4.  One thing to note is that there is no specific story quest line. You know what the point of the story is but...   you just have to do enough of the challenges and raise the "♥♥♥♥ of the devil" meter high enough then you can do the last stand with satan himself.

Let me just tell you all that if you're holding back because of the fact that you don't play as your created character, please don't! BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW! You should have pre-ordered it, because you get the jester's skull. Which is pretty much OP when you fully upgrade it.  This game is even more fun then IV.  The fact that this game takes place in a different setting is a much needed asset. Excellent comedic writing, woice acting. NEW POWERS!  You get to play as Kinzie of you want. (IDK why you'd want to, but it's there.) The wackyness is cut down a bit to make up for the ambience and  atmosphere of hell, but it's still there. Clusters make a return as well.  The ending is well worth the price of $20. I don't wanna spoil it for you all. If you're a fan of the Siants Row series. Even if you're an old school grumbling fan like me. You'll love this game.\n\nAt the end of tbe day, Saint's Row Gat out of Hell get a 9 all day.  If they would have innovated a bit more(Trust me, they did)  with the side activities and some other aspects and features, instead of just reskinning them for the hell setting. (they have some new ones, but they use most of the old ones from Staints Row III and IV.

I beat it in about 10-11 hours dragging my feet and goofing off. As an old fan of things like Edward Lee's "City Infernal" series, the old "Heroes In Hell" anthologies, and the now-ancient video game "Escape From Hell", I really enjoyed this. That said it would have been great if there was more of it, and they had come up with more game rather than just adding some more whacky weapons to Saint's Row IV along with some new overlays for the buildings and vehicles.\n\nFan's of Saint's Row, or the "goofy/campy hell" niche subgenera of fantasy will really enjoy this.\n\nI will also say that the game is almost 100% Johnny-centric, while you can play as Kinzie for most of the game the entire story defaults to Johnny in cut scenes and everything else. While she has a fair amont of dialogue, really it seemed like they tacked her onto the product due to popularity within the franchise and because Volition wanted to avoid getting attacked like Ubisoft for not having a playable female option (this is just a guess). Perhaps if Volition overcomes it's financial troubles (if your a fan of SR I recommend supporting this game to hopefully help the Dev) Kinzie will get her own game/major expansion.\n\nEDIT: As of 12:38 EST 1/21/2015 the Steam achievements for this game do not function (I know I completed the game, and while they came up in game they did not sync with my Steam account). I'm not a big achievement hunter, but for some this might be a big deal. Otherwise the game had few serious errors or glitches when I played it, but that's to be expected as this is almost identical to SR IV so they probably banged out most of the problems with that installment.","January 21, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowRFox/recommended/301910/","ShadowRFox","ShadowRFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowRFox/","225 products in account","The game uses the same gameplay as Saints Row IV. If you loved Saints Row IV, then you're going to enjoy this. Where Saints Row IV took place in matrix version of Steel Port and revolved around you fighting an alien empire, Gat out of Hell take place in hell and involve you fighting demons to free The Protagonist of the Saints Row game. Because you're  playing as Kinzie and Johnny Gat, there is no customizing feature or clothing features. You can switch between the two or have a friend play with you in Co-op.\n\nThe classics mini-games such as mayhem, fraud, wave survivals, and few others make a return. Like Saints Row IV you have super powers, but this time with a demonic spin on them, so wielding feel very similar to Saints Row IV. The new feature is flight. You gain angelic wings early on and the sky become your playground. Soaring is similar to the glide ability but this time you can gain altitude and control your speed. If you slow down too much or run out of stamina then you'll drop like a rock.\n\nThe new weapons are interesting. You can definitely tell the creators had fun coming up with even wackier weapons this time. With weapons based on the 10 plagues of Egypt and the 7 deadly sins, destroying demons with your weapons become more entertaining.\n\nThe game isn't that long. You could easily go through it in a couple of hours, but the real value come from enjoy hell and torturing the residents with your weapons and powers. Overall it a good add on to Saints Row IV, if you enjoyed that game then you will love this.","January 20, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean, you get a small city to play in, with a small array of guns/powers similar to that of SR4, and you get a silly little story to tie it all together. It works well enough. On the hardest difficulty, I've died a few times too, so at least it's not a pushover game. I'd say $20 is a tad too high, but for $5 or $10 it's perfect.

So some things will be cut out. And to be honest, I don't mind not having the customization of vehicles too much, but the radio was nice because you could listen to classical music while running people over. It was funny. And speaking of funny, the game is funny and has very witty remarks to things. They even bring people back from older games such as Dex, The ultor boss guy (I haven't played the second. I have it on steam but I mainly played the third on xbox), and those twins (Once again, haven't played second or first).

I pre-ordered it for $20, and I was fully aware that this was intended to be a stand-alone DLC/Game. However, the moment I start the game up, we get a cut-scene where the president, while aboard the Alien Ship, has a birthday party where a Ouija Board is found. The board sucks the President into hell, whereupon Kenzie and Gat immediately go after him to retrieve him. That was a 5 minute Cut-scene. After you get to Hell, you immediately get a car, drive to a waypoint, and you get ANOTHER cut-scene explaining why this has happened. THEN YOU GET WINGS!! You get to fly for 1 second in the beginning. You also immediately get super-speed and super jump, instead of earning it like in Saints Row 4. Your goal is to acquire the help of 4 main forces in the section of Hell you're in; Blackbeard, the Twins from Saints Row the Third, Shakespeare, and one other person. I played for 20 minutes, and I accidentally found my way to Blackbeard, where I had to help him with a STUPID RAT INFESTATION!! After 3 minutes of trying to shoot these things, Blackbeard pulls out a Hammer that does shockwaves. Why the hell didn't he  use it before?? I couldn't do it. I could not.\n\nIf this review helps you, then good. If you still plan on getting it, then I hope you have a higher tolerance then I do.\n\n3/10. I wish I got a refund, but the option wasn't available at the time.","November 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have very mix feeling about the game.\n\nIt still the same gameplay as SR4 which is a good thing. New map broken into 5 area. Some new powers. 7 deadly sins guns are fun...... If you can find them. Which I feel is a bad thing. No real story mission. You just go off doing the activites  and when you finish enough of them. You get a cutscene and teleport back to your starting base. These happens 3 times and then you fight satan. Which is a very disappointing boss battle.\n\nThey did some changes to the jump/glide power to make flight. Which is very buggy. Randomly falling out of the sky. Touching a building can have you spinning out of control or teleporting around the map. Weak tell you hit get to a high enough level to get flying to almost stop draining your stam. Which at that point you have to worry about SAM sights.\n\nI enjoyed the game but it is so short and almost no replay vaule. I would say wait to get it on sale.\n","January 24, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alleroz/recommended/301910/","Alleroz","Alleroz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alleroz/","27 products in account","English Review - A análise em PT-BR tá mais pra baixo.\nThis review has some spoilers.\n\nI recommend this game not for its excellent story or character development , but simply because of how much fun it is to play it .\nThe first cutscene of the game shows the remaing members of the saints celebrating Kinzie's birthday with a Ouija Board, they ask if the Boss is one day going to be married, after that, Matt is in charge and Jhonny and Kinzie in hell.\nThere is not much to add beyond this point, you meet some old characters, some historical ones, punch satan in the face and that's it, end game. But the activities the put in the game, the flying system, new powers, weapons, make the game worth it, at least at a discount.\nNow, if you are a old school Saints Row fan, don't even get near this game, it will only disappoint you, but if you liked Saints Row 3, and 4, you will probably like this one too.\n\nPros:\n- Really fun to play;\n- You could jump with style in SR4 and now you can fly;\n- Punch satan in the face;\n- Kinzie;\n- Armchair-a-geddon.\n\nCons:\n- You can't play with your Boss after you finish the game;\n- Radio stations removed;\n- No customization.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGraphics : 7/10 - For a game released in 2015 they could have put a more effort into it.\nSoundtrack : 1/10 - Radio stations got removed from the game, there is not much to review here.\nGameplay : 10/10 - Flying, running, fighting, all of this is really fun and fluid, all guns have different abilities and using then either to play the game or just to earn the achievements is incredibly fun to do.\n\nAnálise em Português Essa análise tem alguns spoilers.\n\nEu recomendo esse jogo não pela história excelente ou pelo desenvolvimento dos personagens, mas simplesmente porque é muito divertido jogá-lo.\nA primeira cutscene do jogo mostra os membros que sobraram dos Saints comemorando o aniversário da Kinzie com um jogo de Ouija , eles perguntam ao tabuleiro se o Boss algum dia vai se casar, logo depois, Matt está no comando e Jhonny e Kinzie no inferno.\nDepois disso não tem muito o que adicionar, você se encontra com personagens antigos da série e com alguns personagens históricos também, dá uma surra no capeta e pronto, o jogo acabou. Mas as atividades adicionadas, o sistema de voar, novos poderes e armas fazem o jogo valer a pena, pelo menos com um disconto.\nMas se você é um fã dos jogos antigos de Saints Row, não chegue new perto desse, você sairá desapontado, porém se você gostous de Saints Row 3 e 4 provavelmente vai gostar desse também.\n\nPros:\n- Muito divertido;\n- No SR4 você pulava com estilo, agora você voa;\n- Dê uma surra no capeta;\n- Kinzie;\n- Armchair-a-geddon.\n\nCons:\n- Você não pode jogar com o seu personagem depois que o jogo termina;\n- Estações de rádio foram removidas;\n- Sem customização.\n\n\nConclusão\n\nGráficos : 7/10 - Pra um jogo lançado em 2015 os desenvolvedores não parecem ter se esforçado tanto.\nSoundtrack : 1/10 - As estações de rádio foram removidas, não tem muita coisa pra analisar.\nGameplay : 10/10 - Voar, correr e lutar são divertidos e fluidos, todas as armas tem diferentes habilidades e usar elas tanto jogando quanto apenas pra conseguir conquistas é algo incrivelmente divertido.","January 21","true","34.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While not being particularly extensive, the game builds on the "super powers" engine from SR4, to create an awesome and memorable atmosphere in hell. Angelic flight was a ton of fun to play with, although I was disappointed at how labored the controls were to get used to, particularly when maneuverability in the previous installment was so buttery smooth and natural.\nThe side activities are EXTREMELY enjoyable, in particular hijacking armored vehicles and searching for the coveted "Seven Deadly weapons", were a ton of fun. The story and cutscenes themselves are more than worthy of the Saints Row moniker, by way of pure absurdist hilarity alone. But overall I found myself wishing for a bit more in terms of exploration and discovery. While finally being able to play as fan favorite, Johnny Gat was a fantastic treat, I must admit to some of the flavor being lost in not taking on the legions of darkness as my own unique character, or being able to roam hell's streets decked out in all manner of hellish armors and crazy getups (hell mascot suit, anyone?). Perhaps a "Game+" expansion, allowing players to design or import their own characters from SR4 upon completion is in order?\nStill,I found 'Gat Out Of Hell' to be a fun and thoroughly enjoyable ride, worth the price of admission. 7/10.","February 24, 2015","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I enjoyed it for the cutscenes and the musical number made me laugh loud because it came so unexpected and was just awesome.\n\nThe general gameplay though is simply minigames, some are known from the previous game like Mayhem others have changed a bit like Blazing which is now Hellblazing. There are new wacky weapons in the form of the "7 Deadly Sins" which are lot of fun and the narration and the cutscenes are amazing, even better than in SR4 and meeting old "friends" is always great.\n\nStill, it just feels like there could've been so much more. "Saints Row V - Saints go to Hell" is what comes to my mind. All the Saints in Hell fighting against Satan while meeting evil people from earth's History while pulling one-liners.  Here instead we meet Vlad the Impaler in a Prison that looks like a Kindergarten with children's music and it's fun - especially when you let the music go for a while, with Vlad begging you to stop it. But that's all you get from him. The loyalty mission is just a bunch of mini games stringed together and afterwards, you never see him again. There's a ton of potential in this setting that Volition ignored because it's just a small stand alone expansion.\n\nThe biggest minus is the lack of music. You hear music in buildings like the Nightclub with DJ Shakespeare but there are no radio stations and nothing going one while you collect clusters to upgrade your superpowers. Music made that exercise fun in SR4, here it becomes a burden - unless you put on some music outside the game. SR4 music works great, i did a Mayhem mission with Mötley Crüe's Shout at the Devil, which works just great.\n\nAll in all i was entertained (so a thumbs up because i knew it would be a short game), the cutscenes are fun and unexpected, the Gat & Kinzie Team works great since they're different character wise and they make that clear in the first few minutes. Still i think the scenario is wasted on such a short (5 hours for me without doing all the same mini games over and over again 20 times) game. I want Saints in Hell with Pierce singing Meat Loafs Bat out of Hell with the player character!","January 24, 2015","true","10.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

There's no story missions, no crazy cutscenes and vehicles are once again useless.\n\nThe gameplay however is the same Saint's Row 4 goodness (but a lot lighter in terms of content) with a revised flight system that I really enjoyed and it made the collectible hunt a lot more interesting.

This game is essentially a huge hand job to Johnny Gat and his fans, so if you're into Gat this game is deffinetely for you. I honsetly don't know if people really like Gat that much or if the devs do, so I can't really tell if this is fan service or a fetish game. Although, I haven't played the first 2 Saints Row games yet, so maybe I'm just missing something. But anyway, the other playable charecter is Kinzie, who barely even pops up in the cutscenes regardless if you're playing as her or not, she was likely included in the game just because having two Gats in multiplayer wouldn't make much sense. Also worth noting is that the game completely lacks any sort of charecter or vehicle costumization, which was a huge part of the charm of Saits Row games. The campaign is painfully short, you can easily complete it in under 4 hours while getting distracted by all the collectables. Gat out of Hell doesn't have as much of a "Saints Rowish atmosphere" as the other games did, in my opinion, it's a bit too over-the-top even for Saints Row standarts. But I have to admit, the flying system is pretty fun once you get the hang of it and upgrade it enough, but that's pretty much the only good thing about the game. The active powers aren't that different from the ones in Saints Row IV, with the exeption of the summoning one. Overall the game lacks content and in now way stands up to its predecessor, it's a DLC at best compared to Saints Row IV.\n\nSo, in conclusion, do not buy this unless you're a hardcore Gat fan, just stick with Saints Row IV, you'll get way more enjoyment and content out of that one.","May 17","false","4.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Sadly, it almost feels a shame for these great additions to be confined to such a scaled back entry in the franchise, with no real quests or character development of note, and a much smaller selection of gear at your disposal. That being said, the game is still worth the asking price, and a great excuse to engage in more mindless Saints Row action.","February 12","true","14.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

ZERO customization (unless you buy the pack that lets you have purple wings, whoopdefriggindoo), all shops have been replaced by a vending machine which only lets you buy/upgrade your weapons. The weapons are mostly average accept for the armchair, which is pretty decent. I really only ever found the stomp power useful, the rest I barely touched. The map is fairly small, the activities are sub-par, the musical number gave me a headache, and the whole watered down story is told through a storybook style narration. Six different endings, so that's cool I suppose, it's the only thing that adds any form of replay value to the game. You DO get to shoot Satan in the face, so there's that.

I've played through and beaten every one of them.  I like the story, I like the characters, I like the gameplay.  Unfortunately, I don't like this game.\n\nMy biggest complaints about SR3 and SR4 were 'if you want my character to act like Jonny Gat, just let me play as Jonny Gat.'  Well, here you go.  You're Jonny Gat (or Kenzie Kensington, if you prefer), off to save the boss.  The story seems like typical SR stuff, which is to say that it's brimming with absurdity.  All of the typical Saints Row flavor is mostly present, but this game really feels rough.  There are some parts that are just really choppy for no apparent reason, especially considering earlier iterations of this franchise had identical or similar mechanics that just worked better.  Combat pretty much sucks.  Melee finishers have this earlier-mentioned choppiness problem, and gunplay feels unsatisfying.  There's nothing really new here in terms of gameplay either, it's just more Saints Row IV but with a different environment, which coincidentally makes it feel like a janky version of Crackdown, not just in feel, but in style.\n\nI can't reccomend this game at it's full retail price, and I really can't move past a 'well, if you've got nothing else to do' reccomendation on this title even if it's on sale.  If you're a diehard Saints Row fan, there might be something here for you but if you've never played a game in this franchise but are considering this one, skip it, spend a couple extra dollars and give SR3 or SR4 a shot instead, which are both more enjoyable games.  For that matter, 1 is probably better, because it does a better job being a GTA clone than this game does as a Crackdown one.","May 25","false","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not worth the prize at all. It's way overpriced for such short and trashy standalone dlc. This is not even for the most hardcore Saints Row fans. Story took 3 hours to complete and felt very underwealming. Add couple hours in if you want to complete every mission and collect all the stuff.\n\nThe game is too easy. Missions are boring and there is little to no varierity. Music is boring and forgettable. Hell is boring all around. Everything feels soulless. The writing is level of a bad fan fiction that makes you chuckle here and there once or twice if you try hard enough. Gat and Kinzie have never felt this boring and unlikeable ever. You just keep asking to yourself why can't you play as your own boss the whole time...\n\nOnly goods things ares Satan's singing voice but you can just go check the musical trailer in YouTube. And another fun things is flying with the wings. Otherwise it's just a bad reskin of SR4. And instead of aliens, you fight against demons that all look the same and have no personality. So does the 'citizens' as well who are just these dull grey ghouls.\n\nI had to force myself to play through to see the ending but that was very disappointing too and not worth playing through to see the alternative endings. This left a really bad taste in my mouth and I hope the devs take break from SR franchice for couple years and come back with fresh new ideas and locations instead of this garbage.\n\nBiggest dissapointment in this franchice so far.","January 23, 2015","false","4.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

The gameplay is generally the same; use super powers to take down enemies, cause destruction and all that nonsensical fun. The new locale is Hell, though it's just Steelport reconfigured to look like Hell. They do it well enough that it feels somewhat new though so that is also nice. What really shines above all else in this game is the power of flight. The ability to fly really increases the freedom of the game and makes it even more fun. However, all this aside, Saints Row: Gat out of Hell lacks the personality that IV developed. While you can play Gat or Kenzie, they don't have many lines recorded from them and there are no customizations for them, not even clothing. It may seem unnecessary to quibble over something as that, but the customizabble asthetic is what gave Saints Row it's extra personality.\n\nOverall, Gat out of Hell is a good game if you enjoyed Saints Row IV. The game's storyline is mostly all activities, but the activities are a bit more fun than IV. I'd say it's definately worth the 20 price tag if you enjoyed IV, otherwise I'd say you might wanna pass on it until a price drop.","January 21, 2015","true","11.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

In the five hours I have played this game, I have beaten the game and collected about 80% of the collectibles, all of which playing on the hardest difficulty.\n\nIt still looks like Saints Row and is full of comedic value that the series is known for, but it doesn't feel like Saints Row anymore. It may be just me but going through the story, I feel the voice actors and dialouge just feels out of it; the setting is getting tired and old as it takes place in Steelport, yet again; the only difference now is a different color filter and floating islands that the clusters taken from SR4 can be thrown onto.\n\nAs for gameplay, if you've played SR4, Gat out of Hell is more the same, except now you can fly with wings. Same movement powers, same attack powers, (slam, blast, etc.) same upgrades, really just the same of everything. The only real exception from this to SR4 is that guns are different. Gone is the Dubstep gun and to replace it, they added seven unique weapons to fill each weapon type that coorelate to seven sins, which were nice to unlock.\n\nOverall, don't bother spending $20 on this unless you're a diehard fan for there simply is not enough content to warrant it. The story can be beaten in a good hour or two and getting all of the collectibles would probably take the same amount of time.","January 21, 2015","false","5.1"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

Flying around on flaming angel wings before slamming into the ground, throwing imps at people and smiting them with the hammer of god was fun the first time.\n\nAnd then that was it.\n\nThe game does not have a storyline; it has side missions stapled onto static cutscenes. Think Diablo 3's intermission cutscenes, but instead of character dialogue, you had the general quest text from WoW or something. And at least WoW had coherent storylines.\n\nThe weapons were limited and rather unimpressive. A Lay-Z-Boy with twin chainguns and rocket launchers sounds awesome, but its execution is... lacking.\n\nAnd of course, the best scenes in the game are reserved for computer-generated "awesome", rather than players organically succeeding (or ♥♥♥♥ing up, as the case may be).\n\nI have no idea how much money I spent on the pre-order for this, and honestly, I really don't want to remember.

I did have fun playing this game, I even feel like I got my money's worth, but I just couldn't reccomend it at the $20 price point. There are a lot of good games at or below that price (most notably, Saint's Row 3 and 4), that will give you a lot more enjoyment for your dollar than will Gat Out Of Hell. There are three places where this installment just doesn't live up to it's price tag: the length of the game, the features in the game, and the scope of the game.\n\nFirst, this game is really short. It's not terribly short as DLC goes, but like I said above, there are lots of full games for $20 with significantly more content. I had beaten the story missions in about five hours playing at a liesurely pace, taking time to fly around, getting some collectibles, and doing a few challenges. After about 11 hours I have a 99% completion, with just a few of the annoying challenges to go. Again, for DLC that isn't bad, but in context a game like Saint's Row 4 or Red Faction: Guerilla will last for weeks, and these things are the same price.\n\nSecond, this game lacks a lot of the features of previous Saint's Row games. There are no radio stations. There are no physical shops to visit. There are no character costumes or weapon skins. There are no cribs. There is no cell phone to call in support. Calling this game a DLC is a little bit misleading, because DLC expands a game you've already bought, and even if Gat Out Of Hell didn't include its own shops and costumes, an actual expansion to the game would have carried these things over from Saint's Row 4. Instead, Gat Out of Hell is actually a stripped down version of Saint's Row 4, with a new area and story, but missing many traditional Saint's Row features. If your idea of Hell is harassing the damned with the Violator, while dressed as a genki girl... well too bad, because you can't do that here.\n\nFinally, this game doesn't accomplish much. The game map is pretty small, and once you get your wings and a couple upgrades it will only take you a minute or two to fly from end to end. The game doesn't really tie up any of the loose ends from Saint's Row 4, nor does it do anything for Johnny's character, as the end is too ambiguous to mean anything for the series long-term (they are also extremely unsatisfying). Neither Johnny or Kinzie grow or change as characters, despite their hellish context, which is a little bit of a let down. Kinzie might be the biggest let-down about this game for me, because I really thought that Hell would be a great place to explore her unique brand of crazy. Unfortunately, she's completely flat as a character, and it's pretty obvious that despite being a playable character, she got very little attention. Johnny is much funnier and fleshed out in this adventure, as well as reacting more authentically to being in Hell.\n\nI got this game for $20, and I thought it was worth it just being big fan of the Saint's Row games and the developer Volition, but I can't really recommend it. If you've played all of the Saint's Row games and you're just itching for more, then you should pick up Gat Out Of Hell. If you haven't played Saint's Row Before, you should pick up Saint's Row 3 and 4 before playing this. There are just too many great games out there for $20 to justify buying this for the story or gameplay.","January 20, 2015","false","12.0"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","0"

It also boasts a rather high price point for a game that seems to be completeable at a 80% in only 7h's of gameplay. though the collecting of the spirits to unlock abilities development is far more fun then in original (especially once you reduce the stamina cost to fly.)\n\nother then that had issues when first starting up some times where it would go in small screen and i had close and relaunch to get full since it doesnt have a full screen option when displaying in a small window. (excessive explosions also caused me to crash a few times with one of the later game pistols...) ( and character from past while the did appear werent really indepth or developed much in the story line)\n\nrecommend waiting a bit for a lower pricepoint of around 10 0r 12 dollars for what i played through it seems a bit to high, though atleast it apparently gives you a choice in ending videos. still a good thing to play if your craving a bit more saints row reck and destroy or want to try flying but it certainly is no grand expansion peice and lacks the same feel of saints row when taking over the city","January 21, 2015","false","8.7"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DreamsRPGs/recommended/301910/","DreamsRPGs","DreamsRPGs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DreamsRPGs/","128 products in account","Well, not to jump on the rant list butttttt...... I feel this is very lacking in many ways, and rather disappointing despite the price. However, I am hoping, maybe, they come out with a DLC or two to fix what I feel this is missing. First I am and have been for awhile, a huge fan of the Saints Row Games. I have played from Saints Row 2 through this one, so I feel I do have some room to speak on it. If you just really want to have all the Saints Row games, or just really want to play a Saints Row styled game *say if you never played any of*, this is perfect. However it feels more like a demo than an actual part of the game itself.\n\nDon't misunderstand, its still awesome and fun to play as well as a bit challenging for most of us, it just feels very limited to those of us who are familiar with the series already. I also understand that this was "originally" being designed as a DLC for Saints Row 4 rather that a game in itself and  I am sure all of this has been overstated already, but here's my pros and cons on it:\n\nPros:\nYou can play as Johnny Gat "Who doesn't want be Johnny Gat" and/or Kinzie Kensington *forgive me if I got her name wrong*, which is a bit of a surprise to me given her characters nature *I would have assumed either Shandi or Asha but it very cool to see Kinsie getting to play more or a role other than her typical one* .\n\nI guess this is more for those of us familiar to the previous Saints Row games, but you get to meet some of the former characters from past games, like Daine *again forgive me if I misspelled the name, though I was surprised not to find Tanya anywhere and a bit shocked that both the twins are. Sorry if that was spoiler! XD * as well as you FINALLY get some justice on Dex for what he did to you and the Saints *just deserts I think*. Google or look it up on youtube if your unaware who any of these are, and you'll understand. XD\n\nThe story concept to me is "out o the blue" so to speak. Not an idea I would have thought of or did I see coming with *without adding any spoilers* all that happens in Saints Row 4, so this is very cool *no pun intended XD *\n\nDespite the smaller map size, its still fun and interesting to me to just freeroam and see things. I always loved that part in any game, and find it interesting in comparison to previous versions.\n\nThere's still a lot to do, again, despite the smaller map. I guess I'm a very "slow" player because I tend to take my time doing everything, and I try to take in the full aspects as well as the content offered, be it just the overall astetics of the games design. I know the game itself only offers a few hours of actual game driven play, then one or two more with the side quest/missions, but if your like me and take your time playing, its still very rewarding, none the less.\n\nCons:\nNot a big surprise to me given Johnny's signature outfit and looks, but no character customization, not even cloths? Rather sad I think considering the wide variety of outfits in most of the games thus far, and I looked forward to seeing what kind of outfits were going to be available in "Hell", not to mention seeing Kinzie in some of the various outfits, if even the "hell" versions of.\n\nNo hommies, gang members, crew to back you up or help *aka meat shields XD * which is also rather surprising to me in that I would have thought at least some of them would have went ....down Not up? XD  None the less, its still rather disappointing.\n\nNo vehicle customization, which again is very sad and disappointing to me as I have always loved customizing and tweaking my vehicles, and which also has previously been available.\n\nNo vehicle saves/storage, also very sad and disappointing to me, considering previous versions, but being that there are no hommies thus no vehicle delivery or garages, and no customizations for them as well as the fact there are only like for or five types of vehicles in "hell", and considering this is not another full Saints Row game, still I find this sad and disappointing.\n\nNo weapon customizations again leaving me feeling a bit dissapointed as i usually prefered the reskins version as to the standard skins.\n\nNo radios/radio stations, just the in game music itself. This really shocked me in a couple different ways. I have always loved the radios in the Saints Row games for the music and often for the commentaries *Zynak in Saints Row 4 comes to mind* not to mention I loved the added feel the music provided to the game experience so I was very shocked as well as disappointed about this one. Saints Row has always had some of the best in game music in my opinion.\n\nNo cheat codes. OK, this isn't a big issue to me, however I add it because when I get tired of doing the missions, quest, or roaming about I love turning them on and just creating overall havoc and destroying stuff just for fun, without having to worry about burning through my ammo, and getting killed, and just seeing the game mechanics as I run amock creating overall mayhem....its Just a thing to me. XD\n\nNo Genki... Now, I didn't expect a Murder Brawl, or M.O.M. or anything like that, but was rather disappointed not to see Professor Genki  just roaming about as in Saints Row 4, which I thought would be both awesome and sensible because after all, he's Genki! XD\n\nOnly one safe house....again This isn't a big issue to me, considering Saints Row 4 *again trying not to add any spoilers*, but would be nice, none the less, to have more than just the one, even if the fact that you have no wardrobe or vehicle storage ability rather makes them pointless anyway, but still I find it a bit disappointing, even if the map itself isn't that big overall.\n\nTo wrap this up finally, I know this isn't meant to be Saints Row 5, nor was it designed to be, but again it feels very lacking and limited, and more like a demo of the actual game. Still despite all its fun and interesting.\n\nRecommend.....at this time, no....simply due to what it lacks overall. As I said a few times, it feels more like a demo version of the game that you have to buy, rather than get free to try, and not a part of the game itself. Understanding though it was designed to be a DLC that they opted to make a stand alone, and not an actual game. Hopefully they may add more content to it and then I would recommend it, but unless you just want a lesser feel of Saints Row without having to buy the actual game, or just want it as part of the series, then not at this time.\n","January 21, 2015","false","16.6"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","6","23","0","0"

So I played it til I beat it. It took literally 3 hours to do all the missions and side quests. I got a 65% completion and I know the other 35% is collectables and activities I didn't get gold on. My only main complaint is that there's this activity called Hellblazing. It's exactly like it's older incarnations in 3 and 4 but it's unplayable unless you farm a ♥♥♥♥ ton of clusters and upgrade your flight. Also, in the older Saints Row's ou could do missions at your own pace which I really loved. This, however, does not allow that. As soon as you fill up a meter by causing carnage (which is literally the whole game), it just jumps you into the mission!

You get super powers, flight, super speed, and the same four basic special abilites as in the previous entry to the series.  Only difference is now it's arcane rather than Matrix-ey stuff.  You do the normal saints row things - time trial races, blow up fences, ragdoll in traffic, et cetera - and then after you complete about half the available activities the ending becomes available and then you're done. I beat the game in 3 hours, not 100% mind, but that would at best double the play time (edit: 7:55, 97%, so I was a little off).\n\nIt's an example of what a good $10 DLC should be, unfortunately it's a $20 standalone game.

Taking you up to a further 5 hours for full takeover, however after that you have challenges and collectibles. The one reason I continued playing this game was to collect all the collectibles. Once you collect one, you can't stop the rampage as you start flying through the map on a collecting spree...\n\nEnough of that... SR: GooH is a standalone expansion for the superhero expansion of SR, SR 4. A very short expansion however you will find yourself having so much fun as you sit in your comfy chair, blasting rockets at the countless demons. The weapons feel fresh and new as you collect the 7 deadly sins, which are epic in their own little way. The game is practically end game SR where you going around completing all the diversions and finishing off activities which tbh can be a bit grindy as there is only 4 different minigames as the game focuses more on one-off diversions such as Spires and Extraction Facilities.\n\nDespite the grindy nature of this expansion, GooH introduces a new map, Hell, which consists of 5 different areas (6 counting the tower) which can be traversed using the new fly ability which is far superior compared to SR4's glide. Mentioning abilities, Blast, Stomp and Aura all return from the last game (They have different elements howeveR) but Telekenisis is replaced by my new favourite, Summon, which allows you to spawn in little imps, towers or a big legionaire (which is quite good). The game has few good quests, with the Upgrading Halo one and Final Battle really only being the unique quests.\n\nInstead of playing as the Saints Boss, you play as Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington, both characters are good picks by the developers. However, character customization is completely removed (not even the ability to change your clothes) though players can find 30 amusing commentaries for both the characters\n\nSummary\nSoundtrack 5/10 No radio stations???\nGameplay 9/10 -1 point for grinding and unispiring missions\nStory 8/10 Reintroducing the DeWynters and Dane as main characters were good, but they needed more time in the spotlight.\nGraphics 10/10 Despite there being a lot of red, the graphics were perfect, can't really complete, I guess it is hell","January 30, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is light hearted and enjoyable, keeping with the over the top comedy that makes the saints row franchise so enjoyable. The game play expands on the superpowers that you get in SR4 with theme appropriate alterations such as demon summoning and worship aura. I love the new flying mechanics, in my opinion it is an improvement from the last games gliding system. Bonus: you get to play as Gat or Kinzie, as much as I love the character I have made since SR1 its really cool stepping out of their shoes. Its also nice that they brought back some of the old NPCs from previous games. It should be said that this is more of an expansion than a stand alone game. I had fun playing it but it only took me 7.5 hours to beat the story, complete all side activities, fully power up my character, and find all collectables, which is actually pretty good. In previous games it sometimes felt like a chore to get gold in every activity, or even to complete every activity, but in this game they didn't over do it.\n\nTL;DR Game is short but good, I had lots of fun playing it and highly recommend it.\nEdit: Spoiler alert\n\n\n\n\nNathan Fillion is God","January 31, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And is still as sleazy as steelport.\n-The musical number was pretty sweet.\n-A chance to play as Johnny and Kinzie? Yes please.\n-Bee gun.\n-The arcane powers were a worthy act to follow the superpowers from SRIV. Seriously fun.\n-They somehow made Fraud even more fun. Watching a shuffling husk getting hit by a car and bouncing away is just so satisfying.\n-Audio logs were great.\n-You basically you just have to cause as much of a scene to get Satans attention. You didn't ever have to follow the objectives to do so. Just play minigames. Not sure if this is a pro or con.\n\nCons:\n-There's only 3 story based missions. The rest of the game is just rehashed minigames.\n-Could of used more old Saints Row characters. I didn't really care for Blackbeard or whatever.\n-Way too many collectables. Why collect souls when you can buy them by the bulk?\n-No music and a lot of reused animations.\n-Quite buggy. Often during survival minigames, enemies wouldn't spawn and I would have to restart the activity.\n-Not that funny. And the funny lines were often repeated and beaten into the ground.\n-Always refers to the player and the President as a he, regardless if playing as Kinzie or if you have a female boss.\n-Only replayablility would be in collecting the needless amount of achievements.\n-5 endings which were okay but not really needed and will probably be forgotten in Saints Row 5.\n-Not worth £15. Nah.\n\nAs a fan of the Saints Row series, I was really excited for a new installment but was incredibly disapointed. I would defiently not recommend it to a non-fan. And if you are a Saints Row fan, I'd only recommend you buy it to fund the next Saints Row game. Sorry Volition, I love you but....

The powers are back, but feel almost entirely different, aside from sprinting, but hey, how different can you make running, with the new flying system actually living up to its name. The flight mechanic is a big highlight in the game, with enough speed to make up for no summonable vehicles, nimble enough not to be frustrating, and just bad ♥♥♥ enough to feel satisfying using it for the majority of the short game. Guns, while limited, are still satisfying, with a few hidden gems clearly having been lovingly made.

I mean, there are mods, but you CAN actually hear Hell's radio in the cars below. But not listen to it. I loved Saints series not just cause this is pure badassness, but, from the Third part, I loved it as it gave me DUBSTEP. Fresh and juicy and all like wobble-throttle. This game ain't got new Datsik songs, ain't no Doctor P, just nothing.\n\nSo that were the cons. Only. A short game? ♥♥♥♥ no, it took me lots of times to just 50% everything.

The sandbox elements of SR have always been fun, but the brilliant campaign missions (think Murderbowl, the freefall firefight at the beginning of SR3, and the MGS inspired stealth mission in SR4) are what really make me love the series. So in that regard, GooH falls a bit short.\n\nBut at a much cheaper price tag than a full game, it does a lot of things really well. Hell is a well made environment with some nice touches. The new weapons are as creative, fun, and devastating as ever. If you want to run around just destroying hundreds of demons, they definitely give you the right tools. The powers are also a nice improvement from SR4. Flying is especially of note as an improvement. It genuinely feels good to soar around hell on the wings, especially when they are full upgraded. The other powers are pretty familiar if you played SR4, but have some creative and useful improvements. But seriously, I can't stress it enough, the flying is probably the best part. It just handles so well...\n\nFor a $20 game, I completely enjoyed the 8ish hour experience of completing all of the activities. But here's where I have a major problem with GooH. I've 100%'d the rest of the series (in the case of SR3, I've done it twice), and I'm going to 100% this game as well. The challenges have always been fairly grindy in past releases, but it's a little absurd in GooH. Unfortunately, the challenges weren't scaled down at all from SR3 or 4, so it takes way longer to complete them all after you've completed the rest of the game. Killing 1000 enemies with super powers wasn't a huge deal in the 30ish hour SR4, but is just hours of post game grinding in the 8 hour GooH. I have already more than doubled my "story" playtime just doing challenges, and I still have 1 left, which will take me at least an hour or two. It honestly lost a lot of it's fun about 6 hours of grinding kills ago. Obviously this will only be a problem for completionists, but it has certainly annoyed me.\n\nI also had a bug with the upgrade all powers achievement not unlocking (possibly due to me playing connected to my friend's game). Achievement bugs are always annoying, but this one is especially so as I'm going to have to start a new game, play my way back up to the max level (20), and go around collecting all 940 souls again. Hours of getting the same collectables for the second time is not exactly how I want to end my game play experience, but at least you can collect most of them while flying, so at least I can enjoy that.\n\nAll in all, you should play GooH if you enjoyed SR3 and 4. Don't expect the same full experience as either of those, but does  feature the same kind of wacky fun. I definitely wouldn't recommend GooH to anyone who hasn't played (or enjoyed) either of the 2 previous releases, but there's plenty to love here for any Saint looking for some more murder time fun time.","February 6, 2015","true","41.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the same very lazy missions as SR4 where they just have you do the already available side quests. The difference being that this is a $20 game, so lazy is kinda OK.

The first story quest to pop up after the intro was to save some of your friends. Saving the twins is SUPER difficult. So I decided to do other things to level up. 20 minutes later I was fighting Satan and still never finished rescuing everyone.

I don't think so.\nFirst to just get this out of the way.  This is just a glorified DLC.  Just so there's no misconception on what's really happening.\n\n\nThe Good:\nThe powers are back and in many ways better than originally implimented in SR4 flight is a ton of fun once you get used to it.\nIt's still got that  Saints stupid humor.\nThis iteration has seemingly been built better for multiplayer including activities and missions that appear to really be better with friends.\nThe Meh\nThe activities are still repetitive mini-games.\nThe Ugly\nBecause some activties are better for co-op it makes doing them in single player more annoying than rewarding.\nTerritorial control seems meaningless for some reason.\nSome powers feel more useless than others.\nThe lack of story is truely disappointing. While able to boast that there are multiple endings to the game it just doesn't have quite the same feeling of other Saints games by removing a vast majority of the cast and limiting the game to only a few core missions most of which are isolated without the banter or camaraderie it just leaves the game feeling like it's missing its heart.\nFinal Verdict:\nI'm split on this one, for any fans of the series as a whole (not just 3 & 4) but of the whole story this could be a good value to you in spite of  it's flaws. To people who may have just started recently and not have a history with the entire series this game will probably seem like a hollow shell of a stand alone and may even sour you on the franchise. So for those of you who only recently joined I'd advise you pick it up on steam sale for cheap if you're bored.\n\nThis is fan service at it's finest to give people who consider Gat their main  man a chance to take the wheel for once instead of riding shotgun.","January 26, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Except for flight, all the powers, majority of weapons are the same exact ones you had in SR4 but instead of the source being hacking a virtual world, it is from Lucifers Halo. The names are different but functionally the same for most of them. The anti-power grenades from the previous game are back, but unexplained how it affects the supposedly most powerful artifact in the universe. Chasing down the orbs is back but now they're Sin Orbs. Once your notoriety gets high enough a boss plops down with the same hellfire rain from the last game and basically the same fight mechanics.\n\nUnfortunately with so much same, whats different? Mostly just the look of the map and that you can play as Gat or Kinzie.  Also the introduction of flying is really cool.\n\nBut a bigger question is whats lost? For me the most important thing missing is the cultivation of the plot. Despite having some potentially really interesting characters in the game like Shakespeare & Vlad the Impaler there is almost nothing done with them. In lieu of almost any cutscenes in the game a still frame storybook device was used. So every time you expect to some really interesting interaction it cuts to the storybook and everything is summarised for you. No pop music/culture infused action moments\n\nAlso gone any type of customization. No private garages or helopads, no customizing vehicles, changing clothes, etc ...\nWhereas in previous games you could pick different homies and see their different interactions with one another, you can pick no one here so thats gone. SR4 was full of celebrity homies like Roddy Piper & Keith David with fun interactions.\n\nThis is basically the most Soulless version of Saints Row out of the last 3 or more versions. Describing this as basically a collection of the mini games from previous versions is mostly correct. The battle with Satan is weak and arguably much easier than reaching max notoriety.\n\nI recommend this game but not at full price.\n\nVolition, High Voltage whoever is calling the shots, take some time off, take a year or two and make a next gen Saints Row. Another installment like this on an already 4+ year old game engine could sink the franchise","January 26, 2015","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, the flying is what really sets this apart. I love murder time-fun time as much as the next Boss, but the  flying is such a massive improvement over SR4, it really feels like you have wings. I could flap through these maps for hours on end without even thinking about it. "Blazing" challenges were fun before, they're even better now. When SR4's flying felt a bit 2.5D, the flying here really feels 3D.\n\n8/10, if I ever get stuck in a video game, I want to be Kinzie in SR: Gat out of Hell.\n\n\nAlso no more idiotic quicktime events on miniboss demon kills, hell yeah!","January 26, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game you have angelic wings and can fly around. The flying mechanic and ability is the best thing they could have made, but it makes cars and super speed useless.\n\nSprinting can only get you so far and is probably the last thing you will do before taking to the sky at high speeds once you get it down. The terrain is super hard to navigate with just sprinting alone and overall flying will be the better choice in the end, not that I am complaining.\n\nI loved it but it's only because I am a sucker for wings and flying capabilities.\n\nThe activities isn't what made Saints Row great though, the hilarious story missions did and characters, which this has little to none of that besides finding the other minor/returning characters in this new world and  saving them in the end when they get captured.\n\nOtherwise there's not much else to do besides mess around and collect stuff. That is the end goal. I have to say Gat is an awesome character and I loved when they brought him back, but this expansion lacked a lot and should not have been a stand-alone expansion at all.\n\nAt most this should have a been a dlc continuing on from the last Saints Row. It would have been perfect...\n\nIf you like wings/flying, the activities from Saints Row 4, new guns, new powers, and Gat or Kinzie. I'd say it would be worth buying at full price if that is what you are into.\n\nIf not, I'd say wait for the price to drop to like $5 or less because it is not worth the $20.","January 22, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes up what SR does well (weapons, combat style, skyscraper set pieces etc) and cuts out a lot the shortcomings (annoying repetition on NPC 'pickle' phrases) but doesn't supply much more than that.  Mostly filler challenges and some loyalty and side quests and the chance to enjoy flight. BUT in the tradition of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, GOOH also has a musical to enjoy.

No witty references to Elvira, or other pop, zombie, horror, vampire, werewolf culture appear at all.\n\nHad this title recieved a proper numbered sequel budget it could have easily transitioned into a stand alone, spin-off franchise while still maintaining Saints Row status without officially being Saints Row 5 (if they had done what they originally did with SR4, which originally was slated as a SR3 expansion then released as a full game I wouldn't hesitate so much over the lack of what's missing.)\n\nSo much potential goes unused because it IS an 'expandalone' DLC.

I don't know why they would do this but, they did.\n\nDon't get me wrong though. I do like the game. Not love, but like.\n\nI would love the game but there's some things that give it bad points. So... I'll make the list of positives and negatives.\n\nPro:\n\n1. You get to play as Gat.\n\nThis is cool since we get to dive into the charicter more. It kind of felt like there was a disconnection from the other charicters in the series other then the boss. This made it so we got to know the charicter more. Which is kinda cool.\n\n2. Get to play as Kenzi (did I spell that right?)\n\nSame as above.\n\n3. Creative weapons.\n\nSelf explanitory.\n\n4. Flight. (which is the biggest positive)\n\nThe flight mechanics alone in this game (assuming you have your controls set up right) are fantastic in my opinion.\nThey make the game. I find myself flying around, swooping through wrecked buildings and over lava pits just for the fun of flying. Wishing that flying in saints row 4 was like this. (Maybe a mod could be done to transfer it? Or DLC for a winged flight power in 4?)\n\nThe Cons:\n\n1. Short story.\n\nIt felt like they rushed it. The story -is- good, but it just seems like they needed more charicter interaction.\n\n2. Shortage of mini-games\n\nThe games they do have are fun. But there's a lot of diversity which has gone missing.\n\n3. Teaser of what they could have had in ending.\n\nI'm not going to give it away here, but I'm going to say that after you get some things acomplished, there's a story book telling ending segment that tells a story that would have been better if played through. At first when I saw it I thought "Cool! I get to face them to then?" but no. It's only part of a story instead. A small segment. Almost trollish really. I'm -hoping- they add them in through a patch or something but... anyways....\n\nFor those of you who have played through it you'll know what I mean. For those who haven't it's a negative point for the moment unless they add it as a not too expensive or free DLC.\n\n4. The settings were hellishly dull (pun intended).\n\nI understand that it's hell and there's not too much you can do with it. They -were- creative with what they had. But... why did they have to spend -all- the time in hell? They couldn't have gone back to the ship? Maybe seen the alien ship some? Had some nightmare dream scenes in other settings to save people from?\n\nThe part of 4 that makes it such a negative point is that we have such beautiful flight controls, but enjoying them is hard to do because the scene is always so terrible and... well... hellish.\n\nOver all I give the game 7/10 for the time being depending on what they do with it in the future. Given the right DLC (given it's not too pricey) I may revisit this review.\n","January 23, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfourtunetly, for me the game came out on the 23rd of January.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nSo this game is just a copy of SR 4 but with better graphics (for graphics freaks) and better handeling. The flight took me by surprise, since I didn't eaven look at the pictures. So I thought it was the best feature in the game. But I was wrong. The best feature was the *WRATH* Sistem, in witch you try to get the attention of Satan. And every so often you would get musical numbers beetween the characters. The plot is great, altho a bit clishe.\n\nAll round summs.:\nI don't recomend the game at FULL price, becouse it is a bit of a weaker copy of SR4, so buy SR4 and wait for the games price to go down.\n\nBUT I DO RECOMEND buying it, becouse it is verry enyojable. The Co-op mode is amazing and its VERRY polished!\n\n","January 23, 2015","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/minalkra/recommended/301910/","minalkra","minalkra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/minalkra/","104 products in account","I'll have to give this a down.  I love the Saint's Row series for the sheer insanity that comes to pass in an open world sandbox style game.  It's like the GTA series without the bad gangsta story lines and stupid moralizing - like the original GTA series in fact.  But this stand-alone isn't a very good look at it.\n\nThe setting is, uhm, unique.  Having a Judeo-Christian hell theme was a bold choice and I fully support it.  The mythology of modern religions is very evocative and has some very interesting characters.  But the actual hell-scape is rather small and lacks some of the variability of, say, Dante's Divine Comedy.  Flames are all fine and dandy but give us an ice-scape or an eternal desert, eh?  The very basic demonic soldiery and denizens are also a tad disappointing but they're effective for what they are - just wish it would be more creative in this realm.\n\nThe combat is too frantic for me, as well.  Sorry but I was one of those types to invest heavily in Notoriety decomposition upgrades.  I prefer a more relaxed combat pace where I can approach things in a methodical manner.  Having swarms of demonic enemies every two steps put me off on actually doing anything in-game.  And the size of the game world is telling.  Because there is only one type of purchasable good (weapons) that is bought from a vending machine (usually out in the open where demons will gleefully pick you off with cars), there's no easy and ready way of clearing Notoriety.  Which - for me - made combat a chore to slog through instead of something fun to do.\n\nThe powers are a retread of Saints Row IV pretty much.  They are quickly gained but it takes a long time to upgrade them and the collectathon to do so isn't as fun as SRIV in my opinion.  It felt like I was just doing the same thing in a smaller space.\n\nNow here's the kicker and what really made me go from 'so-so' to a firm downvote: character customization.  Hey, hey.  Hey Volition?  No one cares about Gat.  Not really.  We care about the Boss.  You know, the player stand-in?  Gat might be your big wet dream but not ours.  If I want to play as Doctor Manhatten with a rocket launcher, well damn it - that's what I want to do.  And throwing the female players a bone in the form of Kinzie only works if SHE IS MENTIONED IN THE CUTSCENES.  Or is playable at the end boss.  Or, well, anything takes into account her existence.\n\nSo, this is a 'not recommended' on my end.  It's fun but that fun is tempered with a huge helping of 'same old' from SRIV, the lack of anything really pulling me back to the game, lack of customization and too-frantic and not much fun constant combat - as well as a bit of a missed opportunity in the setting.  Wait till the price drops by half or more and then give it a go.","February 28, 2015","false","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can a Saint reach Sainthood? (Vaguely reference from tatoos in SR3 and 4, so Volition had an idea to start with.)  Can Gat catch the eye of the Big G on borrowed wings? Will the Saint bring fire and brimstone upon the universe?! Who knows.\n\nThe content is sufficient enough to urguably price at $20. Wait till it's on sale on Steam. Had it been priced 12.99 I'd say pick it up right now and enjoy. GOOH hovers in a weird area between where it feels more like DLC and less standalone and missed out on being a full release. It takes up what SR does well (weapons, combat style, skyscraper set pieces etc) and cuts out a lot the shortcomings (annoying repetition on NPC 'pickle' phrases) but doesn't supply much more than that.  Mostly filler challenges and some loyalty and side quests and the chance to enjoy flight. BUT in the tradition of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, GOOH also has a musical to enjoy. WOOT!\n\nBe aware of no additional clothing customizations, so you can't dress up as a Grim Reaper or Mistress of the Dark, no licensed soundtrack (just have Michael's 'Thriller' nearby and other pop-horror tunes handy or maybe Meatloaf, Audioslave, Godsmack, Gorillaz, Queens of the Stoneage, Benni Benasi, Pitbull on standby.) No witty references to Elvira, or other pop, zombie, horror, vampire, werewolf culture appear at all.\n\nHad this title recieved a proper numbered sequel budget it could have easily transitioned into a stand alone, spin-off franchise while still maintaining Saints Row status without officially being Saints Row 5 (if they had done what they originally did with SR4, which originally was slated as a SR3 expansion then released as a full game I wouldn't hesitate so much over the lack of what's missing.)\n\nSo much potential goes unused because it IS an 'expandalone' DLC.

I don't know why they would do this but, they did.\n\nDon't get me wrong though. I do like the game. Not love, but like.\n\nI would love the game but there's some things that give it bad points. So... I'll make the list of positives and negatives.\n\nPro:\n\n1. You get to play as Gat.\n\nThis is cool since we get to dive into the charicter more. It kind of felt like there was a disconnection from the other charicters in the series other then the boss. This made it so we got to know the charicter more. Which is kinda cool.\n\n2. Get to play as Kenzi (did I spell that right?)\n\nSame as above.\n\n3. Creative weapons.\n\nSelf explanitory.\n\n4. Flight. (which is the biggest positive)\n\nThe flight mechanics alone in this game (assuming you have your controls set up right) are fantastic in my opinion.\nThey make the game. I find myself flying around, swooping through wrecked buildings and over lava pits just for the fun of flying. Wishing that flying in saints row 4 was like this. (Maybe a mod could be done to transfer it? Or DLC for a winged flight power in 4?)\n\nThe Cons:\n\n1. Short story.\n\nIt felt like they rushed it. The story -is- good, but it just seems like they needed more charicter interaction.\n\n2. Shortage of mini-games\n\nThe games they do have are fun. But there's a lot of diversity which has gone missing.\n\n3. Teaser of what they could have had in ending.\n\nI'm not going to give it away here, but I'm going to say that after you get some things acomplished, there's a story book telling ending segment that tells a story that would have been better if played through. At first when I saw it I thought "Cool! I get to face them to then?" but no. It's only part of a story instead. A small segment. Almost trollish really. I'm -hoping- they add them in through a patch or something but... anyways....\n\nFor those of you who have played through it you'll know what I mean. For those who haven't it's a negative point for the moment unless they add it as a not too expensive or free DLC.\n\n4. The settings were hellishly dull (pun intended).\n\nI understand that it's hell and there's not too much you can do with it. They -were- creative with what they had. But... why did they have to spend -all- the time in hell? They couldn't have gone back to the ship? Maybe seen the alien ship some? Had some nightmare dream scenes in other settings to save people from?\n\nThe part of 4 that makes it such a negative point is that we have such beautiful flight controls, but enjoying them is hard to do because the scene is always so terrible and... well... hellish.\n\nOver all I give the game 7/10 for the time being depending on what they do with it in the future. Given the right DLC (given it's not too pricey) I may revisit this review.\n","January 23, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The powers are back, but feel almost entirely different, aside from sprinting, but hey, how different can you make running, with the new flying system actually living up to its name. The flight mechanic is a big highlight in the game, with enough speed to make up for no summonable vehicles, nimble enough not to be frustrating, and just bad ♥♥♥ enough to feel satisfying using it for the majority of the short game. Guns, while limited, are still satisfying, with a few hidden gems clearly having been lovingly made.

I love Saints Row!  The consistent original style and fun gameplay of the entire franchise has been nothing short of astonishing and ironically. in some ways even surpasses the Grand Theft Auto franchise (the series that Saints Row was initially dismissed by many for it's similarities), despite Saints Row significantly smaller budget and development timeframe.  Saints Row IV was my second favorite in the franchise, behind Saints Row II and Kinzie Kenzington (my favorite character in the franchise) is a playable character in this game, which picks up after the events of Saints Row IV, so I had some high hopes for this game, while also remaining cautious in my expectations due to it's mere $20 price tag.  I wasn't expecting anything spectacular and yet I was still disappointed.\n\nI've played Saints Row IV to death and I was eager to play a brand new entry in the franchise, what I found was basically the same game, playing like a total conversion mod but with half of the features in IV removed.  Why the hell is there absolutely no radio in this game?  Why are no clothing stores or customizable outfits of any kind?  Why is the map so much smaller than it has ever been in any other Saints Row game?  Why giving the game a plot when almost the entire game consists of "city takeover" side quests that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot?  These are only some of the many questions you'll end up asking yourself as you play this game.\n\nMany fans were initially skeptical of SRIV's quality before it was released after news broke that it was originally supposed to be DLC for Saints Row III, and they were eventually proven wrong when SRIV turned out to written and developed well enough to actually justify it's status as a stand-alone title; But be warned, this is the real deal!  A stand-alone Saints Row game that really should have been DLC for Saints Row IV!  Even with it's $20 price tag, it's still lacking enough content and plot to justify it as a stand-alone title in the franchise.\n\nIn short, if you're new to Saints Row or you're not a die-hard fan, don't buy it.  However, if you're a Saints Row fanatic like me, I'd recommend it, but wait until it's on sale for $5 or lower, because that's what most DLC should be worth and this is just DLC pretending to be it's own game.\n\nAs much as this pains me:\n5/10","February 4, 2015","false","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unsure where this game will take the next game of SR however....\n\n","February 5, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
