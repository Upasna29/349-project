"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/449020/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","When logic and proportion\nHave fallen sloppy dead\nAnd the White Knight is talking backwards\nAnd the Red Queen's off with her head...*\n\nThere comes another marvelous gem for which it is tremendously hard to write a review and do justice completely without presenting spoilers. The Bottom of the Well is the narrative of a series of staggering experiences concerning a girl named Alice - or many Alices in their different incarnations nonetheless - and her dream of an apocalyptic end. Here, we will participate in her dream many, many times to reach countless endings to try and discover a meaning to it.\n\nThe narrative opens with a basic chat screen where Alice talks to her friend M. Hatter and tells him of a disturbingly lucid dream that she has seen the other day. In this unsettling dream, the city is under the threat of getting hit by a series of nuclear missiles due to unknown reasons. The estimation indicates that she'll have a bit more than half an hour to find some kind of protective measure. Here, we become a witness to the before, present and after of a possible nuclear attack and try to lead Alice to some kind of safety while making choices of survival, logic, ethics to reach an ending. We fight against environment, we fight against ourselves; but mostly we fight against time.\n\nBefore each playthrough, we are presented the opportunity to choose Alice's stats enrolled into different abilities - consisting of survival, resources, fitness, social abilities, career and dating - to arrange a different incarnation, an alternate dream version of the actual Alice. The combination of different stats change the storyline and starting position for Alice, making different story paths to follow available. In each playthrough different choices and Alice's abilities - and also the exact timing that we chose to take the action during narrative - present countless different combinations, thus different story progressions for Alice. Mostly she dies, sometimes she survives. Yet there is always the reluctant feeling that something's missing is present. As if, that wasn't the way the dream was intended to end... There we go back, start a new game to craft a new Alice and try a new path to follow in hopes of maybe discovering what that was about this time.\n\nWe participate in Alice's narrative to make her choices and affect the happenings of her dream past in a frame tale fashion. Alice's narrative of her experience is dreadfully realistic, actualized through an elaborate vocabulary and shockingly pinpoint descriptions. It is confusingly easy to immerse into the narrative experience of Alice, finding yourself trying different combinations of stats and choices endlessly, nearly always discovering some new outcome. The main display consists of nothing much aside some beautiful and appropriately forlorn artwork and the ominous soundtrack lingering in the background to enhance the narrative towards its triumph.\n\nAt this point, it should be no secret that the game is inspired from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland yet it manages to craft the symbolic personifications into a genuine setting of its own; way more realistic and disturbing that Lewis Carroll ever intended them to be so. Aside all of its narrative glory and ever changing gameplay; it is an unbelievable fact that the game is a freeware. Can you even believe it? I'll go ahead and urge you to try this uncanny experience. Maybe this time, Alice will come back from the rabbit hole.\n\n*Lyrics by Jefferson Airplane - White Rabbit\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 23","true","5.5"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","41","45","0","1"

With a Sin City's black-red-white graphic style and classic 'Choose Your Own Adventure' gameplay.\nI never played visnovels before and never thought I would, couldn't understand the fun of this genre at all... until now. This time Alice-related setting and dark style caught me, I couldn't pass by. And don't regret.\nThis version of Wonderland is pretty dark indeed - Alice's lucid dream about the end of the world in a nearby future. As deadly as you'd expect a nuclear apocalypse to be - the amount of different ways to die here is extreme. At some point I even got sick of constantly dying :D Few deaths are very cruel and scary too (for a modern setting, that is), and even disgusting to read.\nThe story is given in a form of chat conversation between Alice and Hatter, who isn't short of bitter comments and accusing her actions, if necessary. Also gets comic shocked when she does something really unfitting in her dream :D\nThere are also.. RPG elements (?? :O) You can select at the beginning which stats (fitness, survival, dating, etc.) and starting items your dream-Alice will have. Both drastically affect the story and choices you can make. There are also two predefined avatars - default Alice, weak and soft and dying from breath of the wind, and Dark Alice, a true monster, strong and tough and with no moral. Latter one even got black hood covering her face, for everyone who meets her should know how brutal she is :D This variant can't go for the true ending though, as that would be too easy.\nAn important thing - main storyline is made the way that at some point you can not proceed unless you restart the game several time, going through other branches and with completely different Alices. What a clever way to make people replay the game :D\nNarrative (and that is obviously the most important part of visnovel) is so nice, it kept me intrigued till the very end. Explored as much as possible. Even though it would get a bit obvious sometimes, I enjoyed every branch of the story... except the ending, The True Ending. Pretty sudden and short. But devs already said they are working on some kind of epilogue, to expand it a little more.\nThere's also pleasant minor piano music in the background, finishing off a.. pessimistic atmosphere? You'd never expect a static game to have an atmosphere. But some kind of it is here, yes, and it's good.\nNicely, the game is absolutely free, it's that kind of marketing scheme when "we do first game completely free so everybody can try and see how of a good developers we are".\nTrue little gem for all you Alice collectors ;)\nClass: III - Bread\nVerdict: Yes\nReviewed: 6.2.2016\nApproach: Steam - PC\nTime: Several Hours\nDeeds:\nComplete (The True Ending)\nAll Achievements\n44 Playthroughs","June 1","true","102.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

If you do not typically enjoy point-and-click games or choose your own adventure games, chances are that this game will not be for you. However, I found myself enjoying the eerie end-time setting but never got perturbed to the point where I had to step away for a while before resuming a playthrough. The game feels challenging, but never unfair, and accumulating deaths along the way prodded my interest towards finding this 'true ending' that I always seemed to just miss. Character customization is there, although not incredibly extensive, and skills actually influence in-game choices and outcomes from said choices. The dialogue itself is fleshed out and coherent (albeit somewhat unrealistic considering the game takes place within an online chat between friends, haha). I enjoyed accumulating all of the achievements in two binge sittings, but it did begin to feel a little 'grindy' when trying to get the last few as I found myself skipping large portions of text several times over. If you are looking for a mildly thought-provoking game or just something to fill time for an hour or so, I suggest looking into 'The Bottom of the Well'.","March 9","true","4.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The music and art are both on point, and the story is so profoundly aware of itself that all its gameified elements backfeed into the plot, get shout-outs in the text, and and genuinely lift this kind of storytelling above the static, linear progression you'd see in a really good novel.\n\nBottom of the Well is a choose-your-own-adventure in the old Joe Denver's Lone Wolf sense, with stats and equipment and companions all tracked. It's also one in which decision-making is guided primarily by your stats, and secondarily by common sense. I built a hulking musclebeast of an Alice and sent it rampaging through the nuclear wasteland, tanking incredible amounts of radiation and going head-on with every encounter it met. It survived, but learned nothing about the circular dream it was trapped in, and eventually it comitted suicide of its own will to reset the scenario.\n\nBy the way: this game is chilling. It's not exceptionally dark, but every little bit of inhumanity in it is very nuanced by the characters and tone, and all of them *hurt* just a little to read. If you're looking for something happy to play, this is not that. If you're looking for the kind of story that you routinely survive, this is not that either.\n\nThere's a hidden ending in this game, by the way. A final rabbithole to descend, although I haven't found it in my hour-and-change of getting bombed and then dying. I haven't seen any walkthroughs of it online, so for the time being it is still a special thing; a hidden thing. A bit of narrative that you could find that few other people have seen.\n\nAnyway Red Nettle, the studio that produced this, has created something fey and unsettling. Here's hoping that they can follow it up with something just as clever.","March 29","true","0.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, that's the great puzzle!”\n― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland\n\nThe game is presented as a dialogue between the main heroine, Alice, and her friend, M. Hatter. Alice is presented as a narrator of the story(stories), while M. Hatter comments on some particular events which happen to Alice in her lucid, life-like dreams. In each dream Alice is different. She is shaped by the statistics you are able to customize (and by the decisions you make during your walkthrough). The game presents you with an opportunity to choose a preset Alice (default or "dark Alice",which even has her own art). The dialogue and the beginning of the game differ depending on the stats you choose.\n\nAt first you might think that the game is about plain survival, That's definitely not the case here. Of course, you are able to play this way, making choices according to your outlook. However, the "true" ending is hidden accurately, and it will take you a few playthroughs to get to the main idea of the game. And even then there will be unanswered questions left, the answers to which you will have to come up with yourself.\n\nI would definitely recommend giving this game a try.","April 6","true","4.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, I got way too used at having most free ones be unoriginal, plain and overall ♥♥♥♥♥. The Bottom of the Well was a pleasant surprise, though.\n\nThe choices given to the player are often not that obvious, and the story progresses in more subtle manner besides what is simply told (tip: pay attention to the icons on top of the screen, kids). It was also quite interesting how the "Alice" you choose in the beginning plays a part on your fate from the start (on my first playthrough, I thought it was just some cool, yet pointless customisation feature. Oh boy was I wrong.)\n\nThe game is entertaining and interesting enough to have you explore all different options it gives you. It is also subtle enough that you may want to check an actual guide for all endings and achievements (trust me when I say they offer PLENTY of choices, and sometimes different sets of choices may lead you through a different path, but result in the same ending or similar endings).\n\nDespite not being long (took me 2 hours to get -almost- all achievements, and playthroughs don't take too much time, especially the first ones), The Bottom of the Well is overall quite interesting and a good distraction that does engage the player. (In case you like creepy ambience, the music and black-and-white visuals may appeal as well.) It definitely exceeded my expectations for a free VN and I surely recommend it.","May 22","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The narrator(Alice. C ) has many different ablites, that you as the player can customize or keep default. The story/game is based on the aspect of living through the "fallout/apoclypse" world around you, while keeping supplies, health, acquaintances close and contained.

Simple: survive. Complex: Rich story writing that lures you in first-hand to just what is happening, gritty black and white art that sometimes contains red highlights (I could just sit here and look at the art for hours), and finally: the story itself is molded completely by what perks you choose, and what you say and do.\n\nWhat would I add?

Way to beat us over the head with the Alice in Wonderland reference. And they way they communicate is over-the-top aggravating. "Yeah... It's just... You..."

However, parts of the game can be frustratingly vague. For example, I had died at some point and unlocked a portable Crowbar, but as I ended up playing 'Dark Alice' just trying to find out what could and could not be traversed/overcome, there was no point where it was necessary and it felt awkward to put on.\n\nA lot of times I end up getting very similar endings to previous runs, either something like 'So Close' or making one bad decision or waiting something out and then dying of Radiation Poisoning. Until a guide comes out depicting how each ending is achieved, you WILL see these endings a lot.\n\nThe game mentions a Save function, but I sure as hell can't find it. Also if you try starting a new game too fast, the game won't process it correctly and you'll be forced to restart the client (count to 4 after the main menu shows up, and you should be fine, might have something to do with how I put it on 'Fantastic' graphics which, honestly, I question where Graphics even come into play in the main game.) Group and Social Dynamics in the game are laughable, they seem more like a narrative crutch than an actual mechanic within the game itself.\n\nAlso Inventory can be... really stupid honestly. Dark Alice doesn't have the same issues that Default Alice does and while the game recommends you play Default Alice first, Dark Alice is much better to get a feel for the game and what you can/cannot accomplish.\n\nI haven't spent long on this game... an hour, hour and a half? I mean it's a good game, and if you like trial and error to find the way to your ideal ending, then that's great! Until a guide is made for this game though (and so far there's just a paultry first playthrough where the player fails to reach adequete shelter in time) I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game to others as there is no clear path (and even Default Alice herself offers very little hint on how exactly to accomplish the True Ending, much less other endings)","March 4","false","3.1"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","49","26","53","6","1"

The background art helped to set the majoirty of the scene. You're Alice and you're relating a dream you had about some kind of nuclear apocalypse to the Mad Hatter. You find nuclear fallout shelters under the Rad Bar (I think it was meant to be the Red Bar, in relation to the Red Queen's army) and a Queen ♥♥♥♥♥ guarding the door. She has a bodyguard named Rey. I'll not spoil the rest for you.\n\nPROS\n1. Simple Artwork\nThis is much better than other narrative games that I've played. It sets the scene for where the story takes place.\n\n2. Multiple Endings\nI died due to radiation poisoning but yet the game gave hints that there is another path. I like different multiple endings a lot.\n\nCONS\n1. The Tedium of Repeating the Story\nAs much as I love games with multiple endings, it is the process of getting to the endings that matter more to me. Using the Witcher series as an example, I would be excited to play the game again if I was given a New Game Plus which would accelerate the 2nd or 3rd playthrough.\n\n2. Character Intereractions\nNot very good. You meet a NPC. You deal with them by choosing 1 out of 3 options, that's it. The characters are not interesting to interact with. For a lack of a better word, the characters have no character. The Mad Hatter is an example of a character, he asks about Alice and seems to be a friend, gives guidance and progresses the story.","March 11","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Just a bunch of reading, pretty much nothing else. What finally did it for me was I dropped down the map and it wouldn't go back up again. It completely blocked out the text. When I pressed SKIP to skip all the dialogue, the map stayed put and I had no idea what was going on or what was being said. So, I am deleting this waste of space. Besides the map bug, the game was a complete bore fest. Zork was a totally better read your adventure game. At least it wasn't all reading. This one is reading and choosing an option every few minutes of reading. Total waste of time and space. No wonder it was free.","March 16","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Check out Deuteronomy 28 for an extensive list on the curses.  Chances are, you're afflicted with at least one.  The fate of your soul is in peril; therefore, get right with God.\n\nIf you don't, enjoy the apocalypse, and then hell afterward.

I've loved the story of Alice in Wonderland for a long time, and I feel that this kept true to the theme, while still being able to become its own story.\n\nI love how with each change you make, whether it's Alice's traits at the beginning or the choices you make throughout, the story can have barely-noticable differences, or drastic differences that can really help or hinder Alice in the world. I think that the graphics and artwork really fit with the theme and the feel of the game, and the music was brilliant and helped bring the whole thing together!\n\nThe only things I didn't like were some of the mechanics. If you are hoping to be able to make every different choice possible, or just torn between two or regret a choice, an in-game save feature would be really helpful so you wouldn't need to skip past all the repeat dialogue. The other thing was that sometimes I would accidently click past dialogue, or skip past a section without knowing it had changed until I got to an unfamiliar choice option. Having a text log so you can go back and re-read what was said I think would help avoid a lot of confusion for players. Having said that, however, from what I understand from the developer's website, they are working on solutions to both these issues.\n\nAgain, I loved the story and the choices that led to different ends, but I feel that the "true" (?) end was very sudden. It opened the door to more questions, and a lot more potential story to be told. I hope to be able to experience more of the story through a DLC or another game.\n\nIn all, this game is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes choice-based games and Alice in Wonderland!","March 27","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are able to customize your version of Alice and the choices you make influence your starting items and chance of success in various scenarios. There are also minor (in some cases major!) story differences depending on the personality you give Alice which is a nice touch.\n\nDon't expect to play through the game once and get the real ending. The game is meant to be played multiple times (think 10 or even more) to unveil it's secrets.\n\nThe story is well written and worth replaying, although there are negatives. You are often presented with an illusion of choice. Many options lead back into others while others are mearly fluff. There are also too few locations in my opinion. I suppose the developer wanted to keep the experience somewhat compact but once you get the hang of progression, the lack of choice becomes more evident.\n\nBut as a free visual novel, Bottom of the Well is definitely worth reading/playing as it is a unique experience with real moments of intrigue.

In The Bottom of the Well, you play as Alice who has just had an unsettingly life-like dream about the end of the world. You can kind of call it Alice in Wonderland, but there's endless possibilities for the paths she can take. Even though it's multiple choice, and a visual novel, you are allowed to customize your 'Alice', if you so like, but RedNettle does recommend you to use the 'Default Alice' in your first try. But I've played RPG's before, so I headed straight for the customization, because that's the best part of RPG's!(well for me at least).\n\nYou'll immediately start talking to your friend online, called "Mad H.", quite the punny guy in my opinion. With that, you won't be able to choose what Alice types, it's much like the game 'Emily is Away', but you are allowed to choose how Alice answers, just maybe not in your preferred words.\n\nThere was however some minor Syntax, Grammar, Spelling of words and use of words issues, but it wouldn't bother most. It's a good game if you're into some visual novel games, and even though it may only take you 20 minutes to finish, if even that long, I say for a Free-To-Play game on steam, I'd definitely play this again(to see how it ends with a different 'Alice') and pay for it!\n\nWhat makes this game even more brilliant, is the fact that it's so small, 60Mb for a game is very rare to find in our modern era, and the graphics isn't bad either. I would've liked some extra visuals when the scene changes, just a little beauty for the eye.\n\nAll-in-all it's a great game, with excellent qualities and minor flaws that can be fixed.\n\n8/10","March 26","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are often presented with an illusion of choice. Many options lead back into others while others are mearly fluff. There are also too few locations in my opinion. I suppose the developer wanted to keep the experience somewhat compact but once you get the hang of progression, the lack of choice becomes more evident.\n\nBut as a free visual novel, Bottom of the Well is definitely worth reading/playing as it is a unique experience with real moments of intrigue. I'd recommend it.","March 30","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In The Bottom of the Well, you play as Alice who has just had an unsettingly life-like dream about the end of the world. You can kind of call it Alice in Wonderland, but there's endless possibilities for the paths she can take. Even though it's multiple choice, and a visual novel, you are allowed to customize your 'Alice', if you so like, but RedNettle does recommend you to use the 'Default Alice' in your first try. But I've played RPG's before, so I headed straight for the customization, because that's the best part of RPG's!(well for me at least).\n\nYou'll immediately start talking to your friend online, called "Mad H.", quite the punny guy in my opinion. With that, you won't be able to choose what Alice types, it's much like the game 'Emily is Away', but you are allowed to choose how Alice answers, just maybe not in your preferred words.\n\nThere was however some minor Syntax, Grammar, Spelling of words and use of words issues, but it wouldn't bother most. It's a good game if you're into some visual novel games, and even though it may only take you 20 minutes to finish, if even that long, I say for a Free-To-Play game on steam, I'd definitely play this again(to see how it ends with a different 'Alice') and pay for it!\n\nWhat makes this game even more brilliant, is the fact that it's so small, 60Mb for a game is very rare to find in our modern era, and the graphics isn't bad either. I would've liked some extra visuals when the scene changes, just a little beauty for the eye.\n\nAll-in-all it's a great game, with excellent qualities and minor flaws that can be fixed.\n\n8/10","March 26","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The VN is definitely on the short side but it has a satisfying amount of choices. The addition of stats and inventory is a positive as well. The writing is appropriate for the narrative context - two people discussing dreams over the Internet - and thus, while not particularly literary it remains entertaining. The story itself is quite good, assuming you get all the way to the "true" ending, although the barely concealed anti-war preachiness made me angry, like it always does.\n\nThe bottom line is that, if you're as obsessed with end-of-civilization stories like I am, you're likely to find this a treat.

The music is also pretty minimal, just one soft piano track, but again, it works very well with the narrative feel. The story is fantastic! It's pretty deep for how quickly you can play through a session, and each choice really makes all the difference, even down to what gear you take or what order you choose to do things. This game has a lot of depth, and the story is surprisingly, yet casually dark. The dialogue feels very natural, like a conversation someone would have over a messenger, so bravo on not making it feel awkward and forced. The endings were... appropriate, for lack of a better word. I died a lot, mostly from radiation. It felt 'real' in the sense that there wasn't really a 'happy ending,' despite what the achievements say. I didn't quite get one of the endings, but maybe it was just because I wasn't paying close enough attention. The only negative thing I can say is that some of the menu things seem a little buggy, including the stats, but it was hardly a detractor.\n\nDefinite replayability.

As a free game, you simply can't go wrong here, and I highly recommend taking the few minutes it takes to jump right into this game to give it a whirl.\n\nPros:\n\n1) Great storytelling - It's kind of like "the butterfly effect" meets "the matrix" - and the immersion and layering is such that it can make you briefly question if the "real" world is yet another layer in the game\n2) Price - what's not to like about a free game?\n3) Graphics - yes, it's a text game, but the text looks good, and the artwork is fitting\n4) Music - the single track fits the mood well\n\nCons:\n\n1) The time it takes to reload the game is a bit of a pain, especially since you die so much\n2) Only a very small handful of good endings compared to many, many ways to die - one thing I liked about choose your own adventure books is that there were often many "good" endings\n3) Inventory system - I felt like this added extra complexity that made it much harder to explore all the possible paths in the game, which led to excess repetition in gameplay\n4) Music - the single track gets repetitive\n\nOverall, I would gladly pay money for a more extensive and more polished version of this.  What a great free game!","April 29","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darksilverhawk/recommended/449020/","darksilverhawk","Darksilverhawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darksilverhawk/","157 products in account","Product received for free\n\nAn interesting and short little visual novel with a number of endings. Various choices, including your stats, change what options are available to you each playthrough, though the basic outline of the various branches remains the same each time; your stats will mostly determine how far along each branch you are able to get, provided you make the correct choices. Don't take the following complaints the wrong way- I highly recommend this game! I just feel like there was a little more it could have done.\n\nThe story itself is engaging enough, and short enough that going back to replay it to take different options doesn't take too long- good, because there is no way to save your progress mid-story and you're going to be replaying it a lot. Fully exploring branches can get a bit tedious, as you'll need to skip through the same prior scenes every time just to see how one decision may change an outcome, and a few of the scenes required to legitimately reach the true ending of the game require some very spesific builds and decisions- you'll likely be searching for a walkthrough to avoid sitting through the bombs falling too many times, particularly since these vital scenes are not hinted at or signposted in any real way- it's entirely possible to reach what seems like a good ending for that branch and not realize you've missed vital information.\n\nThe game also feels unfinished, as if the creator wanted to do more but ran out of time. There are a number of inventory slots and items that are basically useless, or if they do have a use it is so obtuse as to be unlikely to be found by the average player. There's one unlockable item that opens up several new paths, but only one. Stats effect possible inventory choices, but the choices shake out to be mostly meaningless in 9/10 playthroughs- just bring all the food you can carry and you'll be fine most of the time.\n\nStill, this is a good, well-written game. It's fun to play, a little thought-provoking but not existential, and the events are enjoyable to read. I recommend it whole-heartedly to anyone who enjoys chose-your-own-adventure stories.","May 7","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
