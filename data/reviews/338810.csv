Demise of Nations: Rome is a turn based strategy game set during the roman times.  You control several units, and have five resources that you have to manage.  As the game progresses, you research things like unit upgrades, buildings, and terrain upgrades.  The basic scenario starts out with Rome at war with a neighbor, and all other contries are neutral.\n\nThis game needs improvement.  During your turn, it gives no indication of which units need to move.  When you click on a space with an enemy unit as an action, it moves your unit there and only attacks if the enemy unit is still there.  There is no option for resource icons.  The game takes forever to run it's course, and the aforementioned flaws make winning annoying.  The tutorial, though improved since release, leaves much to be desired.  Capture the Flag mode is thouroughly broken.\n\nThe multiplayer isn't much better.  It takes coins to create a game, which take forever to regenerate.  Half of the time the game isn't created, and a fourth of the time the created game is unjoinable.  Server times are dismal.\n\nThe game has some pay content, mostly just extra maps and a generator.  I haven't seen the need to spend money on this, but the generator has promise.\n\nBut still, this game has potential.  It's still in early access, and Noble Master has done a good job of responding to bugs and likewise problems.  It's a fairly easy 100%, although the dev has said he might add more acheivements.  Plus, besides the extra maps, it's free.\n\nWith some improvement, this can be a great game.  I give it 6/10, so long as the Dev keeps it up.\n\nEDIT -- 6/10/15\n\nAfter about a month of development since I posted this review, this game has truly improved.\n\nThe tutorial is much better.  The We Go system is much better, and many of the single player flaws I mentioned are fixed.  Resource Icons are there, which makes it a lot easier to manage your land.  The new acheivements have been added, and some of them are quite difficult.\n\nThere have been some other changes too, but I found that playing this time arround was much easier than before.\n\nNew Rating: 8/10","May 5, 2015","true","31.9"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","3"

It reminds me a bit of Civ V but it is intricate in its own way. The movement/battle/territory system needs a bit getting used too, but once you get into it, you just can't get away from the screen. I would love if the notifications and alerts popped a bit more (sometimes they're hard to spot). I was able to play the game without playing the tutorial, it is intuitive. The research system is kinda strange though, I couldn't find a research tree or anything like that, leaving me guessing what  would be the best to invent first. I would recommend this to people who like hex strategy  and considering how this is still in early access, I expect some improvements.","May 1, 2015","true","19.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

But the basics are shown completely. Carthago always wins 10/10.\n\n- Singleplayer - Good to play  and to configure. At least 14 different empires are chooseable. You can play against them altogether. 5 degrees of AI level, hexagon fields, roundbased, nicely animated resources. Just a base pack of 2 maps (one is tutorial)\n\n- Multiplayer - OMG that's disappointing. Firstly you must spend 10 coins to host a MP game? These coins can be regained by logging in each day for one coin? Are you f...ing serious?\n\nThen gameplay MP: Don't make the mistake to choose the turnlimit on just 1 min. You will be stuck in 3 messages "sending", "updating" and "preparing" without any possible movement on the map. I don't understand the low performance in MP. Is it the servers? Is it the high amount of data that must be send after a turn?

However...\n\nThe "we-go" system does not really work for me.  This is especially true when trying to pin down the last unit of an otherwise defeated enemy.  It sucks to have to plan out several turns worth of movement to trap that last guy in a position you can attack.  True turn based might fit this game better.\n\nThe tech tree is a bit shallow.  However once it gets fleshed out it and stream lined, I can live with it.  What's really missing are specialized soldiers/buildings for each nation.\n\nCity development is also pretty annoying at times.  Some buildings only serve as stepping stones to the ones you want.  They have no other function than to increase the cost and time to build he one you really want.  This is sort of poor design.\n\nThere is a stat for population happiness, but happiness improves over time...  Seems like a wasted feature.  My people were always either happy, or a few turns away from it.  With some adjustment this could add another layer of strategy to conquest.  As it is now, it's just too easy to keep people happy.\n\nI'm not much for multi-player, and don't find the value in it.  A game like this might be do better with some older cheaper multi player tech.  Game servers cost money, but play by email doesn't.  For me it's not a selling point, so what do I know.\n\nIt's by no means a bad game, just not fully fleshed out.  With a little more work, I think this game would be a pretty fun diversion.  It reminds me a lot of shareware games from the 1990's, and I think a price point like those games would work far better than charging for dlc, or a sub for multi-player.\n\nI know this is a long list of the problems, but its really not bad.  People are a little unfair in their judgements of video games.  This one works, and I think that alone is worth 5/10.  It's still being worked on, so it could get better over time.\n\nIf you like these kinds of games, it's worth a try, you might find something cool.","April 23, 2015","true","11.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","6"

You are given 100 free gold coins, it costs 10 gold coins to start a game and you earn\none gold coin for every day you login.  During the time I played the human counter was stuck on 3 people, then it would go up to 4 for 5 seconds then back to 3.  Everyone who has this game logs in to get the one free coin then logs out.\nThe game uses the same map from legion from slitherine, plays a bit like that and the old DOS game Hannibal.\nThe problem is the game is unpolished, unfinished and the AI is just plain stupid.  There are only 3 spots on the entire map where you can create an iron mine.  Of course, you need iron for all your troops SOOOO, you either buy it or play with peasants I guess.  The AI will never take over a city, they will surround it with all their units, attack it until it hits 0 then stand around it.  I picked on that fairly early and just sent in one lone spearman to "Take over" each city.  Pretty boring.  Less then 1/3 of the game through I ran out of things to research. You have the 4 basic resources, food, stone, wood and iron.  The research basically lets you build level 1 through 5 of those 4 resources and that it is about that.  The unit selection is very sparse, the peasant, the spearman, the horseman, the archer and the swordsman.  Of course if you do not have iron it is even worse then that.  The most powerful unit in the game is the "Troop transport" that can shoot units 2 spots away, even cities, go figure???\n\nAnother thing is the trade screen.  Here you can set up trades and have them repeat each turn. Except that it does not work right.  If you set up a trade for 500 food and you sell 100 food then next turn the repeat option is only for 400 food so you have to do it again anyways.  It was stuff like that throughout the whole game that really killed it for me.\n\nI took this game off the old hard drive without finishing it, and without giving them money for their "PAY" maps.\nIf they get some stuff fixed and if there were human players out there to give me a good game experience it would be a different story.","June 8, 2015","false","14.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","4"

It is very similar to Civ but only covers the time period of the Ancient Age. Although this might sound like a step backwards (since Civ covers the entire time line of the human history) Demise of Nations: Rome offers a more advanced city management and trading system than Civ. Other exciting features like the weather system, the WEGO-movement system make this game stand out from other 4X Civ like games.\n\nObviously some features are still missing (every nation has the same units and no nation specific modifiers... etc.) but this is expected from an early access release.\n\nI think given the right amount of time this game will grow to be a great 4X game, with a flourishing community with a handful of great mods.\n\nIf you are interested in some ancient time strategic action look no further, this game is for you.","May 3, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Perhaps the settings can be changed for the AI but I havent figured that part out yet. For a free game it is fun to play and can suck away hours of your time.

What can I say about this game?\n\nFirst its free, no need to pay for anything, no need to register an account, no need to buy a special membership, just download and play. Also, if you are expecting a low quality 4X game because its free, well my friend you are wrong!. This game is great and here is why.\n\nFirst of all, this game is similar to Civilization but with a few differences.\n1) To establish new cities you need to research that tecnology.\n2) This game takes place during the rise of Rome (No medieval, indutrial etc etc Ages)\n3) No need to build roads.\n\nSecond: The sense of progressing is awesome, Im currently playing as Illyria. I began with 2 cities, after a few turns (70) I decided to wage war against Cathage that recently conquered my neighbor the Celts. After 120 turns, I managed to conquer all of northern Italy and south of france. Now Im stuck against the Sammites in a war for Rome.\n\nThird: Wars and economy, you better watch how much income do you have and how many troops you plan to create, one mistake and your economy will fall rapidly, leaving you in a state of chaos as your military crumbles due to the lack of upkeep.\n\nIn the end Demise of Nations: Rome is a good 4X game. Its free and offers many possibilities of conquering the world. Either you can start as Rome or as one of the many tribes and kingdoms and fight your way to the top. No need to pay, no need for special cash, Demise of Nations: Rome is clearly a FREE TO PLAY GAME!.

I was wrong, the game is absolutely amazing (unless you hate strategy games).\n\nIt is a little difficult to see, but the graphics are pretty good, especially in-game.  There are lots of different factors and numbers, such as groundwater, which either you like, or you can ignore and still play the game fine.\n\nI like strategy games however, and I think this is one of the best ones on steam.  It is very straight forward if you want it too be, yet there is a lot of content that you could pay attention to if you wanted.  I also love one of the developer's other games.\n\nThere are several things you can change before each game, including the number of nations, and the amount of resources.  Personally I like seeing the whole map from the start and playing with max resources to completely overwhelm the AI, but it is still really fun (almost more fun) playing with the default settings.\n\nOn top of that, I had a problem purchasing their modding pack (Steam had an internal error and I got charged twice), and the developer responded immediately, saying he fixed the code as soon as he read my complaint, and offering me a full refund or some other maps if I wanted.

I have about 25 hours played at the time of this review Some minor changes i would make: Having more maps is not worth $15.99, MAKE IT FREE hence the term Free 2 play. Also please consider changing the skins to the units for the different countries. Playing as Gaul using Roman legionaries is a little weird.

I love how you expand your borders by moving across the map that is so cool. One thing I really don't like about the game is unit health; I will use RTW as an example. In that game it is pure strategy like using the higher ground or using a pincher type move and so to win a battle instead of how much health your unit has. I have a few suggestions for the developers. 1) There are far to many farms and not enough other resources. In order to get a decent amount of other resources available in the game the whole map is nearly all farms. So my suggestions is to have a capability of making areas into resources like example prospecting a mountain or how dense a forrest is. 2) Put in Trading land and cities. 3) Have a capability of building roads for trade routes to other factions similar to RTW (Basically I will suggest them to play RTW to get some ideas). For trading to other factions have some things on the map like wine, textiles, and other stuff to trade to other factions for gold or for other important resources you need that you can't obtain in the areas you control. 4) Have factions return if a place revolts if a faction has been defeated and add more factions that would be cool to. 5) Have each faction have a couple of unique buildings and units that other factions can't get. For example the Celts can have druids and since Gaul is similar barbaric people they can have armored swordsman or something like that.","December 19, 2015","true","56.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Seems like a very dumbed down version of Civ 1, except you can only build on certain locations, and there aren't many of those, except for farms.\n\nLots of things I didn't like about the game.\n\nYou can't give your units extended orders (like keep moving to this location), so every turn you have to give them marching orders. Got sick of that after a while.\n\nAlso it's 1 unit per tile and you can't move thru other units.\n\nThere's no next town feature or list of towns, so you have to be constantly scrolling around the map.\n\nYou have very limited resources. I conquered Europe and I think I only had like 5 quarries, and you need stone for everything. You can't build any money making buildings, so you're always low on cash.\n\nYou have research, but everything you build costs money and research costs money. Just takes way too long to get anywhere in this game. Yeah, that research costs only 1000 gp, too bad you're only making 50 per turn profit. And research is all the same mostly, just upgrade after upgrade.\n\nAlso I found it hard to see special locations. Often times I would miss places where I could building something. After a while I didn't care, couldn't afford it anyway.\n\nSame units I had at the beginning of the game, I had when I quit playing.\n\nEven though it's free to play, I just found it a very unenjoyable game.","June 3, 2015","false","3.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

For free you can't really complain.  The graphics aren't great, which wouldn't be a big deal, but it's tough to tell the difference between some units and terrain.  Mostly it's kind of boring.  All the countries are the same so there isn't any personality.  The diplomacy and fighting is repeditive.  There is only one map for the free version which is part of the problem.  But if you are going to pay money you might as well play Civ because this is the walmart version of it.\n\nIf they offer some more maps, and give some personality to the nations it might work.  But this is kind of like playing Civ 1 without the nostalgia.","May 17, 2015","false","11.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
