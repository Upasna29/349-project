It features a Dynamic Campaign, that alone\nis awesome when you look at all the naysaysers on flightsim forums who use to say "It can't be done, it is teh hard".\nSystems and Flight model wise it is a step above EF2000 and significantly above Strike Fighters actually, but not on the level of military-grade simulators like\nthe DCS series or Falcon BMS. But it was never intended to and the developer was clear on it.\n\nThe avionics are modelled to the degree they are really mission relevant. You have your main MFD pages, with the MFDs being clickable: Navigation / HSD, Radar, FLIR, TPod, Stores, etc.\nThe thrust-vectoring is awesome and works perfect. Including weight effects - e.g. with a light load, you can take off\nvertically from the ship, but load 4x MK83s for example and you will have to do a rolling take off with a 45° nozzle setting or so. People who say the flight model is bad don't know what they're talking about.\n\nSince this is Early Access, there are indeed some bugs, but nothing game breaking from what I saw.\nI agree with the criticism that it is too dark. There needs to be more play on the brightness / gamma setting so as to increase it further.\nThere also needs to be a way to set curves for the stick input. But I'm sure this is gonna get implemented in the future.\n\nOk, off to some more missions in the Straits!","June 6","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Good luck mapping HOTAS controls all over again.\n- The cockpit did not load and I could see through my aircraft.\n- I didn't notice any axis tune settings, and trying to bind anything related to the joystick is a nightmare since the game detects the slightest axis movement and then binds that axis to the control.\n- Quick start missions suddenly fail immediately after start. (I think the plane hits the sea surface during the intro cutscene).\n- CBA to redo any HOTAS controls, I plugged in an xbox controller since it's the default input device. The game's however completely unresponsive to the gamepad apart from the "press any key" screen.\n- Alt-tabbing resets game resolution.","June 6","false","0.2"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","5"

We have the chance to support a dev willing to make a niche flight sim with dynamic campaign etc etc.\n\nDon't buy it yet unless you are willing to contribute to the development of the product. the dev's made it perfectly clear what needs doing. So all you negative reviewers why don't you just ♥♥♥♥ off and play with your xbox and leave the people willing to support this product to support it.\n\nThese negative reviews will not help in any way at the moment. It will eventually prevent any combat flight sims ever being developed because of all these ♥♥♥♥ing kids throwing their toys out of their pram as soon as a problem arises.\n\nThey should put an 18 cert on these games.\n\nAnyway, having played flight sims for over 25 years on pc's I can tell you that it flys nice, you can key map the joystick and the dynamic campaign looks really interesting.","June 6","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

( it is early access ) so expect it to have faults and missing features. )\n\nThe harrier and contol of the harrier do feel like you are flying the airplane, but controls are more simplified than example dcs since you can only click a few buttons.. But never the less this also make the game more fun for many people that they do not have to use 10 houres to figure out how to fly the airplane but can go and shoot the enemy.\nI would call the game a sim and not arcade, since it look and feel like a sim, but control of the airplane ect are just more simple. Targeting of ships and airplanes are rather simple.. find them with your radar and press next target and then you cycle trough avaliable target you can shoot and it is okay i think.  ( a bit like arma flying and targeting )\nYou also have a targeting pod for gound attacks but I did not yet use it but it work like you expect.. point zoom and lock.\nI would say using the airplane once you have become airborn is easy and the feeling of flying it is good.\n\nThe most difficult so far was acual to take off and land, since it took a little while to figure out what angle of the jet engine needed to be in, and that I had to adjust this the moment i left the aircraft carrier.. But once learned things became more easy. Landing is somewhat difficult, and i find it hard to hover near the ship since the airplane do not have enough power to maintain level flight or gain height once it hover.. im not sure if this is my joysticks fault but I just make a slow landing instead of going into hover that work.\n\nGraphics are actual nice, and game run very well. But you need to adjust settings since game do not automatic configure them correctly based on your hardware.. But i would say graphics are good some will say mediocre, but it is clear it is not fantastic like big AAA titles.\nThis is about flying an airplane and the game simulate that very good i would say.\n\nSo far i experienced several bugs and crashes.. example my radar do not work so i cant see enemy airplanes and lockon and shoot them down.. maybe i have some kind of bug, i am sure the dev will fix this.\nGame crash once in a while but nothing that bad typical it crash in the main menu and not ingame, im sure they fix it fast. waypoing indicator is missing on hud, so I kind og guess in what direction i have to fly, but I can see waypoint counter count up or down.\n\nThe campaign well I find it confusing at first.. I managed to move my ships via. waypoint, but I did not yet figure out how to plan a mission and such things or what really is going. would be nice with a little video tutorial or something.\nThe training missions seem kind of simple and have very little information about what to do.. but they are okay.\n\nSo should you buy this.. Yes I think you will like this game if you seak a "simple" flight simulator that focus more on fun than clicking buttons. ;-)","June 6","true","2.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Do not expect a DCS level of simulation, this harks back to the glory days of the 90's and reminds me of US Navy Fighters.  Graphical fidelity of the models is  good, so far i'm enjoying it and look forward to seeing how it progresses through the early access","June 6","true","0.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","4"

So expect bugs and quirks!\n\nBut so far, the time I've played, I was impressed. It has a few different things that we usually don't find on simulators, like actual waves and the nice sensation and eye candy while flying through the clouds. My only major gripe, considering everything else is a bug, is the environment color, it is too dark in my opinion.\n\nThis is not a DCS level simulator, more like Strike Fighters level, and I'm enjoying it! It doesn't require to be extremely versed on avionics like Falcon 4.\n\nSo, in my opinion, if you enjoy Strike Fighters, light-sim and want to go through a few bugs, buy it now!","June 6","true","1.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Figured out you have to save controls after setting up each page, rudder pedals aren't working. Need to add axis tuning settings.\n-GFX wise, looking nice, beautiful harrier model, cockpit certainly not DCS Level but who really expected that? Good smooth FPS (1440p i7 4770K GTX980) but too dark.\n-TrackIr working, no setup necessary.\n-Flight model feels on rails, you can just throw the stick around at high speed, seems impossible to make it depart controlled flight.\n-Extremely simple avionics, not even a proper radar, just radar on/off and select next target.\n-No enemy aircraft damage effects, not even smoke trails or fire.\n-Enemy F-4 phantom took 2 slammers and kept flying, no f*cks given.\n\nVery very early build, I'll follow up and update with further releases. Sure hope the developer is on the level, this looks nice but it'll take some major improvements to keep me interested.\n\nScore: 10/10 would VIFF straight into the water again.\n","June 6","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

If you are not already well versed in flight sims controls its hard enough but when keys and buttons just will not bind well you might find a game of that in and of itself\n\nMy refunding is now processing, not gonna support early access like this. You want to appeal to the mid-sim range then get it right with at least the keybinds working or good luck to you too.","June 6","false","0.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Graphically it's very nice, and the frame rate is fluid.\n\nCampaign, Comms, career progress, and a lot of other features haven't been implemented yet.\n\nThere are a LOT of bugs and crashes though, so be warned.  It needs a lot of polishing.","June 6","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
