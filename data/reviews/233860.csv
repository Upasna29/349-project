I had started out with nothing but the clothes on my back, some cash, and a rusty sword.\n\nFirst thing to do was to find some buddies to help, and so I went to the nearest town. In a tavern I met a short bald man (though we were all bald back then). His name was Dirt, and this was my new best friend. Dirt and I did some pretty bad things then, luring guards to get killed by starving bandits, and then stealing all of the gear. This changed when we both got a little close one fight, and got chased by bandits all the way into the entrance of town. There weren't enough men to hold them all back, so I went into a tavern to see if anyone could help. I found a huge man, named Vedi. Vedi was willing to help for a price, and after paying him he went out there with a rusty sword and killed 3 of the bandits before he passed out from blood loss, effectively saving the town.\n\nIt was the three of us for a good, long time. We killed many a cannibal and a bandit, and soon enough came upon the idea to make our own outpost, a safe haven to keep us secure and resupply when the going got tough. There was a town nearby, so all we had to do was get a few materials here and there and after a week maybe it would be set. By this time all three of us were pretty decked out, myself having a good long coat, Vedi with a huge cleaver, and Dirt with a tricorn hat. Most cannibals were either afraid of us by this point, or dead, there wasn't much worry of our safety by now.\n\nWe had almost finished the small base, with Vedi and I working on some some construction, so it was Dirt's turn to go get the materials. We had both finished our construction, and so had waited for Dirt to come back. A day had gone by, we were starting to get worried. By noon the next day, Vedi and I had decided to risk it and leave the base, to go see where Dirt had gone. The next town over must surely know where he went?\n\nWe didn't even make it halfway across when we found him, laying on the ground.\n\nHis hat and sword weren't far from him, and there were two dead bandits next to him. Incisions and cuts were all across his body, bones broken and blood everywhere. Vedi cried, I stared for a good long time, before getting his hat and sword. I walked to the nearest bandit encampment, which some members looked wounded, and slaughtered them all with Vedi, after he finally caught up.\n\nTime has passed since that day, and the small base we had thought of originally is now a bustling town, with nearly eight residents there, all dressed and ready to defend their home. These people are the best I could have asked for, and I still keep the tricorn hat as a symbol of office, with Vedi forgoeing his cleaver for that sword, as his symbol of guard captain. But as much as I love these people, and would die for them, they will never be that man whom Vedi and I came to know as our best friend.\n\nR.I.P. Dirt.\n10/10","January 25, 2015","true","29.5"," 622 of 675 people (92%) found this review helpful 223 people found this review funny","92","622","675","223","24"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kbugante/recommended/233860/","kbugante","Jay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kbugante/","228 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKenshi is a game where you start off feeling small, incapable, and alone. From the get go, you are basically a nobody; just another face in the crowd, another cog in the machine, another meatbag for the grinder - but it's not what you are, but what you would rather be, and how you get there that makes this game enjoyable. The journey to the ultimate destination of your own choosing is where the fun lies. Will you be a lone trader, looking to accrue the greatest mountain of wealth the post apocalyptic world has ever seen? Or a wandering swordsman who hides their true strength to dispatch armies with relative ease? Perhaps a general at the head of your own personal body guard? Or the mayor of a little tiny village just beyond the next dune? Regardless of what your goal is, it is exactly that - yours.\n\nWhen I started playing Kenshi, the one thing that first struck me was the graphics. Relatively blocky, and a bit funny to look at in some cases, i.e.: buildings clipping in a sand dune, or walls built at unreasonable angles. But, I don't play a game for graphics; to me that's just a secondary benefit. What I'm after is the gameplay, and what I was in store for really put a smile on my face.\n\nMy character started out in a small town on top of a mountain range. I could see another down off in the distance, and figured that I'd walk there after exploring this little fortress in the sky. Did I mention that the towns are more like fortresses? I didn't? Well, imagine a town surrounded by walls taller that the highest in-game building, with a group of 20 or so very heavily armed and skilled guards for it's protection. That's what constitutes a town in Kenshi. 'Relative' safety, but I'll get to that in a minute.\n\nHeading towards the other town, I noticed that a group of bandits had started charging up the hill at me. I thought, "A group of bandits? Looks like fun, let's try out the combat!" and to my astonishment, I was obliterated. Beaten to within an inch of death, bleeding out in the beating sun, unconscious. My stomach had taken massive damage, and one of my arms was pretty much useless. I had been surrounded, beaten up, and left for dead. And my assailants? Took off to raid the town. Luckily, the city guard switfly dispatched them, but I was left on the hill. So, fast forward about half an in-game day, and I limp back to town (of course, I looted those bandits that attacked me and left them for dead; take that!). After patching myself up sufficiently, I take to luring bandits to town to enjoy the fighting with the guards and levelling myself up.\n\nNow, speaking of levelling up, skills are sorted into multiple sections: dexterity, strength, the various weapon skills, just to name a few. You gain proficiency by performing the tasks. You get stronger by carrying heavy objects around, not by killing a few rats like some other games, but not like there's anything wrong with them. You develop your character through hard work and dedication. Want to become better at running? Take off your heavy equipment and do a few laps. Don't know how to swing your weapon? Engage a training dummy or another person for all that matters. Even your ability to widthstand pain can be increased. How? By losing. That's right, you are rewarded for losing. Those bandits didn't kill you when they had the chance? Sucks to be them, because now not only are you angry, but you're also more accustomed to the pain. The next time you see them, they may well be on the losing side of the fighting. Kenshi rewards you for survival and practice, much like the saying: whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\n\nSo back to my little tale to attempt to capture the game a bit more - After fighting a couple of fights with the city guard as backup, I tried luring a group of bandits back to the town only to my surprise - the guards at the gate weren't there. Either they left on a patrol, or were fighting another battle elsewhere, I had no time to check. The bandits were hot on my tail, and the only chance I had of survival was to either lead them away from town, or take refuge and hope to escape while they killed all the civilians. And in that moment, I saw a few brave men - shop guards - rush from the protection of their walls, and stop the bandits in their tracks. A bandit or two slipped by, and I gave chase. Unfortunately while I spent a good while fighting one, the other slayed an innocent civilian, and I was happy to see that the population count in the town had actually dropped. Protecting the towns actually has an incentive - no population = no trading. The bandits dispatched, the guards returned, and I resigned to head off towards that other town in the distance.\n\nNow, as I could see the town, it didn't seem far. Plus, I had enough gold to recruit a new person to my little gang of righteous corpse theives. With some new equipment, a little bit of extra knowledge of how the world works and a new companion, I set out for the town. I travelled for at least two in game days. Two. I saw the sun rise, and set, then rise and set again. Such is the scale of Kenshi - the world is an open sandbox (quite literally at this point - no grass, just sand and rocks), and things that look far off in the distance are far off. And as I mentioned before, zooming out - I became a speck in the desert. The only that that kept my position known was the damn name tag floating above my head.\n\nKenshi may not be a game for everybody, but if you enjoy a bit of realism, and quite a bit of freedom, it may be worth it. It's still early access, which means that there are quite a lot of glitches, issues, bugs and crashes (I haven't encountered anything severe however), you may want to pass the game until it's more stable and developed decendant comes about. What appeals to me the most is actually two things: one, you are rewarded for winning, and are rewarded for trying. So long as you aren't dead, the game isn't over. It makes for one heck of a story if you keep little notes about what happens to your character when you play. The second thing is the scale and immersion of the game. Beyond the glitches sometimes breaking the immersion, I actually felt like a lone survivor in a desolate world, where people preyed upon the weak, and civilization may take days to reach on foot. Since I just recently bought the game, I can't say much about the developer, except that from reading what their vision is, it really is a grand one and has a lot of potential. Kenshi has lots of potential, but it also has lots of work left to be done. So pass it if you're looking for a more fleshed out game, but definitely get it if anything in this review has a major appeal to you. As for me, I'll be wandering the desert with my small group of companions trying to make a living in a world where death can come from even a small group of ill-trained, ill-equipped people. Afterall, you may know how to fight, but if a knife cuts you, you'll still bleed.","July 18, 2014","true","54.4"," 256 of 269 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","256","269","0","9"

Where do I start. It's about how the game feels when you start it for the first time. This is a game in development and somehow I just love it. When it's done, how I interpret it and see it, it is the ultimate RPG game. In a rich and huge (can't underline, but I would) world, filled with cities in biodomes and people, trees, water, dirt... In this world you can become a trader, a looter, a scavanger, but you can also found your own town, find new people for the party (very large parties) and become a power of your own. This sandbox RPG does sound a little too good to be true, but I don't know, it already delivers a lot and I recommend you come and see for yourself. Me and a lot of others are already enjoying Kenshi.\n\nI can recommend this game to people who also like traditional RPG's, but also RPG's like Fable for instance (there are characters, they grow, and there are factions, you are one), people who liked building the village in Assassins Creed 3, people who like minecraft (the playthrough is what you make of it), even people who like Settlers or even Age of Empires! I recommend this game basicly to everyone who plays other games then Call of Duty, as long as you can live with early-access situations in which you play a bêta or even alpha of the end result though. But getting it now if you're interested does save you money in the (very) long run.\n\nThere are factions that all have their own diplomatic stances towards you and eachother, there are bandits raiding unprotected people. You can do whatever you want. So if you want your faction (you are your own faction) to become powerfull, train your party and have an army. If you want to become a trader, train them strong so they can pack a lot of stuff, if you want your own city... start building! The characters do not level up as is tradition, you train each skill by training that skill specifically by doing things that require the skill. Which according to me works.\n\nThe game is really hard, especially at the start. You start with almost nothing and you have to struggle for survival. I usually start with luring bandits to patrols and towns to get them to fight (and die) to then pick their bodies clean like a damned vulture. Sell their stuff at a merchant, buy new equipment, repeat, get a teammate or two and start to choose a place to settle down.\n\nI played the game for the last time at version 0.62 and I have to say: it was an improvement over 0.50. It still feels the same (unpolished, cheap), but with the added notifications of approaching bandits, audio signals when under attack, female characters and at least some means of negociating with bandits I can only say: good work the last few months! Hair looks great, bodies look good, the rack on one of my partymembers is really too big, but looks good (not trying to be a sexist here, pointing out a detail) even beneath armor. I just wish someone would come to my stores to buy my goods, I don't want to walk to towns to sell them anymore ;)\n\nI again had a good time, so I'm sticking with the good review.\n\nThe thing is though that you do have to create your own adventures and the world isn't alive enough yet to fully appreciate this. However, after playing with the same guys for over 30hrs, having built a town, having been in quite some sticky situations... my party did kind of grow on me. With the latest patches I did miss some of the buildings to build, but it was a step forward and I enjoyed myself.\n\nKenshi began for me when I read about it in March 2013 (who knows how long development will take), and read about a game about a man with a sword (the title translates into the swordsman, I believe) in a world. And he can do whatever he wants. The world is still empty, but it's more of a playable techdemo. In the end it will be a beautifull world, the graphics already are worth showing. So I tried it, lost a few hours immediatly. Later I found it again on Steam and decided to buy it.\n\nA part of the experience now is that you are able to see a game being developed by a very small team. As I learned through the fora it was being made by one man. Just one man, this sounded like the late 80's and early 90's and I loved it. And by being able to sell this on Steam he made enough money to hire people and it is becoming very nice. The money is really being put to good use!!! I have checked out the roadmap and the website and trust me, this game is good and will be better sooner then I might have expected.\n\nBesides this curious development by first one man, I have never seen this much fan-made artwork for any game of this magnitude, and the game hasn't even been finished yet! There already is a lot of content available ingame, some maybe replaced and a lot more will come, but I wouldn't worry about the amount of game you're buying. Especially if you find this game on a sale and you're into sandbox games, I would go for it! I'm not even an RPG fan, but I did go for it and I'm happy I did.\n\nUsually with playtesting a game, there is room for feedback. There is no room for that here, the developer is too small to answer. The fora are spread over several locations and the information freely available may be confusing. But the price goes up as it's being patched towards a release candidate so spend the little the game costs now and join the ride. It's going to pick up speed very soon, everything looks promissing. With every patch the game is one step further, and you can actually feel it. There is a demo available on the website of the game, or you can download the torrent (you'll get the demo, nothing illegal her\n\nI've seen the development go slowly at first, many patches but all small ones. Then after the steam-release the hiring of people and the patching slowed down a bit. Now there are 6 people working on this game and I'm all psyched again!!! I can't wait to start another playthrough! But I'm waiting for the next patch, it has been due for a while now and they promissed a big one. I will amend this review when I've picked it up again. My last play was in februari and a lot has improved. Also a new gameworld is announced, ingame animals and more. Even though they may still take a while to implement, these implementations would require a amendment to the review as well.","December 5, 2013","true","123.1"," 628 of 745 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","628","745","0","22"

I have played 57 hours and I can say (sadly) that right now, that's probably how far you're gonna go, there's not enough content yet. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad game, Kenshi is a great game that shows you how life is hard ¬¬ at the start but after a few hours you can see the progress and it gets cooler and cooler as the time passes.\n-If you want to buy Kenshi as soon as possible: You'll have a lot of well spent hours after you get the hang of it.\n-If you want to buy a full game: Wait patiently. They are working really hard and I'm sure that there will be at least 4 times more content by the end of next year.\n-Slow development CAN'T be used as a negative trait, because Kenshi producers are not a big company like Ubisoft or EA, in fact they're only 6 ! (here's proof http://lofigames.com/about/about-us/ )\nAlso, if you think that a game this creative and complex can be easily made, programming is not as easy as you think,\nOne of my professors once said: "Developing a game is the programmer's biggest challenge"\n\n<->\nConclusion: If you want to see kenshi growing and have a lot of entertainment, buy it, you won't regret it.\nIf you want to buy a full game, keep an eye on the updates and wait until there's enough content for you.\nOh, I almost forgot, you can download a demo on kenshi's website. I don't know how much content is there, but it's probably enough to convince you into buying (or not).","October 5, 2015","true","60.2"," 207 of 251 people (82%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","82","207","251","14","11"

Kenshi is mainly a openworld RPG with a bit of base building and strategy, as listed in the tags for the game.  The character customizations go way in depth.  Everything from eyes to hair, to the length of you arms and legs.  I've seen some messed up people on the screenshots and just about laughed myself off my chair.  The fighting is amazing.  It's realistic.  You try taking on a group of raiders 1v7 and you WILL lose if you haven't trained your person to be a great fighter.  You can hire others, or go at it alone.  The amount of things you can do now, is awesome.  Anything from wandering around from city to city or building a home for you and your allies.  Keep in mind, the game is in Early Access so there are plenty of bugs and random glitches.  Things like out of this world rag-doll, people being stuck inside of each other (kinda funny at first, but can be a pain) and raiders spawning inside of your base.  I have a little list I made that I write down everything and with this last update, a few of the things were fixed.  I'm glad to see this game still being worked on and I can't wait to see this game fully built.  I will keep playing this for a long time to come and I'll keep updating the review.\nAs always,  keep on gaming!\n\nEDIT:  I forgot to say anything about crashes.  This game does crash with me.  I do also get the "Super Crash" every 5 hours or so.  Playing the game for long amounts does trigger this and I hear that a number of things can also cause it to crash.  Save everytime you do something that is major like buliding a town, buying a bit of really good armor, or even when you're on the move.   I also have read a few reviews and I have noticed something.  The game starts you out as a normal person.  You are not all powerful, Dragonborn, The Arison, or somone else who matters.  You start out with almost nothing.  You pick a fight early on, and will be killed.\n\nNEWEST EDIT:  I wrote that review at about 50 hours into the game, several months ago.  I figure its time to update it after no having 200+.  The dev have been pushing updates and fixes out at a nice rate. So in other words, this game isn't dead.  A lot has changed since I first played this game.  There's a new race to play as, more starting stories, animals.   The list goes on.  That's the plus side of this new edit.  Downside includes coming across new glitches and crashing games.  Kenshi isn't as stable as it was a few months ago.  In fact, I've had the game crash about 3 times in a little over an hour.  The Devs are working on this, and I'm hopeful for this game and it's future.\n\nOVERALL RATING AS OF 1/2/2016\nStill a good game, with it's problems.  Research the game before you buy, But keep an eye on this one if you don't get it now.   7.5/10","March 22, 2014","true","264.1"," 136 of 158 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","136","158","0","9"

Months ago, before I uninstalled this game, the developer was only putting out new content patches instead of fixing bugs which have been present since I purchased the game in Jan. 2013 (according to the forums there's still pathing problems with buildings, it's not getting fixed any time soon). Dare to bring this up in the forums, or any other criticizm for that matter, and a legion of fanboys will troll and drown your complaints out regardless of how you present them. The excuse that the game is in the alpha stage is used quite liberally, as these bugs go unaddressed most updates. And even when bugs are addressed the game developer takes a tone announcing it as though it's a waste of his time and he doesn't really want to do it. In fact, the new content and features updates seem to compound bugs which go unaddressed.\n\nI could maybe forgive this, if  the game were entertaining. But it's not, it's just miserably tedious and boring. The combat is slow and pointless, as you watch twenty men surround one for each to take turns swinging one weapon at a time at the target. Once you tire of that, spend hours on end standing around, researching new technologies to craft buildings and weapons and armor and other stuff all to... go out and watch twenty men surround one for each to take turns swining one weapon at a time.\n\nI highly recommend this game - to be removed and for everyone who purchased it to get a refund.\n\nSide Note:\nOh, and the forum moderator is either a paid troll for the game developer or a rabid dweeb trying to get in on the ground floor of what he percieves to be another game sensation like WoW. Either way, eventually anyone who speaks ill of the game gets their thread locked and buried. To me, that's the most frustrating part of the game; you can't even bring up a reasonable grievance against it, let alone warn others away. I hope this review gets around that hurdle.","December 3, 2013","false","63.0"," 693 of 940 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","693","940","0","51"

I already love this game. I find it challenging, immersive and immensely satisfying. I can't wait for more content even though I think what's currently there makes it a worthwhile experience for the price tag, any game that can have me put 45 hours in without even realizing it is going to be worth twenty-ish dollars in my book. Also, this game is absolutely not for everyone. That can not be stressed enough, if you don't like struggling in the beginning of a game you probably won't make it very far, it can be tough as nails if you aren't careful and even if you are you'll probably end up suffering through a few coma's in the early section while you're trying to make your character not useless. There, now that that's out of the way let's talk about the actual game.\n\nThe gameplay is kind of a mix between a diablo-style dungeon crawler and an RTS. Every character has their own stats that can be levelled up through using them, every character can be as strong if not stronger than your starting character. In fact the only real difference between them and your starting character is that you didn't start with them. The movement and combat are fairly basic, there's not much in the form of tactics yet. Other than ganging up on specific units and some limited flanking ability you can't control much more than who attacks who. The path finding can sometimes trip up in the more hectic battles (more on that later) but it is early access and that stuff is being ironed out.\nThe RTS elements shine through a bit more in the base building aspects, you build preset layouts for houses and fill them with various different things like work benches, beds or storage for materials. So far there's farming and resource mining as well as some crafting for weapons, armour and clothing. This will be a lot more balanced when things like hunger get implemented, right now there's not much to point to a farm other than making money and there isn't much to spend the money on other than materials and blueprints for items. You can also build defensive walls with gates and mounted crossbows for defense (and you'll need them, believe me) but these things can trip up the pathfinding again (still more on that later). Considering how unbalanced the economy currently is it still took me a while to get a base I was satisfied with and I enjoyed building it. It's only getting better as well.\n\nThe world is both great and not so great all at once. I found myself heavily immersed in the world, I love the style and the sense that you're picking through the bones of an advanced civilization that's been long ruined, the atmosphere is just fantastic. The aesthetic is my kind of thing with obvious asian influences and you can really feel isolated and threatened in the early goings until you have a decent squad, then you feel like you're a match for the world and that's a really satisfying moment. However... as much as I love the feeling of the world, sometimes it can feel really empty. Yes, it's a wasteland and it's meant to feel that way, but if that's not your kind of thing it will really turn you off. I feel like the addition of small bandit camps to go along with the roaving bands and some oasis-like areas where more plants grow would really do a lot to help that. There's also some work happening on adding creatures to the world and I think that will do wonders for this particular problem. My bar for a well done isolated setting is set really high to be fair, once you play S.T.A.L.K.E.R: shadows of chernobyl it's hard to settle for anything less. The fact I'm even willing to compare the two is very telling about just how great the atmosphere is here.\n\nNow, on to the bugs (disclaimer: I haven't played for a while so some of these may have been fixed since my last session, I'll explain in a bit). You get to hear about the pathfinding which is my main issue. It's kind of broken. It's serviceable for the most part, they can manage to traverse long distances and only rarely do they get stuck, however they still get stuck and that's pretty annoying. I use the "bodyguard" command to make sure my squad moves at the same speed (an option to just make them do that would be nice) but the pathfinding for that is far worse than the regular stuff, they match speed and stay at the same relative position to the character they're guarding and don't realize if they're about to walk into a wall, this is where they most often get stuck because for some strange reason edges like to grab hold of characters and they get stuck in the ground. Also, I've never had them defend anything while under the bodyguard command. Frequent quick-saves make this a mild irritation at worst and if you ever get really stuck and haven't saved for a while there's an option in the menu to pick up and drop all your characters on the center of your camera to unstick them, but it's still a bug and it needs to be mentioned. The other issues with it are also minor, in a big fight sometimes units can get confused about what they should do and end up standing around with their finger in their nose while their buddy is fighting three bad guys at once but they eventually get it together. The last issue I have is that closing the gates breaks the pathfinding when your units are outside, if you close the gate no matter how far away they are or where you tell them to move they will turn around about half the time and walk back to the gate to maually open it. It can be really frustrating but the only time you need the gate closed is when bandits are attacking and they give you advance warning so it can be pretty easily circumvented.\nAside from the pathfinding there's an odd (yet hilarious) bug with picking up and putting down characters, if you do it on the ground they pop up into the sky and get sent flying. They only stop if they hit a mountain or you use taht un-sticking method I previously mentioned. Again, it's just a minor annoyance and it doesn't happen if you put them in a bed or jail cell which is where you should be taking them anyway, but if you get attacked you can't put down whoever you're carrying and you run the risk of getting knocked out yourself.\nThis is less a bug and more of a flaw with the system itself, and it's also the main reason I haven't played in a while. There's a serious memory issue, the game runs on a 32-bit engine and it doesn't have a high enough memory limit for extended play. I'm not sure if everyone has this problem but I can only play for about ten minutes at a time now, it's progressively gotten worse the bigger my base got and the more people I had control of. It used to take a number of hours to crash on me. This could be my fault, I haven't exhausted every troubleshooting option yet, but all the same it's an issue that needs to be addressed. There's also talk of transferring to a 64-bit system which would probably eliminate the issue, but as of my last play session it wasn't implemented and I can only talk about my experience.\n\nTL;DR, this game is an extremely rewarding and challenging experience if you're willing to stick through it and are a fan of post-apocalyptic worlds or deserts in general. If not, there's very little in it for you. The early game is pretty slow and it relies on you enjoying the world around you more than the gameplay, afterwards they both work together and that's when the game shines. If you can't handle crashes or potenitally broken AI then hold off on your purchase but definitely keep an eye on this, when all the issues are ironed out this game will be phenomenal. If you don't mind crashes or other early access problems then this game is worth the money as-is and will only get better with time.","October 23, 2014","true","68.5"," 125 of 145 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","125","145","3","2"

New factions, Gameplay, diplomacy, bandit raids, Cannibals or as also known "Bacon Cultists" With more coming soon. and a new AI being worked on for those pesky super crashes and pathing issues.\nThe game music is moving an wonderful, first game ever where i did not mute the music while playing the game. or kill sound effects along with it. It adds just the right amount of mood to the game.\n\nWhy buy the game?\nWell for one its not like any other game you have played before. its a original and still developing and after each core update it gets better with more items added to expand your gaming experience.\nA original RTS, sandbox game. If your tired of starting a game where you can go out and kill people in one hit from the start! Then this is your game. It will challenge you, you have to fight to survive, living long enough to train yourself from a nobody whom everyone could beat up, to a legendary Hero or Heroine depending on your Gender. It is not a quick game, there is no ending, It is moddable even in its current state.\n\nWhy not to buy this game?\nIt is Alpha Stage Development game. If you don't like dealing with bugs, core game play content thats not added yet, then this game is not for you. The game is not complete, so do not buy the game thinking it is. Some bugs (depending on the computer) can render the game unplayable for a short while. If you're still interested in the game, then wait and watch. Come back in a year ( From this rewrite posting  2-13-2014 ) then give it a try. Until then pass it up and leave it on your wish list\n\nEdit 6/11/2014\nWould like to add a useful page to visit for those reading reviews.\nUseful Information and links For Kenshi\nIncluded is a link to the Demo.\nA report on the super crash thats in the game. it is being worked on to be corrected, that update should be out in 2 weeks or less ( from when i edited this post ) barring any problems. The prospecting thats now in the game is  very good, with a high science skill you can easily find hotspots to build your bases. no more turtling up in one spot. The NPC squad slider was adjusted down, ( From 4x to 2x ) for everyone put it at max then complained their FPS went to He** double hockey stick.\n\nTotal time the Dev has said it would take to complete the game. he is shooting for the end of 2014, but its possible it will actually be some time late in 2015. personally i think it will be late 2015 mostly because there is still a lot more to be added. but we will see once the 64bit Conversion and new pathing Engine are added.\n\n\nEdit 12/25/2014\n\nVersion 0.70.x is now in the beta testing stage before public release. it was released early and full of game killing bugs, which have been ironed out to a point. so should be ready for public release soon.\n\nWe now have animals, Leviathans, Pack Gar's, Dog things, and beak things.\nnew factions though the actual people in them are not in yet.\n\nPrisoner Cages are back in police stations, though been having issues with those.\nThe Memory Leak is gone. though the game is running rather rough at the moment due to it being released too early. but things should smooth out soon and look much better once Directx 11 is added.\n\nWe still have the 1 biom but that won't change anytime soon.\n\nBandits no longer attack you on sight but now chase after you tossing insults and if you just keep running they eventually stop, leaving you to your own shenanigans.\n\nMulti levels to buildings has been added, and looks like the GUI will be redone soon. no more badly fitting text or buttons will be coming with that, plus the squad sizes are supposed to be increased in a couple updates from now.\n\nAt the time of this edit, v0.70.x is only open to beta testing opt in. so things will change once its released to the general public.\n\n\n\nGeneral Info.\nI am one of the Admin for the Kenshi Forums, the other is Gmat.\nI write this review based on me being a regular gamer like everyone else. I personally think this is a great game and just getting better, but i also know its not for everyone.\nThere is a lot of links and information in the forums, including a link to a Demo ( link added on 6/11/2014 )\nI can not stress enough to try the demo first before buying.","May 3, 2013","true","593.6"," 73 of 82 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","73","82","4","7"

You can create your own story, manage your squad, build your city and so fort. Kenshi is an open world sandbox game the map/world will grow with next updates but even now, it's still "big". It's of course currently in alpha stage so you have to wait for updates but, you can still enjoy the whole game until it's grow up. There are people with over 700+ hours gameplay currently so you can spend many times in it.\n\nI highly recommend this game those who also enjoyed games like Mount&Blade.

This is 5 hours of gameplay.\n\nDay 1. I create a female wanderer, and I run around town, in and out of buildings looking for something to do. (20 minutes later I’m thinking, what’s the point in this?)\n\nDay 2. It’s time to leave this town, and venture out across the wasteland, this town sucks. I travel at night, with 900 credits (cats) and a loaf of dry bread, and bare feet. I decide to erect a small shack in the desert, and after doing so, I realise I’ve build a useless unfinished concrete structure, with steel reinforcing jutting out all over the place. I move on towards the next town, leaving the unfinished building to ruin.\n\nDay 3. I arrive early morning to a group of people killing dogs, just outside the town’s entrance. I avoid the people, and try looting a dog’s corpse. I get nothing. Once again, I move from building to building, finding nothing other than a few people offering their services for 700 cats. I decide to hang onto my 900 for now. I find a dummy in one building and decide to hit it, soon realising this is the way to raise my attack points. I do this until I’m at level 5.\n\nDay 4. I’m a hard ♥♥♥, now I’m level 5. It’s time to venture out into the wilderness again to kick a group of dude’s brains in! I run out into the desert and soon see a gang in the distance. They spot me and shout “get the prick”. I decide to run instead. They’re faster than me, and soon catch up. They kick my ♥♥♥ bad. Breaking my left leg, stabbing me in the stomach and putting me in a coma, they leave me for dead face down in the sand, in my underwear.\n\nDay 5. Is spent in a coma\n\nDay 6. I drag my broken leg, limping back to the town.\n\nDay 7. I can’t do this alone, and decided to spend 700 cats on hiring a girl in the local bar, to join me. She heals me, but I’m still limping bad, so I find a bed nearby and pay 100 cats to bed down for a while and heal.\n\nDay 8. An outside gang try entering the town, and the fighting kicks off! I’m recovering in bed, but the girl runs outside, looting as many corpses as possible. She puts some of the armour on, gets instantly attacked and hobbles to the bed next to me, to recover.\n\nDay 8. The fighting is still going on outside, and it’s escalated into gang warfare. Both fully recovered, we ditch the gangs’ outfits (so we don’t get our heads kicked in again!) and begin looting and selling. We decide to hire another member to our gang, and turn him into a tank of a man, (with a hunchback). Together we loot every corpse and finally raise around 15k cats.\n\nDay 9. After some serious dummy training and some more members, it’ll be time to head out of this town again, and back to the shack I began on day 1. We’ll try and get the building completed with a working generator, build a few mines and see what happens next.\n\nTo summarise:\nYeah it’s in development still, and it’s got bugs, but it’s totally playable and worth every penny.\nThe developers seem to working hard on updates and deserve  support & money on this great little gem.\n","April 16","true","25.7"," 54 of 56 people (96%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","96","54","56","16","2"

Even though the game is in an Alpha state, it feels very well put together with features such as mining, farming, and research. It took me a couple hours to get the basics down, and a couple more to get over the fact that my puny characters could be bested by even the lowliest bandit, but one I got a feel for the gameplay I haven't looked back. Definitely one of the more interesting games I have played in a while. It was developed by ONE dude. That is damn impressive.\n\n\nSome tips for starters:\n\n- Research mining before farming (trust me, mining pays for itself)\n\n- Make sure you have a guy or two living in town in case your group gets ambushed and overwhelmed.\n\n- Lead bandits to a city, let guards kill bandits, loot corpses, profit","August 8, 2013","true","72.0"," 109 of 141 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","109","141","0","1"

It is NOT finished.  Anything I say may, and most likely will, be changed as development continues. MANY OF THE BUGS I LISTED WITHIN THE CONS HAVE BEEN PATCHED.  DO NOT LET THE ONES I LISTED RUIN THIS GAME FOR YOU, THEY TEND TO BE QUITE RARE.  EVEN WITH THEM THIS GAME IS STILL AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND WAS VERY ENJOYABLE.\n*TL;DR at the bottom of this review*\n\nKenshi.  This game is brutal.  I seriously had more moments in this game where I wanted to yell at it for being so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard, yet if you look on my profile it's currently marked as my favorite game.  The reasoning behind that is simple, this game offers 0 in the way of hand holding.  If you want a good, long, tutorial that explains every single detail to you in a nice format then Kenshi is not your game.  Wiki?  Don't bother, honestly it kinda ruins the fun of this game.  Kenshi is one of the few games where I can say that I never watched a single tutorial, and yet I felt like by 40 hours I knew some pretty advance things in the way of base building and combat tatics.  This game will suck you in, it'll FORCE you to learn the game.  You'll change your tatics, your starting locations, your ordering in what you need, the way you simply play the game will evolve as you learn, as the game makes you learn.  I loved it.  Every second of it.  Even when I wanted to scream at my computer, I still couldn't help but love this game for what it is.  With that said, pro's and con's time.\n\nPros\n- The devs care.  If you EVER run into an issue within the game, you can post in the discussions and I bet you $100 that atleast one of the admins or mods will respond.\n- Many different playstyles.  This game can be an RTS, a squad based rp, a city builder, it can be so, so much.\n- Landscape is amazing, and the next update will overhaul this.  The biomes, textures, and pretty much everything about the look of this game is pretty amazing.\n- Combat system is nice, isn't perfect, but it's very nice none the less.\n- Medical system is also really cool.  Got hit in the leg?  You're limping your way back to town now, bud.\n- Base building is some of the best i've seen.  The job system and resouce refining is overall very good for its current state.  It has some issues, but that'll be seen in the cons.\n- Trading system is simple and works, though I found a few exploits\n- Farming system is simple but very effective, some bugs will be disscussed in cons\n- Factions are pretty diverse in armor, items, etc.  Cannibals are really fun, some issues with factions in the cons.\n- Smithing and crafting are really simple but work pretty well.  Could be more complex or diffucult, but it's still fun.\n- Training system, once again, very simple.  Not much could be improved here, it works very well and theres not a whole bunch you can do to change it.\n\n\nCons\n- Medical system is lacking.  It's way more simple than I think it should be.\n- Combat can get boring very quickly as it's more stat based than anything else.\n- There are items within the game that are simply better than any other item.  I remember at one point samuri armor or whatever it was called was simply the best you could get.  For me this kinda ruined the feel of being able to have so many different build paths, each to their own.  Be super slow but super tanky, be super fast with TONS of damage, but super squishy, etc.\n- Floating trees, enemies not spawning, falling through world.  These are somewhat rare bugs, but they do happen.  Remember, it's an early access game.\n- Combat system is buggy in some cases.  Weapons can hit or miss when they don't appear they did, sometimes your character appears to have his/her weapon equiped but...doesn't use it?... It's like the models there but the hitboxes arn't?  Wierd.\n- Base building.  99% of my bugs are here. I'll be making a list for this one.\n1.- Sometimes you can place a wall down, and even though it allowed you to place it your units simply cannot reach it to build.\n2.- There was an old bug where building the tier 3 walls would crash you game if you placed many of them at once.\n3.- Some gates, when placed, would never lock/unlock.  You could never open them or close them.\n4.- Some buildings can be built on slight hills, and yet it'll let you build it while your units cannot get into them\n5.- Some buildings, once built, would be unable to open or go up the stairs.\nTHERE ARE MANY BUGS, I AM SIMPLY LISTING THE MAJOR ONES THAT KINDA RUINED THE GAME FOR ME DURING BASE BUILDING.  REMEMBER, MOST OF THE GAMEBREAKING BUGS ARE RARE AND WILL MOST LIKELY ONLY HAPPEN TO YOU ONCE OR TWICE, NOTHING A QUICK LOAD BACK TO A CHECKPOINT FROM 5 MINUTES AGO WON'T FIX.\n\n\nTL;DRThis game is great.  It's hard as steel to learn, but amazingly fun once you do.  You will not suceed on your first try, nor your second or third.  It'll take time, but once you do it is AMAZING.  I reccommend this game to anyone who is willing to put up with a few bugs for an RTS, Squad-based RP, City Builder game, all meshed into one.\n\nFor an Early Access game, I would recommend you pick it up.  You will not be dissappointed.","December 29, 2015","true","70.3"," 65 of 79 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","65","79","3","1"

Mainly, failure that you seek out; in the game I am presently playing, my group has been destroyed and left for dead bar one lone survivor. Not bad for fighting over one hundred battles. Unlike most grinders, losing makes the character better. Each blow suffered, each failed defense helps each character grow stronger. On the same hand, each use of an attack does the same for one’s melee attack. Strength requires either using a heavier weapon in combat, or dragging heavy gear and materials across the sandy wastelands to become stronger.\n\n\nMy character started out with a group, fed up with stifled city life and taxes. We gathered together to head out and found our own homes and lives. After days of preparing our small mining camp, the group is capable of carrying out a full scale mining company, selling goods and creating a faction to be reckoned with. The grind is rewarding, since the humble beginning of this rag tag group.\n\nAll of this is earned through hours, upon hours of grinding. Kenshi is not a game for the light of heart; the grinding will try your patience, and the music, while atmospheric, is ambient and tends to get grating after a while. Blood will spill. Arms will be broken. The crafting system, powered by choice of end product and the speed of production depends on the skill of the creator. Quality has no bearing on the skill, thankfully, considering the hours necessary to craft simple weapons and armor.\n\nThere are presently only five styles of attack available to train in as well as craft. Hackers, Cleavers, heavy weapons, and a variety of katana, and wakizashi. Thankfully, this is all mitigated, in part, by a speed up function that speeds up the world to further reduce real crafting time.\n\n\nEnemies in the current version are made up of Starving Bandits, Dust Bandits, Sand Ninja, and Cannibals. You will end up fighting these enemies over and over, until your skills are good enough to defend yourself and your allies. Depending on start, the other notable factions (United Cities Samurai, Mercenaries, and Holy Nation) will be your enemies as well, presenting a higher difficulty for your characters as they are highly armed and dangerous.\n\nThe wound system is one of survival, with the game tracking wounds to different parts of the body. Head, stomach or chest area, are required to stay conscious . The other limbs if injured come in the form of inability to use the limb or slowed movement, which may make fleeing difficult. Kenshi is unforgiving in this respect.\n\nBase creation is RTS style, requiring building materials, time, and a builder. The overall process is the same as weapon and item crafting, with a number of buildings available for crafting or research.The game’s research and science is also time based; Purchasing blueprints is a matter of heading to stores that sell similar products. Researching requires leaving a team member behind a workshop table to learn new construction.\n\n\nNow, considering the game is in alpha, it’s unsurprising that the models start off simple. With recent updates you are given the ability to manipulate and change the character’s features, with the ability to manipulate even height and weight. This all comes with a warning; at present, many of the combat animations do not work with some of the more extreme body shapes, with super small or super tall, or super wide characters having difficulty meshing with the animations. This presents mostly when using female models, which were recently added.\n\nGraphics are the other issue; the game’s atmosphere is post apocalyptic, this makes the the surrounding environments tame continuous desert. The occasional greenery pops up now and then helping to bring some colour.\n\nThere have been many updates since Kenshi was released an Early Access Game, with changes and updates coming roughly every month or so. With new updates come new clothing, changes to models, landscape changes and many more. Game saves are not compatible between versions; however, there is an option to Import characters from earlier saves.\n\nThere are also quite a number of bugs, mostly to do with path-finding and other commands. As this is an alpha, expect to see them.\n\n\nSO WE COME TO THE END\n\nAfter unfathomable hours of game play, Kenshi drawn me back again and again to it’s blood soaked desert. The game offers an huge amount of freedom. It’s a game of growing numbers and seeing their impact in a world that is filled with danger. It is a game that is hard to get into but once you have the basics say goodbye to real life. It thrives off of swift and brutal combat with only the best surviving to the end, and the weak being cut down dead; the lucky laying unconscious. It is unforgiving, and at the same time, for those who are willing to put in the time, rewarding.\n\nIt is a vicious and simple game, that has a full save/loading system. The grind is punishing; enemies constantly challenge you to grow and adapt, to survive, and eventually conquer those around you. Yet it is just lenient enough for your characters to survive.\n\nThe game is still in development and is missing many features. Expect crashes and bugs at this stage. But remember in development games receive regular ongoing updates and improvements, by purchasing at an early stage you get the game for a reduced price and can watch it gradually grow and improve!","April 27, 2015","true","53.8"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","39","43","0","1"

And if you're like me, and are really excited about where this game is going, you get to feverishly await the addition of future content!\nI've clocked just over 60 hours on this playthrough and feel like I've more-or-less plumbed the depths of it by exploring most of the map, filling up my sqaud with people, doing 99% of the research and getting my main guys to be pretty good at what they do. However I could probably wring another 10-15 hours out of this playthrough easily, and the game has the potential to be infinitely replayable. I'd happily start over right now.\n\n\nBrief Overview:\nUntil you can build your first outpost, you'll spend most of your time roaming around a vast and empty desert. I s**t you not. But trust me, you'll love it, because it's so atmospheric. Also, you will be very, very, very, cautious, hopping between the safety of city walls until you can toughen your guy(s) up. or you WILL get destroyed by ne'er-do-wells in the desert.\n\nThe thing I love most about Kenshi, is that it doesn't need quests or missions (although these may be implemented later), because it's an epic story that tells itself, and you make it up as you go along and become immersed in the story that you create.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIf you love RPG's, katanas, epic journeys, and immersive, open-ended, gameplay, then Kenshi is a no-brainer. The vast amount of potential this game has is a bonus. I wish all Early Access titles were this promising.\n\n\nFor a forcast of Kenshi's future development, check out this handy-dandy Roadmap: http://www.lofigames.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:roadmap&Itemid=71","October 5, 2014","true","142.2"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","53","66","0","0"

This review as of now is quite outdated, but I have not redownloaded this game to test the new contents. The devs seem to be updating the game quite frequently, so take it as you will.\n\nHOWEVER, DO KEEP IN MIND THIS GAME WAS INITIALLY RELEASED ON EARLY ACCESS OUTSIDE OF STEAM ON SEPTEMBER 2009. This game does not play like an old school RPG game that was made in 2015. It feels like a 2009 game with some graphical updates. You will probably never see this game released in your lifetime. At least, not with the complete functionalities that were promised.\n\n-----------------\n\nI can't believe how many positive reviews there are for this game. Yes, the game has potential. Yes, the game is in alpha, and therefore can be judged based on the potential, but this is a game that has been in development for an incredibly long amount of time without significant updates.\n\nI even retried the game today to see if there were updates added. Sure, the game is an open world, but there is still not much to do in the game. Dialogues are sparse and uselss at best, Combat is clunky, the UI is horrendous, pathing is bizarre and unexpected. Even building a city and grabbing a squad of your own feels tedious rather than fun. Character models are ugly, and though the devs are going to be coming out with a new GUI soon according to their announcements, it does not appear to be a significant upgrade from the current system. Landscapes and cities look great at times, but not enough to actually immerse you into the game.\n\nThe game itself is challenging, but not in a particularly fun way. Yes, everyone is stronger than you, yes, the game makes you work your way up in the game, but by the time you do, you've inevitably lost interest in the game, or it has crashed on you about a dozen times. It's a game that I really want to like as I enjoy open-world, sandbox RPGs, but there is simply nothing to do other than wander around, get pummeled, wait to be rescued or recover, and repeat process.\n\nAvoid this game until it leaves Early Access, if it ever leaves early access. The game does have a strong (almost fanatic) fan-base, and the devs do listen to their fans, but the development is so slow, it makes almost no difference whether they do or not. And most negative reviews, whether warranted or not, will get torn apart by this crazed fan base.","April 4, 2015","false","36.9"," 333 of 518 people (64%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","64","333","518","14","1"

I originally bought this game purely on the basis of a vaguely promised potential stemmed from the fact that a single person had so fully and passionately invested in her/his singular dream. I admired that and felt it was worth my acknowledgement as a born-and-raised gamer-at-heart.\n\nAdmittedly, I was not impressed at first.  It was bare on all levels. Yet, I felt something; something trying to be realized; a seed trying to find ground. So, I let it be without judgement.\n\nFor whatever reason the cosmos deem fit to define, I recently felt it was time to test the presumably deeper waters that have been forged since I first endulged to witness the extent of that "something" that had or had not been realized.\n\nMuch to my not-so-dubious pleasure, my hope was revived to spark another true flame of that "it" I've so patiently searched for. Granted, I found it beneath hours upon hours of fumbling and keyboard-shattering crashes; but, honestly, at this point, the game's faults have become part of its charm. Which is really what adds that extra spice to give it that "it" flavor.\n\nDespite all of its admittedly glaring short-falls, it prevails with the potential for which it strives. Like every truly meaningful vision, its success is in its unrelenting ambition. And it only reveals this to you if you are willing to see it; willing to want it; willing to give it more than a glance of your attention. If you are, and if you do, this game will abide.\n\nIt defies the shallow, heartless, financially-infused delusion that is the instant-gratification platform of gaming today.\n\nIt is an uncut, unpollished, diamond-in-the-rough, poised to rise beyond one's incredulity into the veritable heart of imagination that so desperately seeks that ellusive sense of perpetual satisfaction afforded only by the so-called immersive gaming.\n\nNo doubt, it is not for everyone. It is only for those willing to see what it wants to be; willing to see where it is headed and how far it has come at the hands of someone who seems to truly understand, if only on some unintelligible level of consciousness, what is starving the hearts of the angst-filled cynics that are today's gaming community.\n\nTL;DR : This game is for those who appreciate gaming as a form of art. It is indeed a work in progress; but a glorious one. In my opinion, it is worth the purchase on merit alone. The more people willing to see the potential, the greater the potential that will ultimately be realized. I am a believer.\n\nAre you?\n\nEither way, happy gaming.","May 8","true","145.0"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","34","41","0","2"

Yes, you can build stuff, and all the cities you will see in the game, you are able to create by yourself. You can prospect the land to see if it is good to grow stuff, make bread, and open a baker shop; or if it's better to mine, make a weaponsmith and open an armory.\n\nEach character can be an Engineer, Merchant, Medic, Swordsman, Gunman (turrets and Xbows) etc.....\n\nThere are mutiple factions which have unique laws and goals in the world. Of course, it is a dynamic world, and if you place your city well enough, you will get more and more travelers stopping by, renting beds or buying stuff; or you can get known by the closest bandits faction and they will start bullying you to pay taxes.\n\nTo wrap it up, this game is absolutely incredible for the possibilities you get.\n\n\nBUT, it is not for everyone.\n\nActually, the guy (GENIUS) behind this game wanted to create a game where you are not special. You ain't the last dragonborn, nor a mighty knight that will demolish every ennemies. You are a simple wanderer, so at the beginning of the game, literally ANYONE can kill you.\n\n+ the health system is very complex. Each part of your body has a healthbar, which affects your total blood bar.\nObviously, if you suffer heavy injuries, your character will go to Coma state, and eventually die.. forever (permadeath).\n\nSo again, it is for gamers that are looking for challenge. I myself was quite horrified by this game at the beginning, but now I understand most of its content, I can make really decent games where I am able to create an outpost with a production and shops, and a little army to defend myself.\n\nFinally, this game is in alpha state. It is a project that is made by one person to begin with, but now it is a team.\nIt has a slow progress, but has never been abandonned. Plus the price is really fair.\nRecently they worked with amazing musicians that play crazy instruments to make a unique and amazing OST,\nAnd the game is getting a major update soon enough since the map will  change for a randomly generated map with diferent biomes and wildlife.\n\nSorry if this comment is too long, but I almost never comment games, and this one really deserved my thumbs up.\n\n18/10.\n\n","July 27, 2015","true","27.6"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","34","42","2","0"

Update 5/25/2015\nI got sidetracked with lots of review, the preview is gonna wait till i get that performance patch they were saying.\n\nUpdate 5/17/2015 Experimental Update\nHo boy this is.... this is awesome! The old GUI is gone and for the first time ever it looks neat! holy crap. holy holy crap. You should have seen the character creation menu. It looks so clean! And gosh from the last time i played this the game looks a bit better now. I did freeze up here and there but it is the experimental build after all. Will update once i actually starts killing sand ninja.\n\nGame Detail Name: Kenshi\nDeveloper: Lo- Fi Games\nGenre: RPG, Simulation, Trading, Strategy, Squad Management\n\nKENSHI *Sigh*. I'll be straight with you, this game once consume me for a while. Therefor when I was chosen to do a review on KENSHI, i was rather taken aback and did everything i could to avoid doing it. But the time has come. And now i ask you the question, do you know what is KENSHI?\n\nMost likely not, it's not a mainstream game nor a very well known indie for that one but those people who had the chance to try it will usually exclaim that it is better than most of the RPG on the maker and yet here i must make my statement regarding this game: It's not for everyone. Certainly not for me after i tried it.\n\nOk so what is KENSHI?\nRPG game, with a dash of realism. That is to say it is still in early access and i had tried years ago the alpha build before it went on steam and i have to say improvements have been made after all this years. It's an eastern style RPG set in a apocalyptic world where sands rule the land and law and order are determined by might with roaming bands of brigands out for your blood everywhere you go.\n\nIt's a very atmospheric world. You can be beset by cannibals, saved by the Holy Empire Patrol, loot dead bodies and equip yourself and after months of training and war you started killing settlements. The tables have turn.\n\nAnd that my dear reader is what KENSHI embodies, symbolizes and make you experience. You are a human being, in a world where other people are often times better than you. You will bleed in the middle of the desert before using your last medkit to bandage your arm and hobble slowly back to the city. At the end of the day, life goes on.\n\nWhy the bravado?\nSimply because reviewing this game is subjectively hard. That and because i liked it. On with the review i suppose. Many parts of KENSHI will be miss however simply due to the scope.\n\nGameplay\nYou can choose to start with several preset such as having a good weapon, having trade goods [the goods are cheap, the bag however is not.] having a good weapon, having good combat skill [recommended for beginner.] or having several dudes in your party at start. Which i do not recommend.\n\nAnyways customize your appearances, choose a name, gender [Race is coming. Not very soon however since the updates are slow but big.] and then *BOOM* You are drop into the magnificent world of KENSHI. With only a very brief tooltip to get you started on your journey.\n\nThe game is an open ended RPG meaning you can do pretty much what you want without any objective save for those you set yourself. Therefor people who enjoy reading story instead of making it should probably not find it very enjoyable. Anyways you can do a lot of things in the game but lemme just use the very rarely used bullet point instead of typing it out.\n\nStart your own town.\nBecome a master of arms.\nBecome a bounty hunter.\nBecome an anarchist.\nA blacksmith even! with upgrades and blueprints!\nOr my personal favourite: Wandering the waste, getting into fights randomly healing people or breaking their bones. Then you become a warlord and do all of the above. Nothing really stopping you to be honest.\nAnd here is where the gameplay gets fun. You see KENSHI utilizes a unique RPG system where instead of skill points you actually perform the action to upgrade your corresponding skill. System like Carrying extra weight to train your strength, running without any loads to increase your running speed. And actually fighting to increase your fighting skills because you truly suck at the beginning where even a small bandit can make you into coma.\n\nSpeaking of coma this game HP system should be utilize into more game. For example your limbs have individual health bar and each of them can bleed out individually reducing their effectiveness and preventing you from using two handed weapons and sword for examples. But that is not all! Wound your opponent enough on the head and they will faint, on the leg and they will hobble, on the arm and well.... have fun. Meanwhile you also have a blood meter! Lost too much and get coma and die. Subject to everyone. So everyone has an equal chances of dying with only their martial art skill being the tie breaker.\n\nThere is also the element of trading, by buying trading bag which reduces your speed and make you more susceptible to bandits you can buy trading goods and trade stuff from town to town. Then all those training carrying sacks of metal made you stronger so you can then beat up bandits!\n\nThe game is hilariously open is what i am saying. That is not even accounting for squad formation, squad order. create-a-town mechanic function and all the other things in this world. It's the tip of the iceberg.\n\nGraphics\nCompare to years ago the graphics have improve substantially although in 2015 its not really something to write home about. You can even sometimes see graphical glitches from time to time although seeing as this is a rather massively scope game such a thing are understandable.\n\nSound\nWhile atmospheric the ambient sound is best turned off, the game set to windowed mode and you play supplied with your own music. Trust me the lonely landscape takes time to transverse even at top speed so having your tune would supplement it quite well.\n\nConclusion\nMy review will never do KENSHI justice, it is a game of such openness and it provides you with the mean to experience that everybody will play it differently. For me it is the ever path of the wanderer [And the warlord once I figure out how to actually kill someone with this metal rod i call a sword.]\n\nScoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: S-Rank [So long as the update is stable otherwise it's an A-Rank.]\n\nProtip: Try the demo floating around the internet before you commit. The demo is rather old though with many new features have been implemented into the game. Still a long way before release though.\n\nEarly Access Hiccups?\nPlenty. Many features are experimented on all the time on this game. And as such it breaks easily during update. Does not stop you from enjoying it though.\n\nEDIT 4/20/2015: I should really clarify something, i wont ssay this game has potential but it does [hypocrite] but the thing is about this game is that i got my enjoyment out of whatever update it already has so further progress is merely bonus at this point. So dont wait for the potential, just enjoy the now.\n\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups. Win free games, make new friends on Steam, & more!

It is still in Early Access, so a there are missing features, bugs and glitches (but that's to be expected). If these things strike a nerve, wait until the full game is released. Most of the glitches and bugs are easily avoided though; just use the F5 (quicksave key) often. Then when something does go wrong, you can automagically timewarp back and do it all again :)\n\nHow I would sum up the world: Think Tatooine landscape filled with sword-wielding samurai and ninjas. No magic, no fantasy. It feels like it could be real (assuming it's on another planet :P).\n\nI love this game because of the grind. Sure, you have to sink in a lot of hours to get anywhere, but nothing matches the feeling of sheer satisfaction when you've built up a strong party, a well defended base and little stands in your way as a threat. The game was tough to learn, so you'll need to lean on the wiki for support for the first few hours at least. But once you've found your way it's all smooth sailing.\n\nMy only real dislikes about the game are the bugs. The one that annoyed me the most was the teleporting 'dead' bandits. Watch out for these bad boys because despite being 'dead', they will teleport closer and closer to your storage buildings then loot your stuff. And no matter how many times you go to loot the stuff back off them, they will always win. F5 is the only way to save the day.\n\nYet some of the bugs are more amusing than annoying... Like men sleeping like bats, hanging upside down off the sides of beds. Or shopkeepers within shopkeepers so they look like they have two faces, four eyes, two noses and four ears :P\n\nAll in all, if you like games that require a grind and can put up with weird stuff happening, dive right on in. It's worth more than you pay for it. If you like a grind but don't like glitches or blank buttons, wait for the full release. And if you don't like a grind, then this game is definitely not for you.","March 30, 2014","true","90.9"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","0"

A true open world oriented game, with innovative and fascinating mechanics.\nAn apocalyptic world, somewhere between Mad Max and Samurai ronin, where you get to build your own outpost, grow food and craft ever better blades and armor. lots of NPC to fight, or hire, leading to really great sword action scenes. The current desert map (they say a new bigger map is in the works) may seem empty, and it is, but will draw you in with red sunsets as you spend 10 minutes of real life time walking your character (or small army of 20) from a city to another.\n\nUnfortunately, it has been left at that for too long, and hasn't been worked on seriously for maybe 2 years. I have only had it for the last year or so, and must say little work has been done in that time. Sure, a patch comes up every month or two, but only to add a new useless model, or a non working one. Something trivial that really adds too little to this beautiful broken sandbox.\n\nThe developers seem to take this game as a hobby, something to work on every now and then, and don't really address the the main problems; Broken economy, failing or halfway developed production trees, bad pathfinding system, frequent crashes, and numerous other glitches and bugs that makes the game unplayable (not to mention completely undeveloped, greyed out perks and abilities).\nPretty, and creative, but broken. And btw, that's just the games framework I'm talking about, there is no lore or content here of any kind. No quests, or Diplomacy, and the only reason you'll talk to an NPC is to hire it or trade with it.\n\nBut that's fine, as a game in development, it really is just that. Problem is you have no idea where it's going.\nThe developer site has little info to offer (lofigames.com). You can find there a nice 'current features in game' thread that's "updated regularly" but hasn't been touched since september 2012. Or you can check the game's Wiki for more game info, but that wasn't updated since patch 0.44 (we're at 0.69 now).\nThey have posted a 'roadmap' for what will be worked on, but wouldn't give any date, and at current pace, it will never happen. Sure, there are some promising announcements like a new path finding and 64bit engine, or a new map and even matching artwork for future animals, but since they did little to nothing in the last year or so, i'm very doubtful as to when or how that will come out.\n\nThe last few patches, every couple of months or so, were as minor and insignificant as can be (non working walls, useless prospecting ability), the kind of stuff that can be done by one programmer in one relaxed weekend. And they are tossed just like that, without any schedule or following any serious timetable. You never know when a new patch comes out, or what it may contain.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? no. I Don't.\nI believe the guy who came up with it should really get some studio's attention, and maybe start working on a new project from scratch (sign me up for that!). I believe this is one hell of a concept, worthy of a real developing team, with real budget and timetable.\nBut at the moment, this is all you get for your money- the concept of a game. And judging from the past year of development, it will probably remain at that..\n\nBut if you're crazy about open world sandbox games, try this experience out. It really does have nice ideas to it.\n\n\nP.S\nnothing would make me happier than to rewrite this review once development picks up speed. It probably won't.","August 22, 2014","false","137.2"," 92 of 147 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","92","147","4","24"

I started off as a lone wonderer in this world before I was able to construct an entire squad each character named after the people who watched my stream, I had to be careful not to kill off my members as I work on them to become stronger so we can take on the cannibal village. In order to keep myself going the first thing I had to do was lure people to thier death and use town guards as my shield, eventually i built a mine, did some recruitment, and assigned people jobs, soon I had a full functioning village selling items from and creating weapons with close to 20 people. Training for our attack on the cannibals.\n\nWith more work this game will be more and more amazing but it will not be done anytime soon. Its slowly getting better and better as time progress and is worth the value, I hope with support the author can focus on this game 100% full time and get things going because this is a real gem of an idea he has here\n\n\n+Samurai Squad base survival\n+recruit players, customize em and name them\n+awsome music\n+This game is plain fun watching your squad roll out in army\n+create your own town, start selling from your town, start a business from your town (still in the works but works really well)\n+the world is quite big and it all takes place in the desert\n+The animations during the combat is pretty sweet\n\n\n-Theres no real story to the game yet\n-Could use alot more buildings and thing sto do\n-Cant wait for more factions. need moar!\n-Bugs and crashes atm which causes me not to be able to progress too far when I have huge samurai battles\n-The graphics isnt the best thing in the world but he fun makes up for it.\n-Sometimes graphic and ai glitches out, like buildings halfway in sand etc\n\n+- This is a working title, my review and opinion will change as the game progresses but this is basically my ALPHA PREVIEW REVIEW\n","January 28, 2014","true","27.0"," 90 of 144 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","90","144","0","0"

Apparently there are going to be new maps, beasts, quests, and I could even see more Mount & Blade-like politics with faction leaders (you listening, devs?), and mounts, or vehicles, and other characters, and maybe even a storyline, and then there's the modding community, and... and... let me stop.\n\nEnter the desert.","November 14, 2014","true","128.3"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","35","50","4","0"

These games were amazing, because in adition to cementing a sense of justice in a 5 year old, they presented a memorable plot, different forms of character development (DW3 with the personalities, where the personality determined stat increases, and was determined by initial stats. Shining Force with the stories told by your squadmates in the various bases found over the 8 chapters, as well as themes of amnesia. Fire Emblem for being, well, Fire Emblem.) None of that is in this game. Which makes it perfect.\n\n"Why would you tell that story to point out what it doesn't have?"\n\nSimple: Kenshi has everything else that made those games personally iconic. From Dragon Warrior 3, you have each squad member being completely unique from creation, with nearly endless possibilities for customization, with an open world. From Fire Emblem, you have that strategic element, same with Shining Force. But with no 'level' or 'class' system, there are no restraints. I'll admit, I plan after writing this to re-create Shining Force in game, by creating each of the characters in order of appearance. That'll be fun!\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. The combat is fluid, and the AI is great. Giving each limb, and core parts it's own hit points, and changing gameplay according to damage (and changing DAMAGE based on how you choose to heal it) is something more in-depth than most heavy LARP systems I've seen. You can build a base and be a group of peaceful farmers/traders (not that you need to eat). You can start a war with one faction (though I wouldn't reccomend it... ever), or become a group of mercenaries. The sandbox element is strong in this game.\n\nWhile the game is still in alpha, the groundwork has been set for so much more than is already released (as a player, I'd be fine if I had to deal with what i've got.) The few bugs that are in the game are minute and are easily bypassed with frequent quicksaves and game imports. The dev, while a little slow in getting the game out, is very careful to minimize bugs. A perfectionist, if you will.\n\nAnd this brings me back to that 5 year old playing those games for the first time, because while I can't play through those stories again, every click is another element that goes into a script playing in my head. While the characters may not interract on screen, they can be in the player's mind. As an adult, I've been a DM for a few years now, but Kenshi gives even more creative freedom to the player, which is the ultimate goal of an RPG. The only thing you can't do multiplayer, and i'm sure that by the time it gets to full release, it will have addressed that.\n\nThis game can only be catagorised as a Sandbox/RPG/RTS/Simulation/Open World/Base Building Awesomeness. This is better than most games released today, and for the price, you'd be a fool NOT to pick it up. The true brilliance of this game is that there is a start point, but it is infinite.

In a game like Mount & Blade, failure means capture and the loss of most of your equipment and probably all of your units, and you are tied to the unit that captured you without options or variation. When my characters were knocked out by cannibals in Kenshi, my main character was left behind while the two units I had aquired by that point were taken to the cannibal's camp. Eventually, my character recovered enough to limp towards the nearest town, while my units were forced to despirately try to pick the locks of thier cages. One unit escaped, one didn't. The world of Kenshi allows for variation in losing, including the possibility of death for your main character if too much damage is taken. The result is strangly thrilling, and as I watched my unit desperately flee the cannibal camp with enemies running after her, I knew I had stumbled upon a game of great possibility.\n\nUnfortunitly, Kenshi remains too unfinished a possibility. The event I just described was the highlight of my several hours of playtime. At the moment there are no quests in Kenshi. You can build buildings, but there is no guarentee that the buildings will carry over to new versions of the game. My only goal is to build up the strength to get revenge for the unit that was killed by the cannibals. After that's done, I'll simply have no reason to keep playing.\nBuy only if you want to support the developers.\n\nGameplay: http://youtu.be/xQC-_xTyss4\n\nVersion 0.64:\nhttp://youtu.be/IAyhEupIyH4","February 22, 2014","false","27.1"," 60 of 98 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","60","98","0","3"

This game is for those who love Strategy games and building their own town. This game is for people who like freedom and a sandbox to live in. It's special, but if you really are a fan of all the above, you should get this game!\n\nFirst of all, in my opinion the graphics are pretty decent, especially for this type of a game. I know it's far beyond those knock off titles upcoming like Witcher 3 and Inquisition, but keep in mind it's not a pure RPG, you build your own cities and there can be way more NPC onscreen at the same time than you would imagine( I had a realy big battle with like 50+ NPC's, all fighting at the same time). The Audio is well...improvable to say the least, but hey it's still early access. Story: there is none! Or to explain it better: think of your own story, why are your characters here? What do they want to accomplish? And the most important question: why are they doing, what they are doing? Right now there are no quests, but they will be implemented, just like several guilds/parties/groups you will most likely be able to join(if I am not mistaken). The landscape of Kenshi is...monotous right now. You're traveling a pure desert, with many high mountains, but also some dunes. There are many cities controlled by NPC factions, most of them small, some are bigger.\n\nBut for me the most interesting part is the sandbox part. You can litteraly build everywhere! I am not kidding. Only restrictions are terrain such as really high mountains and you're not allowed to build too close to an NPC city. So ever wanted to write your own story? Build your own little kingdom? Craft your own gear to quip your fighters? To send them on a conquest to foreign lands or people you do not like? Or do you just desire to trade peacefully? Or maybe, maybe you're the type of guy who wants to stay alone and take on a huge challenge by fighting all on your lonesome against hordes of bandits?

Both ends of the scale have pretty good reasons for they're decision.  The word potential gets thrown around quite a bit with this game, that's because it does have absurd potential for being massively awesome, but let's just focus on fixing the crashes first (they are much less frequent than they used to be, but still).  Crashing out of the game isnt that bad, the game autosaves already fairly frequently, and you can even increase how often it autosaves.  The combat is quite unique in that you dont directly control your squad while they fight, but their skills dictate how well they do.  Once you see a couple of well trained soldiers quickly work through an army of low skill bandits, you understand how awesome fighting can get.  But I do mean "can get", as you have to work your ♥♥♥ off trying to not get the crap kicked out of your guys until they can hold your own even against a few other enemies.  The game also has a basebuilding mechanic, with research and crafting, but in all honesty I haven't attempted it beyond "I'm gonna build a house on this lovely mouintain", so I don't really know how it all plays out or if it's even working.  The game has a cool trading method, go from town to town buying things for cheap and reselling them at the next town over where they don't have those items so you can sell 'em for a higher markup.  There are multiple starts in Kenshi, from being a naked man with a roughed up arm in the middle of the desert to 5 guys wanting to start a town, there are multiple fun ways to start the game off.  Character creation in Kenshi is interesting to say the least, it's not awful, but a lot of the sliders you just don't want to touch for risk of making your character very disproportionate so the armours and weapons dont look quite right.  I once made a midget named Hugo who wielded the biggest blade I could find, it always hovered near his hands and not in them.  Out of 352 games I can honestly say this game is one of my favourites, Kenshi is quite the experience and I feel like I didn't do the game justice with this review, because its either a game that you will love, or you'll disregard it forever.","July 9, 2015","true","34.9"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

There is a definate progression to all your skills that is satisfiying.

I bought Kenshi on the steam sale, and instantly became hooked.  There is no friendly, happy, bunny mode.  You begin in one of the scenarios you choose. i.e. your starting squad and loadout, and instantly begin in an unforgiving world of sand ninjas, samurai, and desert drifters.  How you choose to proceed is up to you, and if you choose unwisely, you will die/fail.  No one to blame but your past.  If you don't rush into the desert wastes, put some thought into you development, and plan, there is a great chance you will succeed ... or at least not be bludgeoned too bad by hungry bandits.  Wait and admass a squad and income before trying to form your own town and you will be okay; if not you will have to fight like clint eastwood in an old western, but without the guys.\n\nGreat game for those with the patience to play it and overlook the occasional bug.  On this issue, updates are constantly coming out, and fixes come out even faster.  The Dev is doing a great job for it's small operation, and if you can handle the occasional stress of dealing with a bug and at the worst having to revert to the newest save or auto save, there is nothing too flawed about the game.\n\nI highly recommend it for any serious gamer.  If you can handle anything but immediate gratification, don't buy it; plain and simple. Just call downstairs to your mom for some more soda and pizza bites ... everything will be okay snookums’.","February 12, 2014","true","91.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Though the mechanics of  this game seem cruel I feel greatly rewarded when I survive an attack against bandits or get my characters' skills up.\nI had started as a survivor, looking at my war buddy as I woke from a losing battle. Though he looked to be healing alright he was still unconcious and we where a long ways from any city. It took some time for me to manag(figure out) how to carry the larger man but I had managed and began walking my way towards a city. I had noticed two bandit groups skirmishing just a little distance away from me.\nAfter getting to the city I was able to buy a mercenary to help me go and pick up some salvagable equipment from the battle that I had seen on the way over. WIth the money from that equipment I hired a medic and we waited for my friend to wake up. Two days later he wakes up and we set out for another town. Two more people joined up and we moved on to another town. After fending off some badits and sand ninjas he limped out way into the Holy City of Sharks where four more people joined up. We had a large group now so we thought it would be  smart idea to build our own city. Two days later in the middle of the desert we where lost to the sands.\nThough my group met a tragic end at the hands of cannibals I was still able to enjoy the hours long playthrough. I learned alot abou thta tfirst one and am going to put that to good use in my next playthrough. I would deffinately recommend this game to hardcore RPG and stategy game fans.\n\nEdit:PLaying this game on and off and loving every minute of it. The game gets better and better each time it's updated. Though I will say that I wish they would bring back certain scenarios such as the survivor one where you and an ally survive a fight. I found that one to be the most fun but I still enjoy the new content to a great deal.

Now if they ever fix it so npcs spawn in towns so you can hire more squad members instead of having to import to a new game everytime and then bugging your town such as the walls allowing npcs to walk through them after you import for example, would be a great first start. Until then, however....NO.\n\nThey said they plan to polish it and work on stabilizing soon someday, so maybe when they start doing that i can change my review back to yes as I had it when i first got the game and ignorant of how long this game has been in development, thinking it was just a couple weeks old and not 2 or 3 years at the time. So now we are heading into year 5?  I do like the game concept,gameplay and the genre of this kind. I believe this game is more likely to become abandoneware than a finished game as slow as its getting developed.  That is why I say NO.\n\n6/3/16. The last month included a lot of fixes and such, you still have to import your game to new game if you want to hire more squad members.  Prisoner cages are still bugged, you can pick lock them with prisoners, and they still ask to be set free even though its unlocked. Most of them don't even talk to you.  I just crashed the game by dismantling a small shack.  So although they keep adding new content, which is a plus for any game, except when they ignore fixing what they already have. So I must keep a no recommendation, until they show development that counts.","March 4","false","88.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I rarely give bad reviews, but there's no way in hell I'm letting them get away with this.\nConceptually, this game is amazing and full of potential. It's the closest thing we have to a Mount and Blade clone. However, with so many years in development and such trivial updates, I've come to realize this will never be a finished, quality product, ESPECIALLY now that it's on special, and it's nothing more than a buggy sandbox with few ways to interact with the world around you.

Combat is dangerous and every encounter has the potential to be your last. Numerous factions have their wars and alliances, and you can participate if you want, or just loot the corpses like a gross human vulture that has no honor.\n\nThe problem with the games are thus: The engine isn't the best in the world, so graphically it's rather unimpressive, however the artists have done a great job with worldbuilding and locations look unique enough that graphical limitations don't hinder the game at all. Another possible gripe is that the early game's combat is very, very hard. You will be knocked out for most of your time with Kenshi without proper preperation. It's stupid to brave the wasteland alone, you aren't the Dragonborn; you're Jeff from accounting who's decided to become a vagrant warrior with little to know chance of survival. That being said, a larger party and training vis a vie the practice dummies can make combat easier.\n\nAll in all Kenshi has been developed slowly over a long period of time, and it's clear the developers have put love into their game. Updates are progressing steadily and adding in new content and features. Kenshi's a good game now, but it'll be a great game when it gets released.","May 12","true","5.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","9","9","4","0"

But what this game is, is so much more, or at least potentially.\n\nYou create a character in a post apocalyptic feudal Japan-ish world, and from there your on your own. You can be a merchant, thief, shop owner, start your own town/outpost, craft your own weapons and armor, build different kind of functional buildings, research technology to build/craft even better stuff. You can train in fighting, stealth, repairing etc. by doing what ever you want to train in. Recruit squad members as bodyguards or as part of your personal mercenary group/army and control and train each person individually.\n\nAt first the game had sub-par GFX (It still not great, but aesthetically pleasing) and no sound, but bear in mind it was still in pre-alpha (currently in alpha), the graphics have improved since, and there is sound now. On top of that new major features keep being added every few months.\n\nI bought the game when it was still $10, and it feels like an investment. I play it for a couple of months, when I come back after, say six months, more features are in and feels more polished every time. A few new major features (64bit engine, dialogue, overhauled pathfinding, animals/beasts and a new larger map with biomes) are planned for the near future. They already mentioned the beta in their latest progress update, price will probably go up again.

I have been following the progress of this game for a long time now and I can tell you the developer is not giving up on this game.  In fact, the game has grown from beiing produced by a one man team for the first 6 or more years (Chris The Great A.K.A. Captian Deathbeard) to a full fledged indie studio.  Progress has picked up a lot recently with the new AI, Creatures, and a new World Map 4X bigger than the current one (which is massive already) with much much  more than just the desert and mountains biomes we have now.\n\nEach character in your crew levels up differently, has their own inventory and skill levels and can be fully controlled seprately.  You can fight stuff, start a village, mine things, research new buildings and things to put in buildings, keep training your men (or an awesome team of Charlie's Angle style girls with a mysterious leader who they've never seen like I did).  Your village can grow into a massive city through tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of work, but it's all worth it in the end.  Have a lone solider or command an army of unstoppable awesomeness (or sexiness).\n\n\nDon't let the low number of hours fool you, I must have had over 100 hours on the pre-steam alpha release.  I haven't been playing it too much lately mostly because I'm going to do a brand new start when the new massivly updated map comes into beta in the summer, and the fact that there is currently an annoying random crash bug that happens when wandering far distances, so keep hitting F5 to autosave every few minutes.  Those things aside, this game is definately worth $20 and I suggest you get it now because I have a feeling when the new map comes out this summer, the price might raise to $25-$30.  I got it when it was $10 and it was the best 10 bucks I've ever spent online.

of skills and attributes currently available (17) appear to be about half of what is planned for the final release) by performing activities that are related to that skill.\nThings such as carrying a heavy load or swinging a heavy weapon in combat will improve your Strength, whereas wielding a lighter weapon will increase Dexterity.\nEven at the farm, crafting weapons/armor, picking locks, or simply running laps around town will increase their corresponding skills (btw, each of these actions I listed apply to unique skills).\n\nOnce your starting point is chosen, you are then introduced to a rather in-depth character creation screen.\nThis character creation screen allows you to choose either gender as well as modify hair, eyes, skin, muscle tone, height, weight, girth, bust, and most importantly, facial hair.\nAfter creating your character, it is possible to find an NPC called the Plastic Sugeon (should be at least 1 in every NPC town) that will allow you to modify any character in your squad using this character creation screen (it goes without saying this emphasizes the sandbox part even more).\n\nAfter you're satisfied with your character, then explore the Kenshi-verse to your heart's content!\nI say this because the current world (which is nothing but desert) has been confirmed to be less than 1/4 of the actual Kenshi-verse, AND this new world map is currently in the works as I am typing this.\n\nSome basic control shortcuts to help new players get started:\nShift+LMB stack of multiple items = Allows player to pick up whole stacks of items\nHold RMB over any character = Brings up a list of all the actions that can be performed on this character (NPC or PC)\n\nThe rest of the basic controls are either given to you at the start of gameplay or can be found, and rebound, in the Options -> Controls menu.\n\nAnother HUGE part of Kenshi that I haven't even touched yet is modding.\nKenshi has been developed from its core to allow extensive modding so that each player can have an even more unique experience.\n\nTo my knowledge, there are mods available that:\nAdd new weapons/armor to the Kenshi-verse\nAdd dialogue, and dialogue trees, to NPCs (which bring a large variety of things from quests to mercenaries, and I think its also possible to edit existing dialogue to read in other languages)\nAdd structures to Kenshi and modify their functional components (things such as a structure's capability to receive an item to Input and produce an Output from it or to allow the mass Storage of a certain item)\nModify components of NPCs in various ways (things such as # of bandits in each squad, add entire NPC towns, change ownership of an existing town from one faction to another)\n\nAmong many, many other mods that have already been produced by the Kenshi community.\nThere are also numerous, well-detailed tutorials available for any user to learn how to mod Kenshi in less than a day's worth of time.\n\nAnyone that has read this far should go to:\nwww.lofigames.com\nand check out all of the information available there.\nBe sure to click on the Roadmap tab at the top to see everything that is planned and when it will be implemented.\nOh, and you should totally join in the conversations on the Forums (I'm on there a lot ;D).\nChris, THE dev and programmer of Kenshi, also posts regular updates to his twitter page as well as screenshots at:\nwww.twitter.com/lofigames","January 11, 2014","true","424.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"

There is maybe one character I've encountered that is willing to join you, and he costs 6000 in game currency.\n\n-And you're gonna need some help, because the game is irritatingly difficult when beginning. I know it is supposed to be a challenge, but the only way to level your guy is to follow around a patrol which may or may not encounter hostile groups. Even then, expect to get only a few hits in before the patrol wipes out the enemy.\n\n-Getting your character to attack is a hassle. Right clicking works some of the time. Other times you have to hold right click over an enemy and tell your character to attack him.\n\n-The staggering animation after being hit often leaves you open to another attack, which can stagger you again. Kinda lame considering that...\n\n-The punishment for losing a fight is way too severe. When you get KO'd you can be waiting upwards of 300+ seconds to have your guy wake up. After bandaging yourself, you must limp/walk to the nearest city to sleep if you don't have the materials to make a camp bed. Getting to the nearest city can take long enough, but sleeping till recovery takes waaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy too long considering how the rest of this recovery process goes...\n\n-If you do make a camp bed, because limping to the nearst town takes too long, I hope you don't mind spending the night with bandits or dogs, who will stand over you until you wake up. And then kill you. And if it was dogs instead of bandits, then you might as well make a new game, because they're not going anywhere after you get KO'd.\n\n-Poor optimization in its current state.\n\nA lot of people enjoy the game, and for good reason. Just be warned that you might find this game to be pretty tedious, frustrating, and possibly unplayable. I'd say to wait a while before buying.","May 13","false","34.6"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","22","35","2","5"

My first question is; why hasn't this game been completed yet?\n\nI shall now answer my own question with: it is because of you, the loyal customer, only you the ones who have been active in the forum have interfered with this game being completed the way it was intended.\n\nHow? You ask?\n\nPeople like to demand that the developers include everything under the sun they desire, pointless trivial things such as 'race' and I recall someone mentioned 'hot-air balloons' and so on and so forth. Let us all remind ourselves that this is a post-apocalyptic world that thrives because of its realism, now then, I've had this game since it came out and I am certain this game was never supposed to go down the road of 'races' and the mystical such. If you are angry that this game is not complete like I am, it is because of said developers not having a clear focus and an active forum.\n\nNow I am not saying it is a bad thing that the developers are allowing their customers to influence the game I mean, we paid for it, we should be allowed to have a say, yes that is good practice but what annoys me is when the game starts to spin off into a half complete spiral of forever being at 50% because people keep asking for 'cool' stuff and as a result unforseen bugs occur that require manhours to fix which all builds up and here we are.\n\nNow they have added cannibals, and I think great, something to keep the player focused on their...well, squad I guess, this might have been a player-suggested idea although from the general feel of the game when I had first made my review I could have predicted a group as such existing. My only main issue, is that the game often finds itself struggling to balance the micro-management aspect and the combat aspect of the game, for example, at the beginning of the game, you are by your own (assuming you picked either the merchant or the default spawn), you have to survive and learn, you lure some bandits into a city they get violently murdered and you sell their stuff, get some more squad members, rinse and repeat, it's great fun, I'm sure each player would agree. THEN we are tempted into creating our own city.\n\nThe city building is a fun aspect but it simply becomes a process of just sitting on your ♥♥♥♥ staring into nothing watching your members work away for hours on end until you travel back to sell your wares, remember that there are bandits, end up having to sacrifice a slower member for the 'greater good' and then get back into the combat aspect, bored of base building.\n\nAll-in-all I'd still actually suggest that you buy this game but just don't expect too much clarity in where this game will end up.\n","April 16, 2015","false","73.4"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","1"

The feeling of being horribly puny in a world that seeks to better itself , and then becoming strong enough to crush the world is a feeling only comparable to doing the same thing in your everyday life. That is Kenshi. You write your story, you act it out. Crush your opposition, or bankrupt their pocketbooks? Annihalate the bandits, or help them take over cities? You are, or will, be asked these questions over and over.\n\nAnother of the great things about Kenshi is that it takes the motto of Urbanprophet; Unfair, Random, Brutality; and takes it to the next level. The game is exceedingly Unfair. You will probably lose men. That one-man army you really want to be? Well, he's lying on the ground, dying slowly after being attacked by 30 bandits. It's a painfully wonderful experience. It is Brutal, the enemies do not go easy on you- You just killed those Samurai's buddies? The entire faction wants you dead now, and you have armies of some of the strongest people in the game after you. Oh, now you can watch your 12 man squad rot slowly on the dusty desert. It is Random. No two people are the same unless they're twins or you made them that way. Every combat experience is utterly random. Yes, there's SOME consistency, as a soldier with 40 combat skill and 40 Defense skill probably won't get taken out by a couple of hungry bandits, but lucky hits DO happen. It can be frustrating to see that up-armored beast get KO'd by some thugs with sticks, but even SAS Operatives get shot by untrained Guerillas.\n\nYou almost have to be a masochist to play Kenshi. Almost.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is consistently buggy, whether it be from minor graphics glitches caused by saving/loading, upto pathing issues that can be game-breaking. It's painful to be forced to watch your men die on the sands, and the fact that the game can't recognize your men are all pretty much dead and allow you to start a new game is a little offensive. The lack of a "Return to Main Menu" button is a little disconcerting in itself.\n\nIn addition to that, it lacks a lot of diversity in its content. The "Music" is virtually nonexistent. It almost makes it difficult to want to play the game. Almost. Weaponry and Armor for your characters has a distinctly Asian flair, but doesn't deviate far from that. Combat animations are virtually the same for all people and weapons, and Melee combat is currently all there is. You buy Mercenaries. You kill things. You might even build a base. It's easy to become disillusioned if you aren't patient, or a good role-player.\n\nAt the moment, the one game I can compare this to is a 3D Version of Caravaneer, without guns, and that is a very good thing. What the developer here tries to pull off is an extensive trade network with fluctuating prices; towns that have surplus stocks and will pay desperately with whatever they can to get what they're on a shortage of. That doesn't happen.\n\nDespite all of its flaws, Kenshi is a masterpiece. While dated in its mission, lacking in content, and occasionally utterly monotonous, Kenshi delivers the ultimate RPG experience that even real life cannot give you: The chance to write your own story, completely unfettered by society. The only problem you have left to figure out is: Do you cut your path into the ground, do you line it with the ruins of empires, do you gild it with coin, or do you merely walk it? It's upto you to write the story; it's upto you to buy and play Kenshi.","February 27, 2014","true","329.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I've always loved being able to make my own stories and characters within a game and it works well in this.\n-There is always a new story to tell with your character(s). Example: Getting kidnapped by cannibals and barely escaping(if at all), then building/training an army and taking your revenge on them.\n-You can mod the game, however it isn't the most straight foward and there are not too many made for it yet. You can find some on the nexus, if you know what you are doing.\n-Updates. The makers of this game DO release updates and patches even if they do take a while, adding new content that stack layers of gameplay. If you do some research you can see the guy who made this game loves it and truely wants to see it finished (even hired more people to help build it).\n\nCons:\n-Like I said, the updates can take a long time to come out but they do.\n-Some people experience bugs and crashes while others do not.\n-Once you get your characters up to a certain level in combat it may become a little too easy. However, they are adding new stuff to keep it challenging.\n\nIf you enjoy these games you may enjoy this one:\nX-com, Age of Empires, Mount and blade\n\nOver-all I give this game a 8.5/10 in the experimental beta build.

I would say that while buggy, the game is fully playable now, and really stands apart from any other game I have played.\n\nIf you enjoy a CHALLENGING RPG/Open world steam punk sim, and you want to support the developers who tackled this very ambitious project, then BUY IT!","April 30, 2015","true","36.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Kenshi can be played as RTS where you lead troops but also you can play it as RPG controling 1-2 characters and make their stories or you can play the game as a town builder.\n\nPositive aspects of game:\n\nFreedom: The best feature i belive is the freedom you have in game do whatever you like, kill whoever you like, you can be a thief, a killer, just a wanderer or whatever else you like to do.\nRealism: Maybe the graphics are not yet the best and the animations a bit glichy but the game mechanics are realistic, every single unit-character has hit points for each part of his body. Head, Torso, Stomach and another 4 for 2 legs and 2 arms, if you get badly wounded you might fall in a coma and never wake up, or wake up after days you might even lose your hand or leg forever, and offcourse if you die is permadeath.\nMods: The game can be moded for further fun.\n\nNegative aspects of game:\n\nBadly writen pathfinding: The pathfinding i think is the worst thing the game has it needs to be rewriten and fixed asap. The units-characters tend to stuck between buildings because they dont know where to go.\nCrashes: Random crashes can happen I also noticed that sometimes after a crash the game gets corupted and it keeps crashing more.\nBugs, Gliches and Low FPS: The game is in early state since Octomber 2012 they keep adding stuff but the game is not stable I believe they need to make a stable release and fix those errors before they put more stuff in.","November 9, 2015","true","47.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Kenshi is one of those games.\n\nUnfortunately, Kenshi has sounded very good for a long time now and hasn't actually had much added to it. You'll spend most of your time watching a character walk from place to place while keeping the game on fast forward.\n\nBut perhaps the combat is redeeming, you say? Nope, you fast forward that too. In fact, there's very little reason to not just play this game on fast forward the entire time. It's basically a watching simulator.\n\nBut the fun doesn't end there. The forums are rather heavily censored and anything that isn't praise toward the developers is deleted and followed by a ban. As of now, I don't think people who don't own kenshi can even post there. This is clearly just an attempt to censor the forum more heavily.\n\nSo, why should you consider kenshi? Well, if you like games that have been in development for years with minimal progress it's right up your alley! If you like games where you hit an endgame with almost nothing to do it's perfect as well!\n\nAnd if you go to the forum for tips you'll be told to "make your own game(Within kenshi)." Yup, the consistent suggestion on the forum is to make your own little game, with your own rules and a load of artificial difficulty that you impose on yourself.  The reason for this is, of course, that there's absolutely nothing else to do.\n\nYou make a little base, get a few guys, and that is it. That is completion of the game. It's not even a matter of ignoring a bunch of features.

However, the greater vision for what the game will be is clear and it clearly is going to be a game of epic proportions with plenty of replayability.\n\nFull Review:\n\nThe game lets you play as you wish. Want to be a BA swordsman with an elite squad of goons? Done. Want to be tader making your way through the waste lands? Done. Want to settle your own town and be the greatest blacksmith in the land? Done. Want to by a sleezy tief in the night? Done.\n\nThe game has a fantastic engine that allows you level your character based on the actions he takes. If you fight a lot, he will become better at fighting. If you run around a lot he becomes a faster runner. Carry heavy things - builds strength. Unit growth is very organic, though you can also setup tasks to help power level guys as well.\n\nThe main game, which is not completed yet, will allow you to effectively build your own clan. You will be able to raid other towns and even take them over. If you do not want to run your own clan with towns then you can try your hand at being a merchinary in one of the many conflicts that will going on around the map.\n\nThe game is also introducing multiple races and ambient creatures that will kick your butt!!\n\nAll the fun stuff aside there are some drawbacks. At the time of the post this is still very much in Alpha. The game crashes regularly, your save files become outdated or unable to be retrieved often, and your are constantly tantilzed by the features you can see but not use. For an Alpha it is pretty playable though and the dev makes balancing changes every so often so that the game remains fun to play.\n\nIf you cannot handle losing your entire saved game or getting randomly kicked this is not the time to buy, wait for the proper release. If you can't wait to be a steampunk samuri in a desert wasteland then by all means get it!","November 16, 2015","true","148.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I play with experimental patches enabled, and I get to see the latest additions to the game- bugs included.  If you're a fan of participating in the course of a game's development, your input can- and will greatly impact- the course of the game's development.  This is one everyone should get onboard for!\n\nFor starters, I'd like to thank members of the development team and their forum moderators for being so involved in discussion.  Many of the threads created in both the Steam forums and the Lo-Fi Game forums end up with answers from members of the team, and what you say can and will make an impact.  To be able to get in touch with someone heading up the game and recieve a personal response is both uplifting and noteworthy.  For me, this game gets high marks for this level of involvement in the community, as for many other development teams, such close coordination has been too much to ask for.\n\nOn to gameplay; Kenshi is an interesting mesh of Real Time Strategy, base-building, caravaneer mechanics, where you have many choices of how to make your living.\n\nIn terms of RTS, you can choose from or mod your own Game Start that allows you to pick a set of characters or character, and enter the game world to begin an adventure.  Mechanics are simple:  Using the Numpad or your mouse, you select your character and order them with a click to move.  You can do this to adjust your active navigation, taking detours where you need to, or you can rely upon the surprisingly competent pathfinding AI, which can take you from one side of the map to the other appropriately if you let it, though sometimes patches make this feature a bit fragile.  There is no first person or third person play, it's really a game of watching and hoping you've trained your guys enough that they can handle themselves in a combat situation.\n\nYour life revolves around your squad, and what you choose to do with them.  You will, at some point, be attacked, and you will have to fight back, so it's best to train up your brave men and women any way you can to keep yourself above the frey.  At lower levels, combat can be hard, if not embarassing.  You can be slaughtered and not even see a rational reason why (other than your guys just suck at swinging a weapon).  Currently, swordsmanship is the big deal going around, granted the namesake of Mortal Kombat character Kenshi (literally; swordsman), though turrets have been added to the game and ranged weapons are expected in the future (no muskets or revolvers, though modding will make that quite easy to do once ranged mechanics are in, so look forward to it!).\n\nThe real fun in Kenshi is in what you decide to do with yourself once you're in.  Bounty Hunting, Raiding, Murder and Looting are all part of the possibilities, but more than that, you have the option to become the target of such things.\n\nOne of the lifestyles you can fall into is a sort of wandering trader, or caravaneer.  Basically, you throw backpacks on a few of your squad members, put the best weapons in the hands of your best muscle, and send your people from town to town crating goods for sale.  Each town hosts a unique set of prices for certain goods; Chainmail can be worth 76% of it's base value one place, and 130% of that value in another, allowing you to invest a lot of money that makes a good return.  All that matters is that you don't oversell to the extent that it breaks their bank.  Being a traveling merchant grants many benefits, and it's a good way to get a leg up in a new game, as running builds strength and athletics, which aid in fighting, running and hauling later on in your lifecycle.\n\nAlternatively, the player can create their own town and have the merchants come to them.  Now, this is a fantastic feature, the construction mechanics of the game are pretty solid, even in it's current state.  If you see a man-made structure in the game, chances are that you'll be able to build it.  You start with a decent shack or house, build a research table, set up a farm, and start work on learning new things and stockpiling new resources.  It takes a while for a town to become self-sustaining, but when it does, you can feel free to hermit it up.  You basically have the same tools at your disposal as the developers do when it comes to construction, and you can make the same quality of layout if your talent allows.  Setting up shops and resource centers allows trade and storage, and building walls and turrets keeps out any unsavory individuals that you might find in the wasteland.  Yes, sometimes a world without borders can be a dangerous one.\n\nIf being a nice guy minding his own business doesn't suit you, or if the Holy Nation stumbles upon your town of peaceful Shek peoples, becoming a more hostile force is also an option.  You even get the option to be a little creative...  Building cages and holding areas for the people you knock out on the battlefield gives you the option to take prisoners, and there'll certainly be more that you can do with this mechanic as the game progresses.  The Role Playing options offered in this game exceed those offered in many others, and the style of gameplay isn't just fun, but addictive.\n\nWith this said, there are a few downsides to the game that you would probably want to know about before buying.\n\nFor one, Kenshi seems to be set-in-stone in terms of what lore it will follow.  This is no problem to most people, but to some, it's pretty concentrated on one Apocalyptic Eastern theme.  I've found that the concept the game follows is a bit rigid, as it celebrates the way of Eastern warriors, yet, leaves out the opportunity to equip shields for added defense, neglects any Western-style weaponry (no Claymore, Gladius, Spear, or Cutlass styles), and the story behind it all can be a bit confusing, at times, with regard to finding a point in it all.\n\nWhat bugs me about the weapon variety is partly explained by the fact that I'm more familiar with Western swordsmanship than Eastern, and I feel that these arts are something that the game is missing out on in a great opportunity.  As it stands, there are a limited number of weapon classes and they're pretty much wide-spread, though manufactured by different "companies" and distributed across the world.  There's a lot of room for far more variety, and it'd help a lot to convey the differences in design between factions if these weapons weren't just different shaders and colors, or cousins basically (different but the same).  Don't get me wrong, there's like 12 separate weapon types in the game, but they're all pretty closely related.  If more varieties were included, you could see a stronger divide between each faction, and one sword from Holy Nation could convey an entirely different culture than a sword from the United Cities.  That's the biggest thing about this metal craftsmanship; it makes unique combat styles for unique cultures.  More weight should be placed in this category of diversity.\n\nThe next thing is definitely the lack of shields.  Blocking is done by swords, and if you've studied metal, you know at some point it'll give out.  Eastern warfare did involve the usage of shields in battle at times, and they really do deserve a place in the combat dossier.  Additionally, including shields would open up a new realm of possibilies for modders possessing the talent to model new designs for inclusion in the game.  Imagine having an entire Roman Legion patrolling the game world, the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhen it comes to the background of Kenshi, I feel that it might be set in stone, and since I don't know what's written on that stone, it leaves me unsure of how the development will play out.  I am confident in the team's ability to carry out their mission and bring this game to completion, but I do worry that some ideas might not see the light of day.\n\nAll said, this game is well worth buying!","May 16","true","44.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You aren't the biggest baddest guy in the world, you aren't going to be able to defeat an army by yourself, you can't do shiznit in this game...  Unless you work for it...\n\nThe only way to get anywhere in this game is to work for it.  If you want to be the strongest man in the game, you have to train long and hard.  If you want a giant city, you have to get the resources, and build it by hand.\n\nOne of the coolest parts about this game is the work mechanics.  Say you want one guy to be your engineer and build all the buildings and such.  Well, you aren't always going to be building things, are you?  No, so you set engineering as your permanent job, which means that if there is a building job going on, then he will do it.  And then his second job may be researching, so when there is no building going on, he is researching more buildings.\n\nThis game may be an alpha, but I have played 25 hours and it seems like there is still more to research and build.

Seems my library is filling with those. Not a whole lot to do at this time except roam the waste and find new members, and sadly they dont respawn, so once you empty a bar out of potentials thats it. Otherwise its about build your base / manufacturing facility and then set out to make money. The combat is rough at first, your so overclassed, but just because your team is beaten down does not mean its over, sometimes some wake up or are just playing dead and will get up after the bad guys leave and you can save your team with them. Its also persistent in damage, if a guy has a bum leg, he will limp, and slow the party down.

I was able to find this gem of a game. I have played way more hours then what is currently said on steam, I had the game before they even put it on steam but I don't recall how long ago that was. Anyway this game is amazing and I love how unique it is from every game. The game first will first ask what gameplay do you want to start was and the option was wanderer and something else. Then you got thrown into game and had your character customize screen show up to change the way your character looked and name him as well. Then it would make you feel that you could not fight alone in the game and that you were just weaker then everyone since they've been through experiences that you haven't even experienced yourself like fighting. Since then they've added tons of new features like farming, mining, and crafting, as well as a lot of new defensive weapons at our disposal. They haven't done an update in a long time though since the next one is supposedley the 64-bit build, new pathfinding engine, and the map too. So i'll update this review when it comes out.","October 13, 2014","true","89.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Having played just above 80 hours I feel I can write a decent review of this game.  Having bought the game almost a year and half ago and seeing short progress I was worried; however, it's good to see that there are dedicated people still out there not just trying to get their quick cash and move on.\n\nKenshi offers you a vast empty (which is good)  desert world where you must fend for yourself and that's as far as the story will take you at this moment in time.   The choice is yours, what do you do? Read a bunch of f**king guides is what you do, or at least myself, but I digress.  Throughout gameplay you must make decisions where to incoporate your time....as in...do I take my only 2 soldiers to escort my 3 traders to a town to sell Ale/chainmail/katanas/fragaxes/medkits/etc, or do i keep 1 soldier at the outpost guarding 2 of those traders while they continue to produce while only sending 1 soldier and 1 trader....which could possibly be attacked by a multitude of people (have fun with that population setting!)  At the same time you must research and dedicate certain squadmates to certain jobs where they will become more proficient as such.  Efficiency is key in Kenshi especially when you just start your outpost.\nBase building is relatively smooth with only minor bugs which can be avoided by a quick save and reload  (applies to entire gameplay as well), and although there aren't uses for many of the items currently ingame besides monetary value there is much promise for the future.  The core buildings on the other hand are useful and there are many of them with industry like processes to advance your small faction as such.\n\nAs far as skills go Kenshi has many of the same skills you find in any other RPG game out there, the difference is that these skills actually have a real-time effect in gameplay.  What i mean by that is that if you have low strength, good luck carrying that backpack full of steel, wearing durable heavy armors, and larger weapons all while slowing you down becoming cannibal food in the process......AND making your Attack say (-14) because you dont know what you're doing with said weapon......fool.\nSo the game hits on the saying "practice makes perfect." in a nutshell in all skill-like aspects.  The unfortunate side is that there are still a considerable amount of skills "greyed" out not finished yet (awesome when finished)  but do not let that take away from this light of a game in this dark re-hashed titled clone world of ours.  It's EA and for as imperative as the devs made the skills (not just stat raises) is something fresh, oh what else is fresh that i forgot..LOCATIONAL DAMAGE!  wut, indie game? Naw that's unheard of...WRONG.  You get your leg beaten to a pulp?  Well I hope you can afford a walking stick Mr. Gimpy until you treat it medically.  The best part is that you don't die instantly, you bleed, you fight, pass out to wake and fight again! then pass out! and die.  Game over unless you have meds.\nVisually, the game remains desolate yet somehow pleasing.  It actually feels like a post-apocalyptic world that you were just thrown into with the sole goal to survive however you see fit.  Some of the structures do look a little edgy at times, and not everything lines up 100% but the end result is fair enough.  Things look as they should....\n\nIn conclusion, because I'm mediocre at reviews,  I find Kenshi very immersive, well thought and executed, and a challenging game considering the dev's choice of realism.  That's saying a lot for those indie's and with this one you'll dump hours into it without even realizing once you understand the concepts.  Honestly, I can't wait to play this thing once it's finished....seriously.  There's nothing else like it right now.  For how much this game costs and for how much content you get it's a decently fair price, try to get it on sale if you can.  Plus, I totally believe in supporting devs that change the industry with great ideas like this. Keep it up!\n\n\nGameplay:    8/10\nVisuals:         7/10\nUpdates:       6/10  (steadily increasing)\n\nOverall quality:    7/10\n\nProgress?   I'd say it's around 60% done overall (don't murder me it's an educated guess)\n\nP.S.  The bugs (not crashes) i've personally found to be more amusing than not most of the time.  Watching bandits and sometimes fellow squadmates violently ragdoll into the sky for a brief moment when are knocken unconcious can somewhat take me by surprise.  Or when the ai gets stupid and bunches up for a massive aoe 1 hitter with a frag axe.

People complain about games not being Bugfree while they are still in Early Access, which is meant to help the developers to improve the game by finding said bugs and reporting them to them. About the development being slow though, yes i have to agree the development is quite slow, with the game being in Early Access / Alpha for over 5 years now, though they do release updates quite regularly most of the time. well now that this rant is over on to the Actual Review.\n\nKenshi is a Squad Based Open World Role playing Game that is currently in it's Alpha (for over 5 years now).\n\nThe Game in it's current version has already quite a lot to offer, especially with some of the bigger updates still coming up. The Development on this game can be quite slow since it is being produced by a small Team consisting of 6 Actual members and a few Volunteers and Freelancers.\n\nPositives about the Game:\n\n+ You currently have quite a Huge map that you can explore and build your base on with more and different Land to be released in a future update.\n\n+ You aren't god in this game, you are a basic human (or group of humans) that has to survive in the desert (maybe other places in later updates), not more, not less.\n\n+ The game is actively being Developed even if it may be slow, the game has been receiving updates for over 5 years now so I'll doubt that the studio has any plans on abandoning it.\n\n+ Has great music (not too much different music but great music)\n\nNegatives:\n\n- You won't get a full on Role Playing feel yet as the game is still in development.\n\n- A bit hard to get into at first\n\n- Kinda slow development though i don't blame them, I have enough respect for them for even trying to make a game like this.\n\n- Obviously, you will experience Bugs since it's in Early Access.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nThis Game is already great and shows potential to become one of my favorite Squad Based RPGs. If you are a fan of games like these go ahead and buy it, but be aware that the Game is still in Early Access / Alpha which means you won't get a full on "Finished Game" experience. Early Access is here to help Developers find bugs and help them find ideas not for actually playing the game early. So if you want to help the Development (even if it is quite slow sometimes) go ahead and get it. But if you want a full game experience wait until the Game gets out of Early Access somewhen.","July 29, 2015","true","4.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

It's a beautiful, sword-punk blend of RPG, RTS, and to some extent a city builder/Sims-style survival game where you cater to basic needs. The demo does the game little justice, and many people who rate it poorly probably never experienced the transition of this game into what it is now. The developers are committed to creating a living world, and tailors an RPG-style game where you are no hero. Even if you choose a start that makes you top dog when it comes to the scum of Kenshi, you bite the bullet.\n\nPros:\n\n-Multiple ways/"genres" to play.\n\n-Multiple settings for adjusting the difficulty, for better or worse.\n\n-Beautiful world, at least for an independently developed game.\n\n-Creature/racial artwork and variety is unique, and funnily deceiving (cute goats that can massacre a small squad).\n\n-Dedicated development team, which has proven itself over the long-term.\n\n-Lots of replayability, and even punishing starts can have a silver lining.\n\n-Combat can be sometimes frustrating, but always beautiful to watch, with drastic outcomes based on even the smallest decisions.\n\n-Character customization can be oddly entertaining, and...\n\n-Mechanics can be easily caught onto, and easier to work around with a little time and effort.\n\nCons:\n\n-Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. It was much worse at the initial release of the Beta, but within a week or so the most game breaking were patched.\n\n-The Dev team actively makes use of bug reports, even catering to some very specific issues players faced in the past.\n\n-World can be laggy, even on a good computer. This is, however, on high graphics and almost exclusive to high density bandit zones or rendering of the map.\n\n-Updates may feel slow, but minor ones with huge impacts are frequent.\n\n-Game can crash due to random errors introduced with an update (commencing specific research, as an example when the game entered beta), but these are once again usually patched within a day or few.\n\n-Can be painfully punishing, and some mechanics are unrefined, but bear in mind many mechanics are fresh to the beta and much of it is an EXPERIMENTAL build.\n\nKenshi isn't everyone's cup of... well, dust and rust. Despite this, its flexibility, originality, and progression through the years has proven it a capable contender and worth the attention.","May 18","true","65.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The free roam combined with the ability to play however you please is great. The sword fighting is smooth and feels like a action movie. Your always determined to get more powerful so your rarely left wandering around woudering what to do next. The game has multiple starting back storys to choose from and after you spend a good bit of time completing those you can mod the game quite easily. The ability to create and mod the entire world of kenshi after watching a 10 minute youtube video is amazing. Ive spent close to a hundred hours just modding kenshi the way I please. Anything in kenshi I think is to hard or easy I can fix. You can also create custom armor,weapons and pretty much change the entire world in anyway you want. I only wish more games would give there community the ability to do this so easily.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hasbeenredacted/recommended/233860/","hasbeenredacted","Mr.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hasbeenredacted/","122 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game provides all the elements I look for in a game if any of the following apply to you, you will enjoy this.\n\n1. Micromanagement; As your group grows the functions for each grow and multi tasking stays fresh, you wont go long before a bandit attack. There's always work to do, training to be done the tasks never end. Making your party run laps in their precious down time, training your combat skills on captured prisoners, producing gear or buildind/researching the list goes on.\n\n2.RPG; Each character has its own stats, the time it takes to get anything to level 20+ is abit time consuming, but it gives a sense of satisfaction as you make another character a mighty warrior in the wasteland.\n\n3.City Building; Build your own city! it takes time, but building your own utopia complete with shops, workshops, homes, outposts, defense walls, mounted crossbows, the only limit is how long your willing to spend preparing your characters for the coming construction.\n\n4.Crafting; At first its more about gathering gear from fallen foe's outside the city gates, but once you begin teching and producing your own gear, a high quality katana compared to a rusty one is a beautiful sight, you can also produce all the raw materials needed for self preservation which is tougher, but for some more rewarding.\n\n5.Diplomacy; Want to be friends with a certain group of bandits? Heal some of their fallen kin, eventually they will stop attacking you and come to your aide. (This takes time, I also assume in the future there will be many diplomatic aspects, but have yet to be added).\n\n6.Permanent Death; Think your starter character is a badass? wrong. Each unit becomes precious, you grow attatched as they become valueable, and then at the worst moment a critical strike leaves them stranded far from a safe location, too far to carry safely without a character with strength above 30... you keep watching hoping the bleeding stops and he'll enter a recovery coma but no his status switches to "dying" and you panic, time to decide if your capable enough to make the rescue, because even if you are, a large enough band of bandits/cannibals could strike you all down, and end your game. (Also note, the cannibals will take your people prisoner and amount of time you have to wait for a distraction is FOREVER, but its great).\n\n7.Travel/Relocation; Making it town to town in the begining is thrilling, as your group grows and you safely reach each destination, perhaps traveling with a caravan or a squad of UC/HO troops for safety, or braving the journey alone it's deadly every time. Also, the town you're in could be overrun. (I've seen it happen twice lol)\n\n8.Huge Replay Value; Start in a new town, new conditions, different starting squad, death at the start, who knows? The randomness is astounding, you could find "wingman" at the start, walk out near "Shark" and get hacked to piece by roaming sand ninja.\n\nYou've read enough.

Lately I've been getting extremely annoyed by bugs and such. Bandits's and whoever just running through my walls even though I've checked countless times for holes in wall, characters just stop moving and either have to pick the up with another character or reload the game, I read that you can steal from stores now but the system makes absolutely no sense, characters not following commands get picked up by someone else in hopes of making them work  again in turn making both of them get stuck, and one of the biggest is the engineer. Queueing someone to be a perm engineer is practically worthless, mine keeps trying to do the most random things such as open a door then run to fabric box then just do whatever he wants to. The bug with characters not following commands is getting very annoying because I dont like reloading my game every 5 minutes. Stealing from stores is extremely hard and it's also kinda... what?? You have to KILL the store owner, not only that but you also have to carry him away from the store. Then you still have to wait about 6 hours (game time) to be able to take from the counter without actually paying for it (stealing). The update said talking to the character would be trading whereas accessing the counter would be stealing but this literally doesn't even work and this update was posted very long ago. The last bug that really ticks me off is bandits literally just WALKING THROUGH MY WALLS,.. So after the huge amount of time i spend walking around with 1 engineer and 1 person to pick him up whenever he stops responding (This is the way you have to build walls like I said the engineer's pathfinding is worthless right now) the bandits simply walk through my max level walls... I have checked to make sure these are actually bugs and not personal fault. Right now I don't recommend this game because from what I saw the wall bug has been around for almost 3 years at least. MAYBE after this update in march I will change my mind but these bugs must be fixed or this game will remain unplayable. Now then... time to play some Kenshi. I love the idea of this game please fix these bugs!","February 26","false","59.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It may become obsolete sooner or later.)\n\nThis game has potential. It really does. It's a sandbox in a steampunk neo-feudal Japan-esque setting. The dev has not clarified what's going on and probably won't tell us for a very long time. I bought this before it was released on Steam, and I have to say: It has grown. It has trading, city building, realistic warfare, a complex medic system, and a whole lot of other things. There is one major issue that has been plaguing the alpha: a good portion of the game progression right now is attracting bandits and luring them to town guards. Once you have accumalated enough "Cats" you can try your hand at founding a faction, building an army, then start a town. Recent updates have added more difficulty to maintaining your humble abode. Raiders will come knocking and try to extort money off of you and cannibals will invade and attempt to take you and your men to their kitchen. You can research new technology with a certain workbench, but I won't bother saying much since I have yet to experiment with it.\n\nSo. Do I recommend this game? Sure, but not in it's current alpha state. If you want to invest in a gaem that has a bright future, go ahead and buy it.

It has grown from very basic mechanics and framework, to this very ambitious and well deserving piece of RPG interpretation. The sky is limited on what you can do now. However, the creator has been able to utilize a team to help him create the game he wants. Key features include free roaming, base building, character development and many more mechanics that make Kenshi great but also set it apart from the rest of the crowd. It has the environment and finesse that allows you to craft your own story in a very unique and different setting than a traditional RPG. It's easily the embodiment of everything a die-hard RPG fan would want to play. It's probably the Sienfeld of RPG's.","December 26, 2013","true","72.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If there's anything I can say about Kenshi is that it has definitely gotten me invested in bettering my character through hours of training. The first time my bad ♥♥♥ level 50 Attack and Defense character took down an entire cannibal camp, I felt like I had truly accomplished a feat (considering how much trouble I had with them in the beginning). Watching him cleave unhindered through their bare, tattoo-ridden bodies made me so happy, albeit a bit doubtful about my sanity at the time. I can safely say that Kenshi has finally fulfilled my desire for a squad-based game in which individual progression and background really means something to me.\n\nNow, I just want to address something that many of the backers of Kenshi have been pondering recently. Lately, Lo-Fi's been making some good progress, having implemented DX11 into the game (though it is very unstable), and added a new race and such, which is all great! But, simply said, it's still been very slow. However, I don't believe, like many people do, that this game is going too slow. In my opinion, and I feel as if people have forgotten this what with triple A games and the likes such as Star Citizen, indie developers should be slightly exempt from the time-frame criticism. I think this is especially true for a game like Kenshi, which hasn't even received that much funding. These guys need to make a living, and nagging them everyday isn't going to fix that. I guess you could say that I don't want people who are pursuing their dreams to be discouraged for going too slow.\n\nKeep it up, Lo-Fi. I still have high hopes for this game!","May 7, 2014","true","106.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I bought this game early on in its development because i saw what they were putting together and its exactly what I look for in a game. The developer who started this wanted to make the game out of wanting to put together a game he wanted to play himself but couldn't find out there. This game when finished will be a high point in early access even with seriously long development it has shown what the potential of early release games should be and it will be a benchmark hopefully for other developers out there to stick with it and truly finish ones vision. Without early access I doubt this game would be where its at now as the development team grew as people purchased the game early which helped this games progress tremendously. Its at beta now with a few bugs but well worth it to see the progress being made to bring this epic scale game together.

Of course,  you could always be successful noble and create your own Faction city in which all nations depend on for their trade and have the most legendary army that no one would dare question your authority. -- Or, if you were to be really ambitious, you could become an abolisher of slavery and take over the province as the rightful sire of the lands - if you're ready for hardship, effort, death, surprises, and ultimate victory.\n","May 20","true","48.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When he woke up and tried to get out the game crashed.. verfied this happening 3 times in a row lol, eventually I just reloaded and carried him to a cage instead.\n\nAtm using 10+ captured bandits to train my recruits. They get their asses beaten all day long by the bandits, but some are starting to man up lol. When they are all unconscious on the floor my main character moves in to clean up and put them back in their cages.\n\n9/10\nCan't wait to see what this game will become, one of the most enjoyable early access games I know. With some polish, optimization and a few more features I could see this game becoming a masterpiece.","July 28, 2014","true","44.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I first realized this when the updates came not with speed, but with good, quality content. The Devs do not rush updates to make people happy, they are not filled with fluff and pointless things, but instead are filled with bug fixes and content that truly help advance the game state. In fact in a recent news post about an upcoming update the devs said "•Entirely new world map.  More detailed and polished, new factions, new content, things to explore.  Its' like Kenshi 2.  Crazy.  I should have called it Kenshi 2 and charged for it again, but I didn't.  Damn." That comment right there just shows you that these devs understand what other Early Access developers do, and that they are not like those other early access developers.\n\nNow for how I feel about the actual game. This game takes time to get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but you do get just that. In most starting scenarios you choose from, you are dirt poor, and you are nothing close to a hero. Kenshi is not easy, you'll most likely die quite a few times at the start. As time progressive you gain more members to your squad and your existing members become more experienced. There is a really great feeling that comes when your squad finally becomes strong enough to destroy a group of bandits without any outside help. Eventually you will be able to build an outpost, which if you do not build incorrectly can be quite difficult (and by incorrectly I mean not building a stone mine and building materials producer first thing). Eventually you will be able to build research stations which allow you to learn how to farm and create your own items such as armour and weapons. Even balistas and walls can be build eventually. If you put in the time this game can be vary rewarding, and best of all, a huge update is coming out quite soon, which will greatly improve the game. I 100% recommend giving this game a try, you will not be sorry.","March 3","true","70.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's core features, being RTS battles and Dwarf Fortress-like base building, are made more complex with every patch. Though, it does lack somethings, for instance: The beginning starts you out fairly weak, even the beginnings geared towards making you more combat ready only leave you with a powerful weapon against an army of more experienced bandits.\n\nThe difficulty fluctuated heavily a few hours in though. Even after amassing an army, you still aren't strong enough to take on a single bandit party. However, when you reach a point, and you've leeched a few kills off of guards with your squad of cowards, you're able to leave the game running with no fear of attack -- or agency. I'd automated an entire camp. Random events and the like, a feature of base-building games that it emulates, would and have been a boon.\n\nThis game could easily be the greatest game I ever play -- the potential is there.

But not for everyone.\n\nThis game has the potential to be Frak'in amazing.  I've been following the game for a year or two, and their have been patches and addition that come relitively frequently.  Personally, I was hoping for the game to develope faster, but their are quite a few things that they are putting together, and the interactions between each Start location/faction/character skill/base construction/tech advance/and so on...  is a very complicated to balance and intagrate.\n\nThe're quite a few bugs still in the system, like pathing issues, caravan guard "visits", building inaccesabilities and such, but they are slowing fixing bits and pieces.\n\nIn recent patches, you have been allowed to assign tasks to your "villigers" and they would run arround and complete that task with no further intervention on you behalf; Which was an awesome upgrade from before.\n\nRemember before you continue to read this that the game is still alpha.\nBut, to sum up some of the issues that are negitive. you have about 5 primary stats, and currently have access to 3 of them, of which one was only recently added (Toughness).  their are about 6 or 7 weapon skills, of which you currently have access to only 4 of them, and unarmed is not one of them. their are about 20 or so skills, like armor smithing, weapon smithing offence, defence, medic, labourer, engineer, science, and a couple of others. You have access to all of these skills but their are about half that you don't have access to. Again this game is still in Aplha!\n\nThe awesome thing is that what is planned is things like, renting a building in a City to use a as a store front. Being able to replace severed limbs with robotic ones. Building cities, creating trade routes, starting you own faction (possably even your own empire) and so on.\n\nI'd like to recommend this game to everyone, but some people will not be able to enjoy it becuase its not completed, yet.\n\nI would advise to those people to add it to their wish list and follow the updates as they come out.\nTo those of you who don't mind a game that is in the works, and can play though and help identify bugs, strap on a sword and come adventuring/build a city/trade with npc's/scavenge the unconsious bodies of the fallen/ or just plain become the scourge of the wastes, this game's for you.","February 6, 2014","true","96.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is an amazing mix of RPG, RTS, City Management. Even without all the planned features implemented yet. It is still worth playing. When this game is complete, it will be one of the most awsome games to date. The developement is a little slow, but considering the size of the dev team and that they probably do most of the coding during their free time, it is understandable.  There are bugs, but you can expect that from a game in developement. The dev team is quick to address most issues or bugs as they appear.  In the end I can't stress enough, that this game is one that will provide hours and hours of game play and provide the player with the most choices in how to play. Be a lone wanderer just making his way by his sword. Lead a group of mercenaries to fame and riches. Become the most notorious bandit in the known lands, Found a city and produce goods for trade. I give this game a 9 out of 10 for being original and well developed. I hope after this project is done, the dev team continues to produce more amazing titles.\n\nUpdate:\nFor those that like the pros and cons listed.\n\nPros:\n1. Freedom - Explore, develope, wander, or waste your time as you please.\n2. Character Developement - You gain skill when you use it. Not if you have exp to spend on it.\n3. Aspect View - You can watch over from above or get into an almost 3rd person view of your party.\n4. Sandbox - No pun intended. You can build a base, or even a city.\n5. Swords - Lots of swords to fit your fighting styles.\n6. Random - Bandit and Canibal raids. If you have a city or base, Bandits and Canibals will find you.\n7. Unique - RTS meets RPG with City Management and Crafting.\n\nCons:\n1. Pathing - Sometimes you have moving problems of your own, NPCs can get stuck for days on a rock.\n2. Trading - Trading is a little hard because of the pathing issues. NPCs will get stuck trying to get to you.\n3. Goals - With no ultimate goal, you can get to a point where you have to say, what do I do next. If there were a rival system. Or just a set of acheivements to get, it would add much more flavor IMO.\n4. Ranged Combat - I have seen in the blogs that this is comming, but until it does, there is a chunk missing from the combat tactics.\n5. Better AI - It always seems to be that there will be that one poorly armed bandit that is willing to battle it out with your band of 20 no matter what. Or the Bandits will chase one guy into a city and be swarmed with high level guards.\n6. Battle Animations - There are only a limited amount of fighting animations. Hack, slash, block, can get old after a while. No evaision or anything like that.\n\nIn the end, I am hoping for a bit of polish to make this game great.  The next Update is supposed to be out soon and I can't wait.  Even with all the little frustrations and bugs.  I have had many hours of fun with this game and it has already been more than worth the $20 I paid for it.","December 23, 2013","true","260.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it's still in Alpha it is a very well polished game that offers hours of play and even more replay-ability. It's definitely not a game for the easily frustrated because you'll find yourself starting as probably the weakest character in its yet-to-be-defined universe.\n\nCombat reflects a very realistic feel at the start: You're weak and everyone can and just about will kill you. It's a game of judging whether or not combat is really worth the possible outcome. Groups of 2-3 bandits will destroy you at the start so luring them back to larger groups is pretty much you're only option while you slowly build up the skills of your character. Having a large party will improve your odds but if they're still untrained it would be like sending a bunch of children to fight an adult. Yeah, they may overpower the adult but more than likely they'll all get beaten.\n\nThere's already several ways to make money and the economy in the game is being tweaked. This just means you don't always have to fight bandits and other patrols to get the capital necessary to start your own outpost. Then when you have that the game definitely delivers several different ways of improving your little town and building your own army.\n\nI recommend trying this game out. There's a demo version of it available somewhere, in case you're the type worried about purchasing and not liking games still in development.","November 27, 2013","true","270.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Currently, most of the game developement is features implementation, because the groundwork has only been laid recently, but after six years of developement I seriously expect a finished product you can be proud to have supported. Very soon, enough features will have been implemented for the final phases of developement to begin, but make no mistake, this game will be finished one way or another, and as most of the features are being added now, now might be the time to get with the program and take an interest in the project.","December 15, 2013","true","43.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Personally, I was hoping for the game to develope faster, but their are quite a few things that they are putting together, and the interactions between each Start location/faction/character skill/base construction/tech advance/and so on...  is a very complicated to balance and intagrate.\n\nThe're quite a few bugs still in the system, like pathing issues, caravan guard "visits", building inaccesabilities and such, but they are slowing fixing bits and pieces.\n\nIn recent patches, you have been allowed to assign tasks to your "villigers" and they would run arround and complete that task with no further intervention on you behalf; Which was an awesome upgrade from before.\n\nRemember before you continue to read this that the game is still alpha.\nBut, to sum up some of the issues that are negitive. you have about 5 primary stats, and currently have access to 3 of them, of which one was only recently added (Toughness).  their are about 6 or 7 weapon skills, of which you currently have access to only 4 of them, and unarmed is not one of them. their are about 20 or so skills, like armor smithing, weapon smithing offence, defence, medic, labourer, engineer, science, and a couple of others. You have access to all of these skills but their are about half that you don't have access to. Again this game is still in Aplha!\n\nThe awesome thing is that what is planned is things like, renting a building in a City to use a as a store front. Being able to replace severed limbs with robotic ones. Building cities, creating trade routes, starting you own faction (possably even your own empire) and so on.\n\nI'd like to recommend this game to everyone, but some people will not be able to enjoy it becuase its not completed, yet.\n\nI would advise to those people to add it to their wish list and follow the updates as they come out.\nTo those of you who don't mind a game that is in the works, and can play though and help identify bugs, strap on a sword and come adventuring/build a city/trade with npc's/scavenge the unconsious bodies of the fallen/ or just plain become the scourge of the wastes, this game's for you.","February 6, 2014","true","96.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Carry on with your community and let your previous shell rot in the sands of time!), a free roam game, or hell just swords, katanas, straw hats and ninjas, then this game is for you. It's quite unrivaled in its free roam aspects (base building / attacking towns / trading etc) despite being in an early alpha stage. You can send out different squads of people to different parts of the map, start several towns, just click on a character to move your camera to them. It'll cause quite a micromanagement hassle, as everything keeps going (unless you pause it. It features pause / x2 / x3 / x4 speeds, but lacks a notification / alert system for when people are being attacked - at the moment.) I've been enjoying and will continue to enjoy this game, with future updates sweetening the deal.\n\nIf you're a fan of "real life simulators" (hardcore elements, no artificial levelling, no hero characters, no scaling item & equipment quality, etc.) or titles like Mount and Blade, Sim City, The Sims, or any other simulator where you control the way a community grows, then this game is definitely for you. Oh, and there's bounty hunting. Kenshi also has a tinge of the post apocalypse feel, being set in the seemingly never-ending desert. (No fast travel! Buildings take a while to build! It's a good time killer :D)","March 25, 2013","true","179.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I absolutly love this game.\nIt gives alot of freedom, and the progress is good, not too fast, not too slow. Everything is learning by doing. No levels. And if you want to, you can equib a newly recruited peasant with the biggest swords and armor. Although it might not be the best choise, it does give you somewhat of an advantage.\nWhen you do get to the point of where you have a secure foothold and a few soldiers, you reap the rewards of your labour. You see and guide your small society of people to advance and trade. And once in a while a few roaming bandits will come by, to keep your guards entertained and help with their training.\nOR you can just go around being the hermit samurai and doing your best to defeat the bandits you meet, although this will mean death, if you dont have an extremly strong soldier first. And such training can be gained by follwing the traders around, as a bodyguard.\n\nThis game is a game i have been waiting for, for a long time. Its open ended. And its a perfect RPG sandbox. And its not even done yet. I recommend you to get this game, while its cheap! Its worth it already now. However, if you want a game where you can dive directly into high action, this is not the game for you.

I really want to. I've played over 40 hours in an absurdly short amount of time trying to love it and make it work. I know it just went Beta, but this is one of the least playabe Betas (or even Alphas) I have ever taken part in.\n\nPathfinding is absolutely terrible. The worst of any RTS I've ever played. If you build a wall, plan on randomly getting stuck on terrain and having to deconstruct part of the wall so your resources are *poof* gone. Oh it's not over there - good luck trying to get the two parts of the walls to attach again, because there is random wall collision detection that prevents you from attaching the two pieces of the wall, so there's a good chance you'll have to start over on a huge section of wall.\n\nThere have been modest improvements to pathfinding, not least of which is your squad tries its best to use the road rather than going offroad. This seems to be a hasty workaround, because going offroad seems to get you stuck for no apparent reason a lot of the time. Also plan on reversing your path and straightening out an approach on one squad member when going through gates into cities. The devs have the best intentions by attempting the following:\n\n- Auto-hauling\n- Priority queues\n- Clicking on a point on the map and having the squad automatically go there\n\nThe problem with these is the execution. Auto-hauling works alright, but you have to have a specific box for the item. For example, autohauling stone has to go to a stone box. So you're taking up a ton of space with storage boxes. This leads into priority queues, which only show 5 of the tasks you have lined up even though you can have more. So if you have 10 resources you want to haul to 10 different boxes for efficiency's sake, you won't see the 5 tasks in the bottom of the queue so you have no idea if you actually have them queued or not. So you might have to deleted and restart your entire queue if you forget.\n\nWhen going to a city by selecting a point on the map, there's a good chance your squad will randomly stop and just stand there because it doesn't know where to go, even though you selected a point on the map. This map feature is very new, so I'll give it a pass. It just needs some polish. It works a lot of the time.\n\nWhoamygod crashes. Pre .90, crashes used to be once every 5-10 minutes (so lower your Autosave threshold unless you want to constantly lose progress). Patch .90.11 made the game literally unplayable (crash shortly after load every time, regardless of whether you start a new game or not).  However, since then the crashes have gotten LOADS better. I just hope this continues.\n\nThe devs try hard (it seems) but it feels like they're playing a game of whack-a-mole. They squash a bug, another bug (or two, or three) appears in its place. I just hope to god it gets a lot more polish in the automation and pathfinding departments. Micromanaging to this degree and especially with this much frustration is not fun. If these key areas improve, this will turn a messy, bug-ridden game into a GREAT game.\n\nAll that ugliness aside... I will continue to support the game (because it's the only one of its kind really right?) and will likely change my review if there's a lot of polish. Right now it's not lookin good though.","April 11","false","85.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The developer and maker of kenshi had before worked as a security guard before to make a living while designing this game until recently he got enough money from sales to form a small team. We had waited years for long intervals between updates but he had never disappointed us before. It is his persistence to complete this game, come what may attitude, is the selling point to me. I see it having a lot of potential and modable qualities, his preseverance and persistence at work is the deciding factor.

An alpha that i've consume so much hours and it's still the case to transform into weeks. The first time i saw those image and thoses tags i was like... what the hell... I MUST TRY THIS!!! and oooh boy i don't regret my choice. Kenshi is a squad based rpg where you're basicly a rat in a giant world. Depends on witch start you choose, the journey beggane with you, mostly with a pants a rusty sword, and you strove the desert to make your legend. In this game, your an ant at the very begganing. imagine that you, normal guy/guurl of all day decide to take a sword and start off you're companie. As you fight and fight, you'll learn what a true fight is. you can literraly see your character getting better at fighting. faster, wiser, deadliyer. Recruits other squad members, engineers, medics, fighter, then train and equip them : cloth, plate, mail, depends on your play style. like all plating knights style? alright. you love it fast and ninja style? alright! take what suit your play style. The fight system is an awesomly done speacking of dynamics and there is a limbs system that we can think of the fallout 3 limb system. If the Hp of a limb go to 0, either he or she won't be able to use that limb and if its a vital limb (head chest stomach) then they'll be K.O and need some medical attention. If the HP bar of thoses vital limb go to a certain negative treshold, those wounds are deadly. That's how you know that one of you mate have died in combat. This realistic mechanics also request of you to take care of your mate and leave them time to heal up, before going out and start murdering again. Go out in this majestic and awesomely well done desert. i'm totally serious here : i've passed several minutes just watching the dune, mountains and the horizon. ALOT of work as been put into the enviroment, and you feel it as soon as you have that sand in your sandals. Also, the map is ENORMOUS. Sometimes i was even saying to myself : jeez... i have to walk all that? but the reasons i'Ve just said make that you want that walking experience in this wounderful desert. Make a gigantic and prosperous town or a secret Samurai HQ, trades, fight, you really are the master of your own destiny. no missions or objective, simply survive and make a good and badass living. it's a sandbox where you do what you want and of course what you can to survive. Start off as a battleground looter to a blademaster to a rich caravan traders, to a formidable bandit or cannibal hunter, Be a bounty hunter and capture bad guys for ransom, or be the inquisitionning justicar and bring their judgment. the choice is yours. your blade awaits and the sand is thisty for blood. Get that game and start your legend!!!\n\nP;S : sorry for the tones of grammar errors.\nHave a great day wandering the dunes!","July 1, 2014","true","105.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I don't just say that based on the projected features, I base that on how it feels.  As I play it, I get the feeling that as development continues the game world will become a complex and interestng place, and the different facets of the gameplay will compliment it.  It is ambitious, with base building, diplomacy, squad-based tactics, and rpg elements.  If all those come together, it will be an extremely unique game.\n\nThe development is continuing steadily, it is not a project that is abandoned.  When I read about all the planned features I almost worry that the developer has bitten off more than he can chew, but the progress that has already been made proves otherwise.\n\nAs it is early access, there is not a large amount of things to do within the game world yet.  However, a significant map expansion and diplomacy/faction system are a couple of the updates coming down the pipe, and if they are as advertised this game would be justified in shedding the "alpha" tag once they are released.\n\nA couple of the game mechanics are clunky, it can take 5+ minutes to sell all the items in my squad's inventory due to having to run around to different merchants in the towns.  However, the game attempts to be realistic in many respects and this is one that reflects real life, a merchant likely wouldn't be able to take a dozen sets of armor off someone's hands in real life.  Although I complain about the selling system, I can see that it was purposefully done to make the game seem realistic; it is not just something that was poorly implemented or was not though through well enough.\n\nAs it is alpha, my characters do get stuck in walls occasionally, it is NOT a common occurrance however.  It is easily fixable too, just save the game and reload with a "reset squat position" option.  This is another example of the thought put into it by the developer; he recognizes that its deveopment status could cause bugs, but implemented a system to allow people to enjoy their experience despite it.  And the bugs really are few and far between for me.\n\nI really think this game is going to be something special.  Aside from the planned features, it just has the feel of something that will be a great experience.","July 9, 2014","true","36.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personally am at a stand point between loving the game and distaining it while keeping in mind the game is in alpha stage. I will explain if and why this game is worth the price.\n\nThis game has been in development since 2012, the development cycle has been slow, and an update roughly every two months at the time of this review (3/14/2014) the last known update was February 10th 2014. The game has a few of the features spoken of, the vast land scape that is truly every meaning of the word large. It would take you quite some time to get across the map, I clocked it at 24 minutes on standard speed (the game comes with three speed rates) There are a few things you can do at the beginning of each game, mostly attempt to trade with other factions or cities. As most factions are less than vanilla, the rewards are arguable. You could make a living hunting bandits, or you could simply create a single structure and have the bandits come to you (After maybe 3-4 hours of excessive training). Unless of course you would like to know how it feels to be a three legged cat chased by a pack of wolves. The fighting animations are fairly nice a few clashing of swords, however does get a bit repetitive which is fine considering the game is in alpha. Now there are other things you can work to accomplish if you actually want to feel some progression in the game, consider there is no story or dialogue to guide you in the game at this time  (3/14/2014). There is however a simple tutorial in the options menu. The base building of the game is fairly nice; you can make a nifty manufacturing system mine, research and build. Then find something else to do, which of course is all there is at this current state (which is fine) as the amount of time it takes to get to that point is quite hefty. The amount of available research is quite vast, which will take you at least six to nine hours, depending on which game speed you prefer. Once you have your super industrial enterprise and have the best warriors equipped with the best weaponry and training that the game allows the next step is to find something else to do. That can be a daunting task; you could put little outposts all over the map and make your own little empire with a few squad-mates.\nOn another note, there are mods available for the game. The construction kit is easy to get. (http://kenshi.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Modding) Although, the amount of mods aren’t a huge attraction, but they do exist! Now then to pros of the game are.\n-Awesome concept.\n-Based on Sword fighting with nice animations.\n-Build a small empire.\n-Very large map.\n-Mod-able\nNow for the cons.\n-Slow development.\n-Many game breaking bugs.(which is forgivable for an alpha of  course)\n-The game-play will come to a point where there isn’t much to do and wait for updates like many on the official forum.\n-The super crash (I clocked it at every 50 minutes) Quite a few of the fellow Kenshi players know what I am talking about.\nThe question you need to ask yourself before purchasing is the game worth the price tag (I picked the game up for 20 dollars). The developers do need the support I will not argue that, I merely want the buyer to understand what they are getting for their hard earned cash.  As of right now (3/14/2014) the reviews for the game are quite positive, especially from the players themselves and for good reason! The amount of potential for this game is beyond words. I am personally excited about the development, and so are many others.\nAs a personal statement, please understand the game is in alpha stage with slow progression as most alpha stage games are just keep that in mind. If you are in doubt, watch some youtube videos on this game.\nReferences\nhttp://kenshi.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Modding\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/kenshi/reviews\nhttp://www.indiegamemag.com/alone-no-more-kenshi-goes-the-crowdfunding-route/\nhttp://www.lofigames.com/index.php (this is their offical website.)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDrMcf48E9Q\n","March 14, 2014","true","95.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though character development becomes ruled out after you get to the gist of the game, it is still a unique game.

I left the town and got beaten up by bandits.\n\nThe second one took way longer but is as short to tell. I left the town and built a house. Then after watching my people working for about 20 min I got bored and started a new game.\n\nThe third try I was exploring the world, hired a few followers and built another house. Then a single ninja walked by and killed all of my people.\n\nI see a lot of potential in this game. Right now it feels too easy to just roam the map, get rich, build an army and then a settlement. I expect that to change once needs like hunger are introduced and you need to get them covered. Also I miss a lot of RPG-content. But I trust the developers that they can deliver what they planned.

I wouldn't really be the type to recommend a game, but this game is just so great, I just had to. The amount of content in this game for an early access alpha game is beyond incredible. There is just so much to do, you can never really get bored. If you have the $20 (Current Price 7/11/14) I would encourage you to try the game. Its pure, original content, not really any game like this. For an early access alpha, 10/10.

And I don't just say that based on the projected features, I base that on how it feels.  As I play it, I get the feeling that as development continues the game world will become a complex and interestng place, and the different facets of the gameplay will compliment it.  It is ambitious, with base building, diplomacy, squad-based tactics, and rpg elements.  If all those come together, it will be an extremely unique game.\n\nThe development is continuing steadily, it is not a project that is abandoned.  When I read about all the planned features I almost worry that the developer has bitten off more than he can chew, but the progress that has already been made proves otherwise.\n\nAs it is early access, there is not a large amount of things to do within the game world yet.  However, a significant map expansion and diplomacy/faction system are a couple of the updates coming down the pipe, and if they are as advertised this game would be justified in shedding the "alpha" tag once they are released.\n\nA couple of the game mechanics are clunky, it can take 5+ minutes to sell all the items in my squad's inventory due to having to run around to different merchants in the towns.  However, the game attempts to be realistic in many respects and this is one that reflects real life, a merchant likely wouldn't be able to take a dozen sets of armor off someone's hands in real life.  Although I complain about the selling system, I can see that it was purposefully done to make the game seem realistic; it is not just something that was poorly implemented or was not though through well enough.\n\nAs it is alpha, my characters do get stuck in walls occasionally, it is NOT a common occurrance however.  It is easily fixable too, just save the game and reload with a "reset squat position" option.  This is another example of the thought put into it by the developer; he recognizes that its deveopment status could cause bugs, but implemented a system to allow people to enjoy their experience despite it.  And the bugs really are few and far between for me.\n\nI really think this game is going to be something special.  Aside from the planned features, it just has the feel of something that will be a great experience.","July 9, 2014","true","36.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of these paths, e.g. farming, smithing, trading, etc. take quite a while (1-3 hours) to really get functioning, so from the getgo you've got atleast 4 or 5 hours before the game gets anywhere near the risk of being boring.

You are more of a drop of water in a big puddle. You can influence and affect what happens.. if a big band of bandits shows up at a city your base is near, they can take out the guards and shops, effectively neutralizing the town. Later a travelling group of lawmen might take it back.. either way, even if you could have changed the outcome, the game keeps playing.\n\nYour characters have stats in almost everything. if you want yout character to be stronger, give him or her a lot of heavy equipment and have them run around. Eventually their strength will increase. Speed is the opposite, have someone run around without anything in their bags and they will become more athletic and therefore faster. Laboring from mining, or smelting. Crafting from weapon or armor smithing. Medicine from healing. The characters become increasingly valuable as time goes on..\n\nThe fact that you  can plop a town wherever you want, build walls, turrets, arm your soldiers with swords and armor and have your builders be guarded and automated with designated tasks is beautiful. Kenshi is absorbing, Rough, Frustrating, Comically suprising and has the potential to be an amazing game.\n\nId say get it.. try it, support the devs and enjoy the process of their creation\n\n\n","June 4, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can.\n\nI have this game since 1 day, already 7h on it, 7h of pure joy.","January 8, 2014","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot. It is also buggy. It is the very definition of early access/alpha. Very rough but an amazing concept.\n\nNow with that out of the way, let me get started. I bought this game one night after I saw it on an ad at some gaming news site. Once I started playing at about 11 pm, I looked out my window for the first time after starting playing and wouldn't you know it, the sun had come up. This game is slow paced the way I play (mind you it can be somewhat fast-paced if you're the fighting type) but holds my attention well enough that hours can pass in real time without my knowledge of it.\n\nYou start out in one of about, as it stands, six or so scenarios. You can choose to be anything from a group of six people with all the right supplies to start out with a small town wherever you choose to, or a guy in his underwear with a broken arm and a crappy pipe for a weapon starting in the middle of nowhere. From there it is your choice where to go and what to do.\n\nNow I am the owner of quite a few early access titles here on steam, and with the exception of one game (space engineers) this game is updated the most. Lo-fi games seems to have it together and wants this title to be finished. They are also very receptive of community input. They have also said that when the game is released the price will go up, so if you're thinking about getting it but you're not sure, now is the time to buy.\n\nIf you're wondering how this game is played, which is a question I get often, then here's the best I can describe it. You order your squad around RTS style by selecting then by clicking or click and drag mouse boxing them and order them around that way. The folks in your squad however tend to be uselss in all respects when you first get them and slowly by doing different tasks (labouring, weapon/armor crafting, fighting) get better at those things, adding an rpg element to it.\n\nNow just to wrap it up, if you buy this game, be patient and take a few hours to really get to know what you're doing before you make an opinion. Even in alpha this game is deep.","January 10, 2014","true","316.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Did you ever want to play a game where you can play with a single or multiple characters with pros and cons for each style? And most of all: Did you want a game with an open world where you can build your own outpost which can produce materials, weapons a.s.o.? If you don't mind some bugs and pathfinding problems (only sometimes) then even the alpha is good for you.\n\nYou begin with a character for whom you first choose the background. There are a few backgrounds you can choose from and each changes the difficulty (i.e. you get a better weapon or none at all, have a squad or are a loner...). So you begin on a big map (which shall get bigger as the development continues) and don't have a real goal. Except to survive. Bandits may find you very fast and the first thing you REALLY want to do is run away. You need experience. The levelling system is like in Oblivion: You get better as you do it. So now you should get to the next city or a patrol. Bandits are Bandits and you don't have the experience to fight them. Like I said: You are NOT a hero. As you venture to the towns you may find better equipment and buy it from money you got for selling looted stuff from dead bandits or ninjas. Maybe you even find better thins on them, but that does not happen very often. To get the best equipment you need to produce them on your own. As soon as you have got money and found a safe place (not too far from a city would be best) you can begin to build a research bench and begin building an outpost. It takes a lot of time. Many hours (real time, not the ingame time) until you researched everything. You also need to buy some blueprints for better weapons and armors. Now that you have even better equipment you can do more in a fight and if you already have more experience, you can take on at least 1 or 2 enemies at once. Since I only played to this point, I cannot go further with the gameplay. Oh, did I mention you can lose limbs? And need to bandage your wounds? There are no health potions and it takes a lot of time to recover.\n\nConclusion:\nPro:\n- Huge map\n- Learning by doing\n- Build your own outpost/city\n- Research\n- Limbs can be severed\n- Different weapons with different playstyle\n- Research better weapons\n- Not as easy as most of the games nowadays\n\nCons (at the moment):\n- Still alpha (includes bugs and similar problems)\n- No animals\n- Mines can be build anywhere\n- World seems very empty\n- Cities are small\n- Even if more guys around sometimes 1on1\n\nNeutral:\n- No AAA-gaphics, but still not so bad\n- Animations","January 10, 2014","true","84.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoy customising a game to your own tastes or creating your own story, this is the game for you! Despite being early access and missing many of the features to be implemented in the final game, this game has so much content and so much potential. Currently, for me, the only downside is the bugs, but early access often comes riddled with bugs. Luckily the current ones don't make the game unplayable.\n\nThe pros:\n-Lots of customisation\n-Huge map (with bigger map in the making)\n-NINJAS!\n-SAMURAI!\n-Solid economic and trading system\n-Enjoyable combat\n-Build a town/fortress/prison/camp any way you want\n-Deep weapon and armour crafting system\n-Custom team building (custom names, looks, armour, weapons, strengths and weaknesses)\n-in-depth character customisation\n-quicksave (F5) (you will be thankful if it crashes..)\n\nCons:\n-Bugs (can be quite rare, but often frustrating. Verifying game cache can often fix the bigger bugs)\n-Crashes (even more rare, mainly happen after hours of having the game open)\n-TELEPORTING UNCONSCIOUS GUYS!!!\n\nAll in all, well worth the low price it is, a game with incredible potential that will suit most play styles.

This game is overflowing with potential, and I can't wait to see where it goes.\n\nRight now the gameplay is pretty versatile, with a number of different ways to earn money, experience, and respect. Most of these paths, e.g. farming, smithing, trading, etc. take quite a while (1-3 hours) to really get functioning, so from the getgo you've got atleast 4 or 5 hours before the game gets anywhere near the risk of being boring. Throw in random attacks from the different desert and city factions, recruiting new members from the taverns of the world, and the amazing fun of mass combat and you're looking at a game well worth the price.","August 26, 2013","true","49.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes the Graphics might not be the best at the moment.  Yes it might be in alpha but this game already has so much to offer.  You can create your own faction, and live the way you want to within the game.  You can start a brand new settlement and fight for survival.   You can raid, and mug and terrorise all over the play area.  Make enemies and forge alliances.  This game is well worth the investment and more.

I left the town and got beaten up by bandits.\n\nThe second one took way longer but is as short to tell. I left the town and built a house. Then after watching my people working for about 20 min I got bored and started a new game.\n\nThe third try I was exploring the world, hired a few followers and built another house. Then a single ninja walked by and killed all of my people.\n\nI see a lot of potential in this game. Right now it feels too easy to just roam the map, get rich, build an army and then a settlement. I expect that to change once needs like hunger are introduced and you need to get them covered. Also I miss a lot of RPG-content. But I trust the developers that they can deliver what they planned.

However, it's a very FUN game even now, and since I bought it about a year ago, it's a very DIFFERENT game than what I bought, in a good way. The team has grown and is steadily updating with new and improved content, and they're quite dilligent about squashing bugs.\n\nThe ambitious idea behind this game is pure sandbox gold, and thus far, I see no indication the game will fall very short of its goals. Even in its current state, it's a game I sink 4-6 hours at a time into. I tend to take long breaks, usually coming back after a big content update overhaul patch, but when I do pick it up, "I think I'll play Kenshi for a bit" always turns into "Wow, I played Kenshi for that long?" It's an addictive game with an extremely promising future.\n\nIf you enjoy sandbox games, survival games or games that let you make a personal mark on the world, you'll love picking up a guy here and there from the taverns in the local towns, banding together for protection, and watching your recruits grow into hardened warriors and master builders as you carve out your own little piece of the world to call your own. I definitely recommend Kenshi for anyone who like a game that gives you freedom and rewards you for surviving in whatever way you see fit. I also recommend it for those who like to start out with nothing and eventually (a long time into the future) have to means to obtain anything they wish.\n\nIf I were to compare it to other games... It's a little bit Mount and Blade, a little bit Age of Empires, and just a tiny bit Minecraft. (Tiny bit; you get to build, but you don't get to design your buildings. You can, however, place useful constructions like beds to heal in and containers to store materials and items into these buildings however you choose.)\n\nDo bear in mind that Kenshi is still in alpha, so it's a little barren and it does have its bugs. Also keep in mind that Kenshi isn't a game that holds your hand too much. You're plopped down in a world populated with various hostile and neutral factions, and your purpose is to survive however you can. Trade between the cities, start your own society where you mine and farm for resources to sell, or prey on starving bandits until you become bandits yourselves capable of waylaying wealthy merchants and their caravan guards.\n\nHowever, what you do and how you do it is left entirely to you, so do bear in mind that at first, you might feel a bit lost and without direction. Also keep in mind that the world is a dangerous place, and you might lose quite a bit before you start to see gains. Don't be afraid to fall; just speed up the time, and there's a good chance you'll wake up. If you do, you'll be tougher than the last time. Every scar in Kenshi brings you a small step closer to being the big dog in the game.\n\nLong story short: If you're thinking about buying Kenshi based purely on what the store page has to say about it, you'll probably be glad you bought it. It's an amibitious game that is slowly doing all it set out to do, and gives you the sense of accomplishment you'd expect. It's paced to be played for the long haul, so if you enjoy open-ended sandboxes where you reap your rewards after many long hours of effort and character growth, this is definitely a game you'll want to consider.","September 25, 2014","true","32.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It started with only a single creator, but as the game gained popularity, the team has expanded greatly. One of the biggest drawbacks that may push many people away from this diamond in the rough is the slow development. But while the updates may be slow, the Lo-Fi team has proven their consistancy and dedication. Updates are regular and often expected, thier website lists projects currently in the works, and the team is very responsive to the community.\n\nThe Game\nKenshi is an open-world, tactical, squad-based RPG, with a 'Sword Punk' style. It runs on the Havok engine. While a great engine, it has created significant obstacles in the way of pathfinding. However, this issue has almost completely resolved. The world has a post-catastrophic event type feel, but this may change when the giant 0.8 world update is released. Currently, the environment is a sparse desert with settlements dotting the land and bandits roaming the dunes. A faction system is present but not fully explored (you can decrease relations by attacking, increase it by healing). The art style is Jappanese influenced primarily, and the newly updated hud adds a rustic, bloody feel to it (A+).\n\nWhen starting a new game, you can choose from several different scenarios, from starting with a legendary sword to a group of traders to absoloutly nothing and a bum leg. The combat is based on your characters' skills, and damage is locational.\n\nOne of the main portions of the game is base building. You can create a completely self sufficent settlement with farms, textile industry, arms crafting, and more, and traders will stop by at your stores.\n\nConclusion/TL;DR\nKenshi has a LOT of promise, so much that this has to be my most anticipated game currently (besides Fallout 4, of course), and has been since I bought it. It is perfectly playable as is, but gameplay can get a little dry. But having gotten 173 hours out of an early access game started by a single individual, it'd be a crime not to recommend it.","September 15, 2015","true","181.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only way to even begin to describe this game would be to call the result of Age of Empires II crossed with Mount and Blade: Warband (RTS-RPG). You control your troops and build a base similarly to Age of Empires, but it is in a persistent and immersive world loosely based on feudal Japanese society, but set in a desert environment with a myriad of factions, towns, bandits and other miscellaneous NPCs to kill (or join, if you're weird like that).\n\nUnlike M&B however, if a character dies you will lose them forever. You don't have a "main" character; all your characters, and indeed all NPCs are equals in the eyes of the game until you train them up, and even then they are only marginally stronger than any normal person. Battles are fought in real-time with limb damage, blood-loss, and encumberance factors all affecting the combat ability of your troops.  Currently there are only melee weapons, but the developer has stated there will be ranged weapons added in a later build. There are also many un-implemented or half implemented features like diplomacy, quests and a climbing skill for your characters which will be added/completed later.\n\nBear in mind that this is an alpha, and it will crash. Repeatedly. So if you do decide to buy it, save as much as you can. It will also have bugs. Maybe not in this current build, maybe not in the next one. But one day you will encounter a bug, and you will cry/scream/rage when it happens. This is normal. Embrace the bugs, for, with every bug you find and report you are making the game a better one.\n\nDespite all this, the game is in a very playable state. This is not one of those games that is released as Early Access when it is impossible to play. In its current state it could be sold as a standalone game with a little polish, but when it is complete it will rival Skyrim and Mount and Blade as my go-to game. It may even become as revered in the minds of Steam users as Bad Rats.\n\nI do recommend buying this as soon as possible, as $20 is amazingly cheap and the price will only rise. I could see a game like this easily selling for $60 when it is finished.\n\nOverall, 10/10 would buy again.","February 3, 2014","true","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It started with only a single creator, but as the game gained popularity, the team has expanded greatly. One of the biggest drawbacks that may push many people away from this diamond in the rough is the slow development. But while the updates may be slow, the Lo-Fi team has proven their consistancy and dedication. Updates are regular and often expected, thier website lists projects currently in the works, and the team is very responsive to the community.\n\nThe Game\nKenshi is an open-world, tactical, squad-based RPG, with a 'Sword Punk' style. It runs on the Havok engine. While a great engine, it has created significant obstacles in the way of pathfinding. However, this issue has almost completely resolved. The world has a post-catastrophic event type feel, but this may change when the giant 0.8 world update is released. Currently, the environment is a sparse desert with settlements dotting the land and bandits roaming the dunes. A faction system is present but not fully explored (you can decrease relations by attacking, increase it by healing). The art style is Jappanese influenced primarily, and the newly updated hud adds a rustic, bloody feel to it (A+).\n\nWhen starting a new game, you can choose from several different scenarios, from starting with a legendary sword to a group of traders to absoloutly nothing and a bum leg. The combat is based on your characters' skills, and damage is locational.\n\nOne of the main portions of the game is base building. You can create a completely self sufficent settlement with farms, textile industry, arms crafting, and more, and traders will stop by at your stores.\n\nConclusion/TL;DR\nKenshi has a LOT of promise, so much that this has to be my most anticipated game currently (besides Fallout 4, of course), and has been since I bought it. It is perfectly playable as is, but gameplay can get a little dry. But having gotten 173 hours out of an early access game started by a single individual, it'd be a crime not to recommend it.","September 15, 2015","true","181.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kenshi is one of the reasons the gaming community will never stop dreaming, and will always have something to be excited about. It shows that one mans dream can become a reality as long as you stick to what you love. It also shows that you don't have to have millions of dollars and corporate funding to make a gem of an experience.\n\nNow on to the meat of the review. Kenshi has come a long way since I first bought it when it first came to steam. A lot of content and technological improvements has put more meat on it bones over time, however there are some bugs and a very steep learning curve and some people might get overwhelmed with the initial difficulty. The bugs come and go mostly except for some that have lingered on and have been a real issue for some people. Like the path finding and super crashes. These bugs usually flood in when a new update comes out and they get fixed relatively quickly as time goes on. The dev does a really good job at listening to his community and the moderators and players are generally helpful and will answer any questions you have about the game. There are tons of guides and YouTube videos so if you don't understand how to do something in  the game it's pretty easy to get an issue resolved or a question answered.\n\nThis game offers many ways to play. You can be a trader, a bandit, a caravan guard, lone warrior/ wanderer, explorer, blacksmith, laborer, scientist, ninja, fragment axe wielding juggernaut. The list goes on and on, and the best thing about it is, more is going to be added in and you'll only have more ways to play the game.","April 16, 2013","true","346.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Sparsely populated by junk towns and populated by newborn cultures based on old black & white samurai films, with a touch of the spaghetti westerns born thereof thrown in for good measure.  Men and women in coolie hats with katanas fighting against groups of bandits and crazed cannibals, trying to build secure outposts of safety in a violent and chaotic world.\n\nThis was the game that advertised back when I bought into it.  This was the game that was promised.  Does this sound like a great idea for a game?  Does this sound like a game that you would want to play?  Well tough crap, suckers, because all that is going bye-bye!\n\nWelcome to a fantasy world filled with lush jungles, mysterious forrests, dangerous wolf packs, and strange races - bone men, bug men, and robots.  Oh joy, robots!  And giant monster things!  That's just what every samurai adventure needs, right?  That vast wasteland that took hours to cross is now a map ten times larger!  Why?  Because we can.  Not that you'll ever get any use out of that, but so what?\n\nThis game is no longer about wandering ronin traversing the desert in search of adventure.  It is now the living avatar of feature creep, fueled by what seems like some kind of unending mescaline binge and slowly morphing into new game entirely... a game that's only common denominator with the original is that there are swords.\n\nAnd all this has been while continuing to fail at fixing bugs that are literally as old as the game itself.  Constant crashes, dysfunctional pathfinding, and broken tools thrown around like a gas explosion in a mechanic's garage.  Rather than fix the game they already had they instead decided to turn it into a RTS version of Morrowind, only weirder, if you can imagine such a thing.\n\nNow maybe that is a game that you'd be interested in and I won't begrudge someone for liking that, but personally I don't care for the bait and switch.  I certainly do not appreciate the constant adding of more crap that I don't recall anyone asking for while everything that came before it is still horribly broken.\n\nI saw an idea, a great idea, for a game that I would like to play.  I paid for that game.  Today I see a completely different game being made, one that I simply have no interest in, while the one I bought was never finished - and never will be.\n\nSo if you're looking for a high-fantasy, RTS version of your favorite magical wonderland, go right ahead and get Kenshi.  If you're looking for the post-apocalypse desert wandering ronin adventure originally advertised on the box then you're out of luck - keep looking, maybe someday, someone will make that game for real.\n\nFinal note: Posting this as a review since I was being banned from forum for saying the same things.

Love it.INSTA FANBOY, of the concept!!!\n\n\nI'm not even going to list to many of the bugs and flaws...because it's still in an alpha/beta  stage,and has been so for a long time.7 years +.The game is very,very buggy. This review is for the so called stable build and the beta build,as they pretty much share the same problems.\nThe beta is just as buggy as the alpha so not sure why there is like 6 builds of the game,but this will cover the the two main builds of the game.The one you DL and the one you can OPT into.\n\nBiggest Cons imo are,\n\nThe need to eat(beta) it sucks,having 40 guys and putting food into their bags is crazy and they need to much food.Killed the game for me,won't play again till its removed or a option to turn it off is added. Or the game comes out and i feel like modding it out...its that bad.Also a fix was added so they will eat out of storage if they are in base,most the time they just rubberband and never do their job or eat.SO again a fix that did not fix anything.\n\nsmall unexperienced dev team. as in maybe 6 plebs with real jobs,i assume.Game did start off with just one guy working on it till steam EA for the most part.\n\nSlow updates. I mean really slow.Most have been small things and bug fixes that really never fixed a bug imo.\n\nUgly base buildings etc.\nLack of Heavy armor skins and types,about 2 in the game atm.\ncan't duel wield\nno shields\nno pack mules or animals or wagons or anything other then a backpack for the player.Just a peeve of mine.\nRep system,sounds good on paper but needs alot of work.You have very limited ways to build up rep that may turn out to be a good thing later on..The traders,etc\n\nBuilding walls is so broken its sad after countless fixes over the years including the new beta build.Men building the walls bug getting stuck in place or just will not build them etc.Can run through walls etc..etc.\n\nSuper buggy traders that most the time or Never buy anything in your shops.They just stand there  or get stuck to some wall or crate etc,Even after fixes etc...Their rep is also the same for the slave traders,so if you kill a slave trader you just got bad rep with the traders aswell.\n\nCrashes alot when you start building up your town/outposts alot.Most due to walls(even after countless fixes) and cooking and pretty much every building etc.It can be done however,but does start to ware on you.\n\nThe pathing is just a mess.Rubber banding bandits i like to call it,or AI stuck to hills,mountains,your buildings,walls..etc\n\nEven with chase disabled your men will chase enemy and start to spread out across the landscape.Game needs a stand ground or hold postion option for squads.Even after fixes they still run all over the place.\n\nSome of the harder enemies  that have "bandit camps" will not respawn.Some times the animals do however. making the worlds camps empty.( The red X's on the map)Same for the beta build.\n\nShops in the towns are buggy and most the time so far that i have played in the Beta are closed,most towns are destoryed etc..just imo the game seems to be blah at this point.\n\nOn the + side with a rant.\n\nYou can set up bases anywhere you want and as many as you want.\nHave up to 50 men in your faction,you must arm them and train them\nBuy and sell  goods.NPC SHOPS WORK\nCraft yourself and your men swords and armor.\nHuge open would.(when the new map is added,OMG) check the roadmap on their website.\nThe combat when not buggy((most the time it is) is good,lacks good sounds tho.You can hardly hear any combat sounds in general.\nHard at first, after maybe 10 hours or less becomes a cakewalk till more things are added.(that is if your starting guy or men are built up enough and have not been KILLED!!!)\nModdable,if thats a word.\nEach of your men have about 40 or so skills,its pretty crazy that you can lv up.\nlofi games main website has a roadmap for the game and all kinda other stuff.\nLots of research trees to upgrade everything.\n\nBut its cheap and plenty of gameplay for the pricetag will become boring before 50hours in tho. I have 300+hrs and still have not maxed out my mens combat skills to max,so its got rpg type stuff in it. always a plus.\n\nI was banned on the steam fourms for listing problems,no idea why,but that happen.Take what you want from that.Not the devs,but the person who likes to pick fights then ban you when they get but-hurt.(enter name of the stuck up fourm moderator)\n\n\nNot enough bandits walking around in the base build,but in the beta loads of them. So combat skills take ages in both builds,cause after awhile the bandits are one shotted and give next to no xp gain to combat.(am sure more factions will be added.) For now you can just increase the squad size and population on the map from the options.Helps alot.(also a buggy crash problem like the rest of the game)\n\nOverall tho this game is cool and worth the time,even tho its been in a sad state since its birth.\n\nI do not feel this was a waste of money,for the hours i sunk into it and was cool imo.\n\nPlay this games experimental build that way you can play with all the new stuff before it gets added into the "stable build" the games gonna crash no matter what build,so imo its better to see all that the game has in it.\n\n\nAfter playing on the new map a bit,not really gonna update this anymore.2+years with the same bugs i have listed and not really much has changed other then the crafting/Tech research system,and imo not that good or bad,kinda in that annoying range.\n\nI give the games concept a 10/10  the build 4/10 so far. I will keep hope that the game gets better with time,so far imo not looking like it. Still worth the 20 bucks as there is nothing like this one.","January 29, 2014","true","476.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And by \"encourage\" i mean it in the same way disease encourages you to go see a doctor, while not always necessary, it\'s still the best course of action, mostly because your new \"hero\" is as much of a hero as the crack addict that lives next door to me\n\nThe gameplay is quite nice, they call the fighting is squad based, meaning you will be fighting with a group, against a group, a big part of combat is also the standard gear and their bonuses, but they also have a skill system, were the skills become better the more your people use them, and some gear gives negative stat bonuses, which means that heavier armor is quite balanced.\n\nYou can build too! You can start your own town (though i don\'t think you can get any \"normal\" citizens) were you can craft several houses and a ton of machines that do stuff for example, you can make a blacksmith, weaver, chainmaking station etc. you can also farm within your town, which is done by building the respective farm building, for example a wheat farm, then employing one of your guys to work there, but before you can build any of those you need to research them, which you slowly do by making the highest level research bench you can and staffing a person there.\n\nA lot of people tell me to judge early access games by their current state, and not their potential, and while i somewhat agree, i don\'t even need to judge it by it\'s potential to tell you this game is great, even in it\'s current state.\nThe main problem with the game is simple, a lot of bugs, but however it doesn\'t crash too frequently, except when you mess about in the settings too much, and sometimes buildings lose their textures and get a placeholder one, and sometimes the npcs get stuck not doing anything.\n\nBut despite all that, i would recommend this game to anybody who likes open world sandboxes and a challenge, and don\'t care much for high-rez games and don\'t mind some bugs and crashes","June 1","true","71.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can play this game as one character, or play it as a group (at the moment maximally 20 peoples).\nNone of your characters will be "unbeatable". Even your main character is just a man - and in the beginnings practically everyone will be better.\nUsually I start the game in hardest mode. Totally naked, with bad arm and a STICK. Yes - I can survive somehow...\nThe best way how to show that any character can die is to give a preview of my game:\n\nI got around six peoples group and went from city to city. I walked too close to Cannibal outpost, and all my group except one girl had been prisoned. I walk then with that girl, and found a band of samurai's. And I made her to walk with them... Then I ordered all the rest of the band, to try pick-lock their cage to get out. one by one I managed to get out... One of the cannibals started to attack to my first character - to the AssassinLV, they beated him up... And were eating my character... After time He managed to get out... But My band was beated up - again but still alive... Later I was close to the city - when bandits attacked on my band... After many attacks AssassinLV were dying... Then that girl - who was not kidnapped, I ordered her to save my character, cause he had the bag full of trade... She managed to prevent AssassinLV from dying, but also she was noticed by other group of bandits... Then she was dying... And no one could been able to save her... She died - cause she was saving the other......","April 16, 2014","true","19.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Kenshi just feels incredibly refreshing and original in a sea of clones and sequels. Its a game you can pick up and play at any time without feeling stressed. Its simple idea with an incredible amount of depth. Build your own city. Or pillage others. Be miners, farmers, thieves, murderers, traders, crusaders. samurai, whatever you want. Set goals for yourself. Your only limitation is your willpower. It is, at this time, still in very early alpha so its rough around the edges.

Then this is certainly the game for you. However, as the devs say this game is unfinished and is still in a buggy state, your games will crash, and the frequency differs for what you are doing.\n\nThe game is fun, challenging and rewarding. I myself have got a large pack of freedom seekers that have stuck by each other through thick and thin, I've lost some along the way, but more importantly my two characters that have been together from the start are mated for life. I only wish this game had a relationship and memory system whereby the friends you make will enjoy your company and hang out, protect you and will remember the times you saved their ♥♥♥♥, and that you could show that friendship or love through interactions. Would give this game so much more life in terms of the human interaction.\n\nThis game has so much potential and I can't wait to see the finished product when it comes out of ALPHA and into BETA and then finally into full release!","January 6, 2015","true","71.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeastConcern/recommended/233860/","LeastConcern","Kalanos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeastConcern/","107 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMy take on Kenshi is a mixed bag.  Bottom line is I love the game but it's horrendously buggy and development is extremely slow.\n\nThey bill it as an RPG with RTS elements, but it doesn't play that way for me.  I see it more as an RTS with RPG elements.  You scavenge materials, build a base, train recruits and laborers and defend or go on the aggressive.  It reminds me a bit of Earth 2150 in how each unit can earn experience and lvl up (the RPG aspects) while maintaining an RTS-like squad-focused feel.\n\nIt's a lot of fun training your troops and building your town up.  But the bugs, oh my.  If you play the "stable" release, expect to crash randomly every hour or so like clockwork.  I honestly had better stability with the "experimental" opt-in steam beta branch, however some friends with similar rigs say they can't play the experimental version at all due to single digit frame-rates (it plays fine for me).  But either way you go, the sad state of pathing AI in this game really kills the joy.  Regular reloads when your own guys get stuck in the landscape and terrain and a constant spectacle of enemy units stuck on hills and corners.   This is by far the worst of the bugs, but there are lots of others.\n\nI really like the game and think it has awesome potential, but the state of development and the persistence of bugs through so many releases really has me discouraged.\n\nIf you managed to pick it up on sale like I did and don't mind risking a small investment on a game with great potential, then go for it.  If you aren't willing to throw money at a project that may never be completed and has too many bugs to enjoy for any length of time in it's current state, then I suggest you wait and see what happens.\n\nFor me, I'd do it again.  I knew what I was getting into and the sale price of $10 makes it an acceptable risk.","May 5, 2015","true","175.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It delievers a decent level of content already with a lot more promised on the horizon, and it actually abides by the spirit of what early access is rather than just being a sort of super early preorder; the developer actually uses community feedback to determine what features to focus on.\n\nThe game itself is also very engaging, but that's more a matter of personal preference. At its core it's primarily a sandbox game (and as far as I'm aware the first sandbox game to feature primarily desert, which strikes me as odd; think of the symbolism!), though at the moment it isn't as flexible as you'd expect a sandbox game to be. Even in early access, however, there is a decent level of easily accessible moddibility to be found. You can tweak and create weapons, NPCs, characters and even build NPC towns and modify the base mechanics of the game with a simple and relatively straightforward GUI.\n\nThere is unfortunately not much more to say about the game at this stage because it is still early access and seemingly a long way off from release, which may be enough to put a lot of people off. Let me repeat because it can't be overstated: this game is made by an incredibly small team (it was a team of one for a long time) and it isn't likely to be finished in 2014, maybe not even in 2015. But it's already a fun game at its core if you like squad based RPGs or town building simulators or a mix of both, and it is steadily progressing. I also expect that over the coming year it'll start seeing some decent modding.","April 26, 2013","true","31.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In the meantime, they've been adding animals, random insult generator, and all sorts of fun stuff to their dev build in preparation for the finished pathfinding. I found the game fun back in the earliest stages of alpha, without sound, great graphics, or any polish at all. It was buggy but fun then, now the bugs are fewer and the fun is far greater.\n\nThe limitations for the game are slowly getting reversed, and the game is becoming more grand by the day, with lots of dev updates and supports. The community is still small, meaning it's a lot easier to get a message across to the devs if you are feeling concerned.\n\nOverall, this is my all time favorite strategy game, start the game with a stick and become a martial arts master who runs a fortress with well armed squad of companions who tear up all sorts of bandit life in the wastelands.\n\nThe game is great, but it's only gonna get better from here!","December 2, 2014","true","160.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It came across as something being built upon and in a very ambitious manner. When I first jumped in kenshi I did not have much to work with other than running from town to town across this expansive desert or farming hemp. NPCs were pretty rare at this point and it did not matter much to me. I still found myself running around aimlessly, having fun just imaging what this game can eventually turn out to be. I truly believe this game has nigh endless possibility for the fans out there of this style of game play.\n\nI have to say all in all this game is pretty self explanatory from the trailer. You can choose several starts for your character, all of which give you a different style of game play starting from a solo rp play style to a squad based one. (you can start with 1 pc or 5, you can start as a trader or retired soldier) When you get in after creating your PC you are given a rough ui with all the controls laid out in a help screen. Forewarning this is not a walk in the park, expect your survivability to be low especially when picking a tougher starting.\n\nHowever, regardless of what start you end up picking you will most likly be forced to do a few monotonous things to survive. Such as having hostile npcs chase you into town, staying alive while the guards kill said hostile npcs and then looting/selling the gear you recover from them. Admittedly this is an issue, one I see being resolved as the skill and stat system is fleshed out more.\n\nAlbeit I feel as of right now, in the stage this game is currently in (alpha) it would not appeal to someone lacking the needed patience or interest in Kenshi's development. IMO - I am willing to wait as long as it takes to see this game reach it's full potential. A project of this magnitude takes time, and I hope the devs keep updating it with the slow and steady approach. This means working updates that actually change major aspects of the games mechanics, graphics, ai, landscapes...I think I have seen these guys rework or update about almost everything this game has to offer since initial release.\n\nUpdates\nIf you have any doubts about this game seeing updates, I would ask you to consider the following. I have been following Kenshi closely for some time and the developers are making a fantastic effort with updates. I have about 60 hrs so far putting in a few every other week since initial release. I can say the changes this game has undergone is tremendous. Here you can find any info regarding updates and the roadmap[www.lofigames.com]\n\nBe patient and take solace in knowing you will be supporting something that does take great effort to create. The team for Kenshi is not all that lucrative afaik and the amount of work I personally have seen put in at this stage is well worth the current price tag.\n\nPros vs Cons(All subject to personal preference)\nPros        Cons                Price Tag        Very Long Devel Stages                Endless Possibility/Modding Support        A lot of monotony in this stage/Very Long Devel Stages                Major bugs are hot fixed fast        You Can Find A lot of bugs                Time Consuming        Time Consuming\nShort of the developers studio being swallowed whole by the earth itself or losing all funding...I don't see this one not living up to it's potential. With the extent of this games mechanics and the capability of a modding community, the sky is the limit for this one. Another game that will surely, one day become a classic among the host of others.\n\nRecommended","December 8, 2014","true","69.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So naturally I studied how to increase my combat skills. It says in the description of leveling up your combat skills, such as katana, dexterity, offense, and defence to fight stronger opponents than you in order to gain a bonus in leveling them. But, the obvious problem to that is when fighting stronger opponents you run a very high risk of dying. So I took on a passive approach. In the beginning I aggroed stronger mobs into friendly cities in order to maybe get a hit in between the crossfire. After the fighting was over I looted and bandaged the mob. Then I realised something, if the mob were not armed (because I looted them) they cannot fight back. Thus I learned a faster method to grinding my skills. Every once in a while I would get hurt so I ran to the local inn and rested my injuries. There I wondered, if I can rest my body faster this way, can I rest the bad guy's bodies? Of course I can. So I started making a human farm of looted enemies where I would beat them to unconsciousness, put them on a bed, then beat them to unconsciousness when they got better. But, the story doesn't end here. Later when I was building my village I noticed I can construct prison cages. What originally started out as a simple outpost for researching weapon crafting, turned into a human livestock factory of caged samurais and holy paladins where they would be beaten to unconsciousness every momment they are awake.\n\ntldr: I made a post-apocalyptic japanese concentration camp.\n\n9/10 (1- for the damn glitches, go finish the game)","January 1, 2015","true","32.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I never expected a finished game. it´s not that I bught it without having experience with other EA titles.)\n\n1. core mechanics not working or not working consistently enough\nthis one is my main concern. workers forget their jobs, which means you end up a lot of micromanaging individual group members.\nalso pathfinding and collision is a mess sometimes. even the workaround (which are offered, that´s a plus) don´t work consistently\n\n2. slow development cycles.\nthe game is in development, which is nice. but so far I have experienced only one real update. the devs are in contact with the playersm which is nice. but I wonder how this game will ever pick up some momentum and gain some ground.\n\nbasically from my standpoint, i couldn´t care less about great char graphics and player customization... thats all icing on the cake once its baked and finished to eat. but pathing, collision and AI behaviour is so essential for this kind of game that it needs to get taken care of asap.\n\nand when  Í read on the forums that some core game bugs are dependent on the actual game engine chosen for the game, I am prone to believe that maybe the have chosen the wrong engine....\n\nits been a good expense/reward scenario for me. I don´t mind spending the money as the time I played was great. but there´s no poin fo rme in keeping playing right now, because of the points mentioned before.\n\nkeep in mind: it´s early access. so if you want to support the game and idea behind it (like I wanted to):\nbuy it. its a good investment as the game itself will be sweet once it´s far more advanced. whenever that might be though...\n\n\n","February 28, 2015","true","109.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It delievers a decent level of content already with a lot more promised on the horizon, and it actually abides by the spirit of what early access is rather than just being a sort of super early preorder; the developer actually uses community feedback to determine what features to focus on.\n\nThe game itself is also very engaging, but that's more a matter of personal preference. At its core it's primarily a sandbox game (and as far as I'm aware the first sandbox game to feature primarily desert, which strikes me as odd; think of the symbolism!), though at the moment it isn't as flexible as you'd expect a sandbox game to be. Even in early access, however, there is a decent level of easily accessible moddibility to be found. You can tweak and create weapons, NPCs, characters and even build NPC towns and modify the base mechanics of the game with a simple and relatively straightforward GUI.\n\nThere is unfortunately not much more to say about the game at this stage because it is still early access and seemingly a long way off from release, which may be enough to put a lot of people off. Let me repeat because it can't be overstated: this game is made by an incredibly small team (it was a team of one for a long time) and it isn't likely to be finished in 2014, maybe not even in 2015. But it's already a fun game at its core if you like squad based RPGs or town building simulators or a mix of both, and it is steadily progressing. I also expect that over the coming year it'll start seeing some decent modding.","April 26, 2013","true","31.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Well, it is a sandbox RPG with a twist. It acts as an RPG in the sense that you can customize your character to almost as much detail as most other RPGs out there. You also have the crafting element you find in most RPGs and sandbox games. You may craft weapons/Armor/Clothes/medical supplies/rum (which at this stage can only be sold/food (same as rum) and other things. You gain materials to make them through mining, farming or buying it.\nThat is fine, so what makes kenshi different then? Well, kenshi has a couple of other elements to it, two of which add some serious sandbox/RTS attributes to it. First we have base building aspects, you may build buildings and put your production equipment and storage boxes inside. You may build walls around your town and you may put man-able crossbow and harpoon turrets on them to defend your town. Base building to a degree some RTSs don’t have, comparing it to a sandbox instead.\nNow you may ask, I have a big base with lots of production equipment and I can build pretty much anything, but who is gonna run the economy??? Well, the other aspect that gives it an RTS feel is the fact that you can recruit a total number of 255 equally customized characters to your cause.\nSo now we have a large base and an army that may take over the world if we want? Well you will end up like that yes, but not now. Now you are one guy, and probably the weakest most insignificant one within the kenshi universe too, unable to 1v1 anything at all. That seems unfair! So at least we get a lot of gold to buy some epic swordsman to protect us right? Nope, you don’t even get that. You have crappy worthless gear and barely enough money to recruit another useless person as weak as you are, with equally worthless gear.\nOkay but if 1 of my guys cant 1v1 something, maybe we can 2v1 something right? Well yes actually you may 2v1 a hungry bandit, the second weakest thing in the kenshi universe, only they don’t travel alone…there will be 10-15 of them. The only things that travel alone are the very strongest ones on the map. But that’s okay since they wont be found in the safe zone right? Wrong, the only safe zone you will find is the one you make from hard fighting and training and good gear and lots of strong fighters….In kenshi, the weak and the strong walk together, and most of the weak die before they even get a chance to grow strong. That is if you don’t wanna be stuck in a friendly town for the rest of your miserable life.\nSo how do we get stronger? You train your skills by using them of course. No level system, just skills that are independent of one another. For damage you increase your weapon skills, whether you wield a katana, hacker, sabre or heavy weapons class weapon is up to you. That goes along with your attack skill, which influences the frequency your attacks get passed the opponents guard. For defence you have toughness, which allows you to get hit more before fainting or dying, and is trained by…getting beat up a lot…Along with this goes your defense skill, which allows you to block or dodge more often.\nThen you get your heavy supporting skills in both defense and offence, namely strength, allowing you to carry more stuff without losing speed, dexterity, increasing your attack and block speed, and athletics, increasing your movement speed.\nThen you get your other skills like medic, armorer, weapons smith, thieving, stealth, laboring, engineering, science and more. Increasing your ability in each.\nSo how about the world, whats the world like and does everything want to kill us? Well, there are groups of bandits running around who would attack you and strip your gear once you faint(you can turn the gear stripping off if you want an easier game) ; there are ninjas running around who will attack you to train their skills, there are nests of animals who roam the area who will attack you and drag you back to their nest for feasting, there are cannibal towns who will attack you and eat you, there may be factions who hate your guts and will attack you, different towns and the groups who own them. So who do you have that will not kill you? There are traders and their guards walking from town to town, there are towns that will be neutral towards you, who luckily hate your enemies to the point where they will defend you, and there are adventurers (powerful warriors who travel solo) who will come to your aid if they are around (a rarity)\nSo kenshi is about learning about the world and your place in it, and slowly moving up in the world until you are the superpower. It is about skillfully avoiding unnecessary trouble until you can face it. It is about starting at the bottom, and ending at the top somehow. It is about what you have it in yourself to be. It is not multiplayer, so you wont see the horridness of humanity you find in an online community. No noob bashing and no kids acting all grown up.\nRight now though the game is in alpha state, and the map is just one big desert with mountains and minimum foliage (it acts as a fake map right now since they are building the real one, which will be 339 square miles as opposed to Elder scrolls: skyrums 25) Right now it is buggy, but the devs are fixing bugs and releasing updates 2-3 times a week. The devs are very active, and have so many ideas of what they wanna add its not even funny. Right now there are 2 races, but they are planning at least 5. But for now the focus are bug fixes until they announce beta with the new world map, which will have all the kinds of biomes you can think of and more that you haven’t thought of yet, along with many biome specific creatures. There will be a fast travel system that would not work like a loading screen (or so they say) we are thinking that ships or some sort of caravan road system will be what they opt for.\nRight now though, it is on steam for $19.99, where at full release $59.99 will be a bargain. This is basically an RPG/sandbox/RTS/survival game. The most complex idea I have yet seen on steam.\nI would recommend it because the devs see it as a dream. They are very active and include the community in pretty much everything. Lo-Fi games, despite being a 6 man crew (half of which are not programmers) are doing an admirable job with this game. I recommend it because if the devs pull it off this will be a game easily worth more than $59.99. It may be worth close to $100, but I know that the devs wont go that far, however it is easy to see that if you buy it now, you will save lots of money. I recommend it because if the devs pull it off kenshi will be the greatest single player game in history.\n\nSo now we are at the 0.9 beta, and wow, all i can say is wow. its still buggy, but within the last 3 days a total of 9 hotfixes were released, so the team is working on it around the clock.\n\nWeve been waiting in the deserts for what was promised to be the best single player experience ever! and we are getting closer, with the first part of the actual map being released. It looks beautiful guys, it really does. No more bare deserts, you can tell alot of effort was put into the map. There is atmosphere now, nightime seems ominous, and everyone wants you dead, or just doesnt care. Very few people would help you from being slaughtered. In the kenshi world death is just another part of life. things are harsh, and hunger is a thing now. If you dont starve, get eaten,  or killed in battle, you may just end up being that impossibly powerful swordsman you see in the movies, but even then you can die, as you are not the only one out there. The character avatars are so well designed. The stronger you get the more visible your muscles. The more starved you are the scrawnier you look. Its just great.","July 20, 2015","true","143.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The RPG elements, the gradual skill increases as you perform various actions, the "exploration," hell, even being a character that has a backstory that suits your playstyle. The game is great with a bit of a rocky start, but after you recruit a good amount of people (at least 6-7), you can finally get things rolling with the crafting and settling of your own town- that is, if you don't choose to live in a pre-made town.\n\nThe possibilities are truly endless, and no playthrough will be the same- unless you play narrow-mindedly and safe. While I am mildly unsure as to what changes have been made to the world, the playability even through its alpha stage is marginally better than when I first bought the game. I, in fact, created my own world and recently finished it in liue of Dark Souls. The modability is there and given to you on a silver platter. All it takes is a bit of understanding, some programs, and the already there construction set and you're good to go.\n\nOverall, I'd give Kenshi an 8/10.\n\nDie well.","March 29, 2014","true","51.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game THIS GAME is my favourite game so far. (my time is low as i have a different account on my titan for different games) I play this on the train, at university, in the car i play it everywhere i can.\n\nTake the best RPG in the world. Add a squad based strategy with a hint of banished and the fallout series and you have Kenshi..\n\nintruged? you should be! This game is an open world do whatever you want bandit merchant and city builder simulator in a Japanese esque fallout stylee setting. When you play Kenshi you can choose your starting position. Naked and hungry with nothing on you in the middle of no-where. Do you want to be a retired captain who has made enemies of the holy empire who only has his trusty sword and the clothes on his back while the holy empire hunt him down? A group of 5 who are sick of taxes and make their own city while facing bandits and sand ninjas? Or start off in the middle of no-where with a critically injured friend in dire need of medical attention after your squad has been killed.

You can choose diffrent sceneries to start your story all of which add diffrent difficulties and fun to the game for example one spawns you in the middle of a camp of cannibils in which your be knocked out and have to escape, Another starts you off with a bunch of freedom seekers wanting to start their own town with a few supplies to get you started. This game adds a lot of replayability and freedom it has a few bugs here and there but it has a lot of promise and in this stage i find the game very fun and addictive.  One of my favirote features is the body health feature which if a body part gets damaged too much it will effect how you move and behave like holding your stomach from being damaged in the torso or being damaged on the leg causes you to limp which adds a dramatic feel to the game trying to limp to safety to a town or your outpost from bandits. this game still gets updated and improved on and i'm excited about seeing the future content they are lining up for this gem of a game.","November 7, 2014","true","37.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The trading system is very good and is part of the game that could really make it do great things. One word of advice for the creators though maybe you could include in the game that when currently looting dead or unconcious npc's you can take there clothing and swords and whatever items they are carrying but you can't touch there money, well how about in the next update we can loot there money aswell this would make the game more realistic which isn't a bad thing.","January 31, 2014","true","36.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even at the early stage it was very playable. Since then more features and improvements have been made. I like the fact that the dev does not rush things and in doing so I can see this game having a very large fan base when its finally completed. Its difficult to describe this game accurately as it contains many well thought out ideas. Its a great combination of things and because death comes swiftly to the unwary you actually start to care about each individual member of your group. They are vulnerable like any human and require training and experience. As this takes time you can get quite upset should one day your group get attacked by a large group of bandits and many members die or become seriously injured. Its this level of detail that makes the game so rewarding because you have to actually think rather than just throw a bunch of disposable, easily respawned soldiers into battle as you would in other RTS games. In Kenshi a human life is a valuable commodity.","January 28, 2014","true","23.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The trading system is very good and is part of the game that could really make it do great things. One word of advice for the creators though maybe you could include in the game that when currently looting dead or unconcious npc's you can take there clothing and swords and whatever items they are carrying but you can't touch there money, well how about in the next update we can loot there money aswell this would make the game more realistic which isn't a bad thing.","January 31, 2014","true","36.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have re-reviewed the progress of the game and looked at multiple standpoints as well. I used to play this a lot on Desura, and there were multiple, multiple bugs. It is still pretty unoptomized and some older bugs still occur for me (the least harmful being my characters falling through the world in ragdoll mode). Seeing how long ago I played this game, and seeing it now... at the progress it's at... years are going to pass by before this game is "ready". By the time it is finally ready, its relevance will have worn off, and people will have long since went to other games and indie projects with set goals, dedicated teams who want to get the game out and fully released -- not as an alpha, not as a beta, a stable release -- and real drive to fix bugs instead of putting them off.\n\n\n\nHonestly I wish Steam's system of review didn't only have two options: Yes or no. I'd put a "maybe", because really, it depends. Do you want to have a pretty neat indie game within the next year or two, or do you want to have a very ambitious, open world indie game in the next decade or two? Pester, or Investor? Unfortunately since there isn't a neutral option, I have to pick one, and I have to change my review to not recommend it. Most people on Steam interested in indie games and supporting them are hoping to be able to play the game in this decade. I cannot honestly say that this will happen with this game as it is going, and to be honest, what does my review matter to those who disagree and still like it? Regardless of what I say, people who decided they were going to buy it before even seeing my review, are probably still going to buy it, and they will either like their purchase or regret it.\n\n\nIf you want to invest in an indie game that just might be the perfect game we were all looking for, no matter how long it will take to finish, go for it. Realistically.... I've seen what happened to games like Duke Nukem Forever, that take a long time to develop. Ultima 9 was another one. In the end, they lose their relevance, direction, or both. I fear for this game with the bugs it has and how long it's already taken, but I already made the investment, and I will see where it goes. I hope those who are more casual indie gamers or those who want indie games within a certain time will read this and consider at least waiting until it either releases, or gets out of Alpha and in to Beta.","January 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They say they have 30+ members to their team for development.\n\nHowever, once you get past the fan boi's and get some feedback from the Devs, they are active in the forums the updates are coming in slow. I keep picking the game up and playing it, yet the bugs seem to annoy or make me put the game back down. They've spent the last 6 months polishing their experimental version, adding features, removing bugs, adding features, removing bugs but haven't released anything to the stable version which gets frusterating to say the least. Overall gameplay is 7/10, features is 4/10. Potential, 9/10. Frequency of updates 5/10.\n\nIn its current state and future potential, I'm going to give it a thumbs up but if they game slows down in development any more, it may be worth to hold off until they start polishing the game with more frequent updates.\n\nBelow is a response from a Dev/Moderator that I wasn't too fond of, if you have a questions and it can be generically answered by a moderator like below, you may see this again.\n\nOriginally posted by Captain Deathbeard:\nThis is what game development is like:\n-You've got a list of 100 features and 100 bugs.\n-Every time you add a feature, it adds another 50 bugs.\n-Every time you fix 10 bugs, you discover 3 more bugs.\n-Occasionally to fix one of the bugs you might need to totally restructure something. This will probably add 10 more bugs.\n-When you fix bugs people say "These updates don't do anything, where are the features?"\n-When you add features people say "Why aren't you fixing the bugs?"\n","January 16, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Kenshi is a totally unique genre of game, it's a mix of RTS, RPG and Simulation but has the ability to make you feel invested in your own characters due to the random nature of the world. It's still got a while to go before the finish line but with additional content, alot of bug fixes + optimisations and more of the same passion and attention to detail that the Dev has shown so far, i have no doubt that Kenshi could wind up being one of the greatest games ever made. It's a labour of love and it truly shows. In it's current state Kenshi already has enough content to make the purchase worth the money so i whole heartedly recommend picking this game up if you want to support a Dev who's creative direction is a breath of fresh air.\n\nSome suggestions for the Dev in the event he reads this :\n- Add the ability for the camera to aim upwards not just eye level (It would be nice to be able to see up hills and see more of the stars).\n- Add Bo Staffs to the Blunt weapon list when you add it in.\n- The Martial arts skills in the future should be about disarming and disabling your opponents.\n- Animals that act as pack mules for the travelling merchant playstyle would be great.\n- Shields would be a nice addition. Much lower damage output but much higher survivability against groups swarming you.\n-  Bows not just crossbows. Ranged weapons should do low damage but be more likely to cripple limbs and cause bloodloss.\n- Even more weapons, armor for crafting/purchasing ect.\n\nAnyway keep up all the great work and best of luck for the future of Kenshi!","December 12, 2014","true","28.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I have always wanted an in depth strategy game where you can forge a connection to the people in your squad and watch them grow into the certain player you need them to be.  Kenshi is a game that words cannot describe, even in its early stages it is so immense that I cannot begin to fathom trying to cram all of it into one review.  In short, kenshi is definitly a work in progress, but its also one of the most captivating, aggrivationg, emotionally taxing, in depth, fun, and addicting games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.","December 12, 2014","true","63.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Even though it is early access and a lot to be done, even though I still got addicted. I love games that allow you choose your own path and essentially start from the bottom and rise to the top. This game will become amazing once they add more features and implement a few things here and there. So if you are willing to look past bugs and limited features at the moment then this game is a lot of fun and will get you pumped to see how they make the game grow.\n\nIf you like challenging/unforgiving games (similar to Blade & Mount) then this is the game for you. Here I was lone wanderer who got attacked by a very large pack of dogs. Luckily next to a city so once I was unconcious in like 2.5 secs the guards dispatched them like chump change. I layed there (after the guards healed me) for 2 days in a recovery coma. While I figured I could reload the game I was like "eh what the heck" and waited it out. This game will be challenging in the beginning. You definitely don't start out like a power house.\n\nGraphic wise its okay. Nothing great nor terrible.\n\nCharacter leveling, skills, building, and the like are fun but limited at this point in time. I can only imagine as the game gets better and adds more how it will be. You can even customize your companions once they are recruited.\n\nFighting is a lot like MMO's minus all the special abilities. Its point and they fight kind of thing.\n\nAs of now there are no quests but I am sure through time some will be added. As of now its just roam, get money, build, and get companions.","December 14, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Hyperbole maybe but my purpose is to illustrate the difference between the amazing immersion of those great unscripted moments this game supplies you with so often VS. the insignificance of the frustrating ones that occur quite rarely.\n\nIt is currently an imperfect game that is full of perfect moments. The music is right, the vibe is absolutely right, the stripped down no guidance on how to accomplish anything, while perhaps not intended for future builds, feels totally right.  You are dropped in a desolate landscape with bands of wandering thugs and brigands and tasked with figuring out how to survive. Crazy loner in a hut? Start a town with tons of followers? Just wander the waste and scavenge corpses then sell junk to NPCs? Build an armor and weapon crafting factory? Produce and sell weed and rum? All possible and you'll probably do a bit or tons of each.\n\nThe skill system is great as far as im concerned. The more you do something the better you get at said skill. Makes sense. Want to be tougher? Get beat to hell often (and recover hopefully). Want to be quicker? Run around with low encumberance. Stronger? Swing a heavy sword and wear heavy armor. Same system goes for crafting obviously.\n\nThere is zero pre generated story to be had here. If you need Bioware levels of explanation for why you're playing your game then stay away. It's 110% no direction sandbox. If you have a creative mind and sense of adventure and find creating your own backstory and narrative enjoyable then buy it. It's that simple.\n\nDeath will happen but it always feels like my fault when it does. Overconfidince or negligence is usually to blame. That being said, SAVE OFTEN. No "respawns" here. You reload the last save.\n\nPerfect blend of Samurai disciplines and the chaos of Mad Max (sans vehicles). Slow development and occasionally glitchy but I could not care less. I really hope the tiny dev team (couple people I think?) sticks with it. One of my favorite games in recent years.","December 30, 2014","true","80.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Great features and there are more features put into the game nearly every update. The difficulty, believe it or not, is fair but they implimented new features to make it harder or easier if you want more/less of a challenge. Your crew members will eventually die one way or another so you really do need to strategise and make sure you, yourself are 110 % convinced they will live, but that's not always the case. It used to be no sound, 1 squad max of 9 or 10, and only a certain amount you could achieve. Now, however, it is bustling with more squads, more research, tech, buildings, even mounted crossbows on walls to great giant walls. Now like I said it will take you time to achieve the perfect citadel or city but it really is worth the effort. Back bout 2 years ago I wouldn't recommend this game because it just didn't have enough in it to call it, in my opinion, alpha version.\n\nBut now I really think that this version, the alpha at the moment is worth gettiing. There is a very long play time and at the moment near endless possibilities in the game, whether just making a base, or setting impossible goals, you can achieve it.\n\nHowever there are downfalls, (1st) the dev team is still relatively small making big updates slower to come out (however they are covering everything when an update does coe out), (2nd) there are very much so, alot of glitches and the AI path system is alittle stupid and annoying sometimes and the game itself can sometimes crash unexpectedly (3rd) some of the features aren't out yet which really really bugs me because they sound really cool, so there has to be a wait.\n\nOther than that, it really is a brilliant version at the moment and I can't wait for the final release!\n\nHappy Gaming and I hope this review was helpful and pointed you to a good purchase!","June 26, 2015","true","71.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I play many different genres in games, but I've really struggled to find some sort of city builder that gives you freeroam over your city, free choice on how to build, lots of customization, and a city defense aspect.  I've also struggled to find a good squad based game.  The good squad based games I do find, like Company of Heroes 2, are not open world.  I feel like this is the game I've been searching for, as cheesy as it sounds.\n\nThis game has been in development for 4 years now, ouch! - but just because it is considered an early access game doesn't mean it isn't polished.  What you'll find while playing this is fantastic gameplay (better than a lot of AAA games), fantastic soundtracks, fantastic building, fantastic customization, fantastic environment, great AI, confusing UI, and a medium amount of bugs.  It's really cool that the devs also created a modding kit for the game.\n\nThis game is a gem that not many people know about.  To give you and idea on what it is, watch these:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E-hpL29Egw -- Starting out\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4SrUMWGTU -- Mid Game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIrIgdK0ddk -- The Power of Modding\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1eIujt8lBw -- Combat and Atmosphere\n\nI do want to address some negative reviews to enlighten people on the negative parts of the game, and some flat out lies.  The fact that this game has been in development for 4 years is not a good thing.  Although the studio has less than 10 people working on the game.  I remember about 3 or so years ago they wanted people to email them atmospheric music for the game with royalties.  It does feel like a good game in the end, but it isn't quite there yet to be considered the game they promised.\nThis game has trivial updates.  This is true in some aspects, but not completely.  The amount of updates put out is a large number and each update adds something that they have promised.  Compared to some other small studios, the amount of updates isn't impressive.\nThis game is not immersive.  Pffffft.  I bet you would say that The Walking Dead (game) isn't immersive too.  Some reviews are blatant lies.\nCrashes and bugs out 70% of the time.  In the 20 hours I have played, I havent crashed at all or witnessed any game breaking bugs.  If you do decide to use some experimental tools, like the freebuilding (different than the standard building) mode, you're going to get bugs.  I tried out the freebuilding mode, which lets you place buildings without any cost, and my squad decided to turn on each other.\nThere is no reason not to play on a faster timescale, it's like watching simulator 2015.  What would you expect in a city builder?  Have you played Banished, Cities Skylines, or Dawn of Discovery?  Actually, have you ever played a city builder?  The game is about progression, not having everything handed to you in the first hour.  Whoever said this also doesn't understand there are other aspects to the game than just building.\n\nI hope this helped anyone wanting to buy the game.\n\nThanks for reading!","July 21, 2015","true","27.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

The development of the game is going at the pace to be expected for such a small team. It is an ambtious project and I am confident they can pull it off.\n\nI started as a loner in the game, forced to run for my life from town to town. Now my tribes have settled the deserts across the map. Communities of individuals capable of labor and battle. With the introduction of a slaver faction, I have taken to roaming the lands for would-be captors. Narratives will be developed from each gamer's playthrough. My point being that a story-weaving gamer will likely take great enjoyment from this game in its current state.\n\nThe game is about to undergo a major overhaul, with new biomes, an expansion of fauna varieties, and improved faction AI. At the time of this posting, there still remain pathing issues with gates and a host of bugs which are being addressed. Please keep in mind the subsequent pro/con list below is subject to adjustments as development continues.\n\n+ Great building system and tech tree that continues to expand\n+ Unit organization permits efficient distribution of tasks over many isolated towns and forts\n+ High interactivity with those around you\n+ Gameplay that encourages treating your community as your greatest resource\n+ Open styled gameplay, I have some characters that run shops in cities while others hunt slavers. Militarism is not essential to succeed.\n\n- Still in development, lacking much landscape and biological diversity\n-"                              ", pathing system can be annoying, along with numerous bugs\n-"                               ", as much as there are many achievements to seek in a new game, content becomes limited after 15-20 hours\n\nThis is not a game for people who are looking for a finished product soon. Nor is it suitable for folk who want fast results and progress. This is a game of protracted events and would only keep the attention of gamers with such sensibilities. When I want a high-paced action experience I don't pick this up.\n\nThis is a game for individuals who want to see the progress of a well-made game through its evolution, unlike some other early access titles. It's suitable for gamers who like to dabble with genres of RPG, town builders, and RTS. If you are on the fence about its development I would wait, but holy scat if you're looking for a great game to enjoy in its growth this is the best early access title I've supported!!\n","June 17, 2015","true","115.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But, there are regular updates, mainly bugfixes, so it's not abandoned, and frankly I managed to put more hours in it than in most full, officially released games from big companies. I could not pinpoint why this game appeals to me so, but I think the main reason is that you can build your own town with fifty inhabitants (at least currently), which is more than most of the ingame towns can muster. Furthermore I like the combat, because it feels like combat, and most importantly you don't have to don the heaviest armor to stand a chance. Well, until you get 10-12 points in attack/defense you will bleed a lot, that's for sure, but after that you can hold your own in battle even in Adam's (or Eve's) costume. So, mainly it's the skill of the characters that counts, not their gear, which is the the contrary - fortunately - to most of other RPGs. Of course being well armored helps, but not a necessity.\n\nI'm really curious what the game will look like when it will eventually be finished. Until then it still looks like it's a safe bet to buy it, and support the developers.","June 22, 2015","true","258.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This is going to be one of those games you'll never stop playing.","May 17, 2014","true","124.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That said, it is in a much better state than most games these days and definitely worth buying or getting the demo if you're into squad-based strategy/RPGs. Can be frustrating at times, such as when bandits or wildlife trap you in your own home with no escape, but overall its a fun game!\n\nCan't wait to see more updates and more interesting features!","January 20, 2015","true","67.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That combined with the cool setting and also-innovative body customization sold me on the game.

At least in the beginning anyway. Once you've got your character toughened up and some production going it gets a little monotonous and you end up trying a different set of start settings.\n- There's plenty of room for the players imagination. Whilst all of the features aren't there yet, give yourself a bit of a backstory and there's plenty to do.\n\nCons:\n- As with any alpha, it's full of bugs, including numerous CTDs. I would not recommend playing it on a 32 bit system as it has loads of caching and memory issues.\n- Here's the big one, appalling development team. Their site states that they've fixed things that are still broken, they refuse to give a timeline on any development, and the development progress is so slow it's unbelievable. I don't know if they can't really be bothered with it, if it's a hobby project or something else but they definately do not seem to be taking it seriously. It's a shame really, since what they have planned could really prove to be something truely fantastic.","February 6, 2015","true","38.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For those familiar with the Mount & Blade games, Runescape or perhaps Minecraft, there are similarities to be had here.\n\nThe game dumps you into its world with very little, and from there it is up to you. You can travel alone or start recruiting hirelings to accompany you. You can start building up your own little town, producing goods and trading, or you could go bounty hunting.\n\nConsidering it is unfinished, at time of writing Kenshi probably lacks a bit of depth to its features - there arent that many viable "endgame" options for what to actually do, but its got definite potential and if you are a fan of the genre, its worth a try.","January 3, 2015","true","75.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its quite an open sandbox, and has plenty of gameplay, presently, but is also heavily in development. I actually got in much, much earlier than the steam release, and it was an awesome game even then. I look forward to the improvements in the future. This is very, very much the sort of game I was hoping would be made. More and more games now get released with a pretty limited scope with some polish. This game goes with a huge scope, expanding as development progresses, and polishes as it goes. The graphical differences from the early release to now are already rather dramatic.\n\nSeriously, I can't say how stoked I am to play the final product, feature complete.\n\nIf you are on the fence at all about getting this game, jump that fence and buy this game yesterday.

Or an outpost for trading. Become farmers, miners, a lot of things. You make your story and its all non-linear. Perma-death for all characters. The only way to lose is all your characters die not just the main one you start with. Or team. You can start the game with multiple characters who you can all customize to your liking. And the customization options for this game are incredible. I mean really incredible! You can change the way your characters look at any time when you hire new ones and as long as you find a plastic surgeon in a tavern in villages or cities you find and go to for the older ones. Hire as many people as you want. Right now the current stable version you can only have 20 but the final release you can have insane amounts. Train, learn, capture people, take down people with samurai swords, die from wounds loose limbs, get eaten by cannibals. Save people, help others, lay waste to towns, become bandits. Really the choice is yours.\n\nThe end game of what it may look like is close to the game series Zeno Clash. The Animals they are putting in the game resemble much of the animal life that is in those games and I love it!

The pathing system still has bugs, and often times you will find people with assigned jobs stuck against something, or trying to interact with an object inside a building from the outside. I have had the game for well over a year and while updates do come out more often now (usually once every month or every two months), they still have yet to resolve really important game play issues.\n\nI do however encourage you to purchase the game, as a fun way to pass the time inbetween games with actual story content and substance (this game currently lacks any), as the base building is fun and watching your people mow down starving bandits with turrets, who just want to attack and not steal your food, which totally refutes their name of "starving bandits".\n\nTo sum it all up, they have some really lofty goals for the game, and if they come through with them, it will be an amazing purchase. If not you will at least have a base building game where you randomly get zerged by bandit/creature patrol, so if you are into being punished with no reward, it is definitely for you.","June 21, 2015","true","260.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is buggy, but not to the point of serious irritation.  Mostly it has to do with minor pathing issues.  I have not found another game like this one.  It is a cross between an rpg, an rts, and sandbox/crafting game.  Not sure which element I like more, but one thing is certain: the game is challenging.  Always.  There is not really a point where you rest on your laurels and say, "Well this is easy now."  Every new success provides the user with a new challenge.  Most of all, it is fun.  I highly recommend playing the "experimental Beta" rather than the more stable version of the game.  It is absolutely worth the money.","May 29, 2015","true","58.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is truly one of the handful of games I am interested in and has a charm that I find hard to describe.\n\nI suppose I am attracted to the game because the developer made it so you are not a special snowflake in this game, you are a normal person or group of people with no special powers or abilities with the only difference from your characters and the games NPCs being your drive for success in whatever path you chose.\n\nAny skills have to be earned and only through trial and error. You will be beaten down, your goods and clothing stolen, you will limp back with broken bones to whatever you consider safety, and then try again only to fail.\nWith each failure you gain experiance though and eventually you will be able to eke out a living on scraps and eventually maybe even make an outpost that could blossum into a metropolis you run, another city on the ever growing map with a whole new diplomatic game to consider. Or just be a lone wanderer trying to survive, making your own story among the sand dunes.\n\nPossibly a true sandbox game when it eventually finishes...\n\n+ Developer is not only active but also has an interesting personality/beard.\n+ Constant updates\n+ Fresh kind of gameplay\n+ Future plans look bright and, more importantly, actually going to happen.\n\n- Very Glitchy, many crashes, texture issues, shadow problems, characters getting stuck, etc (Alpha problems)\n- Slow to add new content but understandable as they are focusing on getting the game more stable.\n- General "Alpha"ness that will go away with time\n\nI highly recommend this game even on its current merits.

I originate from the Village of Fisher. It is a small remote farming villiage. Me and the only four people I trust, Weke, Gardener, Fuujin and Nikon had decided we were tired of living here just scrapping by and not having anything to our name. On the day we had decided to set out on our adventure, our Village had come under siege by Starving Bandits. We had already set out and when we heard the chaos, we turned away and didn't look back. We had made up our minds about what to do next, and it isn't like we could have helped the poor villagers. We weren't warriors.\n\nWe walked for days in the desert Cliffs and Valleys, and we happened to stumble upon a city. Catiun they called it.

This game is not done by a long shot so I have had glitches and errors playing this game. Also there are several aspects that I hope will be added later to make this game better. So if you will just find fault in a game that is not done I would wait and buy when it is closer to completion.\n\nThat being said I think this game is fun an different from a lot of other games out there. It does have a steep learning curve because it does not have an in game tutorial so you have to either look online or fiddle around in the game your self. This game is also not a fast pace game. It takes a long time to make your character powerful. I have seen youtube videos of people sending a solo character into a cannibal camp with about 30 or 40 cannicals and winning. I can only guess at how many hours that took them or what tricks they found to power build. starting off you cannot even fight one guy alone it seems. you will hug the cities and bring bandits to the city guards to fight and help them out. if you are willing to put in a bit of time this can be a very fun game.","July 19, 2014","true","137.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I originate from the Village of Fisher. It is a small remote farming villiage. Me and the only four people I trust, Weke, Gardener, Fuujin and Nikon had decided we were tired of living here just scrapping by and not having anything to our name. On the day we had decided to set out on our adventure, our Village had come under siege by Starving Bandits. We had already set out and when we heard the chaos, we turned away and didn't look back. We had made up our minds about what to do next, and it isn't like we could have helped the poor villagers.

I've never played a game where I had my character minding his own business, brewing rum, when all of a sudden... BAM! cannibals raid my town and knock me out. When I wake up I was in their camp and I was on the menu. This was obviously unacceptable, so I had to pick the lock, break out of the cannibal camp, and make it home safely! It's like the game makes it's own story as you play it! The more you throw youself into, the more the game gives back!\nalthough between moments like these, such as power leveling and scraping up some extra cash the "safe" way, may not be as intense, They are also fun in their own right. the game can switch back and fourth from city simulation, to an adventure/combat game, then back to a shop simulator in a few in-game days. It really keeps you on your toes and blends together seamlessly.\nI highly recommend to anyone who has some free time and likes some hard-won battles with whatever comes their way!","February 13, 2014","true","224.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Kenshi is the most legitimate alpha I have seen in years. It's buggy, there are serious AI problems, crashes are common, and some stats aren't even implemented yet, but the UI still has them included as if it's some lingering reminder to the devs to complete them at some point.\n\nWhen you buy Kenshi you get a game that is still clearly under developed and not even at the stage where "polishing" is a thought, but it's got a lot of promise in it. It's almost reminiscent of Dwarf Fortress in terms of the depth of some of the things you can do. The thing that stops it from being actually comparable to Dwarf Fortresses absolute freedom is that most mechanics aren't fully implemented. The cannibal faction uses weapons that will ensure targets don't die, that way they can carry them to their encampment and put them in a jail cell. But that's where the cannibals threatening and unique actions stop. It's real hard to compare this game to something like Dwarf Fortress when there are a lot of similar mechanics, like base building and crafting, that just stop half way to completion. There are lots of mechanics that have a lot of promise but still have to actually be developed.\n\nIf you like the direction Kenshi is moving in, think about supporting it and buying it. You're unlikely to find another game that will do things like Kenshi does, so don't try to stall on supporting Lo-Fi otherwise you might never get a similar game.\n\nIf you're expecting a finished game, look elsewhere. If you want something a little different, wait off on buying it, hope that development goes smoothly and that some mods come out for whatever you want changed.","February 13, 2014","true","113.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've already recruited a group and built an outpost. We make weapons and armor, which I sell in my outpost or take to other towns to trade. I've slowly built up my group to be adept in combat, so now we can fight off the bandits that attempt to raid our settlement rather than running to the nearest city guard for help.\n\nI usually can't get into pure sandbox games...without a story telling me what to do I tend to feel overwhelmed and lost. Kenshi offers more gameplay options than anything else I've ever played, but there's plenty that you can do to progress the game, even though there isn't a story driving you to do X for Y.\n\nI've built my own outpost and fortified it. I mine my own resources, make my own food, and craft my own clothing, weapons, and armor. I struggled to survive at first, but now my faction is thriving. It's a tough game at first. You aren't special. You're not a hero. Any lowly bandit could easily murder you when you start the game. But you learn to survive until you become skilled enough to defend yourself.

Kenshi is a open world action-strategy hybrid where you control one unit at the start, a character that you can gain stats with by doing natural things like running, attacking and carrying lots of weight. Sadly, it seems the game is rather barren on the 'quest' and 'story' aspects, there being pretty much nothing to do with friendly NPC's in cities besides buying supplies, getting new companions or straight up killing everybody. I am not one of those RPG 'purists' that absolutely need a story but the issue here is that as of February 14th, 2014 there is essentially no content for the player besides looking around for bandits to kill and building a base.\n\nAll of this would be fine if the games combat system worked, which it does but its painfully simply. You click on your guy and you click on your enemy and whoever has the best stats win ( Most likely your opponent at the start considering that they are pretty much always better then your character stat wise. ) There are a few unique quirks to combat like picking up wounded enemies and healing them back to health after a battle which most games dont do and I personally had the most fun doing.\n\nOverall, as of right now I dont feel like the game is worth playing but I feel like it is a good investment for the future.","February 14, 2014","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I've never played a game where I had my character minding his own business, brewing rum, when all of a sudden... BAM! cannibals raid my town and knock me out. When I wake up I was in their camp and I was on the menu. This was obviously unacceptable, so I had to pick the lock, break out of the cannibal camp, and make it home safely! It's like the game makes it's own story as you play it! The more you throw youself into, the more the game gives back!\nalthough between moments like these, such as power leveling and scraping up some extra cash the "safe" way, may not be as intense, They are also fun in their own right. the game can switch back and fourth from city simulation, to an adventure/combat game, then back to a shop simulator in a few in-game days. It really keeps you on your toes and blends together seamlessly.\nI highly recommend to anyone who has some free time and likes some hard-won battles with whatever comes their way!","February 13, 2014","true","224.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Kenshi is the most legitimate alpha I have seen in years. It's buggy, there are serious AI problems, crashes are common, and some stats aren't even implemented yet, but the UI still has them included as if it's some lingering reminder to the devs to complete them at some point.\n\nWhen you buy Kenshi you get a game that is still clearly under developed and not even at the stage where "polishing" is a thought, but it's got a lot of promise in it. It's almost reminiscent of Dwarf Fortress in terms of the depth of some of the things you can do. The thing that stops it from being actually comparable to Dwarf Fortresses absolute freedom is that most mechanics aren't fully implemented. The cannibal faction uses weapons that will ensure targets don't die, that way they can carry them to their encampment and put them in a jail cell. But that's where the cannibals threatening and unique actions stop. It's real hard to compare this game to something like Dwarf Fortress when there are a lot of similar mechanics, like base building and crafting, that just stop half way to completion. There are lots of mechanics that have a lot of promise but still have to actually be developed.\n\nIf you like the direction Kenshi is moving in, think about supporting it and buying it. You're unlikely to find another game that will do things like Kenshi does, so don't try to stall on supporting Lo-Fi otherwise you might never get a similar game.\n\nIf you're expecting a finished game, look elsewhere. If you want something a little different, wait off on buying it, hope that development goes smoothly and that some mods come out for whatever you want changed.","February 13, 2014","true","113.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've already recruited a group and built an outpost. We make weapons and armor, which I sell in my outpost or take to other towns to trade. I've slowly built up my group to be adept in combat, so now we can fight off the bandits that attempt to raid our settlement rather than running to the nearest city guard for help.\n\nI usually can't get into pure sandbox games...without a story telling me what to do I tend to feel overwhelmed and lost. Kenshi offers more gameplay options than anything else I've ever played, but there's plenty that you can do to progress the game, even though there isn't a story driving you to do X for Y.\n\nI've built my own outpost and fortified it. I mine my own resources, make my own food, and craft my own clothing, weapons, and armor. I struggled to survive at first, but now my faction is thriving. It's a tough game at first. You aren't special. You're not a hero. Any lowly bandit could easily murder you when you start the game. But you learn to survive until you become skilled enough to defend yourself. The initial difficulty may be a turn-off for some, but it makes everything about the game so much more rewarding.","February 13, 2014","true","55.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Kenshi is a open world action-strategy hybrid where you control one unit at the start, a character that you can gain stats with by doing natural things like running, attacking and carrying lots of weight. Sadly, it seems the game is rather barren on the 'quest' and 'story' aspects, there being pretty much nothing to do with friendly NPC's in cities besides buying supplies, getting new companions or straight up killing everybody. I am not one of those RPG 'purists' that absolutely need a story but the issue here is that as of February 14th, 2014 there is essentially no content for the player besides looking around for bandits to kill and building a base.\n\nAll of this would be fine if the games combat system worked, which it does but its painfully simply. You click on your guy and you click on your enemy and whoever has the best stats win ( Most likely your opponent at the start considering that they are pretty much always better then your character stat wise. ) There are a few unique quirks to combat like picking up wounded enemies and healing them back to health after a battle which most games dont do and I personally had the most fun doing.\n\nOverall, as of right now I dont feel like the game is worth playing but I feel like it is a good investment for the future.","February 14, 2014","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I originate from the Village of Fisher. It is a small remote farming villiage. Me and the only four people I trust, Weke, Gardener, Fuujin and Nikon had decided we were tired of living here just scrapping by and not having anything to our name. On the day we had decided to set out on our adventure, our Village had come under siege by Starving Bandits. We had already set out and when we heard the chaos, we turned away and didn't look back. We had made up our minds about what to do next, and it isn't like we could have helped the poor villagers. We weren't warriors.\n\nWe walked for days in the desert Cliffs and Valleys, and we happened to stumble upon a city. Catiun they called it. We decided to stay there for a while and gather our bearrings. We heard a local Policemen mention a group of bandits one day that sounded like the ones who attacked our villiage. So we decided that we would draw them out of  hiding, still unarmed this would be a challenge if we were to  be attacked.\n\nWe scouted for days and then we finally stumbled accross the bandits. We ran for what felt like weeks luring them closer and closer to Catiun. Once we had reached the city, Weke the one who could run the fastest, ran to the guards and alerted them to the bandits presense. The guards quickly dispatched these thugs, and our Village had been avenged. Still....it wasnt Enough. We looted these bandits, used what ever gear we knew how to, and sold the rest. We became bounty hunters for a time. Killing bandits and collecting gold on their heads.\n\nWe eventually Saved up enough money to buy some building meterials. Thats when we all set out to make our own place to call home. Along the way we met a Girl named Rin. She dawned a Karate Gi, and used a very old rusty Katanna, and when asked about it she changed the subject. I sense a story here. We also met two Builders, Set and his son Blend. They agreed to join our cause in agreement to living in our villiage. We had also stumbled across a man nearly starved to death in the desert canyons named Feck. He joined us as well.\n\nWe made our way to  the Top of a Platue where we set up our outpost for the time being. We had not yet decided on a name, though we were happy about the location due to the long hike and it was hidden atop a platue above the desert cliffs. Only one way in, which made it easy to defend, or so we thought.\n\nAfter a week we had a stone mine up and running, we have now two houses and we have a farm with a wind generator. We thought things were going great, even had a well outside of the villiage a short ways. That was our mistake. A group of Sand Ninjas and Bandits had come into contact with each other, not far from our well. They Seveirly Injuried Weke and he managed to get back to the Villiage, however so did they.\n\nWe managed to hold them off, mostly due to their in fighting, and Rin was quite skilled with her Katana. Luckily we only had 3 injuries, Weke, Gardener and Set were beridden for days. Now we look to the future, what is next? how can we further our villiage, are our walls enough? That is the story of Toukanai Villiage Thus far."","December 11, 2014","true","26.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It takes a long time to make your character powerful. I have seen youtube videos of people sending a solo character into a cannibal camp with about 30 or 40 cannicals and winning. I can only guess at how many hours that took them or what tricks they found to power build. starting off you cannot even fight one guy alone it seems. you will hug the cities and bring bandits to the city guards to fight and help them out. if you are willing to put in a bit of time this can be a very fun game.","July 19, 2014","true","137.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For every interesting and original concept, there are 1000 copycats who bore the living bejesus out of me, copying Warcraft or Skyrim, or some other AAA lawyer approved crud. The beancounters control what gets made, which is sad.\n\nKENSHI is not like that. It's concepts are bold and daring, and the game is for the creative player who truly wants a sandbox without rules or carrots or narrow path pretending to be free choice.\n\nWhat makes KENSHI so interesting is it's complete freedom to choose whatever role you want, whatever cardinal direction you wish to explore, and it's emphasis on a more realistic combat/character.\n\nThere is no being superman or a supreme hero in KENSHI. Expect to have your ♥♥♥ handed to you, and often, The game requires both patience and brains, which, frankly, is liable to hurt sales and frustrate the less gifted gamers out there who are accustomed to the likes of SKYRIM's mindless carrot following uber-viking nonsense.\n\nIf you want to actually succeed in KENSHI, man, you GOTTA EARN IT.\n\nThe game is tough and uncompromising, and the life of a swordsman is a brutal lesson in picking your fights, knowing when to run, and being smart enough to not succumb to greed and carry too much goods on you at once.\n\nYou need to save your money, invest in comrades in arms, and constantly, slowly, train yourself to kick ♥♥♥. That is what this game is all about, and it is almost umatchable in rewarding the player who works hard- you really feel like you earned the bad ♥♥♥ skills, once you acquire them.\n\nWhle the game is still unpolished in looks, the basic ideas are here, and I love this game.\n\nThings I would like to see added-\n\n1. Formations. It's too hard to keep your tough fighters out front and your workers behind you. I'm sure it's coming, but the need for good strategic preperation before a battle in marching orders needs to be a priority.\n\n2. More "home" decorations/furniture, etc. Home is as inportant as adventuring and exploring. Few games remember and acknowledge this. The more home feels like home in Kenshi,  the more real the characters we play will seem.\n\n3. More variety in city shops. Currently most towns feel all about the same. Each town needs one focus that makes it seem unique, in my opinion.\n\n4. More combat variety to add some uniqueness to our characters styles- dual wielding, sneaking and backstabbing, missle weapons and maybe some shields and polearms would go a long way towards turning Kenshi into a good game with fantastic concepts into a fantastic game.\n\nBut, really, KENSHI is the best new game I have played this year, mostly due to it's approach- it allows that true sandbox freedom so many other games asprie towards, but fail to achieve, and it keeps the difficulty bar set on high- making success all the more challenging and wonderful when you get there!\n\nI'd give this an 8 of 10, with 10 being well within range of achievement, with more polish and details.","August 13, 2014","true","44.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've never played a game where I had my character minding his own business, brewing rum, when all of a sudden... BAM! cannibals raid my town and knock me out. When I wake up I was in their camp and I was on the menu. This was obviously unacceptable, so I had to pick the lock, break out of the cannibal camp, and make it home safely! It's like the game makes it's own story as you play it! The more you throw youself into, the more the game gives back!\nalthough between moments like these, such as power leveling and scraping up some extra cash the "safe" way, may not be as intense, They are also fun in their own right. the game can switch back and fourth from city simulation, to an adventure/combat game, then back to a shop simulator in a few in-game days. It really keeps you on your toes and blends together seamlessly.\nI highly recommend to anyone who has some free time and likes some hard-won battles with whatever comes their way!","February 13, 2014","true","224.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Kenshi is the most legitimate alpha I have seen in years. It's buggy, there are serious AI problems, crashes are common, and some stats aren't even implemented yet, but the UI still has them included as if it's some lingering reminder to the devs to complete them at some point.\n\nWhen you buy Kenshi you get a game that is still clearly under developed and not even at the stage where "polishing" is a thought, but it's got a lot of promise in it. It's almost reminiscent of Dwarf Fortress in terms of the depth of some of the things you can do. The thing that stops it from being actually comparable to Dwarf Fortresses absolute freedom is that most mechanics aren't fully implemented. The cannibal faction uses weapons that will ensure targets don't die, that way they can carry them to their encampment and put them in a jail cell. But that's where the cannibals threatening and unique actions stop. It's real hard to compare this game to something like Dwarf Fortress when there are a lot of similar mechanics, like base building and crafting, that just stop half way to completion. There are lots of mechanics that have a lot of promise but still have to actually be developed.\n\nIf you like the direction Kenshi is moving in, think about supporting it and buying it. You're unlikely to find another game that will do things like Kenshi does, so don't try to stall on supporting Lo-Fi otherwise you might never get a similar game.\n\nIf you're expecting a finished game, look elsewhere. If you want something a little different, wait off on buying it, hope that development goes smoothly and that some mods come out for whatever you want changed.","February 13, 2014","true","113.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've already recruited a group and built an outpost. We make weapons and armor, which I sell in my outpost or take to other towns to trade. I've slowly built up my group to be adept in combat, so now we can fight off the bandits that attempt to raid our settlement rather than running to the nearest city guard for help.\n\nI usually can't get into pure sandbox games...without a story telling me what to do I tend to feel overwhelmed and lost. Kenshi offers more gameplay options than anything else I've ever played, but there's plenty that you can do to progress the game, even though there isn't a story driving you to do X for Y.\n\nI've built my own outpost and fortified it. I mine my own resources, make my own food, and craft my own clothing, weapons, and armor. I struggled to survive at first, but now my faction is thriving. It's a tough game at first. You aren't special. You're not a hero. Any lowly bandit could easily murder you when you start the game. But you learn to survive until you become skilled enough to defend yourself.

Kenshi is a open world action-strategy hybrid where you control one unit at the start, a character that you can gain stats with by doing natural things like running, attacking and carrying lots of weight. Sadly, it seems the game is rather barren on the 'quest' and 'story' aspects, there being pretty much nothing to do with friendly NPC's in cities besides buying supplies, getting new companions or straight up killing everybody. I am not one of those RPG 'purists' that absolutely need a story but the issue here is that as of February 14th, 2014 there is essentially no content for the player besides looking around for bandits to kill and building a base.\n\nAll of this would be fine if the games combat system worked, which it does but its painfully simply. You click on your guy and you click on your enemy and whoever has the best stats win ( Most likely your opponent at the start considering that they are pretty much always better then your character stat wise. ) There are a few unique quirks to combat like picking up wounded enemies and healing them back to health after a battle which most games dont do and I personally had the most fun doing.\n\nOverall, as of right now I dont feel like the game is worth playing but I feel like it is a good investment for the future.","February 14, 2014","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The ability to disappear into the roles of trader, warrior, town mayor or even just sightseer is the best part because you can do them all at once!

I have had unbelievable amounts of fun playing the game and have tried a few of the many ways you can play through the game, first I was a farmer, then a bandits, and now I command a small elite group of bounty hunters. The leveling system is beautiful and the range of weapons and fighting compliment each other amazingly.

Unlike almost EVERY game you are not the hero or best person, Kenshi makes you work hard for your place in their world.\n2. The combat in the game is very grind intersive, the more you fight and land hits and block the better you become at combat.\n3. For how little is majorly new in this game they're is a lot of content to wait for while they go to add a lot of content out of nowhere, suck as base building upgraded, animals, major dialouge, and even stealth.\nCONS..........\n1. A few bugs with hit boxes(not a major problem)\n2. Maybe a little hard for people to learn.\n3. Money is a little hard to come by.\n4. You have to rely on npc to be able to fight and get skill early, (but combat is fun later).\n\nOverall this game is very fun and has a great concept that I can't wait for until it is done.\n9 out of 10","November 29, 2014","true","85.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also when i itry to let the workers work on  a building in the corner, the person will just run to the gate and open it for no reason so fix this.

It's very fun and addictive. I've always been a fan of the free roaming RPG games that don't need or have a story, but instead give you this playground to make your own story and adventure. Set your own goals then achieve them. This is that game easily, even in it's current alpha state (Alpha 0.64). It has a small learning curve and just a few youtube videos will show you around the game quickly, but this game is tough which I think adds to the "started from the bottom, rags to riches" type of thing that games such as GTA, Sims series, and Saints Row, etc have all done, and once you can take on bandits or better it gives you a very satisfying feeling of accomplishment. Even more so when you build your base and eventually make a ton of money trading, then have your group strapped and armed to the teeth! I definitly support this game and feel I got my moneys worth when I bought it. I look forward to see where this game goes in the future.","March 22, 2014","true","68.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not much content yet to keep you occupied for hours on end but it is getting there and fast, the game is growing in size all the time (new buildings,characters,factions and features all the time). Starting the game you will immediatly notice that the difficulty is off the charts, but that is the main goal of the game. You will quickly see your squad of 7 or os people that always lose and get beaten up by bandits turn slowly into one man armies holding up against hordes of enemies and your little settlement that started from a single shack and a mine become a thriving town with automated mines and bustling industry.And that brings us to the base building,this shows the most promise in the entire game.You can make a fortress or a simple outpost,or whatever you wish almost anywhere you wish, unfortunately the faction system is not yet implemented but when it does it is bound to be awesome. I have really high hopes and expectations from this game and as hard as it can be at times it always rewards you with a sense of achievement when your characters get off the sand,stand up dust themselves off and keep on fighting.","June 22, 2015","true","267.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of my first GL games, I loved the idea, the setting, and the core mechanics.  And while development seems to have been taking FOREVER (seriously, it's been in my library for over 2 years or so) it's actually been progressing very quickly, I'm just impatient.\n\nTL;DR\n\nVery realistic approach to an RPG game.  Nice open sandbox elements (done well so far), good combat elements that are in need of some slight refining but are otherwise well thoughtout and implemented, and the possibility to build your own bases/towns to form your own "faction" is great.\n\nPros:\n+Everything?  Seriously, there are so many elements to this game it would be impossible to list them in the limit that Steam puts on reviews.\n+Music is good, not great, but immersive enough that it doesn't distract\n+Graphics are good, nothing AAA here, but the rest is so well done who the hell cares?\n+Gameplay: so without being able to go into too much detail because there's not enough room, they've done a great job with the entire concept of "play how you want" within the confines of the game and it's world.  Theivery, trading, combat, research and technology (which goes along with), base building, and the FIGHTING!!!!\n+Combat is good, since it's still in beta, I'm hoping they refine a few things that are buggy/problematic (Yes, stagger, I mean you, you annoying ♥♥♥♥♥!).\n\nCons:\n-Still buggy, lots of crashing issues (still a beta so this is hardly a complaint, just a problem that in it's current state may detract from some people's enjoyment\n-UI is a little odd, in that it doesn't fit the game's aesthetics, but it's far from awful\n-Load times! But they're still working on optimising the game, so another item that will hopefully fall off the list (but needs to be stated for anyone currently looking at the title)\n-Some combat elements (staggering is a HUGE problem IMO), though this is purely an OPINION on the current balance they have for the game that I feel doesn't fit to well\n\nIn-Depth:\nSo I can't fit it all in here, there's so many good things to say about this game, but it's a great title.  They really took the whole sandbox combat RPG thing and just created something so spectacular.  You can almost literally do whatever you want.  Seriously.  The way things are done is super realistic (as much as you can in a game like this, anyways), from combat, to research and base building, to farming and trading, right down to the injuries people sustain and how it affects their movements!  You'll limp with a busted up leg, or cradle that beaten up arm, or hold your head so your brains don't fall out from that gaping hole you just got!  Ok, not THAT detailed, but you hold your head when it's injured!  That level of detail is downright impressive from even a AAA title!\n\nThis team has done some really amazing work, and they deserve some major props, praise and a whole lot of cats... er, I mean cash!  I can't wait to see this game finished, polished, and then what they come up with next!","April 15","true","88.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I chose to build it somewhat close to a dogs den on a hill, next to the mountain because it looked like a defensible location. I thought it was far enough from the dog's aggro range.\n\nI was wrong. Day after day, dogs practically rushed up the hill and murdered my squad in their sleep. Sometimes, it rained dogs on top of my squad member's heads. One @#$%ing dog could completely destroy my whole squad, even with some  members clad in heavy plate armor. Just to build a well, they even had to go on stealth mode for fear of alerting the dogs.\n\nAfter constant fighting and brushes with death, my squad members survived and grew stronger. There were times when I had them running up the hill with huge backpacks packed with heavy ores, concrete bricks and water buckets just to train their strength.\n\nEventually, I had at least 3 warriors on par with a samurai lord, and could solo sweep the entire murderous dog's den on their own. I was unrivalled across much of the land of Kenshi, and even won a battle with an entire city's worth of "policemen". Good times.\n\nBased on past experiences, I recommend building your base next to a monster spawn.","December 22, 2015","true","172.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","1","3","0"

Tried to fight them, got rekt. Squad enclosed in a cage for 2 days. Managed to lock pick my way out while the cannibals are fighting giant ostrichs in the North and Starving Bandits in the South.\n\nSome other dudes were in cages too, I helped them get out and in return they helped us fight the remaining cannibals in the camp.\n\nI managed to kill 30 cannibals with a 5 man squads, slowly but surely, just for the purpose of training them.\n\nCleared out the area, times to move on . My squad is slow, most of them are badly hurt, one of them is KO, I need to carry him to the nearest town which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing far away. I can't run, it's going to be a difficult trip.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat's just an exemple of what is happening in Kenshi. The developpers builded a very unique universe and gameplay. If you want an original and quite hardcore experience in a game Kenshi is what you need.\n\nThere is no goal, you might want to build a base, create a huge army with 4 squads of 10 mens, get some backpack and travel around the map to trade goods, etc.\n\nStarting in Kenshi is pretty slow and you might want to go for the "Freedom Seekers" start which gives you a decent sized squad and a bunch of building materials to start a base.\n\nThe developpers are working hard on a Beta release that should be happening end of March (probably April tbh) with a better map and a bunch of content.\n\nRight now the game is buggy and crash a lot, hopefully we will see some improvement after the Beta release when they start working on fixing everything.\n\nI suggest anyone to give a try. Keep in mind that you'll have a hard time when starting. You should try to bait enemies in cities to get the help of the Police (which is OP) when training your squad to fight.\n\nAlso you'll need beds to recover quicker, but you won't have any money at first to make them or rent them in town, one way of going around this problem is to pick up your allys and put them in the hotel's beds in town, you won't get charged for the bed if you do so.\n\ntl;dr\nGreat game, lot of potential, already a good amount of content.

Since my purchase of it, it has been updated, patched onto and received many additions. That, however, does not make it complete, or stable.\n\nWhat are you getting right now?\n\nThe game is a survival sandbox-rpg where you command a squad of people with different skills and attributes, you can build in a vast, albeit a bit empty (a new map is coming, so... not an issue), desert land; mine; trade; hunt for bandits, for trade caravans; research and manufacture an assortment of products, from food, to booze, to katanas, to chain mail.\n\nThere are several cities and settlements, a couple of factions, ranging from bandits to the holy nation, to cannibals, and slavers.\n\nAs it is, the game is filled with half implemented features, grayed-out options, bugs and optimization issues and, basically, room for improvement.\n\nIt also comes with a lot of things to do, from building a fort, to making a ton of money from trade, to beating the ever living crap out a bandit boss who wanted to threaten you and sticking him in a cage, only to then hand him in to some samurai police dude.\n\ntldr\n\nThe game is not ready, but has been being updated, and, overall, has improved since my acquisition of it. In addition, it is great fun to have such a degree of freedom in a game, and I have full confidence in the developers and their commitment to their product, which is key to an early access game.\n\nIf anything, the year and a half I've had with this game taught me that regardless of the goals the devs set themselves, they seem quite capable of achieving it, should you give them time.","December 29, 2015","true","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No quest line, no objectives, your only job is to survive. It's also nice that you don't start the game as some kind of "chosen one" the fact that you have to build yourself up from the bottom is what makes this game so satisfying.

I eagery wait for the game's full release.\n\nIf you want a game that doesn't hold your hand, that gives you total freedom to do whatever you want, I totally recomend this game.","December 6, 2015","true","65.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Boom, Kenshi marriage just happened!\n\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nFirst version of the review left here for the historical purpose:\n\nI want to ask you a few things. Do you remember Fallout? Nah, not that fancy F3 and F:NV, no, i'm talking about '97th Fallout. The world, completely destroyed by nuclear warheads, and then, intensively dried by merciless impartial Sun for over a century, become a harsh, empty desert... that was the world we lived in for a while. We did things, necessary for our cause, we met people, hardened by this hazardous environment, we saw rising nations, mindless bandits, we saw the life after... We were free to go wherever we wish and do whatever we want...\n\nNow, do you remember Mount-&-Blade? Where we could roam absolutely free, with no particular cause. We had a party of trustfull associates, we could've trade, fight alone, or swear an oath to a ruller, and fight by their standart. We had to think about provision for out group, so they won't starve and leave us...\n\nBefore this point we had everything we could possibly want, except one thing...\n\nIn Kenshi, besides all other things mentioned above, one of possibilities we have is actually settling our own village. Gather some coin, get some bricks and start to build your little paradise in a middle of nowhere. Build it in a trade route, open a tavern and watch caravans going by and leaving you some coin for your goodies. Build a large house and put some beds in, so roaming patrols could rest their feet and heal their wounds. Grow your own crops to make food. Grow your own hemp to make... err... fabric... Beware though, as not only peacefull force roaming the desert. Cruel bandits and mindless cannibals could show up in any hour. They will crave for your supplies, your money, or even your bodies and your life. Build walls, gates, and take deffence of what rightfully yours! Then gather some strenght, and send a squad of trained warriors back, to their den! Take their lives to bring peace across the land and earn respect of other factions. Travel, trade, fight and settle:\n"The world is yours".\n\nI can't forget to mention the party itself. Every buddy you hire is, in fact, a full character with same set of stats as your first created guy. So eventually, if you want to, you can go from a single hero to an army of individuals, and even if "your" character dies, it's not a "Game Over". Everyone are equall, and everyone counts as your character.\n\nBesides i'd like to say few things about a graphics. Maybe the textures are not perfect, maybe collisions are not always right, maybe animation is a bit dull sometimes... But, brick hit me, characters even has their FOOT FINGERS modelled! They don't even have this in Skyrim!\n\nAnyway, just buy it and help Lo-Fi Games finish this ambitious project and grind this diamond to the brilliant!","February 13, 2014","true","308.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is absolutely no gameplay in this game.\n\nCombat is right clicking, sitting back and watching, there is no challenge or skill, just grind.\n\nIt's advertised like a samurai mount&blade with base building.

You start out with a weak guy, and then you decide what to do from there.

You go find a group of baddies, lead them to town, help the guards fight (if you call it help), loot and sell, buy guys and gear, repeat for hours.\n\nMid game: After you have enough guys, lets say 20 to be safe, you can buy up a bunch of building material, find a spot and start your own town.  Hopefully you can win about 20-30% of the fights by now.  This is where the game starts to get interesting finally.  Unfortunately I started this too soon, unable to actually win most fights makes my 12 guys unable to hold up my base.\n\nShort of it:  The game is as grindy as an MMO, but makes winning more difficult at first.  Based on the description, I believe it will become too easy late in game, if I could get to that point.  Thus I believe the mid-game is about the only part with any play value, considering how long it takes to get to that point I would not suggest starting again with a new goal unless you like watching guards grind.\n\nWith the description by the Developer the world will not change, hense long game you'll be so tough it will be boring from the lack of challenge.  This is why I don't believe the game will ever reach it's potential, and why I cannot recommend it.","June 5, 2015","false","8.0"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

I only don't recommend it because it needs a lot of polishing.\n\nFanboy downvote brigade","July 7, 2014","false","50.4"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

Movement mechanics needs to go back to the drawing board because it is just frustrating as it is. Doing anything in this game is frustrating and no fun, IMO.","May 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

Great idea in general but the game plays like a piece of ♥♥♥♥. My characters run around like ♥♥♥♥ing idiots attacking everything they see and no matter what i do ♥♥♥♥ing dogs manage to land 4 hits before any of my dudes can land a hit. And if that isn't bad enough practically any Bandits within 200m will instantly charge and kill my troops only so that when my dudes finally get up again these bandits rush all the way back from god knows how far to take them down again.\n\nMaybe with alot of ♥♥♥♥ing polishing and reconstruction the game would be fun but i don't know anymore.","June 26, 2015","false","47.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","1"
