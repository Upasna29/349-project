No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nBombernauts is a online multiplayer arena game with fully destructible voxel terrain. Think Bomberman, only a lot more fun; Your character is a little buggy-man thing, armed with tons of bombs and a baseball bat. Bombernauts is an incredibly fun game with friends, but therein lies it's largest problem: the playerbase is currently non-existant. While this isn't the game's fault, as the game itself is solid with a great concept and little to no bugs, it currently does not have any singleplayer or bot options for players to mess around with while they wait for other players to battle. However the devs are currently working on adding these features, so we should see the playerbase rise considerably after these are implimented. Now let's take a look at the game itself.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nRemember Bomberman? Well, this game is Bomberman without the grid layout on it's maps. You control a small 3-wheeled buggy-man-thing (let's just call it a buggy), that's armed with an infinite supply of bombs and a baseball bat. You can play against up to 16 other players (4 is the recommended number), where the objective is to blow them all up! Sounds simple, but it is insanely fun. You throw bombs in an arc, and you can aim how far your throw will be. Bombs explode a couple of seconds after landing, and if you hold off before tossing them while aiming, it'll cause a larger explosion...sort of like powering them up. The baseball bat can be used in a pinch to knock enemy bombs away from you, even before they land! Batter up!\n\nAt times, a small drone carrying a pinata will appear. If you bust up this pinata with your bat, it will drop a random powerup. These powerups are very numerous and do a variety of things, but usually only last for 1 bomb throw. For example there is one that lets you throw a cluster of bombs at once. When this explodes, it shoots many smaller bombs out, which then explode as well. Another powerup gives you a temporary jetpack, which improves your mobility greatly. There are a few referential powerups too, that give nods to various things. One great example of this is a powerup that gives you Dragon Ball Z Super Saiyan hair, and allows you to throw what I believe to be a Spirit Bomb!\n\nThere are many, many different maps that are rotated between each match. Every map is fully destructable, even if some parts take more powerful bombs to destroy them. There is also a map editor which you can use to create your own maps. I haven't tried it out yet because I have trouble designing decent maps or creations using toolkits for games, and sometimes the controls are a bit weird. But it's a great addition.\n\nRight now the game is multiplayer/co-op only, but as I mentioned before finding people to play with is a bit of an issue. If you want to play against others, it's recommended to get a 4 pack and give the extras to your friends who want to play, or host a game and hope others join, or advertise it on the game's forum.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nBombernauts is fairly simplistic, but the visuals are very crisp and look nice. The maps consist of mostly cubes and structures built from them, which can be blown up as much as you please. Some parts of each map react to explosions differently; for example some will catch fire after an explosion and turn to ashy blocks which crumble when touched.\n\nYour player character is a little buggy thing on 3 wheels with goofy eyes. These look pretty comical and adds to the charm of the game. Each buggy can be fully customized with many color, eye, and wheel options.\n\nExplosions look great. While not realistic with flames going everywhere, they are instead a shower of vibrant stars and smoke which fit the game's comical theme very nicely.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe bomb sounds effects are extremely satisfying. They work very well, and mesh well with the visual effects. The music is simplistic like the graphics, but it gives the game a light competitive feel, which helps as this is a competitive game at its core. It's pretty much the same tune repeated all the time, but you never really get tired of it.\n\nI feel like the game could use a little more work in this area. Possibly a few new tunes and some more unique sound effects. What they have now is good, but it can only get better with a little time and effort!\n\nPerformance\n==========\nI had zero issues with Bombernauts. It ran very smoothly with a great framerate of 45-60FPS. I recommend a controller, as the keyboard controls can be more of a hindrance than help. The game loads up pretty fast, enabling you to get into the action quickly. I didn't see any random crashes, so that's a plus.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nWith a little more work and exposure, Bombernauts could be a great multiplayer title. Bombs and powerups everywhere only add to the fun and mayhem of each game. With plenty of maps to play on, as well as a map creator, there is literally no end to the fun this game could bring. Recommended if you are looking for a game to play with friends!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/FG36IxUfZOg\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nIf you liked this review or found it helpful, please consider rating it up.

Best video game ever.\n\nSeriously, though, this is a fun game. If you're looking for a multiplayer game that you can just jump into and start playing with simple mechanics, look no further. Not only is this a relatively un-complicated game the aesthetic is something I haven't seen in a while. I think I heard Gassy Mexican or someone on his stream say it looked like a SEGA game, but it definitely has an N64 feel to it. It scratches that nostalgic itch without being too same-y. IT'S SO COLORFUL.\n\nDidn't experience a laggy game, I was matched into a game really quickly (about a couple seconds after clicked "Quick Match"), mechanics are easy to understand while still allowing players to pull off some interesting combos that could be found through playing and observing.\n\nTL;DR = Colorful, easy-to-learn, action-packed nostalgia trip.

Easy to learn, difficult to master, this is probably one of the most fun multiplayer party games on Steam. The drop-in/drop-out lobby system makes it extremely easy to get a match going and the zillions of items, power-ups and maps makes every round feel fresh and exciting.\n\nAt the moment, the only negative is that the game has a very small playerbase which makes it difficult to find lobbies outside of peak hours. That said, it's still very playable with only two or three players, so if you can find just one friend to play with you will still be able to have fun. Hopefully this will stop being an issue as more people find out about and start playing this great game.\n\nThat said, I definitely recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jono1014/recommended/246920/","jono1014","Jono","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jono1014/","392 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBombernauts offers a unique fusion of Bomberman and Super Smash Bros, of course focusing more on the Bomberman inspiration.  Where it differentiates itself from Bomberman is the way in which players are eliminated from a match, rather than being taken out in one explosion, you actually have to be blasted out of the arena like in a Super Smash Bros. match.\n\nThe 3D maps definintely are more reminscent of Bomberman 64's multiplayer over the more classic top down style that is probably more familiar to fans of the series.  There are a variety of different block types the 100 current maps are made up of too, many of which are fully destructible voxels making for some pretty chaotic matches.\n\nBesides bombs, every player also comes equipped with a bat which can be charged up and used to bat away bombs and players or to break pinatas which contain power-ups.  There seemed to be a pretty good variety of these which would change your bombs into a more powerful or unique variety or something like making you throw a huge pile of bombs at once.\n\nThings I liked:\n- The core game is all here and feels quite polished for an early access launch outside some placeholder stuff like the funny loading screen they threw together in paint it looks like.\n- Good amount of stages to kick off early access\n- Stage creator\n- Power-ups\n- There is a server browser in addition to a quick match option for those who just want to jump right into the action\n- When you die you aren't out of the game as it features a revenge system like we've seen in some Bomberman games.  You essentially become a ghost floating outside the stage that can throw a bomb every few seconds or so.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n- On some stages it was hard to tell if I was walking into a hole of death because the water clolor was too close to the tile.  Camera management can get frustrating at times too since you can't always tell where you are going unless you rotate it.\n- Minor lag and performance issues in some hectic matches, for the most part things were pretty smooth though.\n\nThings I hope to see added:\n- Unlockable customizations for your robot character.  While matches are fun, they need to feel rewarding to the player too.  Have potential random drops at the end of rounds or games and maybe a guaranteed prize for the winner.  Bomberman Live/Ultra featured something like this where cosmetic customizations would randomly appear on the stage during a match so maybe something like that too where pinata loot has a chance to be a cosmetic item to equip before matches.\n- Other than that, pretty much just building more onto what we already have in Early Access, aka more power-ups, stages, block types.\n\nFinal Thought: Overall if you were a fan of Bomberman or just like party-style games, I think its worth it to give Bombernauts a shot at some point whether it be now or when its out of early access.  Definitely would recommend picking it up with friends though, which thankfully isn't too hard to do since it comes with a free extra copy.","August 1, 2015","true","1.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

The gameplay is silly, and the sound design and graphics underline that silliness. The matches vary from simple two-player rounds where you can gauge your skills against another player, to madness with five or more bombernauts. A really crowded match will make it easier to get killed, but with more targets it's also easier to get your revenge as a ghost and return as a zombie.\n\nThe gameplay is intuitive and controls are simple, although the camera can take some getting used to. In the beginning it's easy to flip the camera and accidentally fall off a ledge. The level editor features are straightforward and it's easy to make levels quickly using the various symmetry modes.\n\nBomb combos often lead to hilarious results, but you won't usually get that many items stacked in a vanilla match. Luckily (or catastrophically), matches can be configured to different levels of mayhem. Insane item spawn rate combined with several uses per item is a good way to make each match an unpredictable mess of strange explosive devices.\n\nMost levels can be destroyed easily. Some levels will let you blow up walls to expose climbing tiles, and sometimes you want to prevent others from following you by destroying the stairs you climbed up on. In two-player matches, the latter can get annoying if you're not in a position to catch up using a bomb jump or jetpack, since there won't be any ghost players dropping bombs from above to reduce the advantage. However, the option of introducing meteor showers a few minutes into the game can make isolated platforms less safe.\n\nPlayer count is naturally vital in a multiplayer early access game. You also need at least three players if you want the full Bombernauts experience. At the moment, you're not guaranteed to find other players at arbitrary times of day. It helps if you have at least one friend who plays, since others will be more likely to join in when you have a game already running.  If you don't have any bombernaut friends, but enjoy making your own levels, you can test your levels while waiting for other players to join. Evenings seem to be the best time to find others playing.\n\nAll in all, Bombernauts is a really silly game where you never know what's going to happen next. I already recommend it in its current state, and it's been getting steadily more polished and fun with each update. With a few more regular players it'll be even better.","September 18, 2015","true","123.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BattleCat/recommended/246920/","BattleCat","SunBro Solaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BattleCat/","247 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBombernauts is a tough one to review, because the game isn't bad, it's actually quite fun. I just can't recommend it at this point in time because it's online-only multiplayer. My issues largely come down to where I live and it being a relatively unheard of game at the time of writing this, so this won't apply to everyone.\n\nIf you're an American, I suspect there won't be any issues with finding a match, and you'll have a blast (Get it? Blast. Bombs blast!). But, as an Australian the game is sitting in my library gathering dust because:\n\nA) Small player base = no one to play with, particularly in my timezone.\nB) Busy periods aren't when (working) Australian's can play.\nC) When it does find people to play with, pings are too high (it's P2P).\n\nIf bots and drop-in, drop-out behaviour (e.g. Lego and Left 4 Dead etc) were added, that would go a long way to making the game playable while the player base establishes. As it stands I search for an active game, get told there aren't any so it creates a new one and I sit in the level waiting for people to join. Normally I'll wait 10 minutes (during which no one joins) before quitting.\n\nIf Bombernauts had local multiplayer I'd get some use out of it, although I recognise that brings a whole host of problems with the design of the game, so I'm not holding my breath on that.\n\nThe camera can be very frustrating, especially with the verticality of some levels. Even on level maps you can't see the person you're throwing a bomb at so distance and position are guess work.\n\nIt's not worth writing much else about Bombernauts while it's in Early Access. The game is fun enough and the dev is actively updating it and seems to be listening to feedback. I hope it catches on in places other than America so we can all enjoy it and I can change my review to a "recommend"!","October 23, 2015","false","5.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Pretty simple, yet when close to no effort is put into a game with simple concepts, you fall flat fast. Level design should be key here, maps shouldn't just be squares with no walls, no one wants to fall off immediately because the best strategy in the game is to spam bomb as fast as possible to destroy the sometimes one width block below you.\n\nCharacters could stand to have more character, hell even your twitter avatar as pupils. The character made is like some rejected Dalek when that thing has a plunger attached to it. Two flash lights attached to a ball with wheels doessn't make a character that I would remotely enjoy playing.\n\nIce physics are basic, but you should add a little bit of traction outside of only jumping to not die, and to start moving you have to jump, so instead allow us to impart a bit of momentem by just moving.\n\nThe springs need to be accelerated in multiple hops to go higher.\n\nThe sticky blocks need to be able to move faster, and you should be able to climb up a sticky block to the block above it instead of being stuck a level lower even though you should be able to reach.\n\nBall and chain could be useful if you didn't die immediately when you hit the water, maybe a short float so you could use it to get back on stage.\n\nGhost bomb delay is probably 1 or 2 seconds too long.\n\nThe circle to show the character below another block is unhelpful when a single missing block in front of you could kill you. Just make the level above mostly transparent or just completely transparent unless you throw a bomb.\n\nOverall, this was shoddily thrown together with close to no actual design being worked on, I'm happy you got a game out there, but try to actually work on it instead of just publishing the first thing that came out.","September 20, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","15","0","0"

But when it does get to the point where there is almost no ground to walk on. The game just becomes annoying and I do not have fun at all. On the plus side. There is a lot of people to play the game with. So if you are worried about player base. Worry not, there's tons of people playing online. Netcode is pretty good too. The game could still have hope, but as of right now.

The best comparison I've heard to give an idea of how it plays is a mix between Bomberman and Smash Bros. You die by falling off the map into the water/lava, and bombs stun and knock you back, as well as the baseball bat. It has a mechanic similar to the Bomberman ghosts that you can throw bombs from the outside of the arena, and if you get a kill then you swap places.\n\nThe default maps are all pretty varied and lots of fun. Each map has various blocks that have different effects, from stick blocks that you can jump up the side of, to ice blocks that do exactly what you think.\nIn my experience, the more items the better, cause that adds to the chaos (and fun) of a match. You've got some fun/silly, like a Spirit Bomb that gives you Super Saiyan hair, or a Baseball that makes a big explosion and can be hit away, and the ones to avoid like the chain bomb. The real fun comes with all of those power ups stacking, where if a person runs around and hoardes power ups, they can create one massive clusterf*** of a bomb.\n\nI've you've got a group of friends and love the chaos of Bomberman games, this is easily worth it, especially with the 4-pack being $5 a copy.","November 8, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
