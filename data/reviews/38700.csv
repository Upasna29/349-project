In each level, the player has access to a specific number of tools, each of which may or may not have limited uses, and needs to use them in order to get all the eggs in the level. Additionally, there is a "rewind time" feature which is more so you can redo levels after you've messed them up in lieu of redoing every step.  It has very clean and vibrant graphics, and ultimately does accomplish what it set out to do.\n\nThat being said, I chose not to recommend this game because, at its root level, it seems to have failed in what I find most important in games: I didn't find it particularly fun. The first few stages of each world, the levels are interesting and introduce new mechanics in a myriad of fun ways, but as you progress to the later levels in each world, they become hard for the sake of being hard - not challenging, which proves to be fun as you overcome them, but something more difficult than that to where the game ceases to be fun and ends up being a chore.\n\nThere are some people who will enjoy this game throughout because they like that sort of difficulty. There are others who will pick it up, play the first few levels and be satisfied. But I think for most people, the game taken as a whole will just not be that entertaining.","March 6, 2014","false","9.4"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","40","58","3","0"

These puzzles kill me!"On the one side Toki Tori is a little cute bird - something between a chick and a penguin. It cannot fly or even jump - just step up a small block and float slowly to ground. You walk through lovely animated enviroments and  listen to a sweet soundtrack with the purpose of collecting all placed eggs in every level. But don't get tricked by this overwhelming cuteness!\n\nOn the other side Toki Tori is an ultra hard puzzle platformer without any mercy. That's for some reason:\n1. Some levels have traps where you get stucked in a hole without coming out. Mostly there is the      last egg to get.\n2. The monsters are quick and touching is highly deadly. Unfortunatelly you have to come them sometimes really close.\n3. You have a cruel limit of using special abilities like bridge building, block throwing or teleporting. If your contingent is gone you cannot do anything more and must try again.\n4. It seems that for every level exists only one solution. It's hard to get this, make the right decisions from the beginning to the end and follow the right path.\n\nThough there is a rewind function in this game - besides it looks like VHS. But it will help more in dangerous situations than leading you to the solution. In the end you'll feel lucky to get through all these nerve-wracking levels.

Toki Tori is simple: You play as the bird trying to gather eggs. However, for whatever reason, this bird is unable to jump or fly (but he can breathe underwater). This means that getting around the level is a challenge because he has to use specific tools to accomplish the task of getting all the eggs without getting stuck. Very simple in concept, but it gets really hard. Some of the harder levels took me a good hour to deal with. And I even gave up on the last hard level because I just couldn't figure it out.

You can use it to skip a tricky level, and if you need it later, you can unlock it again by completing the level you used it on. This helps the fact that sometimes you're just blocked and need to process a puzzle subconsciously for a while, and when you come back later, it's easier.\n- Sound and music volume is strangely high in this game. It had three levels in the setting, and even on the lowest, it's already very loud.\n- Bonus levels locked unless you join the Steam group for the game. I understand that it is useful to them for getting feedback from people, but it should be a free decision, and not incentivized through content. They must know that people will just join and then leave again if they don't feel like giving feedback. Caring cannot be bought, and the attempt makes me care even less.\n- Puzzles are designed to often contain a tricky element that needs unconventional thinking. Not as extreme as in Squishy the Suicidal Pig, and thus somewhat easier to progress in, at least as far as I can tell at this point.\n\nAt the time of writing this it's 90% off, and there's even a demo available.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beefbud/recommended/38700/","beefbud","Beefbud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beefbud/","566 products in account","One of the most "pure" puzzle-platformers that I've played, sometimes to a fault.  You are tossed into a level with a set of tools and a set amount of times to use them, and then asked to navigate to find all of your eggs.  The majority of the levels are short enough to not be too frustrating, but some of the later, longer levels have an absurd amount of steps to complete in order to finish them.  The difference between this and other games is the complete lack of hand-holding in a level.  When a new tool is introduced you will learn how to use it in a sort of tutorial level, and after that you're on your own for figuring out how to use the tool in future levels.  For me the issue is that there are a HUGE amount of variables when it comes to playing through each level; where, when, and how to use each tool will make a big effect on the outcome.  And it can be quite easy to get stuck, though thankfully the included ability to rewind time after getting stuck or dying is a huge relief and necessity.  Most of the normal levels I had a lot of fun with, but sometimes they get exhaustively long and I would have to look up hints online in order to not be too overwhelmed.  It's a game that requires a lot of experimentation in order to succeed, but when you do it's very satisfying, and thankfully most levels have multiple ways to solve them.","October 28, 2014","true","11.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

It features very short levels that are connected only by the fact that the goal is the same in each ---- collect the designated number of eggs within the level. There is no story involved, just get the eggs and move on to the next level.\nAnd that's ok, but after a while it gets a bit boring, for me.\nTo add to this, the game's pace is super slow. The main character moves slow, and the few enemies I've seen are slow.\n\nThe game reminds me of those Super Granny games where she is rescuing her cats ---- in slow motion with no story.\n\nThere are many who will see a good amount of appeal here, and the price is good (especially if on sale), so if you find cute, bright, colorful, and very challenging puzzle games to your liking you should check this one out.\nVery hard to decide whether to click yes or no on this one ---- but since we all have different tastes in games, I'll recommend it, with reservations, because it's not one that I would personally spend more time with.

You'd get a constant flow of cute little pixely critters, often upwards of 50 of them, and you'd have to guide them to an exit by designating them special skills like digging of floating or exploding. In the end you had to rescue only a set number of Lemmings, and as a result you often had room for error that let you experiment a little at finding a unique solution and have a mini-panic when you accidentally lead half of them off a cliff.\n\nToki Tori reminds me of this game that I have a lot of nostalgia for because it brings to mind the levels where you'd only have one lemming, and there really only was one solution that didn't involve the cathartic nuke button. By about a fourth of the way through this game, the levels take a turn towards complexity so baffling that you will have no room for error and no ability to predict what tools you might need to save for later.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game is cute and entertaining, but it is far too shallow. Frustration with the invariably complicated one and only solutions lead me to use a walkthrough for most of the second half of the game. Each time I'd wonder aloud "How was I supposed to figure that one out?". I later found out that there is an (undocumented I think?) feature allowing you to zoom out enough to more carefully study the level and predict what you'll need. That would have helped a little earlier, but I still probably would have resorted to drawing out the level and spending 30 minutes working out the solution on paper. Maybe Toki Tori 2 has improved on the difficulty curve, or on the general boredom that results from the uninspiring puzzle design. I wouldn't know as I'm not willing to risk the amount of money it costs.\n\nTwo Tribes has made better. EDGE is a personal favorite of mine. But Toki Tori is just a bit too unforgiving for me to enjoy it, and as such I cannot recommend it.","March 2, 2014","false","10.5"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

It's an action/puzzle game, I suppose. You control a chicken-thing named Toki in a series of increasingly challenging 2D stages in which the goal is to collect eggs. As you may have guessed, collecting those eggs without dying or getting stuck is where the "puzzle" part comes in. I also have to say that the one thing which sticks with me about this game is the level design - it's just so perfect - I swear the developers must be geniuses.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/38700/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nThis little bird first saw the light of day back in 2001 on the good old Game Boy Color, but it manages to remain entertaining and relevant to this date thanks to HD versions, remakes and the fact that you can get it on almost any possible platform including the PC. So, what makes it fun to play 13 years later? Maybe it's the fact that it looks cute and childish and somehow reminds us of a time when games were made for fun and this is certainly an easy to learn, hard to master kind of game because it looks simple at first, but you'll often find yourself looking for the answer somewhere else as you'll get stuck more often than you'd think. The story is simple and just like in Angry Birds you are supposed to rescue your lost brothers, which come in the form of eggs, and not actual birds, but you'll have to go through quite a lot to achieve that. The menu is simple and intuitive and choosing what level you want to play once you unlocked the hard and bonus levels is easy to do, so you won't find yourself navigating the menus in order to find something because all you need is always one click away.\nRating: 8\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay in Toki Tori is as simple as it gets as you can move left/right/up/down using the mouse to point the next place you want your little bird to go and use items in order to pass a certain obstacle or defeat your enemies such as worms, ghosts or porcupines; such items include a freeze gun, a vacuum, instant rocks or the ability to teleport or create bridges. The PC version also has a option to rewind, so in case you screw up you can always go back a couple of seconds and try again which will reduce your frustration because sometimes you might press the wrong button and use an item instead of another or make a wrong step near the end and playing the whole level again would drive you mad. The only thing missing was the ability to jump as I always tried to jump thinking that it would make the whole puzzle easier to solve, only to remember that I can't do that, but either way it's not so bad because you don't really need to as the items and abilities are more than enough.\nRating: 9\n\nGraphics\nThis game looks good as it has a nice pallet of colours and it has that childish look that will make you nostalgic as it is one of those games that will age very well in the purest Nintendo style. Each stage has its own theme so when you will find yourself in the sewers the level design will make it feel like unique and different from the previous stages and the little details like the mud interacting with Toki's feet are going to display the level of attention this game got from the developers and it really shows that they wanted to deliver a better experience with this release and not make it look like just another HD remake.\nRating: 9\n\nAudio\nToki Tori sounds just as good as it looks as the sound manages to deliver the same thing: a childish experience that will stay with you for a long time, and while it repeats the same music over and over again in the menu it never feels overused and during the actual levels the sound manages to deliver the same experience the design does and this helps the player's immersion. The sound effects are also okay, nothing will take you out of this magical world where a chick fights ghosts and worms.\nRating: 9\n\nExtras\nThe PC version comes with some exclusive levels and the ability to rewind, but the real win comes with the level editor which allows you to create your own unique adventures and challenges for the little bird and thanks to Steam you are able to share them with your friends. The Steam Achievements are also a nice incentive to make you play again certain levels and thanks to all that I managed to spend more time in Toki Tori than in some big triple A games out there.\nRating: 10\n\nVerdict\nToki Tori is a cheap and fun game and no matter if you're getting at full price or grabbing your copy during the next sale, Toki Tori is need to buy because it will take you by surprise regarding how much you will enjoy it no matter if you like that type of games or not and even if you go in to play just a level you will end up spending hours in it and for such a small price it's clearly a bargain.\nRating Overall: 9\n\nCheck the full review and a lot more about Toki Tori at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=219","January 28, 2014","true","8.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Using only the mouse to point and click directions to your avatar, and using the tools provided in limited supply, you need to navigate your avatar to each egg in the level.  It is a really simple concept with simple to use tools.  That is where the true beauty of the game lies.  The first few levels warm you up to the control scheme and tools, but it gets really tricky really fast.  The normal levels aren't all that hard, but the hard levels had me wracking my brain for a bit of time, looking for any tiny loophole; anything to exploit.  The game goes from fun to maddeningly frustrating, but not in a hurry to punish.  If you love simple puzzle platformers, you definitely should give this a shot.  If you are looking for an action platformer, this is definitely not what you are looking for.","August 21, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avetixz/recommended/38700/","Avetixz","Avetixz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avetixz/","192 products in account","Toki Tori is a puzzle game by Two Tribes[www.twotribes.com], released in January 2010. You play the game as a chick by the name of Toki Tori, who is on a quest to collect all the eggs in the world. The game is divided into five worlds, who are also divided into several levels. To proceed into the next level, the player has to collect all the eggs in one level. By proceeding through the game, the player unlocks different tools, which he needs in order to reach certain eggs, but every level has a limited amount of tool uses and this is where the tricky part comes in.\n\nIf you are familiar with puzzle games, the game will probably not be very challenging and if you aren't, it's still very easy in the beginning, but gets very hard in the end. The levels are monotone and once you get the hang of one level, you can project that procedure to other levels.\n\nThe game gets quite hard in the end and the monotony that I was talking about is compensated by the different worlds in the game, which all have very different themes and different tools. The atmosphere is happy and joyful in the first world, but soon turns darker and more dangerous as more enemies and traps appear. The game features adorable colorful comic graphics and a cheering and catchy music.\n\nToki Tori is overall a lovely game if you want to pass the time or if you just want a casual game that cheers you up. It's great for people who don't want a serious game and it's a must-have for every puzzle game lover.","February 3, 2014","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Most of its puzzles give you all the time in the world to think their solution, and provided you don't look them up online should give you at least 12 hours of playtime, more if you are bad at puzzles :)\n\nSome puzzles however will require some real time solving, ie. timing skills, but this shouldn't prove impossible, movement patterns aren't complicated and are a simple task to project them to the future.\n\nFor graphics lovers, the graphics show a lot of time went into the graphic design. In this regard there are four "tilesets", or worlds, each with several puzzles to complete, monsters to avoid and different gameplay mechanics to keep the game fresh.\n\nFor achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s the game has several achievements ranging from simple to fulfilling ones, it only has one cheap achievement that you should have serious trouble obtaining without a guide.","December 18, 2010","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sitagi/recommended/38700/","sitagi","undercat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sitagi/","940 products in account","Toki Tori is an eggcellent and hard-as-eggs puzzle game. Do not be fooled by its cutesy look, for underneath it lies very solid gameplay and clever level design.\n\nThe goal of each level is to collect all eggs using a limited number of items available at your disposal. Some levels have enemies you need to circumvent, but usually the main problem becomes planning your way through the level and finding the right order in which to collect all the eggs. Toki Tori has this peculiar puzzle game quality that often makes you think “this level is impossible, the game must be bugged!” in frustration and despair until you finally stumble upon the unexpected solution and marvel at how you couldn't think of it earlier.\n\nDespite its appearance, the game is NOT a platformer. Toki Tori has no inertia and can neither jump nor dash. All characters and objects in the game are always “snapped” to a large grid, which saves you from that awful mentality of trying to find a pixel-perfect location for a block to place. After having learned the game mechanics, you’ll soon find yourself able to plan your way throughout the entire level without any prior experimentation. The game does, however, feature a convenient time rewind function that lets you try your idea and, if you see it fail, rewind it back.\n\nIf you’re unsure, I dare you to try the demo and see if you can resist Toki Tori's cuteness and wit.\n\nP.S.\nAchievement hunters should note that some achievements seem to randomly bug out for some people and not trigger when they should. For me it was "Trap 30 ghosts" (which, as far as I understood, didn't work because the code was checking for "N == 30" and not "N >= 30", but wasn't reliably called after every increment of Y), some other people were complaining about the "Close Encounter" achievement. Let this measly thing not be a discouragement, though, especially since there should still be some roundabout ways to get those buggy achievements if you happen to stumble upon them.","July 25, 2014","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are clearly designed around touch, but mouse or keyboard works just as well. There is a slight timing aspect because of the moving enemies, but nothing that requires a lot of skill. This game has some very difficult puzzles that took me a while. One minor problem is that the rewind function is not very precise and you can't interrupt the death animation, so if you're going to do a lot of trial-and-error, it's a bit annoying. Also, some of the levels ("bonus levels") only unlock if you join the official steam group, which is pretty pointless.","April 26, 2015","true","23.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd say it makes the game about 85% better. On to the game itself. It's not that hard to describe it. In fact, I can use two words for it: puzzle platformer. The graphics are sharp and cute and the gameplay is alright.\nYou're a bird and you have to collect eggs spread across the level. You can collect these by using tools that you're equipped with at the beginning of the level. There's a Freeze Ray for instance, as well as a teleporter and a platform to cross small gaps.\nAnd... well, that's it actually. You just solve puzzles. There's no story.\nAnyway, just remember; it's created by Dutch people (which makes it automatically better !).\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","July 2, 2011","true","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Not exactly that simple.\n\nThis is basically a 2d platformer, but you can't make the character to jump and slash enemies. Instead, you're given the options to put a block to climb, a wood to help you cross a cliff, or a vacuum to suck your enemy. Not only that, you need to think by observing the level first before proceeding, simply because one wrong move and you need to rewind.

I got this game in a big indy bundle AGES ago. Not much of it has been memorable, however this game is very clever and fun little puzzle game. At times the puzzles are a bit too clever and really beyond me in a big way, but it's fun nonthelss. The story is you play as Toki who has had all the eggs stolen and the objective of each mission is to retrieve the eggs.puzzles get more complex as the levels change and you gain new abilities which are needed to get from A to B in many different locations.

You have a selection of abilities to use in limited quantities to collect all the trapped eggs in each level.  It's a fun simple game, at least at the start.  The game starts out simple but quickly becomes overwhelmingly complex, requiring you to navigate levels larger than your monitor and collect as many as 15 eggs with extremely limited abilities.  The game lets you rewind to correct mistakes, but this often requires you to redo almost the entire level only to find out your new method doesn't work either.\n\nSo while the game is fun, it gets quite frustrating towards the end.  I'm pretty neutral about the game overall, but I'm leaving it as a thumbs up because it's worth playing.","February 25, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It does nothing unique, has basically no story or anything keeping you playing it other than solving the next puzzle which arent very difficult anyway.\n\nHeres the thing. Im not sure why this is here. It adds noting by being on PC. Its very short and each level is only a few minutes long. Its by and by a mobile game that you would play on the john. Mobile games are OK if they are shallow as you arent really looking for a deep expirence while taking a ♥♥♥♥ or on a plane. You are passing time. On PC however, you generally expect a higher expirence than just something to pass time.\n\nIt also doesnt help that you cant through a rock on steam without hitting another bloddy puzzle platformer.\n\nIf puzzles are your jam and you really have nothing else to play then go ahead and buy it. Just be aware that  there only about 2 hours of content unless you really want to replay levels on "Hard" which is locked until you beat normal.","March 13, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Along the way, you get to explore a forest with angry porcupines that can't wait to perforate you with their 8 inch needles, a booby-trapped castle filled with human corpses, a sewer coated in radioactive slime and filled with angry mutant slugs and much more. The game states that it's for "everyone". I think it means everyone but children and people with low to average IQs because the levels just become more difficult and downright diabolical as you play. It is strangely addictive and you could easily lose yourself playing just one level. Overall an excellent game. Grade: A+","December 27, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lostleader/recommended/38700/","lostleader","lostleader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lostleader/","179 products in account","For such an innocence looking game, Toki Tori is cruelly challenging. Yes, I like playing puzzle games, but Toki Tori’s sense of challenge just goes from mild to infuriating hard. I really do like everything Toki Tori has to offer, and despite looking like an incredibly easy kiddie game it turns into one of the hardest challenging puzzle games around, and that alone is impressive. It really is a hidden gem amongst puzzle games, and one that would challenge anybody that thinks they’re clever.\n\nThe game is simple enough; Toki Tori needs to collect all the eggs in order to proceed to the next level. Toki can use a number of gadgets to get all these eggs, but usually there is a limited amount of uses on each item. These gadgets tend to range from simply building a ladder to arming an ice bazooka. The main objective is then to find a way to optimize all your items so you can collect all the eggs, and in lies the sneaky cleverness of Toki Tori. Toki Tori has a tricky twist on how you might simply try to get one egg only to not have enough resources to get the next one. More often than not, Toki Tori’s tricks you enough that it can really be trying on any player, and even with the ability to skip a level in a world it gets to the point of aggravation. Toki Tori can just spike in difficult so easily that in one moment you are getting puzzles done left and right, then in the next you don’t even know how to string two eggs together. You could spend an hour on just one puzzle and still not solve it. The game can often get stuck in your head just wondering how you can make it work, only to realize that you were completely doing the wrong approach. And all this could really just be avoid if the game gave you some clue on how to get the eggs. Whether the hint be which order to get the eggs or how to just get one of the eggs, any kind of hint system would have made such a hard puzzle game become a bit more bearable. But don’t let the games hard difficulty fool you that it has nothing else to offer, because after you solve all the regular puzzles harder puzzles are unlocked. Making Toki Tori last far longer with even more challenging puzzles then the ones in the main game. So needless to say, Toki Tori will have you scratching your head for quite some time. But for what it’s worth, it’s quite a wonderful mountain of a game to conquer, even if it looks and plays cute music while you’re doing it.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nToki Tori is really a surprising gem of a game, and one that holds the phrase, “don’t judge a book by its cover” quite well. Although it may look cute, this game can be quite cruel with nearly each puzzle requiring all your resources of weaponry and tools, leaving little room for error, meaning this game will challenge anyone’s wit when it comes to solving puzzles.","November 10, 2013","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything comes together in a nice, neat little package. Unlike puzzlers like Portal 2 and all those stacking and matching games, which give you one core mechanic to work the whole game off of, this game gives you a variety of items and puzzle elements which must be used in order to complete the game. Most of the time they have a limited number of uses so the puzzles are about knowing what items to use, where to use them and when to use them so you can gather the many eggs located in each stage.\n\nThe story is pretty thin, but this isn't the kind of game you play for the story anyways, the point is to solve cleverly designed puzzles. Not to mention each world has not only 12 regular stages, but also hard mode stages and bonus levels (which you need to join the Toki Tori steam group to play), and a load of achievements, so there's plenty of bank for your buck.\n\nThere's also a level editor, which isn't hard to use, but I haven't sunk enough time into it nor do I really care to (mostly due to my inability to design half-decent puzzles) to figure it out completely.\n\nA great buy, and I'd recommend it to any puzzle enthusiast.","January 6, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s sort of like Lemmings but instead of having a bunch of lemmings walking to their death unless you tell them to use the tools, you have Toki Tori who doesn’t even move unless you tell him to. You still get (usually) limited amounts of each tool, but instead of waiting for the flow of lemmings to get to where you want the tool used, you just need to get Toki Tori there.\n\nToki Tori is a fun little distraction. If you’re not particularly experienced at puzzle platformers you may need more help than the built-in “wildcard” level skip affords, but if you’re not too proud to look for hints you’ll enjoy yourself.","December 27, 2011","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything comes together in a nice, neat little package. Unlike puzzlers like Portal 2 and all those stacking and matching games, which give you one core mechanic to work the whole game off of, this game gives you a variety of items and puzzle elements which must be used in order to complete the game. Most of the time they have a limited number of uses so the puzzles are about knowing what items to use, where to use them and when to use them so you can gather the many eggs located in each stage.\n\nThe story is pretty thin, but this isn't the kind of game you play for the story anyways, the point is to solve cleverly designed puzzles. Not to mention each world has not only 12 regular stages, but also hard mode stages and bonus levels (which you need to join the Toki Tori steam group to play), and a load of achievements, so there's plenty of bank for your buck.\n\nThere's also a level editor, which isn't hard to use, but I haven't sunk enough time into it nor do I really care to (mostly due to my inability to design half-decent puzzles) to figure it out completely.\n\nA great buy, and I'd recommend it to any puzzle enthusiast.","January 6, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually, that's precisely what Toki Tori is, but don't let its appearance fool you. Even on the normal levels, expect brain-busting puzzles that'll give you fits on occasion. Some of the hard and bonus stages will really challenge you.\n\nAside from touchy controls, the game plays fair. When you fail, it's because you -- yeah, you -- failed. Trial and error is the key to solving Toki Tori, and you'll feel proud of yourself upon completion. Actually, now that I recall, there are a handful of stages that do require a bit of timing, but not too many.\n\nAnyhow, until you solve the puzzle, expect many moments of second-guessing, self-doubt, self-loathing, and cries of "I'm not bright enough for this game."\n\nIn other words, congratulations to the developers for creating a game that makes me feel both smart and dumb.","May 22, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willdotwhite/recommended/38700/","willdotwhite","The British Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willdotwhite/","142 products in account","Toki Tori is a bright, cheerful puzzle-platformer where you lead Toki Tori – a bright yellow chicken with the power to teleport between a variety of environments via wormholes while collecting some erratically misplaced eggs in standard avian-puzzle-platformer style. It’s an entertaining addition to your Steam library, but falls just short of becoming a shining example of the puzzle genre.\n\nYou lead Toki Tori through a myriad of environments – forests, a castle and some sewers, primarily – and it is quickly apparent that visually and thematically Toki Tori is pitch-perfect. Toki and the roaming enemies in each level have fantastically clean and crisp animations and the overall aesthetic of each world fits the bright and bubbly theme the exuberant loading screen promises from the outset.\n\nToki Tori oozes ‘Suitable For All Ages’ from nearly every pore, with high energy music and cutesy consequences for spinning on the spot too much or dying where you fall off the screen Mario style. Toki Tori can also rewind time to a moment he was less stuck – or indeed less dead – and this further lends to the light-hearted atmosphere that ‘everything will be all right!’, in a world where nothing can really go wrong or, at least, not for too long.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also very tight and clear. Toki scurries to follow your mouse-clicks in comical fashion, and every one of his handy tools –  including summonable platforms, a small range teleporter and a freeze ray, among others – have great visuals and sound; the ‘thud’ of placing a bridge piece is immensely satisfying for all sorts of reasons.\n\nWhere Toki Tori falls short is in the level design. To complete a single level Toki Tori has to collect every egg on the map but this all-or-nothing completion mechanic is marred by a lack of creative level design. Toki’s supply of tools is limited strictly to finding the designers’ solution, as opposed to the player creating their own. This need to discover the correct path, not create one, treads the very fine line between ‘challenging puzzle’ and ‘impossible rage-quit’, more often than not requiring a walkthrough to continue.\n\nThe game does give you a useful Wildcard which you can play to skip a level (and by going back to complete the level, earning the Wildcard back), but this doesn’t really mitigate the problem at the heart of Toki Tori: if you cannot find the path the creators designed, this game has no more content for you. Given that many puzzles are incredibly convoluted, in a way almost certainly not suitable for all ages, this complete lack of progression becomes highly frustrating very quickly.\n\nOverall Toki Tori is a fun, bright and exuberant puzzle-platformer that does many great things well but unless you are a die-hard puzzler, expect to never see the finish. Or be prepared to cheat and use walkthroughs – a lot of walkthroughs. The first 20 or so levels are absolutely excellent, but the shortcoming in level design is just too large an issue to ignore.\n\n6/10","April 26, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The challenge is that not all the tools are available at once, and they have a limited amount of uses, pre-set specifically per level. This knowledge provides clues to achieving your goal, placing you in a sport of trial-and-error until you find a way that works for you.\n\nIf practicing puzzles isn't your cup of tea, there isn't much I can recommend here. The game can get slow and sluggish; as more elements get added to levels, the possibilities expand, and you must keep trying similar things in various combinations until you find one that works. If you're akin to puzzle-style experimentation, you've got no problem, because the higher levels especially require tons of patience before you figure out what to do.\n\nThe art style of the game is cozily cartoonish; the physical setting and music of changes per level, which doesn't necessarily add to the gameplay, but rather to its warm and friendly vibe. A great (and my favorite) aspect in this game is the Rewind button, allowing you to carefully step back in order to do an alternative action without having to respawn. This makes learning the levels more hands-on, as you can explore a potentially incorrect move without the fear of it breaking your success so far. Furthermore, since there's no time limit, you're free to scout and plan without being pressured.\n\nTo label 'Toki Tori' as a simple kid's game (I've seen people do it) is a great injustice to the hours of gruelling, mind-mastering required to be victorious. This game makes me feel SO fulfilled and smart when I figure out how to finish a level. While I consider myself an experienced puzzle gamer, 9 hours in and I've yet to finish Normal mode, and there's still Hard and Bonus to go.\n\nAs a whole, there's not a lot of replayability here; once you've done all the modes, it's simply a nice trophy for your achievement cabinet. However, with over 80 levels, and greatly increasing difficulty, a substantial amount of commitment is required to finish the game on your own (No walkthroughs! Like a true puzzle solver!) If you like a cute, quality game that exercises your brain, I say get 'Toki Tori' and experience it for yourself.","January 14","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Furthermore, since there's no time limit, you're free to scout and plan without being pressured.\n\nTo label 'Toki Tori' as a simple kid's game (I've seen people do it) is a great injustice to the hours of gruelling, mind-mastering required to be victorious. This game makes me feel SO fulfilled and smart when I figure out how to finish a level. While I consider myself an experienced puzzle gamer, 9 hours in and I've yet to finish Normal mode, and there's still Hard and Bonus to go.\n\nAs a whole, there's not a lot of replayability here; once you've done all the modes, it's simply a nice trophy for your achievement cabinet. However, with over 80 levels, and greatly increasing difficulty, a substantial amount of commitment is required to finish the game on your own (No walkthroughs! Like a true puzzle solver!) If you like a cute, quality game that exercises your brain, I say get 'Toki Tori' and experience it for yourself.","January 14","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the start the character moves very slowly and I felt like the game was for little kids. I've read in other reviews that that levels end up getting very difficult, but I'd rather spend my time playing a different puzzle game, than to try to work through this game to the point it presents a challenge.","January 25","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing as a cutesy chicken with a penguin waddle, you must collect all of the eggs in each level while using only a limited amount of tools, ranging from a simple platform to a freeze-ray for your enemies. The levels start out simple enough, but slowly progress into complicated head-scratchers where every move you make must be carefully planned in advance if you hope to reach every egg.\n\nIf you enjoyed games like Lemmings, you'll likely enjoy Toki Tori, especially with the added bonus of an infinite rewind.","January 13","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
