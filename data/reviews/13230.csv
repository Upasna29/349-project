You just stumbled upon the page of the best shooter ever made. Pay some respect.\n\nBefore the days of shooters that holds your hand and aim for you, that regenerate your health and show you what to do like a baby, there was this. Unreal Tournament 2004 - the most brutal, adrenalin-fueled shooter since Quake 3 Arena, a game so fast-paced its guaranteed you'll burn your eyes from not blinking for so long. They say we only use 20% of our brains - well, if you play this game on the hardest difficulty, you'll be using 100% i assure you. Holy hell son, this game uses so much of your brain it pretty much even cures autism. This game is filled with so much testosterone you have to shave your beard every forty minutes of gametime.\n\nGameplay wise, this game is delicious. With an amazing arsenal of creative, varied and badass weapons, its certified there is a gun for everyone and every situation - sniper rifles that shoot lightning bolts, a triple rocket launcher, jesus christ did i mention a shotgun that shoots grenades too? (The Flak Cannon, considered the number 1 best gun of all times by PC Gamer). Also, with the ability of limitless dodging, walljumping and even double-jumping, the potential for amazing acrobatic moves to evade your enemy's attacks are so great not even Dante from Devil May Cry can keep up. Yep: he cries every night because he cant be as badass as you, when you're playing this game. But this is the bare basic - to survive in the Online arenas, you better be backflipping over your enemies and giving them an instagib headshot while upside down. That's how you play this. However, to be good you have to have absolute keyboard coordination and aiming abilities - it aint easy to do those moves while scoring headshots airborne. Its so hardcore, they say ninjas have to play this game to graduate in Ninja School as their last test. I'm not even kidding.\n\nThe maps are varied, from skyscrapers reaching space and low-grav to gothic dungeons, futuristic egyptian pyramids to spaceships blasting in hyperspace - there are over 140 maps in this game (thats almost 5 times more than any CoD), ranging from Deathmatch maps to Capture the Flag, Double Domination, Onslaught (Battlefield-esque map node domination), Assault (from the original UT) and even Bombing Run (Its soccer. WITH GUNS). And kid, that's not even taking into account the thousands of maps released by fans - that's right, the modding community is huge for this game. (No DLC crap, no. You get all those maps and access to mod maps for free. Welcome to oldschool shooters)\n\nThe soundtrack and graphics certainly do not falter. We get badass tracks like the one in DM-Asbestos, and others have more epic orchestral music (for actual epic scenes: assaulting an alien mothership to save Earth) and the graphics, for their time, were considered to be amazing (Even modern games, like Killing Floor, use this game engine as base). The visual and audio presentation certainly do not lack, but to this day this game isnt known for having pretty trees, its known for being the best shooter of all times and god damn it does it right.\n\nTogether with the classic Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 Arena, Unreal Tournament 2004 is known by shooter veterans worldwide to be the best competitive shooter experience that ever existed. Think you're ready for that? Take off the Angry Birds shirt, the Casual of Duty cap and get ready for a terrific head-hunting experience with the game that INVENTED Double-Kills, Headshots and Killing-Sprees (that all games rip-off nowadays).\n\nFinal Score: 10/10","January 9, 2014","true","154.3"," 828 of 857 people (97%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","97","828","857","22","40"

When it comes to competitive play, absolutely nothing beats this game. This game itches absolutely every desire I have for an arena shooter perfectly.\n\nFrom the fast paced movement to the weapons sandbox, it plays like a dream. No other game thus far has impressed me as much as Epic has with this game. The dodging system adds skill that compliments other skills such as tactical skill and aiming skill.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints I have with modern games on PC is a lack of features. This game features a full editing kit, great community driven content, a hub to display that content and a plethora of other features that hardly any other games have in comparison. Yes, that does include a FoV slider. The thing that all FPS games should have no matter what.\n\nIf this game were to only be available by going to E-Bay and paying $200 for it, I would in a heartbeat. If you're a fan of arena shooter games like Quake, you're really missing out if you haven't played this. If you want to try out arena shooters for the first time, this is your best choice. I have personally bought this game for a good few people simply because of how much I believe in it.

If you don't like messing around with such a huge arsenal you can play with an Instagib instead, which is a slow-firing weapon with 100% accuracy that instantly kills (and gibs, as the name suggests) anything you hit with it.\n\nAnother thing that made it so vastly different from all the boring arena shooters we have nowadays was the crazy mobility, you could do double jumps or jump against a wall and then jump from there again, leading to some pretty hectic but awesome gameplay, you could enable a handy little device called the Translocator that allowed you to shoot a disc and teleport to it with a simple click, making camping virtually impossible.\n\nThe game has tons of maps from itself, but Unreal has a very lively modding community and thus hunderds of maps for every game-mode are available for download, you can also download costum skins and even entirely new weapons, just a shame that the game has no steam-workshop.\n\nEven though the game is pretty old by now, there's still a reasonable amount of people playing this gem, if you want to play one of the best sci-fi shooters on the market I'd suggest giving this one a go (And not Unreal Tournament 2007, it didn't live up to the standard of the Unreal franchise in my opinion).","February 27, 2014","true","13.6"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","51","54","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilijaroto/recommended/13230/","kilijaroto","eS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilijaroto/","80 products in account","Many a day of my life was lost playing this game as an early teen. I returned to it now, 7 years later and it still smokes any non-military (meaning not in the vein of CS, Battlefield etc.) competitive shooter out there.\n\nAs AlexOfSpades put it, "before the days of shooters that holds your hand and aim for you, that regenerate your health and show you what to do like a baby, there was this." Yes indeed. I have gotten so accustomed to these games that, when I bought this game and went straight to my old habit of a warm-up Masterful bot DM, I had my ♥♥♥ HANDED TO ME. Time. And Time. Again. Until my rusty inner gaming beast finally tossed away the awful crutches that today's games forced upon it and I once again felt the rush of a full-blown UT deathmatch.\n\nThis shows what a bunch of wimps today's "fast-paced shooters" are made for. This game requires insane concentration, mental sharpness, quick decision making and finger/fine motorics coordination of a freaking Navy jet pilot. Stand still - dead, wrong weapon for the situation - dead, miss a powerup - dead, let the enemy pick up a health pack - dead, shoddy tactics in team matches - dead. No room for error (providing you have set the difficulty level high enough to actually be challenged). It's a wild ride and there is no better feeling than finally letting go of your poor, burned-out mouse and seeing your username at the top of the scoreboard.\n\nTechnically, the game excels at everything. The weapons are perfectly balanced, the powerups are perfectly distributed, the gameplay is smooth and uninterrupted. The graphics are 2004 appropriate, but even today, they are a thing of beauty, the colors are clear and it doesn't have the murky, gray/brown "drape" like UT3. The only thing that kind of bugged me was no native widescreen support, but the fix is super easy, no problems there.\n\nHowever, as much as I can gush over the "old days" of adrenaline-fuelled arena bloodshed, it's dated. Not the game itself, as I said, it is arena mayhem at its most perfect, but the concept itself has sadly fallen out of fashion. There will always be devout maniacs such as myself and a lot of people who gave this game a thumbs up, but ultimately, I think there's little hope of this kind of action coming back in this form.\n\nLong story short: if you spent days trying to find a tactic to bring down a Power Core in a certain map, or spent days honing your no-scope headshots, get this, and feel the rush. If you're a modern gamer new to this game, get it, take it easy at first, up the difficulty when you feel you have the grasp, and realize that CoD is about as intense as PacMan. If you're expecting to get your mind blown by anything other than a Flak Cannon, don't get this game. This is nothing new. It is something old. And it still kicks gobs of ♥♥♥.","May 15, 2014","true","9.4"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","42","45","0","0"

Unfortunately, I have the 2004 original DVD version added to my account so I couldn't write a recommendation.\n\nThis is the game that shaped my initial PC multiplayer gaming experience. I've logged about 4000-5000 hours (just an estimate) in the last decade. If it wasn't for this game, I probably would have discovered PC gaming much later than I initially did.\n\nMoving on to the official recommendation: the single player is very simple, but holds an interesting enough story for its time. The graphics are dated, yes, but honestly I think the game still looks very aesthetically pleasing. There is a general play mode called "Instant Action" where you can choose your gamemode, and play! This includes classics like deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and newer gametypes such as Bombing Run, vCTF and more. All of which are very, very fun.\n\nThe multiplayer community was thriving from between the initial release of this game all the way up to about 1-2 years ago. The community is still somewhat active and there is a good 20 active servers out there with different gametypes to play. There are also several mods that you can download. The modding community within this game is still somewhat active, too. The UDK is also a great tool for learning to map.\n\nI still play this game everyday, and have done since 2004 when I was only 11 years old. It is very cheap right now (and offers trading cards, so badge collectors, it's worth the buy alone for that).\n\nThis is my all-time favourite game, and if you decide to purchase it, I'll introduce you to what's left of the very tight-knit community.\n\nBuy this game.","July 15, 2013","true","116.1"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","36","37","0","0"

Sadly, they started with UT2003, which changed and removed so many things that despite the initial success it flopped hard: so much so that they had to release Unreal Tournament 2004 well ahead schedule. Thankfully they listened to the fans, and not only gave back every removed game element, but created an amalgam of the best features of UT2003 and UT ’99.\n\nThe action is faster than ever, but not to the point where it is disadvantageous to a new player. Old weapons and map types complement the new ones, offering a variety not just in play style, but in game modes– including a Halo-inspired vehicle-using war scenario.\nThe campaign also received an overhaul. You still need to complete all but one game type to win, but the small changes made sure that each play through can be different: instead of set maps you are given a small pool for each stage. For death match enthusiast 1v1 and team DMs are offered as optional challenges, boosting the possible team management strategies and game time to even higher levels.\n\nSome of the game modes like Bombing Run (a cross between Blood Bowl and Counter-Strike) and Double Domination (Domination with camping strategies) weren’t received well, but against bots they can be one of the fastest-paced modes you can play. And even if you dislike them, the other modes and the myriad of high-quality player-made map packs can ensure longevity even after all these years.","May 3, 2015","true","31.4"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","42","48","6","0"

Probably one of the best FPS's ever created. But does it hold up today?\n\nArena shooters are basically dead - the most popular one at the moment is Quake Live. So if you are looking for the current most popular shooter with the most people, go to Quake Live. Now if you are trying to re-live the glory days, you MAY have the ability do so here.\n\nPeople do still play this game online. Most of the servers are the Onslaught gamemode. Very little servers running TDM/DM/CTF etc. So if you were into Onslaught, your in luck. If you enjoyed just pure TDM/DM/CTF, you might have a hard time finding a server. You can easily get the game to run in 1080P, and it runs smooth on W7. So no compatability issues at all.\n\nPrice wise I think $15 is a bit much for an old game, even if it was good.

Unreal Tournament 2004 — not simply doubled number of the cards, new textures, game modes and tons of pleasant trifles. It is attempt to grope the style lost in motley UT 2003 tinsel and to get back to the ideas which in due time have made the best-seller the first UT; fruit of two years' evolution, thoughtful studying of responses and careful introduction of new concepts. Certainly, about any aspiration to start everything with a clean slate the speech doesn't go — UT 2004 at least on two thirds consists of old materials. Well familiar modes are attached to thoroughly propatchenny frame of the previous version — дефматч usual, дефматч command, CTF, Double Domination, Last Man Standing and Bombing Run, and 50 of 106 available cards already "stayed" in UT 2003 and free a bonus-pakakh from Epic/Digital Extremes. Copied them not blindly — the levels which design caused special complaints, are changed or processed, and the balance of forces got rid of lameness. So, the spring ability of players decreased and "adrenalinic tablets" fell in price, adding now on only two units "is flown into a rage". But after all game should be tried, I advise all!

The bots cater for every skill level and do a good job of making offline matches fun in their own right. It also has a campaign mode that lets you buy and sell players, challening other clans to matches as you head on up the league table. It was very enjoyable back in the day and I was sad When UT3 didn't have the same sort of campaign.\n\nThe game will run smoothly on all but the most basic of computers and has been a staple of LAN parties ever since its launch. It has aged brilliantly and was well supported by its community back in the day, making it worth getting for mods like 'Air Buccaneers' alone!\n\nBefore UT2004 there was a 2003 edition which was very similar. There was outcry when this version was announced, with people accusing it of becoming an annual series, much like EA sport titles. I'm almost sad that that wasn't the case, since this 2004 version contains everything that came with the 2003 edition, doubled the number of maps, added new game modes (including a very popular vehicle mode which is better balanced than I had ever expected it to be) and generally rendered the previous version of the game obsolete.\n\nI still haven't scratched the surface of what this game contains. It's big enough that even if you only like a small fraction of what it has to offer, you'll still have more to play with than most entire games have to offer. An odd little side-note, but both girls I've shown this game to have loved it, even though they're not generally fans of aggressive, adrenaline-based frag fests. Odd.\n\nIt's a thumbs up from me. The only irritating thing about it is that occasionally matches reach a frustrating stalemate, or you begin to lose through no fault of your own which is an incredibly frustrating experience. You'd expect that in online modes but offline, when you're outperforming the bots by a considerable margin, can get very frustrating. I've hardly touched the online part of this game, it's never appealed to me. Call me a noob, but the fact this game still holds my attention should pay adequate testament to the quality of this title. UT2004: 10 games rolled into one. Fun for all the family.

IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED VIDEO GAMES, GO GET A LIFE!\n\n(BEFORE STARTING OFF : if you are experiencing troubles regarding your screen moving without you touching it, you're going to have to uncheck the following : mouse smoothing, reduce mouse lag and enable joystick. I haven't figured out yet how to play with a controller).\n\nAll honesty though, this game has come quite the way from it's original conception. Back in the day Unreal was an amazing shooter and still to this day still holds highly to it's acclaim. The mods have helped significantly to keep the game interesting.\n\nUnreal Tournament is most likely known for it's obscene commentary, extreme gore, and weapons that aliens look like they developed. Before you start playing multiplayer, there is a campaign available that will get you ready for multiplayer. In UT, you may customize your character from a large select group of races in which each have their own attributes. The guns in this game are absolutely fantastic. They range from basic shotgun and rockets to energy weapons that will vaporize an opponent. I should say the guns are one of the main reasons why this game got so big; the fact they also introduced alternative firing with both the same amount of strength really plays to the shooters advantage. The game play itself compared to other shoots is a little fast as players move throughout the map with speed.\n\nMovement is quite basic but includes sprinting, crouching, jumping, lateral movements and double tapping a movement button will make the player roll forward. Like Halo, you won't find many players standing still to take a shot as you are absolutely vulnerable when not in motion. What blew my mind was one map I played online where I was not only able to enjoy the basics the game came with, but some crazy yahoo out there took his time to make vehicles (that resemble warthogs), ghost sort of looking vehicles that can jump vertically up and down, tanks and of course a ship that flies through the air. The mods get pretty crazy and some maps feature fixed guns. Game modes that are available in this game are standard deathMatch, team deathMatch, capture the flag and double domination (which is sort of like King of the Hill). Upon killing a lot of opponents or collecting adrenaline, players can use it for regeneration (Down, Down, Down, Down), invisibility (Right, Right, Left, Left), faster rate of fire (Up, Up, Down, Down) and faster movement speed (Up, Up, Up, Up) - (pint size and berserk are also available but I do not know the proper combos... yet). This adds an extra depth to already an enjoyable game. Picking up more health, armor or even ammo is quite easy and shouldn't be too much of an issue to get the gun you want. It's how much can you dodge while you're getting there. I should also add the maps I've come across so far have been superb.\n\nThe visuals are as good as they can be for their age and an update to them could make or break the game. It's vintage-ness is what's really appreciated. Sounds are pretty good, although basic and not extremely varied but provide a good context for the gun you're firing.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game on sale to anyone. It is simply a fun FPS that can be enjoyed by anyone. You will quickly see some players that have really taken their time to precise their movements and their shooting patterns.\n\n\n\nRATING : rock solid 8/10\n\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	C+	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	B-	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots :\nLooks almost nothing like it\n\nUsing a link gun to disable an air unit","December 9, 2015","true","2.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","12","14","3","0"

The community was booming, and new mods and levels were being released each day. The gameplay is the perfect blend of fast-paced action and strategic map control, something that no modern shooter has ever been able to replicate.\n\nAnd guess what? Even with the game nearing the 10-year mark, it's still active! You can still find some Deathmatch and Onslaught servers with a steady community if you decide to start playing right now. A true testament to the absolute quality of this game.\n\nIt's unfortunate that UT3 failed to capture this game's success, and that Epic has pretty much abandoned this series in favor of Gears of War, but for any big-time multiplayer FPS fan out there, this is a must-own.","December 4, 2013","true","4.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The Steam hours say nothing about how much time I've actually put into this game. I first bought it a day after it was released in Canada (That would be about 4 weeks after it was released in the US, based on exchange rates at the time), which would have been when I was 15 or 16 years old. I'm nearly 27 now, and I still hold many fond memories with this game, and will continue to make great memories. It doesn't often see a lot of replay, but the once or twice a year I do jump back into it, I stick to it for at LEAST a week before moving on. That says a lot for an 11 year old game. A lot of other games that age I just can't jump back into because it's just too outdated for me. That, or I've grown up enough to realize that the game actually sucks balls.\n\nUT2004 is an FPS, and like the name says, you're in a Tournament setting. You get points for "frags" (kills), capturing flags, holding positions, or whatever else depending on game type. The game is won when either team, or individual player in Deathmatch, reaches a certain goal parameter set by the campaign, yourself in Instant Action, or the Servermaster in Multiplayer. For example, in a Team Deathmatch game, the goal is always going to be the team with the most points collectively. This can be either a set limit, or it can be a timer countdown in which the team with the most frags at the end of the timer wins. The best part of this game, though, is HOW you get your frags. Even in the vanilla game, there are at least a dozen weapons to choose from. For the most part, these weapons are ranged, but there are one or two melee weapons (Who wants to use those, though?). I don't want to spoil the fun for those who are new to the game, so I'll tell you about my favourite: The flak cannon. This weapon was in the original Unreal Tournament, as well, and in it's return, it's packing a meaner punch. Here's what it does: The primary fire throws a dozen or more slugs of white-hot shrapnel at fast speed, ripping your oponent to shreds. Use this fire up close, and like a shotgun, you're bound to make it messy. The secondary fire is more of a mortar, in which the shrapnel is launched still encased, and then explodes into shrapnel on impact. Imagine taking that out in Call of Duty.\n\nI have to be super honest, I've never actually fully completed the actual TOURNAMENT (The "campaign" of the game), but I was never really looking for that when I bought the game. I had spent the previous five years playing Unreal Tournament, and 99.2% of that time was playing Practice Sessions, or in the case of UT2004, Instant Action. This is, in my opinion, the Brains of the game. Instant Action is where all the experimentation unfolded. Anything that you downloaded or created yourself was first tested in Instant Action, where it was put to the test with or against computer AI bots. The bots in this game are incredibily intelligent, and also very customizable. To find out more, and there's a LOT more about Instant Action, play the game and experiment yourself. It won't ever get old.\n\nWhen it comes to modability, that's where UT is the most memorable. You get the basic package, which is amazing on it's own and has hundreds of hours of gameplay, but then you also get FULL modability of the game. They even include a full UTEditor where ANYONE can jump in and make maps, good or bad, mods, skins, sounds, graphics, textures, ANYTHING. It's one of the most awesome things I've seen when it comes to a game. And then those who aren't so good with game editing could easily just check community hubs and sites for content. This was what DLC was before it was corporatized and had a price slapped on it for good measure. This is how it still SHOULD be, and I'm glad Steam came up with the workshop. I'm happy there are still a lot of good developers who provide open modability, as well. I just don't see it in this scope anymore. UTEditor was relatively simple (For those who are into it) and basically right there for you to curiously click on and figure out. To put it in perspective, I was creating maps and doing minor mods to UT99 when I was 12.\n\nThat's about all I can muster for UT2004 right now. There's WAY too much to really rave about, and I don't want to talk circles around anyone. HIGHLY recommend this game. 9.5/10","March 29, 2015","true","162.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

I do however think UT2K4 has the most bang for your buck, and feels more modern to new players than obviously the original, so if you want to start on an Unreal Tournament, start on this one and then work on getting Unreal Gold,  Unreal Tournament, Unreal Tournament 3 and if you are still interested, Unreal II The Awakening in that order. UT2K4 is exactly the same (well, almost) as UT2K3 (not on Steam) but with tons more content so don't worry about getting UT2K3 although I do think Steam should put it up for $6.\n\nThe Unreal Tournament games and Unreal Gold have bots for multiplayer, and for all my hours playing each one on Steam, and then times those by three to make the hours I've played them on my CD copies, I haven't played ONE single match online against real people. The bots on this game are really, really good and playing with real people is unnecessary to have a good time. No one plays it anymore anyways so don't let that stop you. I still can't play on the hardest difficulty against bots because they kick my ♥♥♥, and not in an unfair way in which they have 100% aim or anything, these bots are still fair on the hardest difficulty, it's just that I suck.\n\nPros:\n+Gore and dismemberment is best in the series and is really rewarding\n+A lot of graphical, input and whatever options you want to make the game yours\n+Weapon arsenal uses classic Unreal weapons and is wonderful\n+Tons of gamemodes\n+Really nice server browser\n+Tons upon tons of maps\n+Addition of vehicles works really well\n+Physics are nice\n+New double jump and movement options are perfect\n+Assault is back!\n+Bunch of mutators to further mix things up such as Instagib\n+Endless replayability\n+A hilarious Australian set Assault mission including run overable kangaroos that feels like it was made by a bunch of 16 year olds\n+Great community\n+Bunch of unique characters to play as including aliens (Selig forever!) and ♥♥♥♥ed up Nightmare people\n+You can tell bots what to do but can completely ignore that feature\n+Awesome Battlefront style space battles\n\nCons:\n-Server browser filter options are annoying to use\n-Invasion is a ♥♥♥♥ gamemode, and so is mutant, although people disagree with me on Invasion\n-Graphics aren't as good as other Unreal Engine 2 games\n-Singleplayer campaign isn't as good as the previous ones (still fighting against bots) but I seem to be in the minority with this opinion\n-Ragdoll is ♥♥♥♥ for any enemy that's not an alien for some reason\n-Though bots are still fantastic, they can be annoying on team games\n-New Assault isn't anywhere near as good as UT99 Assault\n-Music isn't as good as UT99 but still decent enough\n+Like Unreal Tournament and Unreal Gold, this is as close to FPS perfection there is, there's almost nothing to complain about\n\nSound: 7/10\nGraphics: 6/10 (it's obviously dated, but still doesn't look as good as other Unreal engine 2 games)\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nContent/Replayability: 10/10\nOverall: 9.5/10\n\nIt's well worth the $15 and is truly an incredible game. Also support the 100% always to be free (NOT free to pay, I repeat, NOT free to play) Unreal Tournament on the sleek new Unreal Engine 4 on the Unreal Tournament wesbite. 4gb download.","January 15","true","185.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","2"

I used to meetup with at a LAN Cafe most weekends and play it before I ever had a PC of my own.\n\nI recently picked it up on steam and Still love it.\nGraphics still look good enough to this day, Gameplay & gunplay is perfect, AI is quite good and somewhat of a balanced challenge.\nThe Campaign is tons of fun and has many different game modes. My favorite being Assault, an attack & defend objective game mode. There are powerups and different abilities that you can obtain from getting max adrenaline such as Speed, Regenerate, Invisibility, Berserk, Pint-Size & Camouflage.\n\nThere are loads of mods such as the original Alien Swarm & Killing Floor. Theres was also a mod I played but I cant remember the name, You started on a roof with fences on both sides and a spiral stair case going down into a lab, Only weapon you had was a translocator & bullpup machine gun. You could set the number of AI players & zombies. AI would run down and you'd hear over the radio (were under attack, man down) etc. 2Spooky4me :S\n\nDefinitely try it out if your a fan of Fast paced Shooters.\n\n9.5/10- Perfect for its time, wish there was more then 11 assault maps","February 25, 2015","true","24.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I've logged thousands of hours playing this since it's release in 2004... Amazing game, lots of replay value, and a ♥♥♥♥ton of fun.\n\nAlso, this game is extremely moddable, and has a very dedicated modding community, even to this day. The possibilities of expanding this game are endless. This game has spawned many great mods, such as Ballistic Weapons, ChaosUT2: Evolution, Mars Wars 3, Out of Hell, Unwheel, Gunreal, and Tripwire's mods-turned-commercial-games Killing Floor and Red Orchestra.\n\nSpeaking of modability - ever wanted to see Gordon Freeman from Half-Life, and Link from Legend of Zelda duel to the death with heavy artillery? Now you can, because Unreal Tournament 2004 has literally thousands of downloadable player skins and models you can find online.\n\nEven the stock game has a staggering 6gb of content. Lots of awesome maps, dozens of game modes, a single player campaign, custom solo skirmishes, and much more. The re-playability of UT2004 is endless.\n\nLastly, If you like Unreal Tournament '99, there's even more reason to buy and play this game, as there's now a very faithful adaptation of UT99 for UT2004 known as Unreal Tournament: 2341 - http://www.moddb.com/mods/ut2341-hd-arsenal","July 12, 2012","true","105.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As the name would suggest, realism is kept to a minimum and it's all about the action. Your character can dodge jump, double jump, use a translocator to jump around the level really fast. Your weapons are equally unrealistic and therefore fun. It supports a wide array of game modes from Deathmatch, to CTF, to Vehicle attack the enemy base, and more. It's also got over 80 professional quality custom maps that can be downloaded for free on the internet.\n\nWhile it has full bot support, it's best played with other people, and while it's not the most played game in the world anymore, it's still played by some.\n\nThe free demo is cross-compatible with the main game, meaning you can join a demo server and play with players playing the free version.","April 12, 2011","true","79.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That being said, I think this game is one of the greatest games made to date! I absolutely love it! Epic Games and their engine really did create what I'd consider a masterpiece that is UT2k4. Originally, I got introduced to the Unreal series through the predecessor UT2k3 when I was just a little kid and I almost instantly fell in love with the game. My family was fairly poor at the time, so they could never afford to buy me the game, so I had to get a pirated copy to play. Once 2k4 came out, I loved the even greater variety of game modes that it had to offer as well as the old game modes that were only offered in UT99 at the time. As soon as I started working and made a steam account, I bought Unreal Tournament 2004 because I really do think it's well worth its price. Heck, I even bought it for a few of my close friends for them to play too just because the Unreal series NEEDS to be known, or at least I think it should be. I'll start out with the positives and the things I love about this game.\n\nPositives:\n- Multiple multiplayer game modes\n- Very different difficulty levels of AI's that do test your skill well, or can help you learn easily\n- Generally strong, polite, dedicated community (I've met moderators of maps that still hang around ever since the game launched!)\n- Immersive and very well balanced gameplay\n- Fast paced\n- Challenging (In all honesty, I think this game truly tests your weapon handling skills in terms of shooter games)\n- Fun community game mods and a very well done game editing kit\n- Competitive\n- Satisfying gameplay\n- Many gaming and option features\n- Character design is fresh and different, many maps to play on, and large gun variety (as well as some sweet vehicles too!)\n\nNegatives:\n- Arena shooters aren't as popular as they used to be\n- Graphics are outdated (Who cares?)\n- The rare but occasional hacker\n\nHonestly, for me, the negatives don't even hold a candle to the overall game and my rating for it is an easy 10/10\nThat being said, if you want to test your shooting, dodging, reaction time and/or any other skills I highly recommend this game!","March 17, 2014","true","36.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Given that it is so old now, it should run great on just about any computer you throw it at.

Playing it now (May 2014) brings back lots of good memories of when I first played it when I was in college back in 2004. Onslaught is still my favorite game mode!

It has nice graphics, interesting and fun weapons and vehicles, many characters, all with backstories and is a fun, fast paced arena shooter. Lots projectile dodging, out manuevering your oponents, everything you could ask for except dedicated character customization. All this fun comes at a price, however. Multiplayer servers are slower than UT3's and the community isn't the nicest for ladies, gentlemen, and variations there upon on a budget looking for a fun game to play. If you want a fun, nice looking game at a low price, UT2004 is your game. For more of a story, more customization and hoverboards and all that jazz, check out UT3. They're both very different games but both have that fun, arena shooter fun.

The graphics are a bit dated sure, but the gameplay is amazing. It has a good variety of the weapons, and every gun seems to have a alt fire that compliments the gun nicely. Same with vehicles. It has a giant viaration of levels and gametypes, and you are free to download maps that other uses have made.","January 8, 2015","true","16.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rigsteel/recommended/13230/","rigsteel","Rig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rigsteel/","506 products in account","Temos aqui o terceiro (em ordem cronológica) título da série Unreal lançado no Steam. Lançado em 2004 e que teve o Unreal Engine 2.5 como base. Um FPS frenético onde tiros de metralhadoras, foguetes, plasma e ogivas nucleares vão garantir que você não saia vivo. Agora temos a presença de veículos, mais classes e novos modos de jogo para garantir a diversão por muitas e muitas horas.\n\nAvaliação:\nClasses/Raças: 9/10Temos poucas opções de customização de personagens, nada além de opções de rosto e cor das vestimentas, porém porém isso é mais que suficiente pois na maioria das vezes os corpos simplesmente explodem no meio da partida. Apesar disso, temos cerca de 11 raças para escolher. Não faz muita diferença, pois o importante é destruir o adversário antes que ele te destrua.\n\nModos de jogo: 10/10Unreal Tournament 2004 traz diversos modos de jogo. Muitas horas garantidas e muita variedade para todos os gostos. Estes são alguns dos modos de jogo disponíveis:\n\n-Onslaught: Neste modo de jogo a grande jogada é o uso de veículos, e você precisa destruir todas as bases inimigas para capturá-las em link, todas elas espalhadas em um mapa enorme. Capture todas as bases para ter acesso ao Power Core da equipe inimiga, e destruí-lo. Há grandes conflitos concentrados em bases-chave.\n-Bombing Run: Uma espécie de futebol assassino. Você tem que pegar a bola que está no meio do mapa e atirá-la no arco (gol) inimigo. Arremessando a bola você faz 3 pontos, pulando junto com ela você faz 7 pontos. A bola pode ser passada aos aliados, e é derrubada se você for morto.\n-Capture the Flag: Este clássico ainda está presente. Faça pontos capturando a bandeira inimiga e levando-a até a sua.\n-Double Domination: Seu time faz pontos ao capturar os 2 pontos de controle e mantê-los por 10 segundos. Cada ponto fica em um lado do mapa.\n-Mutant: Uma partida Deathmatch comum, e o primeiro a morrer se torna o "mutant". Este jogador recebe munição ilimitada, camuflagem e super-velocidade, mas perde saúde com o tempo. Quando o "mutant" é morto, os poderes dele passam para quem o matou.\n\nMúsica: 9/10A trilha sonora do jogo é interessante, se diferencia um pouco do estilo das músicas de seu antecessor, mas continua sendo bem "animada". Ideal para um jogo frenético como este.\n\nGráficos: 10/10Belos gráficos, muito melhorados se comparados ao Unreal Tournament anterior, agora temos mapas em vastas florestas, cavernas subterrâneas, naves espaciais, mapas submersos e até mesmo do lado de fora de naves no espaço!\n\nControles: 10/10Os mesmos controles de um FPS comum. Algo que pode ser difícil no começo é o sistema de esquiva (apertar duas vezes rapidamente para alguma direção faz seu personagem "desviar" para aquele lado. O que também pode fazer um novo jogador se confundir são os atalhos para as armas, pois temos um total de 19 armas!\n\nArsenal: 10/10Ah, o arsenal de UT2004 continua sendo letal e variado. Dentre as mais interessantes temos:\nO Translocador, que te permite atirar um disco em qualquer lugar do mapa e se teletransportar para o local onde o disco está;\nO Bio Rifle, que atira placas de lixo tóxico que grudam nas paredes e na superfície da água;\nA Link Gun, um rifle que atira rajadas de plasma quente ou uma rajada contínua do mesmo;\nO Flak Cannon, uma arma que atira estilhaços quente de metal nos inimigos, que ricocheteiam nas paredes;\nO Rocket Launcher, dispensa comentários, lançador de foguetes que também pode lançá-los em forma de granadas temporizadas. É possível soltar até 3 foguetes ao mesmo tempo;\nRedeemer, a arma mais poderosa do jogo. Lança uma ogiva nuclear com imensa área de impacto, o que garante diversos Multi-Kills. No tiro secundário, é possível controlar a ogiva com uma câmera. Apesar do poder de fogo, a Redeemer só pode carregar 1 ogiva por vez.\n\nServidores: 8/10Temos diversos servidores com a grande maioria dos modos de jogo disponíveis ao redor do mundo, sendo assim o lag pode ser algo a atrapalhar, ainda mais num jogo com ritmo frenético como este. Apesar disso, o Single Player ainda pode ser um grande desafio nos modos de dificuldade mais avançados.\n\nNota final: 9.4/10\n\nA série Unreal Tournament foi (e ainda é) um dos grandes pilares dos FPS, ao lado de jogos como Quake e Counter-Strike. É um FPS especialmente interessante para se jogar, pois proporciona uma experiência bem diferente da que outros jogos de tiro podem te dar. Vale muito a pena.","June 8, 2013","true","31.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Singleplayer can be a lonely experience, and the last time I checked I found the public multiplayer scene to be underpopulated. If you do find a server, you had better be skilled.\n\nIf you decide to pick up UT2k4, I have some mod recommendations for you:\n\n- Get the first two Community Bonus Packs (CBP1 & CBP2). Together, they comprise three volumes of the best maps that the UT2k4 community produced.\n\n- Pick up the Ballistic Weapons mod, by Runestorm. It provides an overhaul of the game's weapons and mechanics, and it serves as a nice diversion from vanilla.\n\n- Also, check out the Fraghouse Invasion mod. Its maps might not be as pretty as the Community Bonus Packs, but it's great fun,\n\nHave a great time!","December 27, 2014","true","187.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Taken with Unreal Tournament 3, we can see the sad consequences of a gaming industry that increasingly tries to mimic the film industry (is there a real difference anymore?), though the evidence for that claim is a little more implicit between these two titles... The later has fewer maps: Unreal Tournament 2004 has 106 maps\n\n(http://liandri.beyondunreal.com/Unreal_Tournament_2004#Maps)\n\ncompared to the 47 that shipped with Unreal Tournament 3\n\n(http://forums.epicgames.com/threads/579659-Full-UT3-Map-list)\n\nOne only needs a brain to realise this is less than half. Furthermore, UT3 spreads these maps over 8 game types compared to 10 in UT2004. Why then did UT3 Cost $60 when new, and UT2004 cost $40 despite having only 3 years between release dates? The obvious answer is, it looks better. Many more people are needed to create a new Engine than are needed to create new maps; many more people mean many more salaries to pay whilst maintaining agreeable profits.\n\nWhy should the gamer settle for less and pay more? The argument that better graphics make up for the defecit can easily be exploded by taking it to its logical conclusion: Would one pay a very large amount, say $100 or more, for a photorealistic game that lasted only several hours? If the answer to that is yes, it in turn begs the question: Why not buy a film?\n\nOf course, very little can be done about this trend in practice; big developers will continue to develop, with teams of thousands, games that look fantastic and gross multi-million figures. These games will be short and expensive. These games will have neither pretension nor surplus content (except that that must be brought later). This should not manifest as defeatism however, and least of all complacency.\n\nTo undermine this trend, at least in part, one can: Support indie developers by purchasing their games, and being more vocal about them, not pre-order games that promise in advance to be lack-lustre, not pay double the retail price for a bas relief tin and a pamphlet; I am talking here of Legendary Editions and so on (What is legendary about a metal case, art book and a making of... DVD?), be dubious of games released in a yearly fashion, or jack it in all together and find a new hobby.\n\nIn any case, UT2004 remains a great game in its own right. The volume of content ensures many unique experiences by definition, and the game still has a strong online aspect to be enjoyed. It is fun in the sadistic way that shooting things is, and it sets itself too few pretensions to have any serious flaws. It discarded very little from the original title and updated the graphics to the standard of the time, and it did this without skimping on the things that make a game a game, namely characters, levels and modes, showing yes- it can be done, so yes- I recommend it.","December 30, 2013","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unreal Tournament 2004 is just amazing from all corners. It features a wide variety of gametypes to suit any player. This includes, but is not limited to: Assault, Invasion, Mutant, Last man standing, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the flag, Bombing run, Osnlaught and Double domination.\nThere is also a huge amount of mods and addons for this game that can expand the game by adding more gametypes or modifications called mutators that can modify bits and pieces or even large parts of the game making it more fun and interesting. Graphics and performance are both really good for a game so old, getting 100+ FPS with a modern computer is a piece of cake showing it is well optimised. If all the time I spent playing this game was recorded, I would definitely have over 2000 hours of it which shows you how much fun I've had.

It's VERY fast, VERY brutal and unforgiving, and it requires so practice to get good, but the end result is very much worth it.

Taken with Unreal Tournament 3, we can see the sad consequences of a gaming industry that increasingly tries to mimic the film industry (is there a real difference anymore?), though the evidence for that claim is a little more implicit between these two titles... The later has fewer maps: Unreal Tournament 2004 has 106 maps\n\n(http://liandri.beyondunreal.com/Unreal_Tournament_2004#Maps)\n\ncompared to the 47 that shipped with Unreal Tournament 3\n\n(http://forums.epicgames.com/threads/579659-Full-UT3-Map-list)\n\nOne only needs a brain to realise this is less than half. Furthermore, UT3 spreads these maps over 8 game types compared to 10 in UT2004. Why then did UT3 Cost $60 when new, and UT2004 cost $40 despite having only 3 years between release dates? The obvious answer is, it looks better. Many more people are needed to create a new Engine than are needed to create new maps; many more people mean many more salaries to pay whilst maintaining agreeable profits.\n\nWhy should the gamer settle for less and pay more? The argument that better graphics make up for the defecit can easily be exploded by taking it to its logical conclusion: Would one pay a very large amount, say $100 or more, for a photorealistic game that lasted only several hours? If the answer to that is yes, it in turn begs the question: Why not buy a film?\n\nOf course, very little can be done about this trend in practice; big developers will continue to develop, with teams of thousands, games that look fantastic and gross multi-million figures. These games will be short and expensive. These games will have neither pretension nor surplus content (except that that must be brought later). This should not manifest as defeatism however, and least of all complacency.\n\nTo undermine this trend, at least in part, one can: Support indie developers by purchasing their games, and being more vocal about them, not pre-order games that promise in advance to be lack-lustre, not pay double the retail price for a bas relief tin and a pamphlet; I am talking here of Legendary Editions and so on (What is legendary about a metal case, art book and a making of... DVD?), be dubious of games released in a yearly fashion, or jack it in all together and find a new hobby.\n\nIn any case, UT2004 remains a great game in its own right. The volume of content ensures many unique experiences by definition, and the game still has a strong online aspect to be enjoyed. It is fun in the sadistic way that shooting things is, and it sets itself too few pretensions to have any serious flaws. It discarded very little from the original title and updated the graphics to the standard of the time, and it did this without skimping on the things that make a game a game, namely characters, levels and modes, showing yes- it can be done, so yes- I recommend it.","December 30, 2013","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unreal Tournament 2004 is just amazing from all corners. It features a wide variety of gametypes to suit any player. This includes, but is not limited to: Assault, Invasion, Mutant, Last man standing, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the flag, Bombing run, Osnlaught and Double domination.\nThere is also a huge amount of mods and addons for this game that can expand the game by adding more gametypes or modifications called mutators that can modify bits and pieces or even large parts of the game making it more fun and interesting. Graphics and performance are both really good for a game so old, getting 100+ FPS with a modern computer is a piece of cake showing it is well optimised. If all the time I spent playing this game was recorded, I would definitely have over 2000 hours of it which shows you how much fun I've had. I definitely recommend this game to any arena shooter fan or anyone who might enjoy the fast-paced action this game brings you.

It's amazing.","June 24, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd played good ones before, like DN3D, and Doom and stuff, but then came this, THIS game, and it blew me away. Then I played Unreal, as I recall. I played that afterwards, I don't really know how I missed it.\n\nAnyway. That was it. I was a huge fan of UT from then on. It was great fun with friends and family.\n\nThen UT 2003 came out, and that, that was an awesome game. I loved it. I loved it... but I actually preferred '99. I don't really remember why. I still played the hell out of UT 2003 though. Then, we got 2004. Which was so awesome I instantly switched to it and never really looked back (until now, really, I still love '99 because 2004 doesn't really capture the same spirit that '99 had).\n\nUT 2004 however is unbelievably fantastic. When it comes to turbo-classic FPS games, this one should be up there with Quake, Doom, Duke Nukem, Daikatana (pfft), whatever. It's considered by many to be the grand champion of the UT series, which is still going strong today (sort of).\n\nI, for one, am super hyped for the UT '99 remake, or whatever it is that Epic Games are doing. But until then, UT 2004. It's got mods, it's still being played, it's great. Get it.","December 7, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It definitely accomplished its goal. If you don't want to play an online game, there's still Tournament and Instant Action modes (not to mention LAN).  The AI is great, there's a lot of diverse weapons, gamemodes, VEHICLES, and maps for you to play.\n\nAs for gameplay, for most of the time, it's like a Quake Live that doesn't suck.  There's no rocket jumping, sadly; there's plenty of physics/ragdolls, gibbing/messy shredding, and flicking off aliens to make up for it.  Just as a heads up, UT3 was pathetic compared to this.  More than that, play this one and its graphics will still be on par with other games (it just doesn't have HDR/Bloom, that's all).\n\nMost of the time, you run around the map trying to take down as many enemies as you can while running from medkit to medkit.

Here's the reason why\n\nGraphics: "Muh graphics suck" is no longer an excuse because both game have outdated graphics. You wouldn't buy Unreal Tournament for muh graphics now, would you?\n\nDomination: Let's face it, the mod domination suck in UT2k4 while in the old unreal tournament, it is an epic win.\n\nNew weapons: they are all weaker vs they original state, i find way better the sniper rifle than the lighting gun, because the lighting gun aim like ♥♥♥♥. The so called replacer for rocket launcher can't shoot multiple rocket at the same time making it weak. Oh and did i mentionned that the good old rocket launcher can no longer throw grenade?\n\nless gore: I can't believe i'm saying this but there is more gore in UT98 than in UT2k4... yeah i'm dead serious. if you're lucky, maybe a part of a guy will explose from time to time, but you won't be able to explode the rest of the corpse like you can in UT98 and the corpse just vanish 5 second after you killed your target.\n\n♥♥♥♥ing farming: Now you can personalise your team and steal other's team's member. problem is, if you don't do it, you'll end up with a team that really suck, but you need to farm again and again to get this amount of money to be able to send them a challenge request and you have to win or you lose all your money so you have to farm again and again and again. So really, if you want a good old Unreal Tournament, get this one that come out in 1998... If you really are a die fan of unreal tournament and want them all for yourself, well yes those point might not be the biggest deal. Do what you want really, i just told why i don't recommend this game, but if you want to buy it, who care? certainly not me.","June 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 66 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","5","66","0","0"

It's an arena shooter like Quake III and Ziggurat. I just recently bought the game on Steam and am still finding things that I remember from playing pretty long time ago. Those things I forgot about wuld most likely be characters (there are so freaking many), or maps (even more than so freaking many), or maybe weapons, or the soundtrack of the game.\n\nCharacters There are way more than enough characters to satisfy anyone with 10 categories of characters, and at least 8 characters in each one. Every category is unique and about half are even human! :D\n\nMaps There are definitely a variety of choices for your arena to blast each other to bits in. From a big glacier, to a small building, to a futuristic low-gravity city, there's always a map for you. Including almost all of the maps from Unreal Tournament, plus about doubling that from new maps, also another 15 maps can be obtained through bonus packs, there is a total of a WHOPPING 121 MAPS!\n\nWeapons  The huge selection of 19 weapons are wacky and unique from any other games, and sometimes overpowered (hint, hint, the redeemer: basically a small nuclear bomb). But still the overpowered ones are hard to find. Some weapons are only featured in specific gamemodes, but most can be used all of the time.\n\nMusic The weapons of the game would be my favorite about UT 2004, but surprisingly enough, the music would be my second favorite. You can't explode everything that moves without an epic soundtrack playing in the background! This game definitely masters that.\n\nFinal Thoughts Unreal Tournament 2004 is a fantastic game and overall has pretty good graphics for its time. Anyone who likes arena shooters should definitely buy it. I give it a  9/10.","December 7, 2014","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, this helps in that you can get more bots or players going at once without having overcrowding. This game has lots of modes to offer and plenty of mutators like original UT.

I played UT2004 and nothing else for almost 5 years.

But I have tried in compatibility mode for many different service packets, even the service packet I had when I first started playing this game which was Windows XP / Windows Vista /\n\n\nI could possibly get it to work if I downgraded OS but I choose not to. This is an amazing game but honestly steam.....get with the time, this game isn't supported for any future OS.\n\nShame to say get rid of it but I'm kind of annoyed I paid $5 for a game that I can't play because I contribute to OS beta testing.\n\n\n\n","July 8, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

UT2K4 has all the mods I liked of UT99 and has even more custom skins and models that people have made that look great. I mean hell I can play as an adorable fox girl in UT2K4. I can't do that in UT99 or UT3, and until UT4 comes out I can't play that as anything but Stock Male #3 which is DULLLLLL.\n\nSo yeah. I'm still playing this because I can play Junkwar or Ballistic Weapons or have a ninja rope or play as a cute fox girl with huge guns (I do mean guns, not boobs; don't be ridiculous, you are not 12 years old. unless you are. in which case do your parents know what you are doing??), or I can do all of those at the same time.\n\nAnd you know what?

It's fast, it's brutal, it's fun and it makes me wonder why I would ever want to play anything else. The graphics hold up surprisingly well coming out the same year as Half Life 2 and GTA SA and even better than some games that came out last year. There's nothing better than capturing the last flag or getting the last frag in instagib and it's always good to hear "HOLY SH*T" When you set your graphics to the max and hear the sexy lady shout out "GODLIKE" when you're just killing people. I played all the way through UT3 and some of the original Unreal Tournament but this is by far the best one. If you have a chance you should also check out UT4, luckily it's going to be a PC exclusive (dont quote me on that) so it will not be downgraded for consoles hopefully.","February 3","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would get UT3 but I don't like its aesthetic and I don't like how it STILL doesn't have the same amount of mods and custom models as UT2k4.\n\nAs a result, I still have UT2k4 and I'm not giving it up. UT2K4 has all the mods I liked of UT99 and has even more custom skins and models that people have made that look great. I mean hell I can play as an adorable fox girl in UT2K4. I can't do that in UT99 or UT3, and until UT4 comes out I can't play that as anything but Stock Male #3 which is DULLLLLL.\n\nSo yeah. I'm still playing this because I can play Junkwar or Ballistic Weapons or have a ninja rope or play as a cute fox girl with huge guns (I do mean guns, not boobs; don't be ridiculous, you are not 12 years old. unless you are. in which case do your parents know what you are doing??), or I can do all of those at the same time.\n\nAnd you know what?

Buying/selling arena fighters, each with their own attributes and weapon preferences and then playing with the is the most fun this game offers. They can get injuries as well, which you need to treat, or else they remain on the bench. You can assign them positions on the field as well (cover you, defend/attack base, sweep etc.)\n\nIt's an amazing idea and very well suited for a game like UT.

Haven't played online multiplayer yet, but sure that it'd be pretty good too.

Fantastic solo and team FPS play.  So many different game types (DM, Team DM, 1 on 1 Arena DM, CTF, Vehicle CTF, Onslaught, and more)..  And Mutators - which allow you to tweak and alter the game in interesting and sometimes hilarious ways.\n\nAnd the community is second to none.  The Unreal Editor has always been free, and the community have used it to create killer maps, and even complete mods for different games altogether.\n\nI think UT 2004 still looks great, and now in 2015, will probably run on most everybody's machine.\n\nUT 99 (the original) was great and so was UT 3.  UT 2014/15 (currently in Alpha and free to play) is looking so good too.  But if i had to pick a favorite, it is this one:   UT 2004.","May 28, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of the last stands of the classic arena based shooter. And thanks to the community you can enjoy thousands of custom characters, maps, game modes, vehicles, and weapons. No prestige grind, no rank ups, just pure unrealistic action in one of the greatest shooters of all time.

This game will always be one of my favorites.\nI also like how the servers are still running with online players daily so I can run around and blow up power nodes.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend this game to anybody who likes teamwork, objectives, and shooter games because Unreal Tournament 2004 has plenty of that and much more.","May 27","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
