(If you look closely, you may find a few well placed nods to the now classic show that run from 1993 to 2002 and spawned several films...) You're a bit of Scully and Mulder, all boiled into one, as you rush to a friend's aid, and are immediately thrust into investigating weird events, coverups, and all manner of mayham and murder taking place in the small coastal town of Serpent Creek. A host of creepy (there's that word again), eccentric, and sly characters come out of the wood work to either help, or dissuade you, or just plain turn a blind eye on what's really going on in the community.\n\nThe game's investigative mode is very unique and in part, has you becoming a profiler of sorts. There's getting inside  the mind of your unknown suspect, retracing footsteps, and piecing together fragmented clues. Of course, there are Hidden Objects and cleverly designed puzzles along the way as well too. Vocals and musical themes are as always top notch. The look and feel of the game are rich in terms of the color spectrum. The storyline and plot are strong with deeper things going on under the surface.\n\nAll in all a great buy, fun time, and very entertaining! Oh and did I mention that there's an unruly cat and ssssssssssssssssssssssssnakesssssssssssssssssssssssss everywhere?! Have fun my friends. Have fun...","July 4, 2015","true","10.2"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","42","46","0","14"

It is a decent HOG to keep you busy for 2-3 hours straight with a subtle taste for noire. It is not exceptional compared to the rest of Artifex Mundi collections, but it is refreshingly well-done for the HOG genre itself anyway.\n\nOur character, a lady private eye comes to the little town of Serpent Creek to investigate the disappearance of her journalist friend, Helen during Serpent Creek's famous Serpent Festival. We are quick to notice that there is an obscene amount of serpentine references going about the town; alongside mysterious disappearances, earthquakes and zombie-like citizens. The story gets more and more complicated between a moody hotel manager, a veteran sheriff, a suspicious British guest and a disturbingly oblivious mayor... What to do?\n\nWhile the character modelling is appealing in animation, the psychological portrayal and demeanor designs of characters especially take the cake on this one. They are definitely interesting and elegant enough to keep you interested with the story revelation. People look and act similar to cover arts for classical Nancy Drew books with an extra dose of eerie and suspicion about them. You keep second guessing about characters, tying them to any kind of dreadful business the moment you see them. I won't lie, the outcome is not extraordinary, yet the display is certainly worth your time. The background artwork is also pretty and comes strong on establishing atmospheres.\n\nThe game contains some of the more imaginative puzzles that I've encountered within genre, alongside some entertaining lock picking puzzles. What I especially liked was investigation scenes where we are expected to pick up some clues around to deduce the recent happenings within the room. Hidden object scenes were ordinary if not a bit too easy. The usage of the map, action indicators and its teleportation feature are all present to bring you a relief for achievement hunting.\n\nAll in all, the game is worth the money for a HOG gamer, or anyone looking for a time kill with both noire and mystical atmosphere. If it is on sale, even better.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 6","true","4.7"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","3"

It's a bit short, but I think if it was any longer the story would drag.\n\nNothing revolutionary, but if you like to chill out and blow through a casual game with a decent story and easy achievements, it's fun and worth picking up especially in a bundle or super cheap sale.","October 10, 2014","true","5.5"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","3"

And to make it immediately clear: I liked it a lot! It's stylish, cleverly designed and it has an original story.\n\n9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creek was developed by Tap It Games and published by the well-known Artifex Mundi in July 2013. Some research out of my newly-found interest in this genre, has learned me that Artifex Mundi is perhaps THE prime publisher of this kind of games, and after playing a second one of their games, I can safely confirm that they stand for quality and sheer gaming pleasure.\nThe Secret of Serpent Creek could be defined as an adventure-light, or casual adventure game, with a touch of horror added to it. The story is quite original and entertaining and certainly proved interesting enough to keep my interest right through to the final stages. I won't spoil it here, suffice it only to tell that it is also suited for teenagers and maybe even younger children, since there is no offensive context in any way. There are also a whole bunch of helping-tools, perfectly adaptable to everyone's needs with three difficulty levels. Exactly as how it should be done in this kind of games, imo.\nThe actual gameplay is very much point-and-click orientated, with static screens following upon each other. Most of the times there are objects to be found to advance to the next screen, to solve a puzzle, or to be combined with each other. Thanks to the very intuitive inventory, all this can be done in a smooth manner, and thanks to the map (with fast-travel system incorporated), the amount of backtracking is limited. The shining point of the game are the famous "Hidden Object" scenes, where one has to click several named objects in order to find one story-related object. As easy as this may sound, it proved quite a lot of fun, and even challenge to a non-native English speaker as me. I made a sport out of it not to consult any dictionay, and I've certainly learned a whole bunch a new English word just by playing this game ;-). Apart from the Hidden Object-screens, there are also quite some well-designed puzzles, more of a challenge but still very well designed and easily solved with some thinking.\n\nSince gameplay is limited to pointing, clicking and thinking, graphics and sound are very important to me in this kind of adventure (light). And in these departments 9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creek certainly delivers. The scenes are vividly painted, with bright coulours if needed and lots of visual clues. Sound-wise, there's not much to complain about: voice-acting is fine, only the music could have delivered more of a punch.\nAll in all, this was a very fine first encounter for me wtih this genre, and with the quality-products Artifex Mundi delivers. Don't hesitate if you like this kind of games, and do give it a try when you're curious about them. It's not expensive, and as icing on the cake: it comes with Trading Cards and a set of Steam Achievements that can be made into a perfect game without too much hassle.\n\nGameplay: 23/30\nGraphics: 15/20\nSound: 7/10\nLongelivety: 6/10 (decent lenght for this kind of games but not much beside that)\nTechnical: 9/10\nSteam Integration: 10/10\nPersonal appreciation: 8/10\n\nOverall: 78/100","October 23, 2014","true","7.6"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","1"

With how many there are and the near identical formula used as their base, unless it's appalling or extraordinary I find myself scratching my head for something more elaborate and articulated to say than "it's good for fans of the genre". Artifex Mundi's games however are something of an exception to that rule, as more than most casual developers they've shown a desire to strive to better their games with each release, reusing the same basic template but refining it along the way.\n\n9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creek so far as I've explored their catalog is the best example of Artifex taking criticism to heart and using it to turn out a more enjoyable, polished experience. The narrative is a fairly predicable Scooby Doo-esq mystery, in a mysterious town full of odd people that seem just a little too obsessed with snakes. It didn't surprise me, nor is it especially well written, but there's a very typical Artifex charm in the way the story plays out as if they know it's derivative but it's the best they can do so they're still going to give it their all to make it entertaining. The voice acting is a significant step up from what they've managed in the past, perhaps thanks to the fact that the characters presented are so strange that any stilted exchange or bizarre inflection becomes a part of the character instead of sounding like an intern was pulled in at the last moment to record a few lines.\n\nThe hidden object scenes themselves, though as usual something of a treat on the side to the main casual adventure game meal, feel more logical in how they're placed and presented. Gone are the random cascades of junk shoved into random corners of the environment, replaced with a handful of scenes that make sense in the narrative (though it's still a little hard to believe anywhere in the world is quite so cluttered with pieces of machinery scattered all throughout the town). And perhaps most worthy of note is the addition of fast travel at long last, which eliminates the tedious back tracking which is already thankfully minimized do to the shorter, but much tighter experience.\n\nSo yes, it would be easy to simply say 9 Clues is a great HOG and you should certainly give it a chance whether you're already a fan of the genre of not, but I think it's worth pointing out the areas Artifex Mundi has put in the effort to improve their game in a genre so lacking in inspiration or often considered to be of a high quality. It's going to be hard to go back to their older games I've yet to play, but it also has me excited moving forward seeing how dedicated they are to making their games as excellent as they can be.

Arriving there, apparently, nothing seems wrong, apart perhaps that man in a flower shirt, Owen...\n\nAs any Artifex Mundi, this game is of quality. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy it as I should. It was kinda hard to enter the story this time because I have immediately understood who was the culprit, contrary to Grim Legends for example.\n\nI had a problem with one of the HO scenes where, despite clicking on the right item, it wasn't being picked up. I don't know how I managed to get it past (clicking and clicking and finding finally the hitbox), yet, it was frustrating. I don't know if it had been solved or not as I uninstall the game once I got everything I wanted from it.\n\nBut despite this, it's an Artifex Mundi game: well polished, well thought, good visuals, good soundtrack and with nice twists.\n\nGiven the fact that I've played the game a long time ago, why the review now? Guess what will be released in a few days? 9 Clues 2! It seems a little more darker than the first 9 Clues, more psychological (yay!), so, it was time to put a review for the game :).\n\nBuy it anyway :).","July 21, 2015","true","2.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Being that it has a pretty specific storyline, it doesn't have much replayability--the only real difference seems to be that some of the hidden object minigames ask for different items (excluding the one item you need for the storyline), but since you do a lot of them twice, it ends up all being the same stuff.\nFor example:\nPlaythrough One - Find STORY ITEM 1, star, fish, and shovel. Later you go back and find the STORY ITEM 2, book, wrench, and ball.\nPlaythrough Two - Find STORY ITEM 1, fish, ball, and wrench. Later you go back and find STORY ITEM 2, shovel, book, and star.\n\nI finished the game (completing the story + a second playthrough for the achievements I missed) in ~5hrs. It's enjoyable the first time (even if a pretty weird story). And, you may end up replaying it for any achievements you miss. I'd say look into the Trade thread and trade someone for a 50% off coupon if you don't already have it.

Yes.\nIs it as good as some of the other Artifex Mundi hidden object games? ...not really, no.\n\nYou're a private investigator coming to the sleepy town of Serpent Creek to find her friend that is a reporter.\nThe problem I have with the game is pretty much in the title already. What could be the secret of Serpent Creek?\n\nWell, it's snakes. Sorry if this is a terrible spoiler for you, but it's right there in the name of the game.\nThe rest of the plot basically plays out on automatic as well. The people that look shifty turn out to be the villains, the ones that look friendly or attractive are helping you in the end.\nIt flaunts its new "Detective Mode" which is little more than a mini-game a few times throughout the story that has you piece together what happened in a location. It's neat enough, but far from ground breaking.\n\nSo what's left? A decent hidden object game. Nothing spectacular, nothing out of the ordinary, but well executed with high production values like those you've come to expect from Artifex Mundi.\nIf you've exhausted their other games I would recommend it, but it's not their best game by a long shot.\nIf you haven't played their other games, perhaps start with Nightmares from the Deep instead.","September 22, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The puzzles are not difficult at all which incidentally also makes this a fun game to play. There is a fair variety in the puzzles so you dont exactly get bored. I especially liked the puzzles with jigsaw pictures and picking locks. I finished the game in under 3 hours (not in one sitting) and also completed 17 of the 19 achievements at the same time. Unfortunately, there is not much replayability value in this one. You may want to do but only if you wish to unlock all the achievements. The story is mostly linear though you have to go to and fro to solve some puzzles. There is not much originality to the story, but even so the game is pretty enjoyable.

During the story you are going to witness odd things that you can’t really explain while also meet strange characters who speak in an odd way or just show a strange behavior.\n\nIn order to advance in the story you will have to get certain items weather to unlock doors, cut fences or disable some switches. To get these objects you must play a classic hidden object mini-game every now and then or you may have to solve puzzles who may test your intellect but in the end you won’t have to struggle much to understand them. It is possible to choose the difficulty setting to your liking so that you can go through the game without worrying about penalties if you click on the wrong object for instance. Contrary to what the creator states in the “Features” page of the game, the game really gives you a big clue of who is the bad guy and who’s not so don’t mind the “Breathtaking plot full of unexpected twists” because the plot is really easy to follow and it’s really obvious about the main villain.\n\nIf you want some light-gaming experience and you like to solve mysteries, with some side puzzles, the game can offer you around 2-3 hours if you play at a normal rate. There’s no replay value unless you missed some clues and want to go back and start again in order to find them all.\n","January 15","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The 1950s noir detective story motif and the incredibly talented scene compositions– which feature slanted shots and lots of wide angle close ups– create a powerful atmosphere. Too bad the same cannot be said about the over the top characters and the horrible voice acting (not counting the protagonist, whose performance saves a few scenes).\n\nDespite the 2013 release date the low resolution graphics and some design flaws make it feel like as if the game was made around 2007, especially in the normal puzzle segments. It’s not like as if the game isn’t trying: it introduces a new HOP type called Detective Mode, a welcomed addition, and also an integral part of the story. But even that can’t help the largest problem, the length. Even the most casual player should be able to finish it well under three hours, making 9 Clues nothing more than a nice one-afternoon entertainment for a low price.","November 19, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The plot is reasonably good, the music and voice acting are done better than some (not perfect, mind you, but decent), and it's graphically well made.  The "detective scene" portions are, as far as I can tell, unique to this game and it's nice to see some variation in a genre that tends to reuse and overuse the same types of puzzles constantly.\n\nOne problem I can see is the length; I clocked in at 2.6 hours with only about 2 of those hours being in the first playthrough (the rest was going back to grab a missed achievement, since I'm crazy like that).  At this short of a play time, it does not warrant the full $9.99 price tag, but if you can find a decent sale, it's completely worth it.\n\nThe other potential "con" to the game is that the HO scenes are not at all challenging and the puzzles are also relatively simple to complete.  If you're a veteran HO gamer looking for challenging puzzles, this isn't what you're looking for.  But if you're interested in a casual, simple game that won't take too much brain-power to get through, you'll probably like it.\n\nTL;DR: this a fun, short, and casual game that is worth picking up on sale.","June 13, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected!\n\n9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creek is basically a fairly simple and linear adventure game (get items, use them on things, solve puzzles, advance a story) interspersed with occasional scenes where you have to click on specific objects in a pile of random junk. It's very well paced, and not at all frustrating or tedious like many adventure games. The story is basically an episode of Scooby-Doo, but that's okay.\n\nI only really have one problem with this game. Sometimes you have to do a hidden object puzzle more than once to get all the items you need from it. This is really unintuitive, because the puzzle isn't available to try again until after the game decides you need the second item from the puzzle.\n\nThere are other minor annoyances, like solutions to puzzles being a little eyeroll-inducing, but that's characteristic of the genre. Overall, this is a pretty decent adventure game and a great way to spend a few hours.","November 25, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed the creepy atmosphere and ridiculous plot-twists quite a bit. The voice acting is pretty good too, though some of the characters do sound a bit flat. (Luckily there are skip buttons available for cutscenes so you can just read the subtitles and move on if you so desire) My only complaint--and it's more of a critcism--is that none of the hidden object scenes were anywhere near as challenging as they are in other Artifex Mundi games. (I'm thinking of Enigmatis specifically since it shares a lot of similar themes with Serpent Creek) While this can be good news if you're looking for something casual to relax with, if you want more of a challenge, you might have better luck finding it elsewhere.

Well, this is that movie, just with clicking on lots of items. Serpent Creek is a pulpy adventure to find your reporter friend in a weird little seaside town where everyone acts like a creepy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In stark contrast with Haunted Past, this game is heavy on stingers and jumpscares but they're so goofy they become endearing. There's plenty of hilarious adventure game logic too, like needing an axe to chop up a little branch you could step over, using a knife to open a can of soda so you don't ruin your nails (pictured), and the classic "use gun on man" puzzle solution more than once. I really can't overstate the charm on display here, and the puzzles and item searches are mostly easy enough to keep the game rolling. The only times I got stuck were specifically because I chose the hardest difficulty where it does not highlight hidden object scenes for you, which is a problem because for some reason this game makes you do every scene twice at different points in the story. A strange annoyance, but not enough to hurt my opinion of the game.\n\nThere are investigation scenes as well where you click on 9 pieces of evidence and then listen to your character narrate an absolutely ridiculous series of events. There's voice-acting set to the Flash-level animation and it is just as goofy and terrible as it needs to be. The puzzles are pretty standard adventure game fare, minus really obnoxious ones like sliding blocks. The map is helpful, and the graphics are crisp enough to make out everything you need. I enjoyed this one quite a bit, and it even clocked in over the usual 2-hour mark.","September 22, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With a plotline that could give a nonsequetor episode of Spongebob Squarepants a run for its money as far as the ability to engage anyone above a second grade reading level, calling this game a "murder mystery" is akin to calling a go-cart a road ready, fully functioning vehicle.\n\nIf this had been a gift, I'd have stopped talking to the person to gift it.\n\nNot only are the "puzzles" shoddy at best, there's no question that this is a point-and-click game that does little more than engage you to blindly find the cat. find the rat. find the bat. Resist the urge to shoot yourself in the wallet and uninstall Steam entirely.\n\nThe voice acting sounds like someone pulled the most culturally offensive sound files of a drunken party in New Zealand and claimed it was British with American overtones. I'm not sure if the girl in the opening cutscene "screamed" or if she stubbed her toe and let out a weak whine while running from a snake monster that looks like Voldemort got a little too friendly with one of his pets and created the abomination that is the antagonist.\n\nThis game made me want to die.","March 4","false","2.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

If you don't like the genre, this is certainly not going to change your mind, as it's pretty by-the-numbers.\nHowever, it's a well-polished example, and even combines with more point-and-click adventure elements, which are a nice change of pace from hidden-object all day everyday. The music is great and the ambience is unsettling, the graphics are well-drawn and the story, while not great, is decent enough.\n\nIt's probably not a game for the "hardcore gamer", as the puzzles themselves are pretty easy, and you should be able to power through them without much trouble. But it's a nifty little game to chill with an afternoon :)\n\nAlso, the game - as with many other hidden-object games - is a great way for people not very proficient in English to learn some new words. I spent 5 minutes searching for a fingernail before realizing that "nail" is also something that you can use with a hammer. Yes, I'm an idiot.\n\nOn Mac the game seems to have a broken integration with Apple Game Center (so just press 'Cancel' when asked to log in), and once or twice I ran into bugs that actually left puzzles unsolvable, but overall I still recommend 9 Clues for into hidden-object games or "light games" in general.","January 24, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a casual point and click and it is one of the easiest I have played so you don't really need the extra help that the game offers.\n\nThis is a puzzle and point and click adventure game. I know that most point and click games have puzzle elements but this one has a stronger focus on them. The main gimick seems to be item searching. You are presented a few times thoughout with a big pile of items and a check list to find them, it's a little bit like one of those games they have in the pub that promises to pay out but in the later levels most likely doesn't even have the items you want to find. The game also has detective mode where you click on a few of the background scenery and your character who puts sherlock holmes in the shade uses her powers of clavioyance to describe exactly what happend! Yes it does stretch the imagination a bit but that's what games are for right? :) On the harder difficulty it supposedly gives you a penalty for miss clicking but I missclicked a load of times to test it out and nothing seemed to change for me which is very strange. Could be a glitch? Or maybe you really do have to miss click like crazy before anything happens.\n\nAlthough there is detective work I wouldn't really say this is very film noir. It almost felt like a game for children but there was quite a lot of potty mouth at the end of it which was quite surprising for me. It has creepy moments but it is toned down a lot, this won't cause you any fright or jump scare but it is still somewhat disturbing.\n\nThe art work is very nicely done and an awful lot of it is voiced which is nice. Only 3 hours of gameplay though although your milage may vary. If you already own it like I do then it is worth your time and is a nice distraction. I have been suffering like mad with my GID over these last few day and maybe I am being a little more charitable then at a more relaxed time, but it took me out of this world for a few hours and that is worth a lot for me at the moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!

To it's credit it supports the Steam Overlay and widescreen resolutions, as well as Steam achievements and Trading Cards.  However, the games plot is somewhat cliched and predictable, despite clever but not too difficult puzzles.  My biggest complaint with the game is it's length.  I completed the entire game in just over 2 hours with 80% of the achievements.  I felt the find the object mini games in particular to be incredibly easy compared to comparable games on the market.  I did not come across any bugs during gameplay and the voice acting was passable if uninteresting.  Overall the game is a fair purchase, but should be avoided by any enthusiast who desires a real challenge or a lengthy adventure.","April 28, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the right balance of puzzles and mystery with some good "freaky" moments (like pop there's the bad guy in your face). I loved the story line and the constant directional changes in the story so its not predictable too much. Voice acting was amazazing and music draws you into the game. It's also one of those games you feel like you can't stop playing till you find out the ending (kudoos to Arti for that). Things I didn't like, there was maybe 2 gaps in the story that lacked a complete explanation but, they can lead to a sequel (which I sincerly hope there is one). Overall, I rate it a 10/10.\n\nPros:\n-Wonderful story\n-Captured mystery to a T\n-Excellent voice acting/music\n-Easy flow between areas (like you can click on the map to move to an area versus in Abyss where you couldn't, makes the game not seem too draggy or like you back track a lot even if you do).\n\nCons:\n-Needs a sequel\n","April 29, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like a lot of HoGs, the visuals are very much high up on the list of important aspects, and here the game does not disappoint.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nWith a very thin storyline, and a protagonist who flips between being a detective genius, followed by being a naive victim to quite possibly the worst-kept secret of all in this game: the main antagonist - I find it very difficult to recommend this game to anyone but the most dedicated of HoG-lovers.\n\nYes, these games don't hinge on storyline, but really what follows when you boot this game is a tiny amount of story, followed by a bout of kleptomania as you 'collect' everything that's not nailed down, and attempt to rescue your friend. The puzzles are fairly straightforward, which is fine - I assume I'm not the target audience here - but often the puzzles have zero bearing on the game's plot, instead just serving as unnecessary hurdles.\n\nI know there are plenty of fans of the genre, and I am - alas - not one of them, as such I am a tad biased.\n\nIf you see this game in a sale - do by all means pick it up for a bit of casual enjoyment, but don't expect anything too challenging.\n\nAs always - I've documented my progress in the form of a video series:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DETj7h4BHNo","April 24, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's true but for me very important are details in such game.\n\nLike for example that you can exit a "zoom in" by clicking anywhere not only down (all navigating is very intuitive) or when you talk with somebody only their sentences show up, you won't lose time for hearing obviosus things from your character.\n\nLevel of difficulty (on expert of course, why would any1 play this game on lower?) is perfect, you won't lose much time in hidden objects game while they are much more rewarding then in other games, mostly because of 1-2 items that need your interaction to find them like you need to take stamp, put it in ink, make stamp on paper and take that stamp.\n\nUsed object that you won't need anymore disappear from eq, so you won't be confused.\n\nBesides hidden objects minigame there are "find clues" minigame in which you don't see name of what you should find, but you need to figure out what can be clue, which is not very difficult but very rewarding.\n\nAlso there are other puzzles, all well thought, with nice graphic for some jigsaw puzzle and nice ideas like trying to put connected points on board so connections don't cross each other.\n\nAmount of "wtf i should do now" is low and usually short. Good thing this game is about figuring out things, not figuring out what developer wanted us to do.\n\nOh and soundtrack is very good imo, really good match for this game.\n\nThe best game of this type I've played so far.","February 10","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're sort of a reverse HOG:  you find things that look odd in a scene and it fills in the name down below.  The silly part is that the main character then uses those objects to come up with what happened in the scene.  And, she's just pulling that stuff out of her posterior dorsal when she does.  The sole reason I don't recommend the game at its current list price is its length:  it took me 3.3 hours to finish the whole thing with 100% Achievements.

At that price, you can take a risk, i played this one first because it came up on top of my steam games list (because it starts with '9').\nNot knowing what to expect, i was rather surprised by this game. The graphics are decent, the music and sound is good and the voice acting is very well done. It felt like playing an adventure game the first 10 minutes, because it has these elements of putting things in your inventory and using/combining them with other objects to make progress in the game and advance the story. However, soon enough you run into these 'hidden object' games, which i don't see the point of. You're presented with a list of objects and you have to find them, when you complete this task, you get a new object in your inventory you need to get further along the game. There are also puzzles to be found, you know the kind, activate all lights by turning the dails, arrange this or that without crossing other bits, ... After playing it for an hour or so, it started to feel more like a very light version of Nintendo's Professor Layton series (i say 'light' because it's not as good).\nThe story is very very predictable and so are the actions you have to take to advance. They are not hard as in real adventure games, which could have you scratch your head for days (back in time, when there was no internet yet and you couldn't look up the solution).\nWhat is left is a very well made and executed game that is rather simple and so falls more in the casual gaming field (at least that is how feel about it).

One is the story. There is nothing really wrong with the story in general, it's just that eveything is so obvious, there are puzzles that really makes you think, but there is as straight forward as a 3-piece comic strip. The second flaw is the length. It took me a little over 2,5h to beat this without hints. I would have liked a little more from the game, I know that it wasn't Artifex Mundi that were the developer, just the distributor of this game, but when you see their name on you expect a certain level of quality in it. But as I said, is a nice game, good artwork, sound and puzzles. The voice acting is a little wierd at times, but okey.

For casual players, though, it's a well-made romp.","May 13","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art work is great and the puzzles are satisfying. The plot is not the most sophisticated but it is enough to keep you engaged. Some of the voice acting is a bit questionable but overall it is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.","May 1","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/osirish/recommended/284870/","osirish","osirish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/osirish/","1070 products in account","A solid example of the HOG genre. Generic puzzles and HO scenes, with above average voice acting, and a typical HOG mystery story to follow. The strongest thing this game had to offer were the ambient sounds and soundtrack, which fit well with the subject matter and probably went unnoticed, which is the sign of a good soundscape.\n\nThe only issues were that the HO scenes were far too easy, and few, if any, of the puzzles were challenging and the graphics ranged from very detailed in some scenes, to very simple and basic in others with almost no interactivity.\n\nOverall, it's a good introduction to the genre, as you would expect from Artifex Mundi, but experienced HOG players will probably feel unchallenged even if they enjoyed playing through the story.\n","May 19","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was kind of wrong. By looking at the pictures I knew what kind of game this is and I tought that I dont like this kind of games. And I didnt like it for beginnig but I think it was only because I set my mind to "not like" this game. After 15min I sort of liked it and after 1h I knew that I had to finish this game before uninstalling it. And that what i did. I played it 2,5h in row and finished the game and uninstalled it. There is little bit replay value to try to finish it on harder difficulty but for me 1 time was enough. I dont want to this game any grade because it wouldnt show what I really experiensed. I think it was worth of playing once.","May 29","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
