Too many bugs and glitches. This was not tested or polished before being realeased. It is a very frustrating experience. Save your money and play something thst works. Even on sale it wasn't worth it. There are many better games of this genre too.","November 9, 2014","false","11.4"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","0"
