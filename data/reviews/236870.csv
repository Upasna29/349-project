If you get disconnected, it will instantly kick you out of your mission.\n\nNo stable internet, Steam or server connection issues?\nNo challenges/progression, no access to unlocked equipment/costumes/starting locations, no achievements.\n\nAddendum:\n\nI didn't expect people to actually respond to my short 'review', so here are a few more facts:\n\nThe games lets you play in a crippled offline mode but, besides being unable to use Contracts mode, they decided to give you a seperate offline 'save' with the following features:\n\n- access to the two tutorial levels and Paris\n- disabled progression in offline mode, can't earn XP, no points/mission ratings\n- unable to complete challenges (bonus objectives), so the only thing to do is to take out the target(s)\n- no access to unlocked weapons and gear\n- no access to unlocked starting locations\n- no access to unlocked extra costumes\n\nAll of this for the sake of 'protecting the leaderboards from cheaters', as people are claiming? How about pausing the game and offering an opt-out, so we can keep playing and and not lose another half hour when the server connection drops and instead only lose the ability to submit our scores for the current run?\nUnacceptable.\n\nDenuvo DRM is not to blame here rather than Square Enix, who decided to implement this intrusive online system. This is exactly the same as with Just Cause 3 (also published by SE, also a singleplayer only game!). MGS V: TPP has Denuvo, yet you are able to play offline perfectly fine (just without online features, duh).\n\nAlso I just felt like writing DRM instead of 'Square Enix Anti-cheat Solution'.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coflash/recommended/236870/","coflash","Phill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coflash/","863 products in account","My 47th review, how appropriate.\n\nI like this game, it's definitely a step up from Absolution, and I'd recommend it for the gameplay (but I'm not recommending it on Steam until all of the content is out and issues are fixed). But something other than the quirks of this game bothers me, and that's the amount of people making the comparison between this and Blood Money. eg: People calling it a "true sequel" to Blood Money. Or "Blood Money 2.0".\n\nBlood Money 2.0? Yeah, no. How many features did we lose from Blood Money, and the series in general?\nWe can no longer look through keyholes\nThere's no first person view\nWe can no longer upgrade weapons\nWe can no longer collect weapons from each level\nEveryone seems to speak in a US/UK accent, no matter where you go in the world, including the newly released Sapienza and Marrakesh. Even Hitman 1 and 2 had this sorted.\nWe can no longer use NPCs as shields and shoot at the same time\nCivilians no longer pick up weapons to try and fight you if you decide to go postal\nNo difficulty levels, which in turn means no degrees of AI, notoriety or save game limitations\nThe save system itself. The game is now an utter joke when it comes to having a high level of tension. Why worry about an action or what path to choose if you can just reload a save as many times as you like? I also like how 'challenges' can be completed even if you constantly reload.\nDual wielding from the first + third game are still absent\nThere's no sniper rifle case, the rifle simply floats on your back. Wasn't it promised that this would make a return? This is an issue because you always need a disguise to carry it, unlike before when the rifle was concealed in a case.\nWeapons in each level are the same as other levels\nWe can now choke out anyone we like, or donk them on the head with a hammer, or *insert 100 other ways to knock them out* - whereas before you had a set amount of sedatives to take people out of the equation without killing (or you had to be clever about it)\nThe AI never shut up with their commentary. Go play Blood Money and see how much they talk. This is one of the worst additions to Hitman, and really, it's just a gimmick all nextgen™ games use, it doesn't fit in with this series.\nPistols feel like machine guns without delays between shots, and shooting feels ♥♥♥♥ in general. Load up Blood Money and use a snubbed nosed pistol or an upgraded MP5. *That* feels like shooting. *That* feels like the weapon has some sort of impact.\nThe scripted sequences you can trigger. Oh god. I read from multiple sources that the Paris level didn't have any. After testing the level using various methods for ~7hrs, that's a load of crap. Both primary targets (and other important NPCs) are littered with them and can be triggered various ways, depending on how you approach them. The world doesn't feel organic when it's utterly tied to your presence. Here's an example of a test I ran: I killed 205 people in Paris yet neither of the main targets had tried to escape. Why? Because I hadn't triggered their appearance yet.\nThe game design in general is fairly lazy. The game is quite good looking with lots to do, but when you look at how each level works in detail then you'll realise how many similarities there are. eg: If there's a glass you can poison, then you can assume there's a toilet nearby, plus 1 or 2 ways to dispose of a body. Decent guard patrols are near non existent, this is why it's so easy to complete every level with the suit only. I'd actually say this is one of the biggest problems. Look at the main routes of any level, then look how devoid they are of any AI patrolling them. We've also gone from having disguises in Absolution that were next to useless, to disguises that are too effective, especially with the poor AI patrol routes.\n\nSaving, as mentioned in comparison to older Hitman games, is pathetic. There needs to be serious negative effects tied to saving to act as a deterrent to save-scumming, in this game more than any other game.\n\nThe good thing about previous Hitman games was that if you decided to do a level without stealth, the shooting mechanics were satisfying enough to enjoy that style of play. Not here though. Shooting feels incredibly claustrophobic. What's with having to zoom in so far when aiming? Why do we need hitmarkers to show we've killed somebody, a pool of blood and a lifeless body isn't enough? Good on them for removing the slow-mo effect when you headshot someone - but what's with the sound effect that plays every time you do shoot someone? And the giant crosshairs, especially for the shotgun? Console ten-foot UI garbage that doesn't belong on PC. The shotguns in previous games (especially Hitman 1 and Blood Money) were great and didn't need giant crosshairs that occupy up 30% of the damn screen.\n\nNone of this is even to mention what a joke the online system is, how elusive targets took over 2 months to be implemented once the game had released, the technical issues that still plague stability, or how the game has been cut up into pieces. I'm willing to bet that the only reason the game constantly auto saves is because of how it's tied to online dropping in and out. If they kept it like the old games where you couldn't save on the hardest difficulty level, you could potentially lose ~40 minutes of gameplay at any time.\n\nElusive targets were a major selling point for me (and others, I'm sure), but they don't really bring anything new to the game. Missions already consist of eliminating targets, eliminating them different ways, completing many challenges on offer, escalations, user created contracts and so on. By the time you've completed a decent amount of these activities, you've likely run through the level well over a dozen times. Then an elusive target comes along... and nothing's different. You simply have 48 hours in real time to kill them. You can restart as many times as you like so long as you haven't killed them, which again removes any tension the series was always known for. No new mechanics are added, nothing particularly interesting happens, it takes around 10-15 minutes to complete (assuming you know your way around the level), and then you wait a week or two for the next one. Pretty disappointing considering the hype.\n\nIt does have some decent additions - the graphics for one. The map is pretty detailed too, but more often than not, underutilised. The AI is (at times) a lot better with how they react to certain situations. But again, it's hampered by things like weapons falling through floors (constantly), guards dragging invisible bodies, guard AI running right past me while I'm actively shooting into a crowd, and crashing as soon as it all becomes too much for the engine to handle.\n\nIt has been over 3 months since it released and there's still no patch to address the DX12 crashing, random CTDs in general, or why I often slow to 20-30FPS on medium/high details with GTX980s in SLI and a 5930k. And worst of all; the amount of disconnects I've had to the servers while in-game.\n\nIt's hilarious how we're 10 years on from Blood Money, yet we've lost more features than we've gained. Blood Money 2.0, what a joke. You are beyond delusional if you still think that's a valid claim after having played the first two full missions for any length of time. The new additions are nothing with so many classic elements missing.\n\nI also wonder where it'll be in another 10 years. I can still play Blood Money as it was always intended to be played from 2006, in 2016. Will this online-ridden game be the same in 2026?","April 30","false","16.6"," 1,000 of 1,194 people (84%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","84","000","1","65","62"

ALWAYS ONLINE DRM!\n\nThe first three levels (2 tutorials + first real level) are really well done and so far I "was" having fun.\nThe game's DRM though prevented me from enjoying the rest of my evening, as apparently the game servers went down and game told me I am unable to load the saved game I made 2 minutes before, because I lost connection to the almighty game server. Stupid me, welcome to 2016 when the game tells you it is late and it's time to stop playing.\n\nThanks to that hidden feature, at least I have time to write this review. So let's start with three major points:\n\n1. The game is a technical disaster. Two 770GTX GPUs in SLI here - game settings fixed texture quality to Low with no way to change and also fixed maximum resolution to 1080p with options above, greyed out. (found out there is a way to set higher resolution via launch options and it works great, but apparently the devs didn't want to risk someone having a slight dip in FPS)\n2. Game divided into episodes. Seriously, this game is supposed to release a new level every month. The game developer/publisher wants me to play one level for a whole 30 days before they decide to give me the next slice of the pie I already paid for. That is of course if it lets you play, which gets me to the next point...\n3. ALWAYS F-IN ONLINE DRM! This is absolutely amazing, but apparently if you play with your internet connetion on, the game creates save games that are online-only! The game comes with a parental lock already implemented and it doesn't matter how old you are. When the game servers want to sleep, so should you! Stop complaining and welcome to 2016 world of DRMs. Truly unbelievable.\n\nHonestly I would say to wait for a patch, but the issues I described are design flaws and they won't be fixed. It is a pity as I loved every other previous Hitman game. This one also is very very good, but there is no way to play it... it is either missing levels or missing ability to load save games.\n\nThat said I could at least enjoy the rest of the beer I'm drinking, while writing this (instead of playing the game) and I hope someone will hesitate to buy after reading this. Let us all hope this episodic-always-online-♥♥♥♥ won't become the new era of video games.","March 11","false","61.6"," 1,047 of 1,252 people (84%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","84","047","1","47","15"

Instead a pop up shows up, stops you from playing, and gives you a choice : retry connexion, or go offline. This gives you a chance to fix whatever caused the loss of connexion, if it's on your side.\nBut if the issue is due to a server maintenance (which happens mostly when they are implementing an upcoming patch for any plateform), you have no choice but to go offline.\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nI WILL change this NO to a YES... if and only if that online bs is fixed.\nSo, I won't bother repeting anything that's been said hundreds of times here already.\n\nJust this : I expected this game to be a disappointment.

Controlling 47 is once again comfortable, precise and empowering. IO had the decency to allow for all the in-game assistances to be deactivated (I did keep the icons indicating which enemies can be suspicious). Overall, there are tons of good ideas, and an undeniable attention to detail. You feel free to explore and tackle the objectives how you see fit. By now most people might already know what big changes have been made since Absolution, like the revamped disguise system and the sandbox-ish open levels, so I won't say anything about this. These latter had been promised, they're here, there's nothing to complain about.\n\nI'll seize the opportunity to briefly mention the story: while we are just given a little glimpse at it, it does seem well-crafted and interesting. The prologue/tutorial takes place at the beginning of 47's career, when he first joined the ICA. The Paris level - and the rest of the game after that - takes place a few years after Hitman Absolution (without direct link to said episode, like a new start, a clean slate, in order for us to better appreciate the experience of playing as 47 when he does what he does best).\n\nEach destination will have its own ambience and each target, his background story. An overarching story ties it all together, and the balance is perfect : it is there, it is interesting, and it manages not to feel too intrusive.\n\nNevertheless, some design choices do manage to ruin the fun for me : the game requires you to be online. Should you be disconnected from the servers, the game will quit and you won't be allowed to load your saves. A distinction is being made between online and offline saves. This is unacceptable.\n\nThe game will slow down for no reason after shooting someone is the head, and so far this unadequate, inelegant "feature" cannot be deactivated. I hope IO patches this.\n\nThere are a few bugs here and there. For instance, I had a knocked out character stuck in a wall and I couldn't move him out of sight, it got me spotted and ruined an otherwise perfect run. Alright, probably it was also my fault for forgetting to save my game.\n\nThe AI can be exploited, it can be broken, it can feel dumb at times, but really, it still does its job, and overall, the NPCs truly feel alive and convincing. The scripting might need another debugging pass - I saw an (important) character ask for a drink after he had taken it and started drinking on it. I know, I know, it's just a detail, but still, one might expect such things not to happen.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are pretty. Once again, the Glacier engine delivers. The modeling and the texture works are good, even with the quality set to "medium". Lightning is really beautiful - not groundbreaking, but still - and overall, there is not much to say about it. The design itself appeals a lot to me, with plenty of details that help immersion and make the game feel believable.\n\nTechnical / Performance\nI play on Dx11, at 1080p, on the following setup :\n\nWindows 7 x64\nGPU : AMD HD7950 3Gb\nCPU : Intel Core i7 4970k @ 4GHz\n8Gb RAM\n\nAnd the game runs from a SSD.\n\nI had to put the in-game settings on medium because I had big framerate issues. Sacrificing a few settings - texture quality, detail level, shadow quality, texture filter, AA, etc - didn't render the game much less beautiful. Sadly, it did not improve performance either. Looking at the forums and other reviews, it appears that some people with similar or superior setups are reporting performance issues as well. So, based on that hardware, I should expect a higher performance. Don't get me wrong - it is decent, with 60 fps when the field of view is directed towards the extremity of a level, or when indoors - and it falls to 45 fps when looking at crowds or towards the center of a map. I also notice a slight stuttering when rotating the camera.\n\nI experienced two crashes so far is less than 3 hours of gameplay, once on the very first tutorial mission, another time upon launching the game, as the IO logo was appearing.\n\nSound\nThe sound design is great. The effects are diverse and a particular attention to detail has been paid in that regard. The voice actor work is, as in previous Hitman games, accomplished with a lot of care.\n\nThe music is pleasant to hear and contributes in building a proper Hitman ambience. Niels Bye Nielsen did a great job, even if, I'll admit it, I'll need quite some time to get rid of this sour taste Jesper Kyd's absence is giving me.\n\nConclusion\nThis is just the first episode of the "season", so, be warned - it can be finished in just an hour (or less). But that's not how a Hitman game is played. There are tons of contents beyond the completion of the three missions. Achievements, challenges, user-made contracts, elusive targets... Well, that part is the job of Square Enix's PR department, I won't do it. In short, there are a lot of things to do if you like Hitman games. Good enough for this first episode.\n\nNow, I decided not to recommend this game for several reasons : first of all, the use of Denuvo. That's right, they chose to put quite a lot of money into buying a licence for that recent DRM. Yes, that's the one that doesn't want to be called "DRM". That means money that could have been invested into paying developers to fix above mentioned bugs and performance issues, has instead been redirected to the pockets of the guys who made the StarForce DRM. And if you buy Hitman, you'll get some files coded by these people in your computer. I would rather have nothing to do with that shіt since I bought the game and since it's already protected by Steam's DRM.\n\nAlright, moving on. The episodic format made a lot of people suspicious. Some of said suspicious people decided to trust IO and Square Enix and bought the game. I am among those people.\n\nI do not regret buying it. I'll admit it, I'm having a lot of fun with this Hitman game. However, I cannot help but feeling like "I don't like where this is going".\n\nBeing tethered to the servers is not okay. Being plagued with Denuvo is not okay. The bugs and terrible design choices are not okay.","March 11","false","43.7"," 422 of 506 people (83%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","83","422","506","22","16"

While this current Hitman game is not fully complete and there is only 1 mission available at the moment I am writing this first-impression review, I think it can provide some good insight for people who are still skeptical whether it is worth buying it or not.\n\nTo begin with, let's focus on the positive aspects that we have already seen during the Tutorial and the first mission in Paris:\n\n+ The graphics are excellent and the attention to the detail is really something else: It becomes apparent from the moment you begin your first mission that IO Interactive did an amazing job to offer us a game with excellent visuals that meets the expectations of a gamer in 2016.\n\n+ Landscape and map: I am really impressed at how big is the map. I have been repeating the first mission in Paris for 7 hours now and there are still places that I haven't discovered. It is really amazing how much freedom we are given in this game to roam around and discover the hidden treassures of the map.\n\n+ Plethora of ways to complete your mission: One of the biggest criticisms of Hitman Absolution was the fact that it was way too linear and it didn't give the player enough freedom to improvise how he/she wants to complete the mission. In this new Hitman it becomes apparent that IOI took a 180-degree turn and offered us exactly that: The freedom to act and kill your target in a way that fits your style.\n\n+ Plenty of disguises and smarter AI in terms of disguises: While Hitman games have always been known about the innovative and big variety of disguises, I have to admit that I am really amazed by how many disguises I could use just in the first mission. I hope that the next missions will continue having such a big variety. Moreover, back in Absolution there was a terrible interaction where almost all the AI units of the map would recognize you when you were using a disguise and this ruined the experience for many hardcore fans of Hitman series. In this new title you will be happy to know that AI became smarter in terms of disguises.\n\n+ Overall, I am happy to see that the game implemented many positive elements from the previous succsessful Hitamn titles.\n\nDespite the good first impression there are many negative aspects about this game that made me very skeptical about this new title and whether it will be successful. Let's analyze the negative aspects that I have managed to pinpoint so far:\n\n- You must be online in order to get the full experience of the game: As many people have pointed out before me in their reviews, there is currently a very sad situation: In order for your missions, achievments and mastery points to be recorded so you can unlock new weapons (such as the Sniper), new starting locations etc, you must be online all the time because the game records everything you do to an online server. If you are not connected you are pretty much done for because you lose so many privileges and, as a result, the variety of completing your missions is diminished because you will not have access to certain aspects such as new weapons, new starting locations, new items etc. This is really sad and I hope that Square Enix and IO Interactive find a solution soon because the current situation ruins the game.\n\n- Not the best AI: While I mentioned that IOI gave much emphasis on improving the AI and they managed to do it with regards to disguises, I personally feel that overall the AI remains as "stupid" as in Absolution. Since they took so much time on developing that certain aspect of the game, I would have expected more. It is really easy to deceive every NPC of the game as if they were children of preschool age. I felt a bit disappointed here because I knew perfectly well that IOI was supposed to give so much attention to developing a smarter AI (not just with regards to disguises) than in Absolution but it seems they fell short.\n\n- No difficulty levels: One of the silliest things you can do in a game such as Hitman is not to implement difficulty levels. This goes in accordance with my previous point about AI. It feels so bad not being able to alter the difficulty you want to complete the missions: As an avid gamer of this genre of games, it felt like I was playing all the time at Easy and it didn't seem very challenging to complete the missions. It becomes apparent after you complete the first mission multiple times that IOI chose quantity over quality in the sense that, indeed, there is a big variety of completing the mission, but the quality (aka difficulty in the current context) is lackluster. For someone new to this type of game it will probably feel as if they play at a medium difficulty, but once you get the grip of it, you will notice how easy and repetitive it becomes.\n\n- Mediocre and unappealing story: While Hitman Absolution had many obvious weaknesses as a game, one thing it did right was the story. Personally, I would rank Absolution as the best Hitman series in terms of story. From the very first mission it made me care about it and it kept me on my toes from the beginning till the end because it had a great cohesion. While it is a bit early to judge this new Hitman game based on one mission, I have to admit that the story failed to catch my attention and it feels as if I am playing one of these fps games with a generic story. I hope that my view about the story changes after the next few missions become available and the plot starts rolling, but until then I will continue having my doubts as the first impression was not that good (with regards to story). I just hope that this game will not merely focus on the location (e.g. Paris, Italy, USA, Japan) and forget about story.\n\n- No blood and gore scenes: For a game that is based around an assassin it feels very unsatisfying to kill/shoot your target and see very limited amount of blood or strangle them and not hearing that satisfying "crack" sound when you break their neck. To cut a long story short, killing your targets is very unsatisfying and feels quite repetitive when you are in melee range where you strangle an NPC always in the same way and the NPC reacts pretty much the same almost every time.\n\n- The game is released in monthly episodes: For a game such as Hitman I find the concept of releasing missions monthly very stupid. I do not know why SE thought that introducing a model similar to "The Walking Dead" and "Life is Strange" is a good idea (other than milking money from the gamers). I want to play the game and enjoy it as a cohesive unit, not as fragments that unlock every month, which means I will probably have forgotten what happened in the story and I will not care at all. Besides, there are many people who want to get the full experience of their favorite game at the moment they purchase it and not periodically. "The Walking Dead" is a way different game and the concept of releasing it in different episodes worked for certain reasons. For a game such as Hitman, however, this is plainly stupid. It is as if you buy a new car and they tell you that at first you will get the body of the car, in one month the wheels, in another month the radio and then the steering wheel.\n\n- Lack of special killing (mainly shooting) techniques as we saw in Absolution and shooting feels clunky: Someone might say that its too early to blame them for that and they might implement it later but let me remind you that in Absolution you learned your first important shooting technique (the one that stops time shortly and mark the enemies) at the very first mission. Also aiming and shooting feels very clunky and bad compared to my previous Hitman experiences.\n\nOverall, I am really skeptical and unsatisfied from what I have seen already. I would suggest you wait a few months to see how the game goes after more missions become available. For now its a no-no.","March 14","false","7.9"," 541 of 669 people (81%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","81","541","669","27","31"

I don't know if I miss read or was fooled but I am very sure that I read and heard youtubers say that the 'intro pack' gave you access to the tutorial and first level(s), I am infact wrong! I paid 10,99 for the tutorial that was in the beta and this isn't the main thing that has angered me, not only have I payed for a maximum of 20 minutes of gameplay, if I wish to upgrade to the full thing, I must pay 32,99 instead of 39,99 - 10,99 = 29, I honestly don't care about the extra £4 that I will have to pay, but it's priniciple alone, I pay for the beta basically, and then I get charged another £4 if I wish to upgrade!\n\nUpdate : I did indeed recieve an update 14 hours later (when I woke up on 03/12/16) where the paris missions is now unlocked for me, great to now the developers didn't scam me, although why I got the update 14 hours late is beyond me but whatever. Now lets talk gameplay, overall I feel it's smooth just like hitman should be, shame that the same can not be said for the frame rate. I have a EVGA GTX 970 SSC and a Intel Xeon E3-0123 3.3 ghz CPU and the game doesn't run as smoothly as it should. My total sum up is this : This game has extreme potential, but the developers are limiting it right now, my only hope is that they do not ruin this series becuase it's one of my top 5. The game right now is NOT worth buying, the episode by episode release is stupid, the game needs to be updated further to improve the frames, I don't know what's causing the bad frames if its a bad port or whatever, but something needs to be done, and I still do not understand why I have to pay an extra 4 pounds to upgrade but I'll just leave that be for now. Oh! And another thing that is just purely a mind ****, is why do I need constant connection to the internet to play an SINGLE PLAYER game??? This make NO SENSE what so ever, if this is to track my progress to put on a leader board then why not just update it when I connect back to the net? Again, no sense, the franchise is suffering for no reason at all, first it was Absolution with the great idea to add a story line.... And now it's episode by episode release + bad frames (which I'm praying will be fixed) + needing internet to play a single player game???? Honestly guys, I'm more impressed rather than angry that the developers managed to harm this series further, I didn't think it was possible. :)","March 11","false","3.8"," 309 of 422 people (73%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","73","309","422","19","7"

This game on a scale:\n\nBlood Money ||----O---------------------|| Absolution\n\nMARRAKESH (EP3)\n\nA big and varied location, like Sapienza, but a bit less routes and things to do. Consists of three separate areas, marketplace, consulate building and an abandoned schooI.\n\n6 new weapons to unlock. More rubber ducks and vials, one automatic fire capable pistol and silenced assault rifle. Still no sniper suitcase, if people were wondering.\n\nSadly optimization is still a problem, after latest update. Especially in big crowds.\n\nFor me, Marrakesh is worst of the three Episodes, it's not a place I would want to visit IRL, and also from a level design pespective it was least interesting. Voice acting is really immersion breaking, every African person speaks flawless English with American accent.\n\nSAPIENZA (EP2)\n\nSapienza is great! Much better (and bigger) than Paris, which wasn't bad either. One of greatest Hitman levels ever. It feels like a real place, like you're on vacation in Italy, except you murder people :P It's getting very close to that Blood Money magic, closer than Paris.\n\nPROS\n\nThe game does have a stupid HUD handholding system (basically in-built spoilers) but all of it can be disabled from menu. Which I suggest everyone does, because it adds longetivity and doesn't spoil all the cool little secrets right away.\n\nLoadout selection is back. No gun customization, but more stealthy gadgets like Emetic poison, Audio distraction device, breaching charge and explosive Rubber duck. People whining about lack of guns, tend to forget Blood Money had none of these things. This is not essentially a shooter, but a stealth game, so IMO this kind of gear makes more sense.\n\nOverall the game is a open sandbox like Blood Money, instead of tunnel-like small levels in Absolution. This is especially evident in Sapienza, which feels very organic and every place seems to have a new route.\n\nCONS\n\nOnline only DRM. In a single player game doesn't make much sense, but I don't care that much since my connection is stable and I have it all the time anyway.\n\nOptimization is still crap after Marrakesh. My GTX 980 Ti + i7 4770k is struggling with 1080p Ultra, which shouldn't be the case. Very inconsistent framerates. Seems to be mainly about CPU, since I've seen even GTX 1080 owner complain about FPS drops. He had i5 processor.\n\nMy main complaint about this game: Player proximity triggered events. Key conversations or events don't happen, unless you appear on scene to witness it. It feels fake and hurts replayability, and makes it feel less like a living, breathing place, like Blood Money missions.\n\nVoice acting... actually it didn't really start to bother me until Marrakesh. Everyone in Paris, Italy and Marrakesh speaks flawless English, with no accent. Locals too.\n\nNo human shield. Being able to fake surrender feels half-pointless because of it. Keyhole peeking being gone I can understand, since real keyholes aren't really big enough to see through, but removig Human Shield is a step back from BM. Also light switches in rooms cannot be turned off like in BM, these people must have huge electrical bills.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDespite the flaws and bugs, after seeing they are actively trying to fix/patch problems, and especially the amazing Sapienza mission, I'm changing my rating to recommended. It's not the perfect Blood Money 2 I was hoping for, but it's close enough to keep me entertained.","April 27","true","63.4"," 220 of 305 people (72%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","72","220","305","12","16"

In all honesty, this really wouldn't be all THAT bad if all it did was just simply not put your "score" on the database. I could live with not having my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ score of -100,000 because I killed every guard in Paris. But no. Unfortunately, if your internet fails or for some other reason you are disconnected from the Hitman servers, it will kick you out of your current game (without giving time to save) and you are left with the bare bones of the game, no "perks" that you've unlocked through completing missions with better scores.\n\nI really don't like the way many games and systems now a days rely so heavily on being connected, and Hitman seems to have 80% of its game online.\n\nI wish I had more options for recommending from steam besides "Yes" and "No" because the game is AWESOME when it's at its best. However, I really didn't mention this before but random frame drops and freezes seem to be pretty common, along with the whole connectivity issue.\n\nFor anyone looking to play this game, I wouldn't purchase it until the full game comes out and all the other kinks are straightened out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpookTouc/recommended/236870/","SpookTouc","The Nightman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpookTouc/","214 products in account","EDIT (Gameplay) -  In the review, there wasn't much talk about the actual gameplay offered by this game. The game itself plays very well, the Paris map is extremely open and their are so many Oppurtunities to approach killing a target. The gameplay feels a lot like a HITMAN game should, and whilst in game you do not feel 'pressured' to get a lot of points like Absolution did. Once you start a mission, you are able to roam a large part of the map freely, yet there are still a lot of out of bounds areas which mean you need to be extremely stealthy or in disguise.\n\nThe mechanics such as instinct are much better now, they are a lot more balance and they can be switched off entirely allowing you to customize the difficulty of the level to match your skill. The gameplay does actually make the game worth playing assuming you can deal with the poor port/ lack of FPS this game offers.\n\n\n\nPre-Paris Review - This game is quite fun assuming you can actually play it. I am running an AMD card and it performs over 60 FPS on some of the highest settings. Gameplay is as expected, especially if you played the beta. Fun so far for me, 7/10 as of right now.\n\nPost-Paris Review - So it turns out only the tutorial missions run at decent performance for me, the rest of the game is still poor in performance. Though it is still playable (for me) at below 60 FPS as it is not a high action game, I play in complete stealth so it is more of an annoyance. However I recommend holding off on buying this until they fix the port as it struggles on performance.\n\nBased mostly on the port and performance of Paris (which is of course the main mission so far), I would say Not Recommended and rate it 5/10 based on performance, and 8/10 for actual gameplay.","March 11","false","11.6"," 188 of 266 people (71%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","71","188","266","17","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hitmxn/recommended/236870/","Hitmxn","Sorter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hitmxn/","134 products in account","Everyone is outlining the performance issues and online DRM but no one is actually reviewing the game itself.\n\nUPDATE: Updating the review as of 30/05/2016 - the update for Marrakesh has fixed the issue for target names and parameters not being shown in Contracts mode. The launcher now has support for higher resolutions. Performance has been slightly improved in certain areas.\n\nEDIT: Obviously the online DRM is a bad thing and the performance is choppy in some areas but that shouldn't cast a shadow over the gameplay. I managed to enjoy the game regardless, so here is a review of the gameplay:\n\nI haven't played much (4 hours as of writing) but I can certainly make some points based on gameplay. This is based on the Paris level available on release. TL;DR @ bottom.\n\nHITMAN plays very similarly to the original Hitman games but also incorporates mechanics from Absolution such as the cover system and a few borrowed animations. Instinct is back but that stupid thing 47 does with his hand over his head is gone; it's literally a wall hack but you can turn it off if you so wish. You can choose the equipment and clothing 47 takes with him before the mission, and depending on your "mastery level" you can also choose where to enter. Mastery level is a value that increases once you've completed certain challenges. You can gain Mastery of a level by completing all of its challenges and earning an achievement.\n\nWhen you're in a level you can press F1 to view the challenges. From here, you can mark a challenge so you can complete it. The game also presents challenges to you if you're in the right circumstance. When carrying out a challenge, the game points you where to go and what to do. It very much holds your hand, which can be patronising. I'm sure you can turn this off though. The HUD is a little "too" helpful by displaying literally every opportunity and highliting every possible pickup, but can be turned off. I really do feel that this game tends to make it easier for you, removing any sense of independence you might have unless turning off options such as the HUD and hints.\n\nA few interesting features available to the player vary from the ability to conceal your weapon in things such as bins and food crates to setting off a fire alarm so the civilians are evacuated. The AI worry me a lot since actions which should be obvious don't seem to phase them. They feel dumbed down. The AI go about their patrol paths and investigate unusual behaviour, but peripheral vision seems to be obsolete. You'd be surprised with the kind of stupid sh#t you can get away with due to poor AI and sometimes delayed reactions. While wearing a disguise, the head of that group will see through it. You'll need to avoid these "enforcers" as they can blow your cover - I like this system in comparison to everyone seeing through your disguise.\n\nThe level feels very open and alive and the NPCs all seem to have a role within that world. The map is huge, allowing for endless replayability, planning and exploration. NPCs feel believable. I would say only the static NPCs (such as the generic guests) feel, well.. static. Events within the level make the level feel so much more deep. This can range from conversations between guards about the multiverse theory to walking in front of a camera as a reporter does her job, only to get mad at you for interrupting. This is of course all based on the Paris level, but I'm sure this will be applicable to future missions. I felt myself often exploring the level and just taking in the beautiful scenery and architecture of the world. It feels real.\n\nI'm really impressed by the vast majority of ways you can kill your targets. The methods sometimes really go above expectations and make you question if that really just happened while also giving you a sense of accomplishment for actually pulling off "the big kill". They really are unique in comparison to just garotting or shooting your target and definitely leave a lasting impression.\n\nOn top of the base game is contracts mode, escalation mode and elusive targets. Contracts allows you to choose up to five targets and set up ways for them to be killed, so others can attempt to do so. Or you can attempt their challenges. It's different from Absolution because Absolution had parameters like "don't miss any shots", allowed you to choose NPC costumes at the beginning, there's no money and no weapon upgrades. You can't tell what the target's name is because the game doesn't tell you, so you don't know which weapon or method to kill them with. Absolution had a better contracts mode. Escalation mode first provides you with a target, a way to kill them and a disguise to wear. After this is done, you are tasked with the same mission but with added parameters (such as opening a safe or killing another target). More and more parameters get added each time you complete it. It really is quite fun. Elusive targets are targets that will appear for a short time that you can kill. IO sets this up.\n\nNotes - my review is based on gameplay but I will talk about the issues everyone else is talking about too:\n\n* Currently there are DRM server issues meaning that you can't complete challenges whilst being offline. The game kicked me back to the main menu after disconnecting me and didn't make a save. I lost some progress which annoyed me. So you NEED to be online to complete challenges, which is very stupid.\n\n* There are technical problems relating to the graphics, but this really only seems to be active in the yacht mission during the prologue. Being near the NPCs on the boat drops a lot of frames but being near at least 3 times as many in Paris doesn't drop any frames (for me, anyway).\n\n* The launcher locks some graphics settings. I had to add start up options to the game in order to play above 1080p (1440p).\n\n* This game is episodic.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Very fun gameplay, feels solid\n+ Lots of interesting ways to kill targets\n+ Equipment/weapon selection\n+ World feels very alive and real\n+ Huge maps\n+ Lots of fun challenges\n+ Back to how Hitman games used to be\n+ Contracts mode, Escalation mode, Elusive targets\n\nCONS:\n\n- Performance issues (will probably be fixed soon)\n- Online DRM\n- Locked graphics settings in the launcher for some people (as of right now)\n- Game holds your hand, dumbed down HUD/hints\n- AI need some "logic" tweaks\n- Absolution had a better contracts mode\n- A few reused animations (there are some new ones though)\n- Wall hack instinct (can be turned off)\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n+ - The game is episodic. Opinion based.\n\nTL;DR - how a Hitman game should be,  loads of content, loads of ways to kill targets, really fun. Suffers from performance issues, DRM issues and certain gameplay mechanics.\n\nNow I hope you'll excuse me because I need to use the bathroom.","March 11","true","88.3"," 913 of 1,401 people (65%) found this review helpful 84 people found this review funny","65","913","1","84","52"

They stopped releasing optimized games, and keep making our eyes hurt. Most known examples are Watch_Dogs, Batman: Arkham Knight, Assassins Creed: Unity...\n\nI'm Not A Pre-Order GuyMy first pre-order is Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain, because it gives another free copy of Ground Zeroes. I was happy at the end, because they release the game very fine. Game was so smooth, so i can't play any other game for a while after Phantom Pain. My second was Naruto Shippuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 just for character bonus. I did not except a lot from it, it's classic NSUNS game with tag team system. That game gave me what i except, also it was cheap. Even if fails, i won't lose too much. I was know the stakes. But in the end, that pre-order was fine. After that, i just pre-ordered Street Fighter V for beta. Also i got very badass Chun-Li costume too. I was not sad after full release. It has a little bit connection issues, not too much. The only one problem about it, it has not punishment system for ragequiters and it's fixed now. So, that pre-order was not a bad idea.\n\nSuddenly i changed my mind. After those years, i can pre-order games without fear. Then i saw Hitman's pre-order deal. That suit... That suit was my childhood. I spent lots of hours on Blood Money when i was 9. After all, Hitman Franchise one of the my favorite franchise. I trusted Square Enix after Absolution, back in the day i bought it on day one. I still play Absolution sometimes. That game is not bad like community says. Back in the topic, after saw that suit i gave a shot about it. Then I play HITMAN Beta and it was not bad at all. The game runs about 50-60 at normal, gets a lil bit stutters if NPC's are lot. I was not feel bad for that pre-order money until now.\n\nI'm okay with episodic chapter plan. The problem is i can't even test DX12, it just give white lights on black patterns. (Which is fixed with 16.3 driver, the one not works with autoupdate somehow i done it manually, twice. Because it corrupts 3-4 times, so i used DDU to make it clean. Even it fixed the game crashes a lot in DX12, which is i've not know why it happens.) In DX11 i get 30-40fps, sometimes i can see 10fps too. 10FPS with a effin $500 graphics card. TEN EFFIN FRAME PER SECOND. So, after this experience i decided pre-ordering games are taking a huge d in your mouth, just like Eric Cartman says. I was not waiting this ♥♥♥♥ from you Square Enix...\n\nI'm not recommend this game, it's runs too bad, maybe a few patches can fix it. I'm double checking my gpu drivers, maybe they can fix it i dunno.\n\nLets Pretend Like Optimization Is Not BadLike i've said it before, episodic games are fine to me. I'm not digging around HITMAN too much, those fps problems are broking my soul and damaging my eyes. Even it has one mission on day one, gameplay was good. I mean, there is lots of opportunities, disguises, killstyles... Map is big, like was in Blood Money. It's pretty direct sequel to Blood Money, it's fine. Also it has some elements from Absolution like Instict with a better version. I'm in love with game even i play 5 hours (and 5 hours are nuff for a first episode), I'll play more and planning to give more info about it.\n\nWell, forgot the mention it the human shield and point shooting are removed. I have wanted the use them again, because sometimes i want to play movie-style (pew pew pew), but unfortunately they removed instict bar which is used to be for point shooting. I hope human-shield will be back, but it's not necessary. Also, if it's direct sequel to Blood Money if we consider play-style, where is the god-damn sniper cases? Smuggling item will helping kinda, but i want to use that case. Another thing to mention, animations kinda dummy. Beta was more good about animations like walk, using wire, running and climbing.","March 11","false","14.7"," 137 of 192 people (71%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","71","137","192","16","8"

I understand that the devs want to release content in an episodic format but that doesn't mean that the basics shouldn't be polished. Things like menus, controls, and basic graphics settings should all be properly finished before you release a game. Unfortunately they aren't here.\n\nThere's a bunch of simple functions you'd expect on any PC release which are just completely absent in this game. For example, the escape key in the main (root) meny doesn't quit the game (you have find the quit button burried in the settings menu to exit), key binding options are extremely limited, there's no hotkey options for things like quicksave, the mousewheel doesn't allow you to cycle your inventory like it should and did in past games, and so on. Playing on a console I might expect some of these issues but no PC release should be this handicapped.\n\nGraphics are another problem area with massive and annoying rendering issues all over the place. Trying in vain to fix some of these I've discovered that even some of the graphics options haven't been finished. For instance, want to set texture quality to anything but low? Tough, the medium and high options are disabled so suck it up princess.\n\nThere's some nice ideas in this game but it is only half baked in terms of the execution.

I really did. Blood Money was a classic and the developer promised to bring this game back in line with the classic Blood Money style. So that was enough for me to purchase the Full Experience for 69.99. A rarity for me in this day and age. Most AAA titles don't deserve that amount at launch. So I bought the game and was ready to get a classic Hitman experience.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nI don't blame the developers wholly for this, but it's up to them to take a stand when their publishers demand ridiculous features like always online DRM. Take pride in your product and defend the people who will be playing it.\n\nThe game boots you out if connection to the servers drops (which happened frequently at launch) and your progress cannot be carried over to offline mode.\n\nIn addition the game is clearly a console port and is poorly optimized. As of this writing, DirectX12 barely works. No support for 144hz and unless you enable Vsync there will be screen tearing everywhere.\n\nThe game itself was fine when it was working and/or you weren't getting booted out for losing connection. It offered many different approaches to taking down a target and all that other good stuff that made Blood Money so well loved. Graphics are pretty poor and look like something off a PS3. The menus themselves are messy and poorly optimized for a M+KB experience. I have a controller, but I enjoyed playing Blood Money with M+KB.\n\nThat being said, while the core of the game is fine, it is wrapped in hot garbage. Publishers like SE don't deserve 69.99 for this ham fisted crap they push onto PC Gamers. CDProjeckt Red has set a new standard for customer care and LISTENING to the consumer and there is no reason for PC gamers to put up with crap like Hitman with its always online ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and shoddy optimization for PC's.\n\nAlso the business model for this game is atrocious. At launch you get two training missions and one actual mission. The rest you have to wait for. Don't support this garbage.\n\nThank god for Steam Refund. This further strengthens my resolve to not buy AAA titles at launch.","March 12","false","2.2"," 80 of 116 people (69%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","69","80","116","10","0"

There is flexibility in how you play to accomplish your mission, but running in guns-blazing like an action shooter is probably not the most effective way.\n\nCheck out my Episode 1: Paris Quick Review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwS7jXg5-QU\nUPDATED since Episode 2 release.\n\nIn Hitman, you playing as Agent 47, and your objective is to kill any targets you’re assigned while minimizing collateral damage. You will find weapons, and tools that will help you, and allow you to kill your target in different ways. Unless you can find a clean shot, you will need to gain access to your target first. You can use distractions to lure people away, and subdue, or kill them. Then steal their clothing to disguise yourself and infiltrate their inner circles. You can also try to sneak passed using lock picks and crowbars, without using disguises, but if you get caught, you may be escorted out of the area for trespassing. You also want to avoid leaving bodies or weapons around, otherwise you may drawn suspicion. Some people can see through your disguise, so you have to be aware of their presence, and you can do this with your x-ray like ability that lets you see through things.\n\nPros:several options for gameplay, audio, and graphics settings\nfully customizable controls and controller support\nthe gameplay was as expected with the use of weapons and disguises to infiltrate and kill your target in a variety of ways\nthe sound effects and voice dialog were well done\nmanual save slots as well as auto saves are very helpful for doing the 'perfect' runs\nCons:the story that you learn is so short, that you barely get a taste of it\nservers being down: only the main story is available in offline mode, everything else required you to stay online and connected to their servers (that aren't always working)\nif you drop from the server during any contract mission, you get kicked out of the mission completely, it's frustrating\nDoing all 3 tutorials, and the first 2 episodes took me less than 5 hours, and that was with me reloading saves, and restarting a bunch of times when I got spotted, so I could try and do clean runs. I enjoyed episode 2 more than episode 1 because I found it more challenging.\n\nThe game also has a contract mode, which are different kill orders you can complete, but you play on the same levels from the tutorials and story mission. The contract targets are in different areas though, so you may have to alter your tactics to succeed. However,  you can only access the contracts, and almost all the content outside of the main story line while you are ONLINE AND CONNECTED to the Hitman servers. If the server dies while you are on a contract mission, you get kicked out of it, and that was frustrating. However, I didn't notice any connection issues while playing since the episode 2 release, but I am still not a fan of the online DRM.\n\nIf you’re interested in playing the game for it’s story campaign, I still I suggest waiting for ALL of the episodes to be released before even thinking about making a purchase. If you plan to do mostly contracts, compete for the high scores, and get achievements, then you might be able to get a bit more enjoyment out of the game as it is right now…. That’s of course assuming their servers are working. I was trying to do some contract missions, but servers were down over 2 hours, and I couldn’t play. Needless to say, I am still disappointed in this purchase so far, but maybe when the rest of the episodes come out, it will be better. At least I hope so…","March 12","false","9.6"," 87 of 130 people (67%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","67","87","130","11","0"

Marked with "*". Yes I bought the all parts before the game came out. I can't walk atm because I'm waiting for surgeries on my feet and during this period I'm more relaxed on my rules of pre-orders etc since doing any crap that takes my mind of being stuck at home (however stinking bad that crap is) is better than doing nothing.\n\n*Episode 2 - State of the game: So yeah... I tried to play the Episode 2 after a couple of days (or weeks, can't remember) of the episode being out. What surprise am I greeted with? The servers doesn't work! Yay! So if I wanted to play that day I would have no ability to progress and unlock new stuff or use new stuff.\n\n*The performance (playing the DX11 version with GTX 970 and Skylake 6600 CPU) since Episode 1 is alot worse. Had to reduce my settings to half of what they were before. (High settings to either medium or low).\n\n*Great choice to have always online DRM on a singleplayer games guys! Oh well... a few days ago I logged in again and completed the level while exploring most of the stuff in it. Took me an hour maybe. Most definitely doesn't feel like 1/5 of a full game. Maybe 1/15. 1/10 if I'm really generous, Blood Money had 13 missions and it seems like this game will have 5-6 in the end.\n\n*If each episode came with 3 of these levels then I'd say it's worth the price. But atm, there is no way in hell that any person who can walk (I.E not me lol) should put their money elsewhere. I don't see how they can justify releasing only 1 level every few months while also having Always-Online DRM AND Denuvo DRM. Scum bags is all I have to say. (Probably Square Enix fault)\n\n*Original review*\n\nDon't make the mistake of supporting these shady people like I did by buying this game. What will you have to deal with if you buy it? Let's make a list!\n\nAlways Online DRM - check.\n\nDenuvo DRM on top of the Always Online DRM - check.\n\n2-3 months wait time between episodes instead of 1 month (which they promised) - check.\n\nToo little content per episode - check.\n\n*Worse performance now than at the release - check.\n\nWhen (if EVER) should you buy it? When the Always Online DRM is removed and the whole game is completed and at sale. These guys are really shady and shady practices shouldn't be supported. They promised a new episode each month and that the episodes would be filled with content. Now they're going back on that promise when they've sold most of the games. Disgusting practice. They use Denuvo DRM which should mean that there is no need to have Always Online DRM, BUT THEY STILL USE IT!\n\nIf you look at my hours played and think I got my money's worth, don't be fooled. I have played sooo many hours trying to make it worth it, but most of those hours (replays of the same levels) have had me so bored that I fell asleep in front of the computer... it's just my desprerate attempts to make it feel like this was worth it by pretending replaying a level 10 times is fun because it's big. Suprise! It's not! I actually would have rather had another game like Absolution than this crap. At least replaying them made you feel some success at perfectly figuring out the puzzle of that level. Replaying these levels are just too easy because the options are so many and so overpowered.\n\nI'll never buy a Square Enix game again.","April 7","false","10.8"," 151 of 238 people (63%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","63","151","238","16","2"

I've got myself the Pre-Ordered Full Experience.\nThe requiem suit looks great, but that's where the sweepstakes end.\n\nThe game seems to be badly optimized, even on lowest of the lowest details it's barely playable (especially Paris mission, where there's much to render). The many times mentioned always-online DRM is ridiculsus... I play the mission, craft it all carefully for an hour or so for the best experience and then server decides to make a break, resulting in immediate mission termination and kick-back into menu... It's really not fun and frustrating...\n\nI'd say okay to this, even if it meant that I can get achievements only on-line - that's fine. But not getting the whole game under lock-down and depended on developer's servers, that's just a huge NO.\n\nAs it is now, I feel like I was given an early-access game for testing - well not so fast Square Enix - professional beta testers are being paid to find bugs and issues, hire some of those guys before you release the product to public.\nI pay - I demand full functional product. As it is now, it's great topic for lawsuit for the product not meeting the agreement. By buying I agreed for functional game, not something that's in development.\n\nIf you're a Hitman fan like me - you probably already have the game purchased, but if you didn't - do not buy it yet. I'm sorry that I can't recommend the game, but as it is now, it's not worth the price. Learn from my mistake, don't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mayonnaiseplant/recommended/236870/","mayonnaiseplant","Mayo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mayonnaiseplant/","249 products in account","This is probably the pinacle of bad ideas in the gaming industry.\nI loved Blood Money and enjoyed Absolution but I cannot support a game that releases, episodic or not, as $60 with so little content.\nI am very hesitent to buy 'early-access' games on Steam these days as many of the developers have decided to abandon their titles before completion as the game's sales have already peaked.\nThis HITMAN feels as though a AAA game studio saw the work vs reward of many early-access games and decided they should try it as well.\nBasically, you buy the game and must trust that the developer will not only finish it, but finish it in a satisfying manner. What prevents the studio from not finishing this series? What prevents them from phoning in the rest of the episodes?\n\nWhile I knew of the 'episodes' when I purchased the $60 version I still think the game borders into some grey areas of ethics. The videos shown above show a much more finished product which many, like myself, thought would be a part of the first episode.\n\n75% of the content in the first episode is dull and uninspiring anyway. The fashion show mission called Showstopper is much nicer but still felt unentertaining to me. I swore I heard the words 'open world' somewhere in marketting before this came out and the levels feel very small to me. Maybe the square footage of the Showstopper is larger than some, but it felt clostrophic. I think of a large spanning room where the ceilings are only 4ft high.\n\nLastly, while I'm sure some enjoy it, I can't help but feel that the completionist mindset of the game is lazy. Many things within the game, all replays of the same missions mind you, are locked unless you complete challenges. These challenges are things like "Kill this person wearing this uniform in this fashion". I feel like they're trying to capture the essense of Blood Money but instead of giving the freedom of Blood Money they force the player. Do this Agent 47. Ok. Now do this.\nI'm not sure if I can explain it better than that, but I had no interest in listening to the game.\n\nI just cannot approve of this new direction the franchise is taking. I have no interest in it. I think it's dangerous to customers as well. It feels like a family member asking for money. That they'll pay you back later. In an undefined time frame. With money they're betting on making. From the money they borrowed from you.\n\nNo uncle 47- please stop.\n\nEDIT: On a positive note, I received a refund from Steam for this game. I'm pleasantly surprised they refunded me but felt it was worth mentioning. It was not only refunded in full, but the very next day. Thumbs up to Steam.","March 11","false","2.8"," 72 of 109 people (66%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","66","72","109","11","0"

I'm changing my recommendation to positive; there are already enough people boycotting the game that sales numbers are low enough for Square Enix to get the message that their always-online garbage ain't cool. Definitely glad I bought it - can't get this kind of experience anywhere else. Well, I could in real life I guess, but that has potentially unpleasant consequences, and no save-reload mechanics.\n\n\nEDIT 23/4/16: This week's patch incorporated a reconnect option that allows you to reconnect to the game's servers should you happen to be disconnected during play (Thanks IO). This helps somewhat to solve the immediate frustration of having your gaming sessions disrupted, but still doesn't change the fact that the game is almost entirely single player, yet is unnecessarily hampered by draconian DRM and a pointless always-online requirement to access new equipment and unlocks. HITMAN may very well lose most of its content if the servers are shut down without the developers rectifying these issues. If the game wasn't so damn good I'd be boycotting the next episode(s) until they remove all of it completely, but I don't think I'll be able to help myself. Damn you Square Enix.\n\n\nGame is great, publisher is not. Do not buy until always-on DRM/connection requirement is removed. This game is a shining example of another publisher releasing incentive for people to pirate their products.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drahon45/recommended/236870/","drahon45","Crusader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drahon45/","243 products in account","IO Interactive have really stumbled upon something here. I believe they might have made a breakthrough in the gaming industry that no company has done since CryTek and CryEngine: IO Interactive have, somehow, made a game look horrible while making it the most demanding piece of ♥♥♥♥ you'll play in the coming years! Seriously, it's absolutely incredible how off (bad / mediocre) everything looks graphically, while running at sub 20 FPS on my system. My specs are becoming a little aged, I know, but they shouldn't be having so much trouble running this game even at medium on a medium resolution.\n\nMy specs:\nCPU: Intel i7 4810MQ @ 2.8 GHz\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M with 4GB VRAM\nRAM: 16GB\nOS: Windows 8.1\nHDD @ 750GB\nSSD @ 250GB\n\nThis system can run The Division on High-Ultra at 1080p with about 40-50 FPS average\n\nIt runs Hitman at 720p on medium-low at about 17-20 FPS average.\n\nAll joking aside, I probably don't have to tell many of you reading this review how completely unbelievable this is. Hitman doesn't look good enough to be so demanding on my PC. It isn't worthy. But besides the performance issues and the Always-Online DRM issues, I believe Hitman has received the true return to form that it has deserved for a long time. With that return to form, though, comes some huge bugs that can make it difficult to feel like you're really walking in Agent 47's shoes. This game feels too much like a game - a buggy mess, at that.\n\nI don't agree with the episodic release schedule (seriously, ♥♥♥♥ you Square Enix) but the missions that are available in the first episode so far have been pretty entertaining. There are limitless combinations for taking out the two targets you're assigned to kill in Paris. It is lots of fun sneaking around in Suit Only, and it is lots of fun using disguises (and knocking out guards) since you are no longer penalized for subduing people. Also, the new disguise system works extremely well, and allows for way more exploration than Absolution, which is great for a game like Hitman.\n\nHowever, as I said, the gameplay isn't without its bugs. The new opportunities system has certainly added a lot to the game, and makes it much easier to experiment with the different things you can do to kill your targets. Of course, naturally, if you find it is too easy: you can turn it off. It's great. The problem is, though, that because of the way the game world works (Agent 47 has to be near an event / dialogue for it to happen) sometimes the opportunities don't actually work very well, and lead to some frustrating instances where the target is running around spouting nonsense and failing to do what needs to be done by their AI, because their AI is playing catchup now that Agent 47 is nearby. There are also numerous other little bugs that I've encountered already. Nothing too gamebreaking, but still extremely annoying:\n\nIn The Final Test, I approached Jasper Knight to get him to follow me as part of one of the opportunities. When he finished his scripted dialogue, he suddenly ran through about 8 lines of phrases like "Are we going or what?" "Hello, grease monkey?" "C'mon, I don't have all day!" and went back to what he was doing like I hadn't even been there. It became evident that his AI somehow got the notion that we'd been standing there for 20 minutes instead of 10 seconds, and set him back on his regularly scheduled programming. Which didn't impact the mission too much, as it worked perfectly the next time, but it was still extremely odd and removed me from the immersion of the game.\n\nIn Showstopper, I stole Helmut Kruger's (the supermodel who looks like Agent 47) disguise and was meeting up with the second target, who wanted to see Helmut in a specific place upstairs. I went to that place and sat for about 10 minutes, watching the target go from place to place in Instinct mode. When I had had enough, I approached the target - and she didn't even acknowledge me. I couldn't speak to her, like I had spoken to Jasper. The only time she would notice me was when I stood directly in her path, and her AI got annoyed and told me to move, not recognizing her close personal friend, Helmut. 10 more minutes pass, and I managed to close the auction with some hacking on her laptop. I thought this would let her and Helmut meet, but it didn't. Instead, she proceeded to storm through me (while recognizing me as two people at once - Helmut Kruger, and Tobias Reaper, which is the alias Agent 47 uses if you manage to sneak into the auction in your suit without using a disguise). Again, it completely ruined my immersion, and because of the failure for the event to spark, it made it nearly impossible to kill the target in the way I wanted to without blowing my cover.\n\nIt is my personal opinion, that if any quality assurance had been done at all on this game, then both of these bugs would have been easily detected. I didn't do anything to trigger them except by playing the game. Things like this should not be happening for no other reason than shoddy programming. It's completely ridiculous for such a huge title. I really was excited for this game, because I finally believed IO was going to get it right - but they didn't. It almost seems like they just crapped out what they could so they could grab some cash from Hitman's most loyal fans. I'm praying that one day I can turn this review into a positive one. But until they actually optimize the game for PCs that should be able to run it, and fix the glaring bugs that are evident everywhere in the game world, I just can't recommend buying Hitman in any other form, not even just the First Episode.","March 12","false","6.4"," 94 of 151 people (62%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","62","94","151","9","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JeffMOD/recommended/236870/","JeffMOD","JeffMOD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JeffMOD/","81 products in account","TL:DR - I've gotten 70+ hours of gameplay out of Hitman even before the second mission hit.\n\nFirst off, there are a few issues. On release, there were a bunch of server issues, and for some reason IO has decided to kick players out of their game sessions if they disconnect, despite it being a singleplayer game. Not a decision I agree with.\nI also realize that for some, the episodic release schedule will be a major turn-off as well, especially with the delays inherent in software development being shown publically for all to see.\n\nBut for those willing to look past those two issues, and who are interested in a stealth game with an emphasis on undercover tactics rather than combat ones, I honestly don't think you can go wrong with this game. At the time of writing, there are 2 small training missions and one large sandbox level, with a second out of a planned 7 similarly scalled maps total on the way within a week. Within the levels available there are numerous ways to find and kill your target. You can be quiet, you can be loud, you can kill them in a public "accident" or without anyone noticing or ever finding the body. You can bludgeon, stab, shoot, poison (three different kinds available) garrote, drop, explode, incinerate, electrocute etc etc etc your targets or anyone who gets in your way. It's possible to create all manner of diversions to remove witnesses non-lethally or simply make sure eyes are looking away from you when you go for the kill.\nAnd of course, what makes Hitman, well, a Hitman game, is the disguise system. Each level has many disguises with different levels of access to various areas in the maps and its well worth trying each of them on and seeing what you can do with them.\nFor those looking for an extra challenge, the game has plenty of pre-set ones to strike your imagination - various ways to take out your target, some of which you might not have even considered without being told it was possible, as well as for discovering all opportunities or using all disguises in a level. Or, if you're really skilled, go for the Silent Assassin, Suit Only challenge, and kill only your targets, without being detected or changing outfits. Once you've exhausted all of these challenges, there are further ones in the form of escalation missions from IO and contracts from fellow players which give you new targets and restrictions.\n\nAll in all, what makes me really appreciate Hitman is the amount of different approaches you can take to get around any challenge, most of which involve more subtlety than simply running in with a rifle. (and in fact, most of the time that will get you killed quite quickly - though props to anyone able to do so and get out alive)\n\nIt is currently unfinished, so if you want to hold off for now I wouldn't blame you, especially since the current level of quality usually found in episodic and/or early access games. But hey, I managed to get 70 hours out of it without getting bored, and that was with a single map. I guarentee once it's done the game will be well worth your money.","April 21","true","104.4"," 55 of 88 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","55","88","0","0"

Hitman (2016) is my first experience of the Hitman series and I’m satisfied.\nDiversity – There are many ways to kill target(s) and many routes to infiltrate and many disguises.\nThrow something – You can throw a fire axe to someone’s head. This is my favorite.\nCon	Ridiculous selling – They're selling an unfinished game and what I thought was they selling a paid demo game.\nAlways online – This game already uses “Denuvo” packer to prevent game from pirated and Denuvo is the most powerful anti-debugger solution and it is powerful as a “Dongle” protection system. Therefore; Do we seriously need always online for a singleplay game? At least my Internet has no problem but their server is the problem. While the server is out of service, you can’t use any unlocked special starting points, weapons etc. Always online is seriously stupid idea and this is the worst thing in this game.\nGlitches – There are many glitches and bug. Sometime body stuck in a map and I can’t drag'em out and occasionally somehow they can see me through the wall. Also DirectX 12 mode it bit off. I’m not sure it is a NVIDIA’s fault or not but somewhat DX12 is bit broken.\nThis game shows many possibility. game itself is good but also with many problem.\nBuy this game after they release all 6~7 of unfinished episodes.","May 3","false","51.0"," 71 of 118 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","71","118","2","0"

Hitman traditionally is a single player experience and more recently (in Hitman: Absolution) has had online elements tacked on, to give you a sense of lots of content.\n\nI'm sad to say online DRM ruins this experience (when doesn't it), I was kicked out of my game because the connection failed and to continue from a previous save you must reconnect. (Sucks when you have poor internet or lots of people using your bandwidth.)\n\nApparently if you play offline then you will have an offline save. Challenges are also disabled in offline mode, so you wont be able to level 47 up to buy/unlock new weapons or tech to reply the levels in new ways (so much for replayability)\n\nI wish I hadn't bought this via GMG just so I could refund it because I don't support this level of locked in online only bull, at least in a single player game.\n\nAlso what's going to happen when the servers shut down in 5 years time, there is a challenge in the game to eliminate 5 exclusive targets.\n\nExclusive targets are IO's (only online) small offering to keep you enticed because there isn't a lot to do and we don't know yet how big or how many levels there will be. We also don't know if the unlock benefits from completing them will be unlockable any other way it would be scummy if you can't.\n\n(They have said no micro transactions but I bet the costumes/weapons from these exclusive targets will be up for a price)\n\n\nI would hold off buying this at least till IO or Square Enix change their narrative or change the game regarding the online only elements.\n\nHeres hoping the mod scene can turn this around and stop this, I payed for a single player experience not a tacky online mess but I doubt it because of Denuvo and server checks.\n\n\nAlso in playing the game some more I've found the "replayability" laughable most of the challenges and assassination only vary by a small amount. So you end up replaying multiple times using the exactly the same method but using a gun instead of fiber wire.\n\nI've resorted to having a good save start point that already has the masterkey a few tools fireworks remote etc, just to be able to speed through the challenges and assassinations.

The Environment feels more alive than ever before, the controls are smooth and the options to archive my goal (killing the targets) are vaster than ever. The opportunities system (which can be disabled) guides me some of many ways to do so. The fact that I can save any time allows for fast iterations which helps to keep me inside the action and from time to time the autosave comes in handy too.\n\nThe problems that I currently have with the game are that there are currently only 3 maps (2 training and Paris) from which the first two are rather short. This makes it quite repetitive. The fact that you can only unlock stuff while you are online can be annoying as you get kicked out of the game as soon as you lose your connection. You have to load a save to continue, which can cost you some of your progress. You could argue that it isn’t just DRM but to keep hackers out, but I can’t say if this is the case/works.\n\nAll in all I got what I payed for.

I enjoyed the increased narrative in Absolution, but they really lost out when it came to gameplay.\n\nHowever, HITMAN is the best of both. The levels are large and very 'sandboxy', with lots of approaches and methods open to the player.\n\nI've really enjoyed my time with the game so far, and I'd highly recommend it to any fan of the series, or anyone looking for an interesting and varied stealth game experience.\n\nAs for the episodic nature, I personally am fine with it. The levels so far are really large and take about 2 - 4 hours to get a first decent 'basic' playthrough done, and completing the mission in a variety of ways unlocks new equipment, starting locations, drop-off caches, etc that enable you to try and plan the 'perfect' hit. Having the missions drop on a near-monthly basis keeps the content frequent enough that it is enjoyable, without overstaying it's welcome.\n\nPROLOGUE\nTwo smaller levels designed as 'simulations', to teach you the basics and get you up to speed. Even so, these missions are fairly roomy (especially the second one), and give you lots to play with.\n\nPARIS\nThe first mission proper, this sees 47 attending a fashion show to eliminate two high profile targets. The mansion is expansive, with service staff working hard behind the scenes and in the basement areas, the fashion show on the first floor, and a secret auction taking place on the top floor. This level really starts to showcase the scale of the HITMAN levels and your options within them.\n\nSAPIENZA\nOff to Italy in this mission, where we have another two targets to eliminate in a grand manor, and a deadly secret to destroy in a hidden lab underground. The level is even more expansive than the Paris mission, including a large chunk of the town of Sapienza to wander, a morgue and church, shopping area, pier, sewers, the manor is divided into several large buildings including an observatory, plus the ruins of a castle at the back of the manor. The lab area requires a keycard to enter (or the use of noisy explosives), there are a multitude of 'zones' that you can access with different disguises (kitchen staff, gardeners, security, lab scientists, priests...). This feels like, so far, the best mission a HITMAN game has had.\n\nWILL UPDATE FOR;\n\nMARRAKESH\nTHAILAND\nUSA\nJAPAN\nEPILOGUE\n\nOVERALL\n\nThis latest iteration of HITMAN feels like a must-have for fans of the series, and I would recommend it to anyone else who enjoys stealth games. There's a lot of variety here in the current levels, and the gameplay is deep and engaging.","May 2","true","33.3"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

That said, after only playing the "tutorial" (which took me over 2 hours as I like to take my time and be as stealthy as possible), this feels more like absolution than Blood Money, but that's not a bad thing.  Blood money is lauded as having "more open" levels, but both Blood Money and Absolution have very small and very large levels. Both games had their plusses and negatives. If you like stealth games and, more importantly, the Hitman universe, this is a very solid game. If you enjoyed the last two Hitman games you will likely have a blast here.\n\nTechnically, I did not have any issues. I'm still rocking the i-2500k (which is the minimum recommended processor for this game)  with a mild 4.0 GHz overclock and a GTX 970. I opted for a 30 fps refresh rate with more effects turned up. Hitman is a very slow, methodical game so I figured 30 fps would be fine. Outside of some very slight frame rate hitching when the game was streaming in new assets, it stayed locked at said framerate. Most settings at max.\n\nGreat game so far, can't wait to dive into more of it tomorrow.  Less than 3 hours in, but didn't have any issues with connection to the game server. That said, I find it rather lame that a lot of modern games, even in the single player mode, require a connecton of some sort (such as The Divison).\n\n","June 4","true","6.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

(yes i know you can find in in the MY CONTRACTS tab, but that is only for me to see, why would i keep replaying my own contracts if there is nobody to compete with?)\n\nBasicly what it comes down to is, Contracts mode in HITMAN 2016 is a MAJOR step back compared to Contracts mode in Hitman: Absolution.\n\nHitman: Absolution contracts mode had; Friends only filter contracts list & score boards, sharing contracts, easy way to look for new contracts, and an awesome rating system to see what other people think about your contract. HITMAN 2016 has none of these features sadly...\n\nI hope Io-Interactive & Square Enix are aware of this and are working on improving the HITMAN 2016 contracts mode ASAP! but at this time i could not find any information on it that they are, all i can find is other people like me who are sad about these lacking features.\n\nSo here is my feedback for HITMAN 2016, its a real shame because the main mission is AWESOME, i cant wait for more and hopefully a much better Contracts mode! because that is what keeps me coming back to play, especialy now when you have to wait for more main missions aswel =(\n\nUntil then, my review will stay like this, but i hope i can update this soon and make it a positive!\n\nCheers,\nNivek","April 21","false","17.6"," 37 of 61 people (61%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","61","37","61","10","0"

Yeah, aside from all that, it's pretty fun. However, another thing: If Paris is only one of 6 levels, then the "full experience" is going to be a short game. Yeah, yeah, I know "but there are other modes!" You can come up with brand new challenges when playing Mario Brothers, different modes on the same maps will only extend the game by so much.

If you want the full game on your HD right away, with the choice to binge-play and complete it at your own pace, even if you blast through it within a day or two, you will probably want to wait until all maps are released.\n\nIf you do get the intro-map, right now you get: 2 tutorial missions, one of which you HAVE to complete in different ways twice, plus the Paris map, which you CAN complete over and over in different ways, and HAVE to complete several times to complete all challenges (if you want to do that).\n\nThe tutorials are pretty quick, and then you hit Paris. The Paris mission is worth exploring, there are MANY ways to eliminate your targets. I have no idea in how many different ways you can complete this one, but I read about people playing this level for like 10+ hours, over and over.\n\nHowever, if you completed it and would like to move on...wait before you purchase the game.\n\nPerformance-wise, it is ok. My rig is an i7-4790 with 16 GB ram and Windows 7 plus an Nvidia GTX960 with 4 gigs. I didn't experiences glitches or anything like that, and the game looks nice. Not mind-blowing, mind you, but it's pretty decent. Not more, not less, IMO.\nThe controls work well, but keep in mind I have played this with a controller. Not sure how it works with kbm.\n\nConsidering the intro pack is like 12EUR, I think the prize is ok if you like replaying stuff in different ways. It's like a demo where you can test the controls, performance and mechanics. If you bought the whole thing and would like to move beyond Paris, well, you might feel disappointed for now.\n\nPro:\n+ Graphics are ok\n+ Lots of detail regarding backdrops, NPC-activities etc.\n+ A guidance-system which will help you get started if you never played a Hitman game (tracking opportunities to complete a mission, roughly guiding you). This can be switched off if you want to figure out a mission all by yourself, so the choice is yours.\n+ The levels do feel kinda alive, with NPCs chatting about different things\n+ Performance was ok on my system\n+ Lots of replayability and ways to solve a mission if you like to play that way.\n+ The contracts you can create, or contracts by other players, can be fun, but still are in the same settings as the missions.\n+ Some methods to solve a mission are fun to figure out, can be challenging, are pretty tactical.\n\nCons:\n- If you DON'T like to unlock everything or try many different ways to complete a mission, there isn't much to do.\n- Always online, and if you lose connection, your progress in the current session is lost. Haven't experienced that yet, but I only played for 3 hours (have completed the tutorials and the Paris mission in those 3 hrs). However, I kinda worried in the back of my mind while playing, hoping the connection would not break up.\n- The "gradual release" thing might be an experiment, or might be a method to generate income while the game is still being worked on. Personally, I'd prefer to have the FULL game right away, as I doubt I'll go back to this game every month to play the new content, as I'll probably be playing something else by then, and going back to readjust to the game and its mechanics every month isn't a fun thing to do IMO.\n\nVerdict:\nIf you are a completionist, or wanna test the game, get the intro pack and decide whether you like the game enough to upgrade and wait for future content. The game is decent. Nothing mind-blowing regarding AI, gameplay, performance or graphics. Your mileage may very much vary, so for some hItman-fans, this might be perfect, while others will hate the gradual release. I give the intro pack a 7.5/10, if I had paid the whole thing probably a 5 or 6","March 19","true","9.1"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

There is only one big map and after couple of dozen playthoughts you will see everything on it.\n\nI also wanted to add something from myself:\n* Contracts are worse than in Absolution. Basically, there are only two options - disguise and killing method. That's all, really. Also there is no way to call out your friend to do the contract or even find contracts done by your friends\n* Leaderboards is worthless because scoring system is too simple. Only way to get higher score is to beat the mission as fast as possible. Also, no way to check score of your friends to compete with them.\n* Weapons. This might be minor, because true silent assassin doesn't use guns, but, ugh, have you seen them? It's like the same gun that can be a shotgun or sniper rifle depending on the barrel you attach.  Oh, and no weapon customization.\n\nBut! The cool thing is that IO stated from the start that first we'll get the very basic features, and then they will expand the game.

People complained about Jesper Kyd not being responsible for it, even before they heard anything from the soundtrack (that's why I'm mentioning this).\n\nCons:\n- The Lowest settings for graphics seem to be quite high. There is no way to disable the planar reflections and the minimum level of detail is way too high for me. This does NOT mean it's a bad port. For what the game looks like, I think it runs like a decent port. Make sure to check out the minimum requirements before buying the game, as they are really high.\n- I pre-ordered the game before it became episodic and ended up with just a part of the game (for now). Later it was decided that the PS4 gets some exclusive content. Personally, I think that's no way to treat your customers.\n\nNeutral:\n+- You can initiate combat, but the game was clearly not made for this. New enemies will keep on spawning until you die. If you find yourself in combat, try to hide or kill the witnesses before they alert others.\n\nUnfortunately, the majority of bad reviews seem to be the caused by the fact that the game became episodic.

One negative the same day of release, and one positive a few days later. This review, after it having had been out for a few weeks, is negative for a reason. I explain below.\n\nTL;DR - Episodic releases have ruined this game for me, and the series. If this developer takes this course again, for any release, then I am done with them, that includes the Hitman series.\n\nFine tooth comb version 1.0:\n\n- Episodic releases. I remember someone posting a forum post when the game releases and called everyone that disliked the episodic releases a bunch of crying babies. Well I would have to ask that person if they have a full-time job, and also attend college full-time, and also have a family to support, and also have a wife to please, and also have very limited gaming time. My point is this exactly; I like diversity. I like a little of this, a little of that. Episodic releases do nothing but force us to master a select few levels, with content we have seen tons of times over and over again, to master them. To me, this is not fun. So what happens, I spent $60 on a game, that I have played for less than 10 hours total, because of this stupid mastering system. You know what I loved about the old Hitman games, before this episodic release crap? I could log in, pick a level I loved to play, for a new experience each time. I could replay it forward, backward, story mode, or just slaughter everyone with a change of pace and scenery. It's like eating Broccoli every day for dinner, and then next month, only 30 days away, we get to incorporate potatoes with our broccoli! How exciting! Meanwhile, everyone is anorexic... Episodic release. What a stupid f'in idea.\n\nThe game runs fine. I have no qualms at all with that portion of it. The first bogus wooden ship stage, first time I played, in DX12 I froze up, but after that I had nothing. I play in DX12, maxed out, running on an OC 4.3ghz intel quad core, samsung SSD and nvidia gtx 980ti ftw edition. I have no problems with the graphical sense of the game.\n\nMy sole review on this game is based off of a stupid decision which has ruined the game for me. If I could get the $60 back that I paid for it, right now, I would.","April 2","false","14.5"," 40 of 68 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","40","68","8","0"

Lots of people seem to be complaining about the episodic release but it's stated upfront, so I don't know what they were expecting.\n\nThat aside, the game is very fun, with elements like escalations and contract kills to maintain replayability. Escalations are 5-part missions where after each level, they introduce a new parameter such as either killing another person or completing the mission in under 5 minutes. By the time you get to the final part of the mission, it's generally quite difficult and requires good planning. So far I've completed about 9 escalations and find them to be my favorite part of the game so far.","April 14","true","40.8"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","29","48","0","0"

I have played Hitman games since the beginning and "Blood money" is by far my favorite. This title brings back the sandbox elements of "Blood money" but with updated graphics and gameplay.\n\nI had no problem running Hitman on Ultra (GTX 970), but decreased the settings a tad to ensure that it ran smoothly, which it really does! (Unless you are disconnected from the servers and have to restart from the lobby).\nThe visuals are not "spectacular" but still really good.\n\nThere's high replayability of the missions. I've played 18 hours on two tutorial levels and the one mission level when writing this and am now eagerly awaiting the next episode.\nTo be honest, the episodic format kind of forces you to replay the same missions. However, this is in my opinion quite nice as I don't feel stressed to just quickly complete a mission. There's actually time to really enjoy and master each level this way.\nAlso, it feels very good to know that there are plenty of missions to come as the game is already really fun. For me the release of every episode will have a hype factor to it.\n\nThe AI is not the best, but I don't expect that from Hitman games. It is true that you cannot change difficulty settings and this might seem like a bummer, but from what I've played so far I feel it is balanced. It still requires skill to do a "Silent assassin + Suit only" run perfectly.\n\nDefault key bindings are a mess, but they are customizable so that's fine.\n\nVerdict:\nI understand if you want to dismiss this game due to the questionable business model, but if you like Hitman games please don't. If you are not keen on waiting for episodes, wait until full release.\nThis game is really fun and does not deserve the mixed review stats. If you doubt it, buy the intro pack and judge it yourself. I'm glad that I bought the full experience and within a couple of episodes I'm sure I will feel like the price was justified.","April 13","true","43.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It absolutley kills me that I had to request a refund for this game due to the developer's elitist attitude and unwillingness to address the community's overwhelming  gameplay issues and techincal problems.\n\nNow the small level to level experience of Absolution wasn't the greatest, but at least I was able to actually play it at a stable 60fps. This game however has perhaps the poorest optimization I've seen in recent years.\n\nI have:\n\nI5 3rd Gen\nNvida 760TI\n8gb Ram\n\nNot the most powerful system, but I can play Hitman Absolution, Grand Theft Auto V, Max Payne 3, on VERY HIGH settings and get a smooth 60 FPS in 1080p.\n\nTo give you an idea of how ridiculous the PC optimization for this game is, I can't even get a smooth gameplay experience ON LOW Settings at 1280p resolution!\n\nIt doesn't matter if you have an Nvida - AMD, I5 - I7, Direct X 11 - Direct X 12- You are GUARANTEED to run into frame rate dips and crashes unless you are running the best of the best.\n\nIn addition to immersion breaking technical issues, you also have clueless developers that refuse to face the facts , own up to their mistakes, and most importanly, FIX THEM!\n\nHere are some of the many issues people are complaining about, and rightly so :\n\n- One episode released per month. You have to wait until 2017 to have all the levels.\n- Releasing un-tested updates that further break the game and don't fix current issues\n- Terrible gameplay optimization issues that render the experience unplayable for many, including myself.\n- Forcing you online for no plausible reason. Achievements are only available in online mode.\n- If you lose your connection to their server in the middle of a mission, you're immediately sent back to the menu without a chance to save your progress to "re-connect".\n- You can play in offline mode, but many game types are not available and Online and Offline saves are not compatiable!\n- The autosaving feature, which turns on when you're about do any sort of action (approach a NPC, execute a task etc) causes a stutter each time it runs.\n\nYou may notice that i did play this game for 27 hours. The first level, though far from a smooth experience, was still playable. With the release of the second episode however, the game is now compleltey unplayable.\n\nWhat makes this such a shame is that the big open levels are back, the npc Ai is better (but not perfect) and with the release of the second episode; Sapienza, there are some great visuals.\n\nAll in all, do yourself a favor and miss this purchase, at least for now. Hopefully the developer will get their ♥♥♥♥ together and properly optimize this game, however I've given up on that hope after 3 months and countless updates.","May 7","false","27.8"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","27","45","2","4"

Well put together and more blood money style than anyother hitman (I have really disliked all other takes on this game other than blood money and this one).\nB.  Visually pleasing.  I run this on max settings and its nice.  Not sure why there is an in game benchmarking tool for this as it really isnt that impressive, but still very nice.\nC.  Depending on your mark this can be very challenging depending on your mission requirments or personal goals.  This would not be a good game without challenge and once you start playing around a little there are some pretty cool/funny kills like drowning a mark in the toilet (super duper swirley) or killing one target with the falling body of another target.\nD.  My favorite feature, the community created hits.  I did little to no reserch on this game and only watched a bit of gameplay before buying as I had pretty much written this series of games off years ago.  But really this hitman sandbox thing they have going is pretty cool.  It keeps the game fresh and fully allows you to approach a target to the best of your abilities making this a more open experience in comparison the the story.\n\nThe bad...\nA.  One of the most counter intuitive key command systems I've played in a long while.  Im not sure why the devs couldn't figure out how to make one key do multiple things such as hold shift to run and also hold shift to slide down a ladder faster.  In this game shift is run and holding S and X is slide down.  Its wierd, thats not the only thing, but its an example.\nB.  The way the game is layed out for payment.  Its has kind of a rip off feel to it.  Look it up but in short you pay an initial price for "the game" and then more money for "levels"...and it really was released with only one level as in my opinion the tutorial does not count.\nC.  The sniper, assault rifle, smg, and shotgun all look incredibly stupid.  Larger than they should be and... purple.  I mean really purple!  I wanted to be a cold blooded hitman and you gave me PURPLE GUNS !?!?!?!?!?!  I dont want to get my account in a bind but read into that.  That really is upsetting and I wonder who in that dev team made that call or maybe it was the janitor that snuck into the game files late one night and set the color to purple and increased the size by +50%.\n\nThe inbetween...\nA.  The one level launch.  This in my opinion is mostly bad but the positive part of it is since there is only one "sandbox" area, the percieved lack of content issue subsides when you realize how much there is to do in that one place.  The menus are a little funky on the home screen but throw 10 minutes at looking at everything and then do some of that stuff.  Once you realize how much there is going on the saltyness of what you thought you purchased goes away as you realize what content is actually there.\nB.  Unlocks.  The weapons are NOT very unrewarding to unlock.  You feel no more powerfull than you did before unlocking them.  They missed the mark for sure there, but the unlocks for inserting into different areas with disguises already on was suprisingly good...not like a bad ♥♥♥ weapon...but still good.\n\nAgain I wish steam had a rating that was middle of the road but I will give this one a thumbs up but really do your reserch.  Look at gameplay, check out the pay structure, find out what all the content I mention above is.  This is a slower game which is what makes is a quazi believable playthrough.  If your game library is full of COD games or CS go, you will probably hate this game.  Again do your reserch so you dont put money to something that you utimatley may not like for a variety of reasons.\n","April 9","true","19.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

This is the best hitman game I've experienced yet though.\n\nIf you're considering to buy this game, here are some of my thoughts:\n\nBad:\n\nCrashes - Frequently (can be annoying as you've spent many hours doing a mission with hard work to see it crash after)\nFPS - Dropping and Raising every now and then.\n\nGlitchy - When dragging body's, this may be a bit glitchy if you're moving them from a chair as the character's body your dragging starts shaking. Sometimes if someone has long hair and you hide their body inside a closet for an example, their hair may come out of the closet, please fix this!\n\nAlways Online - This can be very, very annoying. This constributes to the part where if your internet shuts down for a second, your whole entire game will crash and progress will be lost. But at the same time, I do understand why they do this (to stop people pirating the game)\n\nBlood: I realized that the character's you kill don't really have blood animations, please add blood animations to make the game even one step closer to realism.\n\nEpisodes - Episodes are being released monthly which can be very annoying. This doesn't really put much of an effect on me as the first episode is very hard to complete. Even if I did complete it, I would be doing the different methods of the killing.\n\nGood:\n\nGraphics - The graphics on this game are unbelievebly good, I don't know how they're going to be able to make another Hitman game with graphics this good!\n\nKilling - When killing people (e.g with a fire axe, wrench, etc.) the animations are quite realistic.\n\nBlood Puddles - When you've killed a person, a blood puddle is created underneath them, but it's a shame you can't actually see blood animations.\n\nThere are a lot more good things, but I can't really explain all of it in this little review.\n\nOverall, I would most surely recommend HITMAN for killing game lovers. I'd also recommend getting the Full Experience instead of the Intro Pack as there are a lot more fun missions that you will be missing out on if you don't get it.","April 6","true","89.0"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","28","47","3","4"

The thing that hurt me the most with this game is terrible performance ;/ I dont mind always online design...

Bad move from IO Interactive here as that DRM might have just killed the game for them... as it is inpossible to maintain 60FPS in this game without i7 series processor overclocked to 5Ghz.\n\nWould i recomend this game to a friend ?\nWell if you can invest in water cooling and have an amd CPU with at least 8 cores overclocked to 4.2Ghz and you dont mind 30fps with dips to 25 on highest settings.

At first I was like you reading reviews and thinking "well damn, this game might be ♥♥♥♥." So many good reviews and so many bad reviews. Well, I decided to buy the intro back and hope for the best. I'm glad i did this, because the game is increadible.\n\nI have ZERO performance issues with Hitman. ZERO, I run the game at max settings @ 2k resoultion. Mind you I'm running an i7 6xxxxK, 32gb DDR4, and have a 980 TI. only issue I had was the load times were slow, however that was fixed in the most recent patch for me.\n\nThe gameplay is execellent, they brought back the classic gameplay forumla that we all loved. This game plays more like Blood Money execpt better. I've put about 12 hours into the game so far and I have yet to complete all the tasks/kills/achevements. That is only for two levels, what kind of AAA title lets you get that much replay out of TWO LEVELS. NONE, most campaigns can be completed under 8 hours.\n\nI would recoomend you buy the intro pack and try the game yourself. It isn't much to bet, You've prolly spent more on crappy pre-alpha games that have not gotten anyway. So buy the intro pack, give it a spin.

Lee","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018453161/","36 products in account","This pre/review might get updated along the way to reflect more of the gameplay, bugs and what not.\n\nI was about to make a pass on this game, partially due to the negative reviews (which doesn't detail the bugs nearly as good as some of the positives) but mostly because I'm on a 2core CPU with the minimum recommended specs having a 4core. In other games that are more CPU than GPU heavy I really feel the boundaries of my 2 cores >.<\n\nPlease note that I haven't tried the first mission yet, Paris, and I've only been fiddling around in the tutorial so far - But what a time it's been. Not only am I having fun, but the game is awesome to look at. It runs smoothly, and there are multiple ways to complete and approach an objective. It's filled with challenges which helps on the replayability a bit, for those of us who aren't die hard Hitman fans - I'm not one for sure :)\n\nThe big elephant in the room: DRM and Episodes.\nI really don't mind the DRM in this case, for one reason only. My internet is stable. For people in rural areas, on shoddy connections or something similar, I could imagine this being a big deal breaker. I haven't tried the offline mode yet, mainly since I've read it's so "crippled" compared to the online one (Saved checkpoints/games aren't compatible, some modes/achievements/challenges are limited or even disabled).\n\nAbout the episodes... *shrugs* I knew it, going in to it, since I just recently purchased it. I feel for anyone who preordered it under the assumption they were going to get a full game. Especially if you couldn't get a refund, or stuck around hoping for it to turn out better than it did (for you).\n\nMy mismatched PC parts are; Intel Pentium G3250 (3.2Ghz 2 core) - 8GB XMS3 1600Mhz - MSI GTX 970 4GB.\nI'm still fiddling a bit with the settings to see how far I can push it but so far I haven't had issues running it with this:\n\nExclusive Fullscreen - 1920*1080 - Vsync OFF - Vsync interval; 1\nSuper Sampling 1.00 - Level of Detail; Medium - AA; Off - Texture Quality; Medium - Texture Filter; Trillinear - SSAO; Off - Shadow Maps/Resolution; Both on Medium.\nThey are close to the defaults which instead are: Resolution 2715*1527, AA; SMAA - Texture Filter; Anisotropic 4x and SSAO On.\nI've been fiddling with the settings/benchmark for a while, trying out some of the recommended settings and upping both shadow maps and resolution. I was still able to pull an average of +40 during the benchmark with low dips around 20. Lowest FPS always seems to change even with the same settings :)\n\nAs I always say: If you're unsure, try it out and if you don't like it ask for a refund.\n\nEdit 1)\nAfter the update, it also updated its recommened settings for me. The game finally found out I only had two cores to play with so now the defaults are:\nIt still wants DSR (2715x1527), but everything is recommended to be low, off and trilinear filter (If bilinear was there I bet it would've rec. it haha).\nNvidia Experience freaks out even more, wanting me to dip the resolution to 1360*768.\n\nHOWEVER:\nI've bumped the Texture Quality up to High and the shadow maps up on ultra and things are still running great (I haven't done a benchmark yet).\nI have to note, I did have issues with my CPU (msiOSD win.task) causing some of the FPS dips (also noticed it in other games) and after it got fixed the game is running much more smoothly.\nI would not have expected it to run this great :)\n\nStill recommending it even with some of the bugs I've noticed:\n\n- Game has crashed on a few occations (2).\n- Disconnects prior to game patch which enables us to retry.\n- Buggy planning menu causing disconnects and "unplayable" gameplay (There are two "storage options" to chose from when planning - Large and small. Whenever I picked small, the game would try and load the next screen and did a "soft-disconnect" to the main menu). It worked the next day :)\n- Update haz br0k3n mah keybored! Sarcasm aside, people are having issues with subdue/snap neck. Prior to update they we're labeled Q and E - Now, when the target you're strangling is lying on the ground, the snap neck command is Q (instead of E) which I think is resulting in the quick-snap effect people are having (Victim gets their neck snapped before 47 begins to lay them down >.<)\n\nAnother issue I noticed today, which might entirely be on my end (or unrelated for that matter): While booting it up for the first time today I forgot I had my headphones plugged in and after plugging in my speakers the game "hung" on the launch screen.\nAfter skipping it, the main menu was laggy AF and I didn't have music so I decided to just reopen the game which solved the problem.\n\nAll the issues I've had so far have been noted here - For me, they aren't game breaking, but I wanted to detail them in any case.\n\nThanks for the upvotes :)","April 11","true","79.1"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Don't get turned off by the fact that the final game only features 7 levels, because the levels are really big. Playing them again to find all the different way to kill and approach your target offers quite some content next to extra challenges and contracts.\n\nThe episodic release even gives you the option to just test a small part of the game for a small price and then you can still decide if the game lives up to the name and buy the rest.\n\nThe only big complain I have about the game is the always online DRM. Now you can play with no connection but that doesn't save any progress.\nA singleplayer game absolutly should not demand a connection to the internet and I hope this will be changed. What if the server go down or your internet craps out? That means getting kicked out of the game.\nI never had any issues with the connection though so I don't mind it that much and if you don't have a problem with it either then I highly recommend getting Hitman.","April 22","true","49.5"," 31 of 53 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","31","53","0","0"

I have no issue with the new design being centered around repeating this large map with varying objectives. It's fun trying to complete escalations as the mission difficulty slowly increases. I used to play Blood Money in the same way, completing a mission and then trying a new angle. So it's cool that they've built this in with their unlock and challenge system.\n\nKills are satisfying in that there appear to be multiple options. There are some of the bigger more staged options and I would recommend turning off the Opportunities hints as they basically hold your hand. Beyond that though it's fun turning people chaotic so you can sneak up behind someone and stab them with a lethal injection. The core of the game (map design, ai, sound, visuals) is great.\n\nWhat's not good:\n\nI'm always amazed how developers can create something good and then shoot themselves in their own foot. I don't play Hitman for multiplayer. Leaderboards are why the game has always-on drm. And it's felt. On my final part of an escalation mission, I was disconnected randomly and bounced back to the main menu. This negated all the work I had just done. To have my play interrupted by a feature that I care nothing about in a game that isnt about other people is beyond infuriating. I appreaciate them trying to tap into community content with the contracts feature. But we don't need always on drm for that.\n\nAlso the episodic release schedule is confusing for a hitman game. The story isn't compelling enough for me to WANT to see what happens next. Which has to be the case for Episodic release to work. Instead you walk away feeling like you have a very small repetitive game.\n\nBOTTOMLINE:\nCore mechanics are great but the game is hampered by always on drm and episodic release schedule. Not enough content to keep you motivated to continue playing.","April 6","false","7.8"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","24","40","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/illmaticxking/recommended/236870/","illmaticxking","Earl Sweatshirt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/illmaticxking/","367 products in account","This game is actually really good. Most people seem to want to hate the game because of having to be always online and the fact that it is being released in an episodic format. Does it suck having to be always online to be able to play a single player game? Sure. The fact of the matter is that some people, much like myself, are always online anyways so this affects me, in what I feel,  such a small way. As for the game being episodic, Square has made it abundantly clear that it was going to have this type of release, so I'm surpised (and also not surprised) that many people who write reviews use this as a negative. You purchased the game knowing what it was going to be like and if you don't enjoy, then refund it.\n\nAs for gameplay I would just like to give a few pros and cons that I have noticed in my small amount of play time.\n\nPros:\n\n- Extremely open and the level provides a variety of ways to complete it.\n\n- Actions seem to be a lot faster in this one. Dumping a body in a dumpster for instance, you don't have to watch the whole scene.\n\n- The people who stand around a level/the scenery really makes the game atmospherically amuzing.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- I heard that the game has slow load times, though on an SSD, this is not an issue.\n\n- The game does not run very well. I have a 980ti/i7 4770k and I had to turn down a lot of options to get a steady 60 frames per second.\n\n- The game crashes sometimes. I have only experienced this twice and luckily it was resolved by using DX11 instead of DX12. I can definitely see how this would turn someone off of the game.\n\nThat's about all that I can notice so far. I look forward to more levels being released because by the way it's looking, it is going to be WAY more like Blood Money than Absolution....which is like, what everyone wanted in a new Hitman game, right?\n","April 11","true","4.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I took the time to read a majority of them and the only problem they seem to have is connection issues. I have yet to have one connection issue with my game.\n\nSince that is the case, I must spend my criticism on the actual gameplay. This game is immense! I cannot find a better word to describe it. Only one mission, but 1000 ways to complete it. I spent most of my time completing challenges and discovering new ways to lure, expose, or kill my targets. This element was prevelant in Blood Money but absent in Absolution. Glad the developers took the time to recognize that and bring it back into the world of assassination. It took me about 4 hours to finally achieve Silent Assassin with only wearing the suit. Talk about difficult.\nFor those who enjoy the difficulty of playing Hitman, take off all the indicators, instinct, mini-map. It makes it that much harder. Also  try avoiding the use of any guides, for it will only decrease the enjoyment. I would also like to say that if you are a perfectionist, then get ready to hit that restart, save, and load buttons multiple times. The Showstopper mission in Paris is full of obstacles that need to be conquered. The AI is very sensitive to small movements, sounds, and any altercations 47 has with other people. If your goal is to kill someone other than your targets, then by all means do so. Just know that if you don't hide the bodies there will be consequences.\nLastly, I would like to talk about the mechanics of the game. If you are thinking about doing something with an object, then you can do it. Name an object: knife, screwdriver, wrench, lead pipe, scissors, fire axe, remote controlled explosive device with detonator. Take these items and do what you please with them. The environment allows you to do what you please. You can shoot the chain off a chandalier and it will fall and crash. Shoot a fire extinguisher and it will explode. The possibilities are endless. 30 hours into the game and hoping to double it when more missions come out. The episodic development is a good idea for one reason. If you don't like the game, then you would only be screwed out of $15. You can buy the intro pack and see what the game is like. If you enjoy it, then buy the upgraded version for another $49.99. The devs were smart in doing this because there are some people who have not been die hard Hitman fans like myself. This type of game needs an aquired taste and loads of patience. If you cannot take your time to complete a mission, then do not bother with this game. Go back to your Call of Duty.\n\nPros\n-Unlimited ways to approach and terminate your targets\n-Immense environment to wander and lurk around\n-AI is very intelligent and have a variety of conversations\n-Sound is realistic (gun fire, glass breaking, etc.)\n-Gameplay is fluid and not mechanical\n-An array of challenges to complete (assassinations, discovery, feats)\n-Stealth and Aggression are both welcomed\n-Options to turn on or off indicators for assisstance\n-Pools of blood and blood splatter on walls\n-Sandbox style game\n\nCons\n-Graphics could be better\n-No multiplayer\n-Aim down sight is hard to get used to\n-Guards will shoot you if you do not comply\n-No rifle case for the sniper\n-POV is awkward (over the right and left shoulder view, it should be centered)\n-No first person point of view (it was available in blood money)\n-No use of human sheild\n\n\nOverall, the pros outweigh the cons. This review was as unbiased as I was trying to make it. It is a very enjoyable game to play. Again, for the hardcore Hitman fans, you shouldn't even be worrying about the review because you're probably already submerged into the game like myself. For anybody else, I recommend buy the starter pack first before buying the entire game. Get a feel for it. It takes patience and commitment and retrials. Hopefully you found this review helpful. May you all take on the role of Agent 47 and enter the World of Assassination. Thanks and have a nice day!\n","March 14","true","164.9"," 158 of 295 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","158","295","9","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reverenddude/recommended/236870/","reverenddude","Reverend Dude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reverenddude/","172 products in account","Most of the reviews I see that downvote this game seem to be from fanboys whining about how awesome a game from ten years ago was (Blood Money) and nothing compares to it. After praising the game for going back to the mechanics of Blood Money, offering huge levels to explore and tons of AI to deal with, and the replay value, they all slam this game and give it a thumb down. The main complaints, and I'll address them in line:\n\n1) Always-on DRM. Put it in offline mode. It's the same game with the same content. You can do this from the menu, you don't need to disconnect your computer or sign out of Steam. You're welcome.\n\n2) Performance issues. I've got an old AMD Athlon processor with a single GTX 970 graphics card that has yet to see any performance issues after 13 hours in the game. As most PC gamers know, there's a lot that could cause minor issues with ANY game. Chances are, the problems these people are seeing aren't caused by the game itself but rather their particular hardware setup.\n\n3) Episodic release. While this *may* be a legit complaint in certain ways, get over it. If you don't like it, wait until the full game is released and then purchase. Don't bash a game just because you want to play it ASAP. They aren't charging you any extra cash over what they would normally charge for the game (unless you do decide to purchase it piece-by-piece).\n\nAnd seriously...go back and play Blood Money again. It was great for 2006 but it doesn't hold up. The PC version doesn't have controller support, there's little AI to have to work around minus 2 levels (Mardi Gras and the Heaven/Hell party), and the levels are tiny save the Heaven/Hell party (that level was actually kinda massive at the time).\n\nHITMAN is a fantastic installment to the franchise offering massive levels, tons of assassination options, hundreds of AI characters throughout, and the classic "closed level"-style of gameplay that became synonymous with the franchise. If you're a HItman fan, this one is not to be missed.","April 17","true","60.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

This release broke my heart. I purchased the full experience and was excited to get into the "world" of assassination advertised in the promo videos. I completed the two training levels, was absolutely psyched to get into the actual game. Smashed through the first mission, assassinated the power couple and then moved on to..... oh. Moved on to nothing. You complete the first mission and that's it. Time to wait for the next one to be released. Meanwhile, please replay this map over and over with different targets so you don't get too bored. WHAT?!

Now while Absolution isn't the best as far as a Hitman title goes, at least it can be classified as a finished product. Hitman uhh......HITMAN is the newest entry in IO interactives most recognizable franchises, and it's broken. While I can't speak for all of the optimization, and performance problems of everyone allow me to share my experience. On booting up the game I put my settings to medium level of detail, high textures, medium shading and fxaa antilialising. As soon as the first training mission started, I get graphical glitches with the lighting. Shadows from light sources casting through walls, flickering constantly completely taking me out of the game. Other than that the game ran fine with my hardware which is an AMD 79503gb, 8gb ddr3 ram, and an intel i7 4770k proccessor. Upon turning the shadows on low the flickering stopped for the most part and i continued. Then onto the actual paid demo, I mean first entry in this episodic series. Everything was working in it's favor it felt great, looked great and reminded me of blood money times a 100. Then halfway through the mansion after running smoothly for 20 minutes it starts to stutter uncontrollabley, rendering the game unplayable. I was having such a good time too, the richness of the level and sheer number of ways I could accomplish my task is amazing. I love the disguise macanic and they've found a way to make it work in a sensible way. instead of being free to go wherever as certain disguises or needing instinct certain NPCs of that group youre dressed as may notice you, so a big strategy is finding the most unique disguise with the most access. All of the mechanics could have been so sweet, it's all there. I sincerely hope the developers address all performance issues and release the quality we Hitman fans have been hyped for.","March 11","false","56.3"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","14","22","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChrisWolf/recommended/236870/","ChrisWolf","White Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChrisWolf/","149 products in account","This is exactly what a Hitman game is supposed to be like, and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Great gameplay, huge levels and SO many ways to kill your targets, there's a ton of replayability here. And the game also runs very smoothly on my pc. With a GTX970, a I5 4690 @3.5GHz processor and 16GBs of RAM, I get over 60 fps at almost all times with nearly everything maxed out, except when I walk into crowds, but even then, the frame rate never drops below 40 fps.\n\nNow here are the bad things.\n\nAlways online DRM: Why, just ♥♥♥♥ing why? The game is 100% single player, the only multiplayer aspect that it has are the leaderboards, so why is it that I have to be connected in order to have access to a playable version of this game? For some people, this might not be an issue, but I don't have access to relayable internet, so I'm ♥♥♥♥ed there. But even when my internet works flawlessly this type of DRM still sucks, because if I'm downloading something on the background or watching a video on a different device, the game just gets SO FREAKING SLOW. And even people with good, relayable internet will have trouble with this, as the game's servers aren't stable at all and will, sometimes, simply not work. I seriously don't understand why bother with DRM like this. The only good thing about it is the fact that people can't cheat on the leaderboards, but that's 500 light years away from being worth all the problems it causes.\n\nBugs: Half the point of this game are the challenges. Given the fact that you have very little original content, due to the episodic nature of this game, you are left with challenges to complete after completing the mission the first time. But these are VERY buggy, I'd say about a quarter of them won't unlock after you complete them, making you have to redo the whole damn thing and just hoping that this time it will be unlocked. This is completely random, as doing the same exact thing will sometimes grant you the challenge and other times it won't. There are other minor bugs in the game, but the real significant bugs are all challenge related.\n\nEpisodic Content: This game is episodic. The game will be released by updates of little original content at a time. In this release, for example, there's about 60-90 minutes of original content, half of which are tutorials. After that it's all replaying the same exact missions in different ways. The major problem with this is that it's going to ruin the story. I can't see how we can get engaged in the game's story, if we're only going to get 5 minutes of cutscenes every month. There's a tiny little bit of story in this first release, but I don't even think about it and completely forget it even exists, just because of how little of it there is.\n\nOverall, I think it's an incredible Hitman game, and I personally love it. But they made so many stupid choices not while developing the game itself, but all the things around it, that I just cannot recommend it. It's too late to fix the whole episodic thing, but if they get rid of the damned always online DRM, then I'll give this game a thumbs up. But for now I say: Get it if you're a Hitman fan and you like the replayability aspects of the old games, who doesn't mind replaying the same level over and over, who knows the always online DRM isn't going to make the game completely unplayable for you at most times and who doesn't mind the episodic content. It's a long list, I know.","March 11","false","32.9"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","15","24","6","0"

Finally you feel like you are one amongst the crowd again which is something that has been seriously lacking in the past few hitman releases. Levels do not feel as linear as they once did and you now express your own assasin style as you move in towards your targets. Also, things can go terribly wrong and you can still make it through the mission which is where I find myself laughing the most and having a great time. I can only hope this game ends as epic as bloody money did.\n\nStory: So far the story seems very interesting. The story picks up sometime after agent 47 escaped the clone facility in Poland which was a mission you played in one of the earlier classic hitman games. I am interested in seeing the relationship between Diana and 47 develope further as well as enjoying the classic agent 47 personality\n\nSHOULD YOU PURCHASE THIS GAME NOW? NOOOOOoooOOOOoo!

AI can be a bit confusion, spotted or not even in uniform even if not facing them.

Almost done in a perfect stealth all that left is to get the exit. Here it is, right in front of me, just a few steps left... "You are offline". All progress is lost.\n\nThat was painful, very painful. But it happened only once and I, as you can see, I survived this tragedy.\n\nThe game itself is very nice. The map is huge, a lot of different ways to assassinate the target. I even like that the game is episodic as it gives me more time to explore the level without temptation to jump into the next one. Also, the game gets constantly updated with new escalation contracts, and also there are contracts created by users or can be created by you, but I don't like those very much.","April 20","true","29.3"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","17","28","0","0"

This game is the Hitman game we deserve!! This game is going to be amazing when its released in full!!\n\nPROS:\n-Blood Money mechanics.\n-Beautiful HUGE environments.  Marrakesh is the biggest Hitman level to date!!!\n-Replayability! There are literally tons of ways to take out a contract.\n-Hundreds of NPCs in a single level (think the Mardi Gras level in BM but all the NPCs are killable).\n-Decent AI.\n\nCONS:\n-Movement animations are a little choppy and "floatish".\n-Keyboard controls take a little getting used to.  Example: I wanna use my scroll wheel on my mouse to cycle my inventory and not press "I" everytime.\n-Targets are pretty easy to take out silently. However the fact that there are more ways to kill them than the previous games makes it slightly better.\n\nSUMMARY:\nI was on the "EFF SQUARE ENIX" bandwagon when I first heard about this "Episodic" release and I held off buying the game and considered not buying it at all. But being a Hitman fan I decided to read the Positive reviews from people just to see if the gameplay was any good.  From the sound of it, people were really enjoying the small amount of content they were playing.  So I decided to just buy it.  Honestly I'm glad I did because this is the type of game where you can play a single level over and over again so the monthy release, although annoying AF, is tolerable (EPISODIC RELEASES OF FFVII IS A HORRIBLE IDEA!!!). If you like Blood Money and you can get over the weird release system Square Enix thought we wanted, this game might be worth buying.  Personally I'm having a lot of fun and I'm excited for the rest of the contracts!!","April 16","true","32.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

There should be an offline mode, or at the very least it should not boot you in the middle of a level. If you have interrupts in your internet, then this game is not yet for you, hopefully they patch this. Nevetherless I refuse to believe that the ENTIRE game deserves a NEG review for this. After all, this has nothing to do with the actual game. I understand people are upset, but at least one review (mine) will not reflect this in my scores.\n-Episodes: I am not a fan of episodes either, I've played a few episode games so far, and the waiting really does get boring. However, unlike other reviewers I'm willing to take HITMAN episodes with a grain of salt. Especially in light of what the game makers are working to achieve.\n-For those who may not know:\n-This is one of the first games to support Dx12\n-The episodes / levels on this HITMAN are larger then ever before\n\nLevel Rant:\nI'll admit, I didn't like the idea of only one level at the begining, but as I challenged myself to complete more tasks available in the game. I saw more and more details that the game developers added. Things I missed if I were elsewhere in the level, and what could easily be described as repeating events, in watching (while try to silently kill) my targets i saw little changes constantly in the main targets behavior. This is something new the game developers are trying and I applude them for their efforts. Also I would trigger different events at different times, and yet the targets responded predictibly (which is a nessacary evil if were going to set them up for a silent kill) without breaking their "routine"...they would finish their current thing and then proceed to my trigger, so far i've yet to see a trigger fail...I did see a trigger not fire once, but I was far away from the target...it then triggered on the next run. Maybe this was a bug, maybe this was on purpose.\nOkay so I maybe rambling at this point, but my point is that the details the developers are adding considering the larger size of the levels is exteremly ambitious, and I support the month to month releases.\nI didn't like the fact that the April release was delayed until the near end of April, but we do have the after launch patches to compensate for that. There is nothing saying that the May release will be early, ontime, or late. Honestly I've always been in favor of supporting the developers, especially if there is evidence of them working to improving the game. So even if May's level released in June, but it was obvious that the developers did it for a reason...I as a gamer who enjoys well developed games would appreciate it. Even if the waiting was killer.\n\nSum up:\n\n\nPros:\n-Level design is done very well\n-Details in levels are good\n-# of props, areas to achieve creative kills are higher than any other game\n-Levels are huge\n-ways to trick / distract AI are better than ever.\n-Gameplay allows for good difficultly, yet hitman's abilties allow for creative ways around guards etc.\n-DirectX 12 imbeded (more on this below)\n\nCons:\n-Developers didn't stress to gamers the graphical achievements of the game (game runs slow, except on med-high+ systems)  [Yet I was able to run this on my gaming laptop with a 2yr old GPU]\n-The always online DRM is a mistake, no way around this but again my score won't reflect this, as I care about the gameplay\n-DirectX 12 imbeded (pro and con)\n\n\nDirectX 12: The Dx12 API is to Dx11 what Dx10 was to Dx9...That is the programing allows for better graphics, with smoother gameplay. Now anyone with a win10 system and a newer card  will easily see that in comparing Dx11 to Dx12 on Hitman there is only a 10-15% bump...not nearly as much as desired or as much as Dx12 should do. This is because you can overlay Dx12 on top of Dx11, but it doesn't allow for as great a proformance boost as creating a game from scratch with Dx12.\n\nIf anyone is still reading this, I am sorry this isn't a very good review, more of a rant...but hopefully it helped someone.\nI as a fan of hitman, but also a gamer expecting much of the series really enjoy the new Hitman, and am looking forward to the new level coming soon.\n","April 23","true","57.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Even if the waiting was killer.\n\nSum up:\n\n\nPros:\n-Level design is done very well\n-Details in levels are good\n-# of props, areas to achieve creative kills are higher than any other game\n-Levels are huge\n-ways to trick / distract AI are better than ever.\n-Gameplay allows for good difficultly, yet hitman's abilties allow for creative ways around guards etc.\n-DirectX 12 imbeded (more on this below)\n\nCons:\n-Developers didn't stress to gamers the graphical achievements of the game (game runs slow, except on med-high+ systems)  [Yet I was able to run this on my gaming laptop with a 2yr old GPU]\n-The always online DRM is a mistake, no way around this but again my score won't reflect this, as I care about the gameplay\n-DirectX 12 imbeded (pro and con)\n\n\nDirectX 12: The Dx12 API is to Dx11 what Dx10 was to Dx9...That is the programing allows for better graphics, with smoother gameplay. Now anyone with a win10 system and a newer card  will easily see that in comparing Dx11 to Dx12 on Hitman there is only a 10-15% bump...not nearly as much as desired or as much as Dx12 should do. This is because you can overlay Dx12 on top of Dx11, but it doesn't allow for as great a proformance boost as creating a game from scratch with Dx12.\n\nIf anyone is still reading this, I am sorry this isn't a very good review, more of a rant...but hopefully it helped someone.\nI as a fan of hitman, but also a gamer expecting much of the series really enjoy the new Hitman, and am looking forward to the new level coming soon.\n","April 23","true","57.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I would wait for more of the game to be released before buying but I can assure you that the gameplay is top notch and fans of the older Hitman games will love this. I honestly don't know why there are so many negative reviews of this game. An episodic game will be whole in a few months and what will be left is a fantastic Hitman game.

The game wants to hold your hand too much by default, but there are some settings that handle most of this.\n\nSo whats the problem?\nThe main issue I have is the publisher is not being honest about what this arrangement really is.   At the very least it's Early Access.  At worst, it is a creative way to rush an unfinished game out the door while mitigating a large portion of the backlash.\n\nIn short, the game is nowhere near finished.  We have a couple of maps to get a taste of the game and now we can wait or play the same map over and over..  but hey the season 2 trailer shows the real game we are waiting for.\n\nWhat about the online features?\nTo me it's late content.  The timed offerings are there to get you buy the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sup3rScrub/recommended/236870/","Sup3rScrub","spooky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sup3rScrub/","32 products in account","So, looking at the rest of the store page, there are a lot of bad reviews regarding the episodic content system and the wait between episodes, not to mention the lukewarm introduction in the form of the Paris Fashion Show, however, this review is based on content up to Sapienza.\n\nTL;DR:\n+ Graphically stunning\n+ Hours of replayability\n+ Living, breathing gamespace (Sapienza) with a real feeling of a busy town centre.\n+ Vibrant storytelling without clumsy narrative.\n+ Freedom to explore the game level with interpolated linearity. (Sapienza)\n+ Encourages the player to re-approach the scenario with a different method or style.\n\n- Episodic content is bad for those looking for a solid game to play.\n- Disappointing introductory mission in terms of freedom/structure. (Paris)\n- Benchmarks poorly on older systems. Recommend a GTX 950 + with sufficient memory.\n- A few bugs here and there, which seem to occasionally get patched, mostly physics bugs.\n- Have to play through the mission completing challenges in order to obtain certain features always afforded in earlier games (such as the TAC SMG (silenced)).\n\nI've been playing the HITMAN series for 6 years, ever since my friend introduced me to Blood Money (I went back and played all the previous games too), and I get a lot of joy out of replaying missions, and exploring all the possibilities for the mission - without a doubt in my mind, this latest HITMAN game has proven to have the most intricate level of detail and possibilities to progress through the mission, and find entertainment in trying to repeat the process with different methods.\n\nParis was disappointing, in the same way that one would open the box for a toy, only to find it was smaller than you thought it would be, and that a lot of the parts don't move. With such detail put into the map, it felt like such a shame that you couldn't really take the time to explore it in peace and appreciate the gamespace the studio have created.\n\nSapienza has taken the game a few steps in the right direction - the way the game should have went from the start - 47 starts in the heart of the bustling town, reading a newspaper on a bench, looking across at the front gates to a large mansion complex. Unlike Paris, there is nothing to force you onwards into the objective - you can wander the streets, listen to the residents, learn the thoughts of the people in this small town. The story-telling in Sapienza is possibly the best self-contained plot in the entirety of the series and paints 47's mission in a different light - a relative hero, in the face of a horrific threat to humanity. A stroll down the winding streets can lead you to the marina, a high steepled church, cliffside cafes and more, and as you look around this well painted canvas, you begin to see opportunities - the vantage point from the church, the sewer access of the marina, the back passages of the cafes and beyond. There are many, many more secrets to see and opportunities to find, the challenges to complete, and of course, the obligatory gun rampage playthroughs. This will consume countless hours for me.\n\nThen there is the matter of the maps still to come - if they have this same level of freedom to explore from the beginning and less linearity, then the only things that can really go wrong are the story-telling, and map design. I am looking forward to the next episode.\n\nOn the matter of episodes, as an MMO player, I think the episodic content for this game is fantastic. In a single session, if I play through a mission once, that is maybe an hour or so, plus the escalations, and custom contracts, which I'll play over a few days, and then probably revisit the game a few times during the month. In the rest of the time, I play other games, and will come back to HITMAN for a break every couple of days for an hour to break up the monotony of MMO grinding - this is great for me. For people who bought the game thinking they would get one straight 10-hour blitz, there was sure to be disappointment, but for those of you still looking to purchase the game, please check out some video reviews of Sapienza before making your decision, as the introduction package is merely that, and it does not show the potential of this game.","May 3","true","6.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

All they worked on was map design and a new look for 47. Utterly pathetic to see how much of the animations they've reused from absolution as well. How about a more creative combat system rather than the same thing over and over and over again, i want to smack their head on a wall or grab an object and smack them mid-quicktime fight. This is 2016 and I have to say I find it ridiculous that this game falls so far below the standards of improvement that other games have been held to.\n\nThe game misses so many of the flourishes which made Blood Money a literal work of art. there are hardly any mysteries left to the player after doing the map about 4-6 times which happens to take about less than half an hour to achieve. Also logistics, WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ ISN'T THERE A GARROTE FROM BEHIND THE SEAT ANIMATION??? You literally showed the celloist i always used to do that to so YOU KNOW IT EXISTED BUT CHOSE TO IGNORE it. One of my favourite things to do was to set up the sniper when it was in the suitcase, imagine how cool that would look with this generation's graphics? But no, apparently IO interactive thinks the only thing we didn't like about absolution was the fact it was linear and that they could get away with minimal effort.\n\nNow to answer a really obvious question. 'You recommend the game... yet your review is just plain negative' to which I say fair enough. It's not really clear but essentially I say this because the series is too good as a whole to abandon them now. It's not that this is necessarily a bad game on it's own, it's just A REALLY BAD ADDITION TO AN AMAZING SERIES and as such it should be held to a higher standard.\n\nBottom line is this game had and still has so much potential and as unlikely as they are to redesign it now at my behest I would still say support these guys so they meay have a better, more intelligent and dignified attempt next time round because yes Blood money was that good.\n\nP.S I will come back to this review 'episodically' because ♥♥♥♥ you if they can do it then so can I.","April 22","true","46.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","1"

The gameplay is nothing short of brilliant. Yeah, it has some flaws here and there, but no game is litterally perfect. As a Hitman game, this is pretty damn close though. As much as I liked Absolution for what it was, this is what Hitman is supposed to be like. It takes everything good from Absolution and Blood Money and then combines them together. You're presented with a large map and the objectives. Then you go to work aby way you like. Shoot everything that moves? Sure, you can do that. Sneak in and steath-kill only the targets? Yes, you can do that too. What about killing only those in your way to get to the targets? of course, it's a Hitman game! You can even make it look like accidents.\n\nThere is, however, one problem. It's not with the gameplay, it's not with the graphics. It's the content. This game has one level, well, if you don't count the tutorial. It was supposed to be one map, then one months after another one would come up. The problem is that the game was released on March 11th, and teh next map, well it doesn't come out untill today, which is April 26th. That's way too long. A map every two weeks or so would be great. Well, not better than just having everything released on the date the game came out, but the age of complete games upon launch is sadly long gone. Anyone else miss that? And then getting an expansion alomost the size of the original game a few months later? Yeah, those were the days. No I'm not here to complain and bicker about how the gaming industry has become and yadda, yadda. But if you do get hung up on this sort of stuff, do not even think about buying this game, yet. When everything is out and the game is complete, which at this pace will be in a couple of years, the game will be fantastic.\n\nSo stick around for the full game, as this game is gonna be great when it's actuall done.","April 26","true","15.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

At first I was skeptical of this game, but went ahead and bought it anyway since I'm a big fan of the series (wasn't impressed with Absolution, but it was an okay game...it just wasn't a good Hitman game).  This, I have to say, is a Hitman game.  I love that they got back to the Sandbox style, and Sapienze is BIG with tons of options.  My first play through I went through it with reckless abandon, exploring and killing like a maniac.  My second playthrough I was able to obtain the sniper rifle and start in the safe house.  I then waited outside for one of my targets to appear and shot her dead right at the very beginning.  This is what I was hoping for, but it is still a bit sad that they decided to release it like it's being released, and there are still some bugs to work out.  One is the V-sync problem.  I get 60fps, but I see a slight tearing effect so obviously something is broken or I'm missing something.  Other people are reporting the same problem.  But, the bottom line is this:  if you are a fan of the Hitman series (the real one where you play on a map and figure out different ways of killing the target(s), and loved how replayable the games were in the past, then I recommend this game.   As of this review, I have 14 hours on an intro and two maps, and I still haven't explored everything on both maps.   They are definately making this worth the money, IMO.","April 26","true","96.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The only other Hitman game ive played is Absolution... and i loved that one but only because of its storyline. The open worlds are more fun to explore but its not long before im bored by the lack of storyline and distracted by the fact that some kill opportunites need to be executed FAST before they disappear and require the level to be reloaded to use. Playing a level over and over again to complete about a dozen ways to kill a person just isnt my thing, and i cant recomend the game to anyone who feels the same.

The tutorial does a good job in conveying what Hitman is all about. The 'opportunities' (creative ways to kill targets) interface can be fully turned off, but is very nice feature for new players.\n\nAnd then the Paris level completely blew me away. The scale is massive. It's probably 4x+ the size of your average level from 'Blood Money'. And it ran very well and still looked amazing even though I'm on an older system.\n\nThe amount of things to explore in this single level is insane. It's like levels inside of the level (levelception?). There's the 'infiltrate the auction as a guest' level, there's the sharpshooter assassin level and many more.\nI've played through the Paris destination three times and I'm not even close to seeing everything and doing everything.\n\nAdmittedly you have to be more of a completionist and a tinkerer (a typical Hitman player) to get a lot of time out of it.

But now that I have it I'm so glad that I bought it. Yes always-online DRM is kinda stupid but some of the actual gameplayelements rely on an internet connection. For instance: You have challenges these get updated and added without changing things on the client-side. It's like a web browser in which you see new things when you press 'F5'. There's a way to improve this for offline access, like downloading the said challenges as soon as they are available. The same goes for "Escalation Mission". I haven't had any problem with this game so far, which turns me into a rare case somehow, and I've really been enjoying it.","April 26","true","182.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafarioch/recommended/236870/","mafarioch","Mafa Rioch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafarioch/","12 products in account","This game is exactly what Absolution should have been. This is a true Blood Money sequel. It has a great graphics, amazing sandbox maps with huge variety of approaching your missions.\n\nSHORT SUMMARY:\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- Great graphics\n\n- Open sandbox envoirnment\n\n- A decent amount of challenges to keep you playing, that is, if you aree that kind of person.\n\n- A good amount of playing modes, including contracts which you can create and share with people. (Also in CONS)\n\n- The maps are really huge compared to all previous games, which is kind of nice.\n\n- Allows you to plan your starting game plan, as in what weapons you'll take and where you'll start. The option becomes more varried the more achievements (masteries) you unlock.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Always online play.  There is an offline mode, but it has separate save files and all achievements are disabled. Such games should not require a constant internet connection, because it is not an MMO and you do not have any interactions with other players.\n\n- Episodic gameplay, usually with delay of releases. This means that you will be getting one mission per month till the end of the year. There is no info about additional missions after the year ends at this point.\n\n- No difficulty settings. Well, no manual difficulty settings. You can not choose the difficulty of your opponents or remove certain elements from the game to make it harder, however the game itself is not that easy, if you are trying to complete every possible achievement and challenges.\n\n- Voice over of actors is something lacking. Most NPCs speak native English no matter the location or country, and are voiced by same 4-6 actors. It breaks immersion for some people. Huge AAA titles should be able to hire more people for their games.\n\n- Soundtrack is decent, but average. The game misses Jesper Kyd orchestral music which was a huge part of the franchise itself. This CON is more or less personal preference.\n\n- Contracts mode is not as customizable as one would desire. You can mark up to 5 targets, select how they should be killed and what closes one should be wearing. However the options are flawed, and if you would like a person to be killed by a specific accident, the game will mark it as explosive or just melee kill.\n\n- DX12 mode is still something to work on, due it giving ocasional glitches and crashes on certain types of PC Builds.\n\n- Certian features were removed which existed in previous games, ex. Human Shield, Sniper briefcase. Developers say that they are working on those though, so they might be avaiable in later versions of the game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCONCLUSION\n\nMy personal conclusion as a fan of the franchise is to get this game if you're a fan of the series and the gameplay it provides. It is trully a sequel to blood money and has a great atmosphere to it. Locations are beauitful and the maps are humangous for you to explore. One level feels pretty much like 2-3 levels of any previous game in the series which is amazing, and the game actually is more deep than it used to be. The so called opportunities feature allows you to listen to various conversations and make your choice on how to adapt to what you have heard, which gives you a feeling of playing in the moment.\n\nDespite all the CONS of this game, I'd give it a rating of 8/10.","June 1","true","23.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

If sneaking around finally bores you, pick up an axe and try to finish off a room full of guards swinging. Very satisfying skull-crushing fun. Well thought-through leveldesign.\n\n-The Challenge / Reward-system is a good motivator to keep playing the same level over and over. It actually changes things up. The "oh no 1 level only, I'm a crybaby"-thing isn't really all that called for. Paying 12 euro for 30+ hours of gameplay isn't shabby at all. It's actually more than many "full" singleplayer-games.\nThat said, if you can't stand doing the same mission differently many times, don't buy this game.\n\n-Good Looking! (Although poorly optimized!)\n\nCons:\n-The always Online-crap. If I play for 8 hours I might be disconnected 2-4 times. It's not as horrible as other people say on here, the game auto-saves every 5-10 minutes and the disconnects doesn't happen THAT often. However, I still consider this a MAJOR drawback since I really believe game developers ought to know better than this. It's a stupid f*cking idea.\n\n-I have to say it again - poorly optimized. It looks good af but not so much when I have to play on low settings for a decent framerate. Lucky the people with monster hardware.. :)\n\n-Although it's not THAT big of a deal waiting between episodes (I mean cmon guys, just play another game when you're done with a level?) I still think it would've been way better to wait with the release of the game and released it in full.\nMaybe just release the first episode by itself a month prior to the release of EVERYTHING ELSE. It would've been like, "Hey,try this game before you buy but also don't be a pirate!" - like, f*ck yeah? right?\nNow instead it's this. Not horrific, but not good either.\n\nAtleast they priced the separate pieces and the upgrade-pack the same.

Also loading saved games now correctly loads information about chalenges and other stuff. But That is all for the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that the disconnections do still occure. Worse bad news is that the game gets unstalble after a while and craches simlpy as time passes. I have a save game whis is not finishable, because the game crashes aproximately 3 minutes after I load it, sooner if I kill someone. huh. WTF?\n\nAnyaway, the new map is not realy good. I would say that it looks really great at first but actually it is much worse that the first map. Main thing which I do not like is that there are some predefined routes, but If you want something as easy and simple as open/break a window that is not opened from the beginning (even from inside), you are out of luck. How lucky we are we that at least doors can be opened as expected. Runing over the roof is only allowed on thre (I think) places. Not to mention climbing on anything (wall, hill, rock) - it is not possible, unless there is a sharp ledge to hang on. oh well, another WTF. It really gest booring by now.\n\nWell, I think that this is more that enough update, for now. I will wait for another update/patch before even trying to play the game again, because I am now stuck with unfinishable savegame after some 4-5 hours and well, I have no intention wasting another single hour on any replay atemp unless I am pretty sure I will be able to at least finish the level...\n\nSo. I still do not recoment the game. Actualy if it was possible, I would recoment it much less than I recomended it earlier (and yes, I did NOT recomented it earlier).\n\n\nOriginal post bellow (was valid before second level (sappienza) was released):\nI will not say anything about the game itself as it is absolutely UNIMPORTANT compared to how unstable the game is.\n\nMy fist day (day of the release) experience was OK, but today (next day) it keep keeps crashing like 1x per hour and I got disconnected several times, which forced me reload, which does really made me angry (since I try to save as less as possible) and it looses all progress and sending me to the game menu.\n\nAnd no, it was NOT problem on my side - my connection was perfecly fine and working all the time.\n\nAlso, I forget to mention, that the finished oportunities and chalenges are NOT displayed correcly when game is reloaded. Some do still couts as finished when the mission ends, but it is a bit hard to keep trak of all of these since there are so many of them a well, basicaly they are the only reason I stick with the game after finishing the level for the first time. Which means it realy DOES break my game experience.\n\nSo. I can not recommend this game. Instead I recomment to anybody STAY AWAY until they can make the game  (at least) does not crash when interet connection to their lousy servers fail.\n\nIf there would not be for those, I would be quite satisfied with the game (knowing it is not a finished game), but as things are right now, I really do regret that I have bought it in its present state.","March 13","false","55.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

And ive managed to waste 40 hrs on that one level. Yeah i wish there were more levels, but I bought the game knowing how they were releasing things.

It really isn't a big deal)\n- You can't do xx when you could in past\n- It's episodic (Ok? A lot of games are. If anything you spend $15 to try a game with plenty to do and see if it's worth it. I wish Fallout had done something like this so I could of saved money)\n- Someone actually complained about the BONUS CONTENT of the elusive targets being limited on time... This person would never be pleased if they gave them the game for free...\n\nHere is the basis. It's a silly, fun game that you can play for 30 minutes and put down without a problem then pick it up later.

Firstly the game as stated before only has one actual stage other than the Beta stages (prologue / tutorial missions) which can be completed around 40 mins if played quickly. There is a good amount of replay but not enough for a full episodical release at a price of £39.99 at all\n\n2. The game will run at a smooth...ish 60+ fps if you meet the requirements but dips are clearly evident.\n\n3. The game at its current state is lacking content even for a episodical release.\n\nAt its current state i cannot reccomend the game with the lack of content for the moment but will probably recommend it in around 4+ months when the game is released (fully) and has patches to fix the various glitches.

I have played every Hitman game since the first, yes I am that old and crusty. I was so excited about Hitman Absolution I looked pass or dare I say Blindfolded my ♥♥♥ to help me ignore its shortcummings. The Hitman games have become a mindless series. Yes, the graphics are great, the environemnts are awesome and the dialogue is superb. However, the gameplay reminds of the old 8bit and bit days of gaming where you had to play the level several times to memorize what or how the AI would behave. My good friend since High-Schoool has worked at "IO" / Square Enix or whatever they call themselves for about  odd years. He has happily worked on more than one Hitman game in the past and always had great things to say. However, in the last  3 to 4 year or so it has not been that way. Jeff has always said very little about Hitman Absolution and the recent Hitman now series "For Profit". He left IO interactive 6/15 and was asked to reconsider through several emails and meatings with upper management. As he worded it, the series has become a mindless game where the "AI" has predertimned paths and behaviors in place regardless as to how you play the level or navigate it. So, no matter how well you plan your attack on the level, you will most likely have to "Redo" it once you learn the AI paths and behaviors. I feel like its 1999 again.

I have been a fan of the hitman seires so when i heard of this one you could imagine how psyched i was when i heard of a next gen hitman game. When the game was released i went to purchase it but noticed it was being released in levels and that one level would be relased every month. Most peole would have been put off by this (Just look at the other reviews) but really i see this as opportunity to really expierience every bit of detail each level has to offer without feeling the need to keep pressing through the story. I purchased the 15$ version of hitman and was extreamly impressed with this game. I have put in 18 hours on only the first mission and i will continue to play through and explore the possibilites and challenges. The developers really did a good job with this one. I will most deffinetly purchase the rest of the game when i have the money but for now i will continue to complete challenges and public contracts because i can honestly say i cannot get sick of this games deep and rich gameplay. I highly recomend this game to any true hitman fan. If you love the hitman games and really enjoy playing these games over and over i feel you will love and respect what the developers have to offer with this one. Please do not be put off by the harsh reviews people have given this game. I personally have not had any issue with connectivity issues and have tested this game offline and it works just fine.

I just love how many challenges and ways to kill your targets the game has to offer. There are so many ways you can kill your target and they are very fun and original. Even though, there is only one map at the moment, for me it is pretty big. I have been playing for 12 hours, and I still need to complete more challenges. If you don’t mind playing the same level again and again to discover all what the game has to offer, I highly recommend it. The only con I found is that the AI can be easily exploited. However, other than that, I’m having a lot of fun and I love the game.

And we get kicked out of our games to the main menu whenever there's a connection issue while playing the regular story mission.\n\nThey deliberately failed to mention those details before the game was released.\n\nAnd then today, after players have inquired about this situation for two weeks, IO responded to an inquiry by games media regarding our feedback, which IO has said they would listen to and respond to quickly[hitman.com], where they imply that they informed us pre-release how the game was going to work, and that we just didn't get it,\nOriginally posted by IO spokesperson:When we announced Hitman, we explained to fans and to gamers everywhere how we are creating a live game.[www.eurogamer.net]IO also took the opportunity to market the game with their fancy buzzwords.\nOriginally posted by IO spokesperson:This is a constantly evolving, living world of assassination, that will grow alongside the community with frequent content updates in between the launch of each location. This live content includes new contracts, escalation contracts, elusive targets, and even additional challenges.[www.eurogamer.net]Which seems to be of more importance to them, than communicating with and addressing the concerns of the community they claim to be working alongside, listen to, expect to build, and to be supporting them and their misleading, disrespectful bulls*** throughout the game's release schedule.\n\nGuess we'll see how that works out for them.

Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryan_kras/","229 products in account","Episodic release was such a terrible choice for the HITMAN franchise, the Paris mission was fun, and there are tons of ways to assassinate your target, and different disguises which allow you to perform special activities providing for tons of replayability of a single mission, and really makes User-Created contracts a good challenge and always unique.\n\nPerformance wise I was fine, definitly notice some FPS drops, other than that it went pretty smooth for me.\n\nWas this mission worth the $15, sure. But if you can hold out till the full release. Do that.\n\nOnly reason I do not recommend it, is because I feel episodic games really kill the vibe and flow when trying to immerse you as the Hitman. After completing Paris full stealth and only using lethal methods on my target I was ready to jump into the next mission, but unfortunately I'll have to wait until next month.\n\nEDIT: They really need to upgrade Contracts Mode. I just spent an hour finding hard to reach targets in Agent 47's suit in-doors, and kill each one with a sniper rifle. After losing connection to the server I get booted out to the main menu, and while creating a contract you cannot save. So I just re-did the entire contract and performed all my target kills in 47's suit, with a sniper rifle (my assumption was this would make it very difficult to complete my contract). Then I look at it when I'm done and wearing 47's suit is OPTIONAL, and it doesn't require the kills to use the sniper, it just says Fire-arm kill not what specific weapon. The whole point of attempting with the Sniper was it is hard to sneak your way in with a rifle on your back, but hey you can just use a pistol so why even bother.\n\nWhat a great system.","March 11","false","28.3"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

And do you know how I was able to do that? The original Publisher and developers didn't force me to be online to play a game that I intended to play Offline, to immerse myself in the world of Hitman and make up my own stories as I carried out my duties as an assassin.\n\nAs soon as you load up the game, the first thing you're greeted to is your options menu for the graphics. You'll note that Texture quality HIGH is greyed out, as is 2K Resolution, my native for all of my monitors.\n\nLoading the game up, you're next given a screen advising that "Hitman is designed for Online play, and your save games are not interchangeable between Offline and Online modes". As an Australian that lives out in the bush, where Internet is not always the most stable, this becomes a problem as we're then unable "to play the game it was designed to be" which ultimately detracts from the overall experience. Additionally, should I then desire to play the game Online and get the "full experience", I'd lose all my progress Offline and have to start over.\n\nAs of writing this, I've still been unable to play ONLINE as my connection to the Hitman servers has failed over and over, yet here I sit browsing the internet and writing this review for you. Thus, I launched the game Offline. Graphically, the game looks beautiful, and you can really appreciate the amnount of work the developers put into immersing the player into the world, however the game runs like absolute dogshit. There's been no optimization whatsoever for PC (as should now be expected for most, if not all, AAA titles) and I find myself struggling to hit over 50FPS with at least ONE of my graphics cards. With both my cards in their original and intended SLI configuration, you'll receive jaggies, screen tearing, and no improvement whatsoever to your FPS.\n\nDo not buy this game, wait until the devs fix the game and release it "how it was intended to be played": in a working state.\n\nThank god for Steam Refunds.","March 11","false","0.5"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","16","28","4","0"

However, I have experienced zero issues with this game thus far.\n\nThe last installment, Absolution, missed the mark in my opinion and lost the feeling of the original games. Blood Money is widely thought of as the greatest Hitman game. I would agree with this. Well, for those who played Blood Money and loved it, I suggest you get this new Hitman. They have clearly listened to everyones concerns after releasing Absolution and this new Hitman recaptures the style and fun gameplay most of us loved in Blood Money.\n\nYes, it's episodic but the level that has been released so far is absolutely huge and has endless possibilites and plenty of opportunity to replay. For me, if people are just blitzing through the main mission to get to the next level, they are missing the whole point of a Hitman game. The satisfaction comes in refining your tactics and experimenting with new techniques.\n\nI love it.","March 16","true","20.4"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

THEY SEE YOU WHEN THEY SHOULD NOT, AND DON'T SEE YOU WHEN THEY SHOULD! AN INSULT FOR THE PLAYERS.\n\nI can only write a first impression, since I only finished the tutorial and just started the Paris level.   Let me start to say that I am a big Hitman fan and played and finished all games on purist level with silent assasin status.  So I was really looking forward to play this one.   Well, let me tell you......So far I am really disappointed.\n\nIn the short period I played, this is what I noticed:\n\nTechnical stuff:\n-  Playing on DX12 mode causes freezes.  Playing on DX11 works fine.\n- I could not start the game without controller.   Keyboard/mouse did not work properly.  In menu it only showed the controller buttons, not keyboard buttons , i.e.:  "press A to continue' instead of 'press enter to continue'. After plugging in a controller the problem was instantly solved. Also keyboard/mouse work fine now.\n- In Tutorial graphics seemed static: people barely moving, not changing position, fabrics not moving (example:the flag on the ship and the curtains around the scene)\n\nAbout AI:\n- AI sucks to a level it almost made me cry.\n-  No need to sneak, i can just walk behind the enemy in a room that was clearly not meant for people to be in : running arround, bumping the target even, still did not get me noted by the 2 other people int he room  They only noted me when i stood right in front of them.\n- After being caught, i could still kill the target and slowly wander off.  Took the guards ages to respond.....even if caught red handed. I could have killed everyone in the meantime, had a drink at the bar, have swim and slowly leave the scene.\n- To make matters worse, while being shot at, i fled into a dressing room with only 1 exit. Guards did not even come after me, but aimed at me through the wall from outside the room. When eventually a guard did come in to check, he did not even check the only closet there!  Indeed, the one I was hiding in.  They knew i was there. There was no way out....the other guards still stood outside aiming at me through the wall.  Guard inside mentionned I was gone.\n- At another moment I killed a guy while he was alone in a bathroom. No witnesses at all; no one close by. Yet the guards instantly knew they had to look for a bald guy dressed at as waiter...WTF!\n- Suddenly I saw on the map  that guards moved to my location.  They said they found the body, but I was still alone on the bathroom with that body with the door closed. No way they could have seen it. Anyway.... I went out of the window and hid outside on the ledge. Guess what... the guards knew exactly where I was (through the walls) and started shooting me (also through the wall).  So I quickly moved aside, passing a window of the next door room, before the guards arrived there. And suprisingly... still they knew exactly where to look.\n\nI can't believe this is the Hitman from the series I love.   I wondered if i was playing on super easy mode or something, but did not find an option to change the level. Only option was to turn of pointers.\n\n\nOf course there are also positives to mention:\n- Textures look awesome\n-Atmosphere is great\n- Voice overs are great\n- The world is screaming to be explored and conversations begged to be listened to.\n-  Really great audio\n- It's Hitman\n\n\nFix the AI quick please! Because you can not tell me this is meant to be!\n\nAt this point I really can not recommend the game for diehard Hitman lovers.  I I hope they patch soon and put some intelligence in those NPC.  Since I did not get it through Steam  I can't get a refund.  Else I probably would untill this is fixed.\n\nA disappointed Hitman fan.","March 11","false","10.8"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","18","32","5","1"

Why they chose to release the game in episodes is the main problem.  Calling it an early beta would have been more forgiving.\n\nI loved playing all of the Hitman games.  Playstyles from person to person differ, some may choose to kill each and every persone they come across, some may choose to role play thouroughly and disguise themselves to get around different obstacles.  This still holds true to the game, but releasing the game with just one "episode" is just not enough.  The game was released early March, episode one.  Promised to release separate episodes in consecutive calendar months.  We did not receive the 2nd episode until almost May, which still holds the company true to it's word.  But one can only play a single episode so many times before getting irritated at not being able to progress.\n\nThe game as a whole (so far) is awesome.  However, I do not recommend purchasing this game until it is complete.  Yes, it states that the game is released in episodes, but it feels like it's in beta with all of the bugs.  As a matter of fact, an update was released late Apr, that completely broke DX12.  I am able to play in DX11, but why should I have to downgrade what my computer is built to run at on a new game?\n\nThis release was an unfortunate mistake and I definitely won't be purchasing any more "early release episode" games in the future.","May 8","false","21.1"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","18","32","0","0"

Seriously I was Very skeptic week before its release (maybe that way its better?) but to my surprise I turned out to be one of the best Hitman experiences I ever had. Simply put -I can't stop playing it.\n\nYes there are problems like:\n\nAllways online DRM and poor optimization (which hopefully will be patched soon).\nLack of blood with some animations, some sound glitches - those are all can be fixed with upcoming updates aswel.\n\nTake in mind that IOI is listening to us. Remember how we all wanted, now famous, "Baby-face 47" to be gone? IOI completely changed his face model to look exactly like in CGI trailer and I dare to say that now its the best looking 47's face model we ever had.\n\nSeriously, nitpicking aside, from gameplay and level design perspective - this is all that I could have ever wished from a Hitman game, considering what Blood Money worshiper I am.\n\nShowstopper is:\n\nMASSIVE and by that I mean that pretty much every space / room it in has its purpose in the level - its not just an empty space for the sake of beeing "space".\n\nInsanely detailed and rich with content. I mean I play it on PC with all settings maxed out to Ultra and boy oh boy it looks SHARP! Visually its stunning, I cant find better word for it to describe. It literally took me about 3-4 hrs on my first playtrough to figure out how to eliminate my targets. I was simply lost in the immense amount of on-going things/events around me. And I still am.\n\nThe world feels like it's trully alive. If you take your time and dont rush it, you can hear so many interesting stories and even Easter Eggs told by NPCs - and thank God those are not cheesy Absolution 'jokes'. Really love all the living feel of the level.\n\nIt offers Ridiculous replay value for a price tag of 13 Euros (in a good way ofc) - according to my Steam account I have already spent over 12 hrs in-game and I didn't even felt it. That's how good it is for me. I haven't even done more 40% of whats possible in this first Episode, nor even started doing my 'perfectionist' speedruns yet. I don't want to rush myself just yet because I feel like it would be a mistake hah!\n\nSo far, with best things yet to come (Elusive targets and rewards) - I would rate this first episode with a VERY SOLID 8+/10. Once server problems will be taken care off and optimisation patches released - Im sure I could easily rate it 9/10 or even 10/10\n\nGreat ♥♥♥♥ing work IO-Interactive!

Even with the episodic format being a big negative and the DRM (which I haven't had any issues with on a terrible internet connection), the game is a striking testament to what made the Hitman games great in terms of sandbox and planning. Just wish they had the newspaper article at the end of every mission. There's a very nice system I've been fond of, which is the custom contract mode. Basically what you've done in other games where you're a stealth archer making a backstory for a random NPC to kill, you can now do this and get rewarded in Hitman and share this with others. It's a nice touch and adds a whole other playstyle to the game.\n\nThe game started off a little buggy, causing system crashes when saving, etc but I found out my drivers were extremely out of date on my R9 280X 2GB, but after updating to the recent driver all visual & system bugs went away in both DX11 & DX12 and played 6 hours in one session without any crashes or noticable issues.\n\nI'd like to note that the episode format is done in an interesting way which allows the dev team to put a bunch of time into each map release and appears to be priced decently. This is a very slippery slope but if done correctly without getting screwy with greed could produce high quality maps over time extending the lifetime and support of the game over years.\n\nOne more thing, that check point BS from Absolution is now gone and you can manually save at any time as well as timed saves.","April 30","true","38.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even with the episodic format being a big negative and the DRM (which I haven't had any issues with on a terrible internet connection), the game is a striking testament to what made the Hitman games great in terms of sandbox and planning. Just wish they had the newspaper article at the end of every mission. There's a very nice system I've been fond of, which is the custom contract mode. Basically what you've done in other games where you're a stealth archer making a backstory for a random NPC to kill, you can now do this and get rewarded in Hitman and share this with others. It's a nice touch and adds a whole other playstyle to the game.\n\nThe game started off a little buggy, causing system crashes when saving, etc but I found out my drivers were extremely out of date on my R9 280X 2GB, but after updating to the recent driver all visual & system bugs went away in both DX11 & DX12 and played 6 hours in one session without any crashes or noticable issues.\n\nI'd like to note that the episode format is done in an interesting way which allows the dev team to put a bunch of time into each map release and appears to be priced decently. This is a very slippery slope but if done correctly without getting screwy with greed could produce high quality maps over time extending the lifetime and support of the game over years.\n\nOne more thing, that check point BS from Absolution is now gone and you can manually save at any time as well as timed saves.","April 30","true","38.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But modernization is not always a good thing.

They (thank God) didn't make the Absolution storytelling mistake, the levels are bigger and a lot more open than ever. No linear puzzles, just the good old objective to kill someone. The maps are huge and open, with streets, open buildings, big areas, many people in it, many ways to find a way to target or to get what you need, hear or find things on the way to be prepared. Just watch Sapienza and Marrakesh.\nThis game offers a lot of hours to play without doing the same thing again. Like challenges, they're great. There's a lot of it, and that's mean you can complete the same mission over and over and it's still new in many ways. Like in previous games you just finish the levels on one of the limited Silent Assassin ways and that's really it. But this time the game has a replay value like never before. And one of my favorites that you don't have to be Silent Assassasin. With some challenges you kill others, sacrafice others but that's what our Hitman does for complete the contract. In the Final test we had to shoot the guy with an assault rifle? I didn't even use them ever in the series before and now I have the reason to do that.\nThe idea of the opportunities is awesome, listening to conversations just to reveal secrets or finding a letter with information, I love it. The unlockable starting locations, the unlockable starting disquises are so great, really good idea. The ICA can smuggle you in as a staff member? Hell yeah they can. This makes every restart a new experience for me. They can hide a choosen weapon or tool for you, too. They're the freaking ICA.\nBlood Money never had the subdue, in Absolution you can't knock somebody out with a blunt weapon without killing them, and I just love throwing hammers to people's head.\nMy favorite gametype is the Escalation mode. It different from the main story, new targets and no save feature, and they don't make it easy for you. But you have to face challenges and even silent the the witnesses.\nIt's a great game, keep it up guys!","May 31","true","77.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The maps are significantly larger than Absolution, and other previous games. Definitely makes the game entertaining to play many times, since you can take a different approach everytime. Some approaches can become very challenging, which is also nice.\n\nMy only complaint would be the graphics, which are average yet manage to put your computer under tremendous amounts of load. I can only get about 40 FPS on a high setting, even though I can run other more demanding games on higher settings at a constant 60. There are also occasional glitches (in lighting effects), but I haven't experienced anything game-breaking e.g. light going under walls.\n\nLast but not least, I want to address the "episodic" release of the game. Many people were complaining about it, although Square Enix announced this decision MONTHS before the game's initial release. Plus, it barely even affects gameplay and pleasure since the maps are so expansive.

The Gameplay\nThe player mechanics have been greatly imrpoved and even though, at times, it might feel slugish, the game provides a very easy way to maneuver around and do what you want to do. On behalf of the game-world, it provides an insane amount of detail with opportunities at every step to change a route and try something new.\nBecause of its episodic nature (which I will talk of later), every map has numerous Challenges and various 'tricks' that you must complete to unlock all assets available to 47; these make sure the player is still engaged for the duration of the whole month, before the next episode releases.\nAnd if that weren't enough a multitude of Contracts and side missions provided by both the community and the developers are available for you to really refine your skills in the art of killing NPCs.\n\n2. The Story\nAs the missions progress, each episode reveals more of the story. In it's current state it is very ambiguous for me to really review it. I will come back to refine this review.\n\n3. The Graphics\nThe game looks astonishing. The level of detail and the precision of that detail are both unbelievable. Now. granted, you will need quite the horsepower to run this, I am running it on a GTX 760 with a Quad i5 and it runs smoothly on High graphics. Hitman has never looked so good.\n\n4. The Hitman Experience\nOverall this game provides what it says it provides: a Hitman game. Granted it came out in this 'episodic nature' but I don't mind. It's not DLC, you can buy it all for full price. The fact that it comes out each month feels appropriate to me since it can keep you engaged for longer.\nThe game requires quite the skill and finesse and proves a challenge for experienced Hitman players. It is not really a gateway for new people to enter the franchise.\n\n5. Updated Review\nREDACTED: I have come back to this review after having Mastered both Paris and Sapienza and as of 3 minutes ago, also killing the second Elusive target. I can say whole heartedly that this game is worth your money and it is a full game that is merely provided in episodes (like a TV show). Some bugs are still existant and persist to annoy me by crashing my game, but given the manual save option it is not that aggravating.\nI will be sure to come back again once more of the game is revealed.\n\nIn summary I will list some conclusive key features:\ncore Hitman game elements\nhuge maps, immersive environments\nsmartly designed NPCs\na vast amount of content\nserial killer training experience\nI definately recommend this game to any fan of the series (except Absolution -  if you only played that, this might be a completely different thing).","May 22","true","43.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The map is bigger, more complex, more details, with lots of sniping vantage points... if IOI keep escalating the map size every time they release new episode, we could end up getting a one full city map by the time we reach Episode 6.\n\nThe game engine is still broken here and there.

First of all, the pre-load was a complete waste of time. I pre-loaded HITMAN™ the day before it was released and it downloaded the tutorial map and not the main map, Paris. So I had to download the game even after my pre-load. Bit stupid of Square Enix to do something like that.\n\nThe game has some major bugs. Upon my first attempt at trying to play the prologue mission, all I saw was bright glooming lights everywhere with no texture detail at all. I had to mess around with graphical settings and my computer settings for about half an hour to resolve this issue. There are random stutters during gameplay and graphical glitches, too. Not just that, sometimes it will say a body has been found even when you haven't killed, drugged or pacified anyone, just out of the blue.\n\nThe worst flaw is that this game is only available online, even worse is that I've disconnected twice, even though my internet is fine and my Steam is online. This completely breaks immersion. The same happened with Just Cause 3 and I just don't understand this online-only concept. It really makes no sense to me.\n\nAt its current state I have to say I can't recommend it, definitely not. I paid for the full experience, which was £39.99 for me. At the moment, there isn't much content and even worse there are far too many issues that need to be resolved.\n\nWhen the game does work, it is fantastic. Even the tutorial maps were quite satisying. Paris is fantastic, though. Albeit the bugs and the online issue, this is all we hoped for, it is quite literally just an upgraded Hitman: Blood Money with better graphics, updated mechanics and hopefully some storyline too.\n\nI will update my review as soon as the issues of HITMAN™ are fixed or at least partially fixed. At the moment, it's a no from me.","March 11","false","44.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I'll probably change this to a yes when more than one level is available to play.\n\nGame server had a hiccup last night and booted me from my single player game straight to the main menu.  No save file created, so I lost a good bit of progress.  Tried to subdue the target on the training mission and pulled him through a wall and down a set of stairs so everyone in the area could watch me strangle him.  Went about as well you'd think.  When I can subdue someone without pulling them through the wall completely there is still a chance the body will get stuck in a nearby wall.  This will do nothing good for your silent assasin ratings or your new disguise.  Why does this company need at least a month to build one level at a time for the next several months?  Oh, and buying the starter pack instead of the whole package will cost you more money if you decide to upgrade to the full 6 level experience later.  Also, I wasn't able to save my progress at all in the Contracts mode.  If the game servers tank while I playing one of these I have to start from the very begining?  Think I'll wait till they're more stable, thanks.\n\nWhen the game isn't marred by the progress destroying online requirements, the walls aren't eating bodies (or you!), and  the AI doesn't randomly notice you being an assassin from a closed room away, this is a great Hitman series game.  But sweet baby jesus, does this game need a local fracking save created when the online crap goes down.  Or just, you know, not boot you out of a single player game because your leaderboard garbage is having a bad day.","March 12","false","4.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I have been a fan of the hitman series since playing hitman2, but haven't played all titles in between. The game is still a little bit bugged and I somehow it does not let me select medium or high graphic settings, but I have only very seldomly encountered performance drops.\nThe first (non-introduction) level is very, very huge and the characters feel organic. The episode formate benefits the game, because it does make you really explore the levels and find all those little details hidden in the game and there are dozens of opportunities to kill your targets (I haven't found all in the first mission yet altough I played for 20h.)\nFor trying out new ways to kill your targets you will be rewarded with new weapons among other things. Unfortunately, besides the sniper rifle you receive quite early, non of the new weapons you receive are useful for the mission. What do I need 3 kinds of silenced pistols for? It's only really useful if you are planning to run amok... Also, although you are able to equip a poisoned syringe from the start, you can't use it to actually poison food/drinks... So how is that useful?\nStill, very enjoyable game, especially when throwing heavy stuff on people :D\nRecommend and looking forward to the second episode.\n(Although, the full experience pack is quite expensive...)","April 25","true","44.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game itself is very well done and there are many replayable options (this is both good and bad). I just wish games these days would stop replacing storyline and gameplay time with replayable maps. Although it is fun to replay a map now and then, it should not be the main attraction! If you just played through this game one level at a time without going back to try it another way, then you would finish it in about an hour, tops.\n\nIf you are going to buy this game, you might as well buy the "Full Experience"; otherwise you are wasting your money. The fact that there is even an option to buy this game in sections, is just stupid! Why release an unfinished game? Why not label this as "Early Access"? It would have made MORE sense to either just wait until all of the content was finished or just NOT release it at all (if they didn't want an early access that is).\n\nI absolutely hate that we have to buy this game in segments! I wish, If I could, I would rate the publishers with a 4/10 (with this game alone) Why? Because, cash cow, that's why. I get that they want to make more money, but to nickel and dime us like this; I will run out of money to buy games. So, if you DO NOT buy the full version from the start, then you are left with paying more than you should. At least the first episode was only ten bucks. Let's just hope they stay cheap! Although, I would rather it be that they did not release games in segments, to begin with.\n\nI wish we could review the publishers instead of just reviewing the game. There are so many negative reviews out there that are not entirely against the game itself but the reviews are geared toward the publishers direction or decision for the game. It is so frustrating that we have to buy games these days in parts!

I was a little skeptical of the episodic release of the game so I started off but just purchasing the intro pack. I am now going to purchase the full game upgrade because I have enjoyed it so much.\n\nI actually think the episode structure works for this game. It gives you some incentive to master the level. To play the game as intended and find every single option available. If I had the other levels right now I would probably just move on afer I had finished the first assassination.\n\nThe gameplay itself is really well done. The improvements made to stealth are great and give you a much clearer view of when you're in trouble. The amount of options is pretty immense and after first feeling overwhelmed you gradually learn the level with each playthrough giving you more insight into how to perfect your assassinations.\n\nAs of writing this review I have 16hrs on record and I feel I have alot more to discover. I haven't even touched contracts mode and some of the challenges seem impossible right now. I know though the more I play the more I will discover. In my opinion people complaining this is "Just one level" really need to look at how much fun gameplay is in this one level and judge it by that and the fact there is five more levels like this on the way. There is easily going to be over 100hrs of gameplay overall.\n\n\nI am now looking forward to the next episodes.","March 16","true","39.9"," 43 of 81 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","43","81","0","0"

This is the 6th game in the Hitman franchise, and every month a new episode will be released with a different setting and target. This review contains the content of the first episode: "Paris". The game is also always online, but it can also be played offline even though some features are blocked.\n\nSTORYThe story will be rated when the game is fully released, there isn't enough content to even know what's going on.\n\nGRAPHICSPowered by Glacier (the same engine of Absolution), the game does look pretty damn good, with great attention to details in the levels and with improved animations (I especially love shooting and reloading a pistol). However, at launch this game is packed with performance issues, plus some graphical options are greyed out based on your hardware. With everything either off or on Low, I managed to get 30+ FPS inside and 24+ FPS in outside and crowded areas.\n\nGAMEPLAYYou despise the levels of Absolution, but you liked the improved controls? You loved the level of detail in Blood Money and Contracts? Then this game is just for you: gone are the Point Shooting, the dumb linear levels and the unrealistic "lower-hat-to-hide-your-identity" system.\nThis Hitman is closer to a 007 game: the Paris level has you infiltrate a fashion show where a secret evil auction is taking place. Around the map you can eavesdrop some conversations that will activate Opportunities, which help you achieve the slickest and most badass assassinations. For example, you can disguise as a Sheik to go to a private meeting where you can garrote your target, or dress as staff of the palace to poison your target and drown him in the toiler when he is vomiting, and so on.\nYou can also preplan which weapons to bring in your mission, which suit to wear, and even in which area of the map to start in (in the attic, undercover in the kitchen, in the garden...). Plus, you also get XP whenever you complete certain assassinations, feats or discoveries, increasing your Mastery of the level, and as a reward you unlock more preplanning options.\nIf you are tired of killing the same targets, there are also Elusive Targets (currently unavailable) and Escalation Mode. In Escalation, there are five increasing levels of difficulties, where you have more objectives to complete to finish the level.\n\nCHALLENGEWhile there is no difficulty mode, your regenarating health drains very quickly, which means that you will die pretty easily, so stealth is always the best option. The AI works also very well: there are some people called Threats that will be suspicious of your disguise if you go near them, patrolling guards will take guns that are lying around the map, and if you are found trespassing you will be taken out of the area. However, it still isn't 100% realistic, and after a while it became really easy to screw with them.\n\nSOUNDJesper Kyd didn't score the game, but the soundtrack isn't bad but neither memorable. And the sound design and voice acting are top notch as always.\n\nREPLAYABILITYTrying to master the level will keep you engaged for many hours, and Escalation Mode will be updated every week. This will last for at least 15 hours in its current state, similarly to "Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes".\n\nOverall, I am really glad to say that this is a great return to form for Hitman games: a big sandbox to play in, multiple ways to kill your targets, many disguises, and good customization.

It almost forces you to actually be a HITMAN and learn the most efficient paths to each location and that's how it should be. Open world aspects and the community contracts make this game feel so lively. It runs great... when not using DX12. DX12 creates mouse lag, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gfx and horrible rendering. When running with a 980 Ti it claims that I'm getting 80fps yet it feels like I'm getting 15. Aside from that DX11 runs amazingly and actually is driving me enought to want to beat the missions as a Silent Assassin and drives me to platinum the game. Maybe it's DX12 that people can't run. DX12 is new afterall and after reading about it, it almost seems like you need SLI to get your use out of it. I'm also running this at 1440p for a side note, it's alot more power hungry than 1080p and yet it still runs great.\nI don't know what the disconnection issue feels like that everyone's getting pissy over either.","May 3","true","19.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed this title albeit not a complete game, but I invested in it knowing it would be episodic.\nI've already purchased the full game because I enjoy the franchise and I want more. If this is the standard the future chapters provide, I've no doubt my money was well spent. A Hitman game is an experience not many games provide. The opening training area with its multi-tiered ways of assassination can compete with full priced games. There are many people complaining on the periodic system of releasing a new Hitman game, but as the locations are so huge, and there are infinite count of possibilities, you have a month to play locations (beside that developers feed you with new mission) before starting a next one.

Not one of these two thins are a real problem, as far as I can see. The whole problem around always online feature is absolutely unnecessary and pointless. Without any intention of spending my time on explaining why it doesn't matter, I have to admit that being always online is never going to be a dealbreaker for me. It's pointless since we're online anyways. The only drawback that I can see is that Squeenix and IO have decided to store our saves online, rather than doing so on our precious SSDs. In case of a disaster, disconnecting from the servers means that all unsaved process is lost. Bad, but not *that* bad.\n\nAnother thing, as I've mentioned previously, that many people see as troublesom is the fact that Squeenix and IO are releasing HITMAN as an episodic game. This isn't something new, just think of all TellTale games that have come out. Also, I'd like to remind you of all the DLCs that many modern shooter get (Battlefield and Call of Duty). This isn't something new and never before seen. It's something we've gotten used to and, frankly saying - HITMAN is just the right game for this sort of thing. With episodic content, HITMAN is able to deliver its content in its full glory. Instead of rushing through campaign (which has around 7 or eight maps) and complaining how short the game is - players will play it for months on end. We'll get to enjoy elusive contracts, contracts our friends and other players have made, special content and all sorts of things that devs can come up. Not to mention that maps themselves offer countless challenges and achievements. I can understand that some people might feel a bit underwhelmed and bored by replaying same map over and over again but... Hitman has always been about exactly that - find your target and utilize countless ways of disposing of them. Play, succeed and repeat.\nAs far as gameplay goes, HITMAN is rather good, even if it still isn't on-par with its predecessors (not Absolution! everything trumps Absolution). The biggest problem in the game is that it often feels rushed. There's no real opportunity to let player see things and plan his own way. Rather, we're forced to rush to certain events while AI mindlessly follows the same routine, over and over again. It can get irrititating sometimes, but given how gameplay options allow us to tweak the game - it can also be much more fun! I'd say that, when gameplay of any Hitman game is questioned, it is all up to the player and how they play. Some might argue that Hitman games are all about being slow, metodical and surgically precise (me me me!) while others might like to speed up things and "just do it". I'd say that the latter shouldn't really even be bothering with Hitman.\n\nAll things said and done, Paris is a solid outing into the world of Hitman. It's really big. Much bigger than anything we've seen in Absolution. If my memory serves me right, I've seen bigger maps in Hitman II: Silent Assassin, but I can't say that for sure. The important thing is that there's a lot of room for improvement that's needed. HITMAN must be polished and advanced if IO and Squeenix want to keep gamers interested for another six months.\n\n\nNon-English version:\n\nPrije svega mislim da je potrebno da se" skinu dvije stvari sa dnevnog reda" - "uvijek online" i epizodni karakter igre. Niti jedna od dvije spomenute stvari meni ne predstavlja problem. Cijela hajka koja se digla oko "uvijek online" zahtjeva od strane Squeenixa i IO Interactive je apsolutno bespotrebna i predstavlja tipično i besmisleno kukanje. Nemam namjeru da trošim riječi (dalje) i da objašnjavam zašto to nije loše no, barem kada se ja pitam, zahtjev da gamer bude uvijek online nije i nikada neće biti "dealbreaker". Istina, ima tu jedna velika mana - autosave funkcija je vezana za Squeenixove servere - no i to se da zaobići redovnim snimanjem igre.\n\nDruga stvar za koju se veže najveća kontraverza kada je Hitman u pitanju je epizodno izdavanje igre. Iako ovakva praksa nije nešto novo u gamingu, jeste ipak nešto novija kada su u pitanju shooteri (treba izignorisati činjenicu da smo ovo vidjeli prije kod raznih Battlefield i Call of Duty naslova). Zasigurno da ovakva metoda ima kako mane tako i prednosti. Jedna od najvećih prednosti je činjenica da je Hitman jednostavno jeftin! Na mjesečnoj bazi, nakon tzv. "uvodnog paket", igra košta svega osam eura! Mogućnost da se /legalno/ nabavi 3A naslov po toj cijeni je apsolutno smiješna. Naravno, nedostatci se ogledaju najviše u samom igraču. Postoje oni koji će igru prije svega gledati kroz single-player kampanju i čiji će cilj biti da istu pređu u što kraćem roku. Takvim igračima će i cijela igra sa svega sedam (ili osam, nisam siguran) mapa biti prekratka. Tu su, također, i oni drugi koji će gledati da progiraju što više mogu. Upravo je takvim igračima Hitman i namjenjen. Uz dosta dodatnog sadržaja koji obuhvata razne izazove, achievemente te niz "ugovora", čak i jedna mapa iz Hitmana može da potraje barem desetak sati igre i to bi trebalo biti i više no dovoljno za cijenu koja se plaća. Mislim da na kraju vrijedi spomenuti kako mojoj malenkosti epizodno izdavanje igara, barem kada je Hitman u pitanju, itekako ima smisla i ne gledam na to kao na neki veliki minus. Znam da neće svi dijeliti isto mišljenje ali barem treba pokušati sagledati stvari iz drugog ugla pa tek onda pljuvati i kukati.\n\nKada je u pitanju gameplay, Hitman je poprilično dobar iako i dalje odudara od starijih naslova (poredim sa drugim dijelom u serijalu koji je i dan-danas jedna od najboljih igara koje sam ikada odigrao). Najveći problem cijele igre je što se često ima osjećaj kao da je igra zbrzana jer više ne postoji ideja planiranja i skautiranja prije "napada". Umjesto toga, posebno kada se uključe sve stavke u opcijama, igra postaje poprilično lagana. Čak i sa isključenim instinktom te smanjenim informacijama za izazove i objektive, igra je i dalje poprilično lagana i odudara od starijih naslova. U želji da stvore dinamičan i brz gameplay, Squeenix je odbacio ideju planiranja (tu u igru ulaze tzv. izazovi) te polaganog nastupa. Pariz, koji slovi kao jedna od većih mapa (mada to i nije, realno govoreći bilo je mnogo većih mapa u Silent Assassinu) je moguće završiti za nekoliko minuta. Opet, naravno, ovo sve zavisi od pristupa. No onaj ko je volio Hitmana zbog same ideje da je igru potrebno igrati prije svega pametno i strpljivo sada i neće baš biti oduševljen no neće biti ni potpuno razočaran.\n\nNo, sve ovo na stranu, Pariz ipak ima i svojih prednosti. Mapa je zaista velika, mnogo veća nego ono što smo gledali u Absolutionu. A ukoliko igrač isključi par opcija u gameplay sekciji, igra može biti interesantnija. I dalje postoji mogućnost izbora a opcije koje igra nudi igraču su ogromne (negdje sam pročitao da se glavni likovi u Parizu mogu ubiti na više od pedeset! načina).\n\nNa kraju vrijedi spomenuti performanse igre. Obzirom da se radi o prvom DX12 naslovu koji sam imao prilike igrat, nisam nešto pretjerano sretan. DX12 ne funkcioniše kako treba i sama igra ima problema koje Squeenix još uvijek nije uspio riješiti. DX11 radi poprilično dobro, sve dok ne pretjerujete sa stavkama. Treba držati na umu da je jednostavni broj NPC-eva koji se pojavljuju u igri ogroman i da to zahtjeva ogromne resurse. Šesnaest giga rama, i5-2500k, r9 270 dc oc, mogu igru pokretati (na 1080p rezoluciji) na srednjim postavkama.\n\nTL;DR: Šta je tu je, nekima će se svidjeti a nekima neće.","May 9","true","17.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

So, here's mine.\n\nFirstly, I'm gonna review this game based on 'this' Hitman game only as it is my second Hitman game (first was Hitman: Absolution). So I don't know anything about the previous Hitman games or how they played out. This game is just fantastic, I've put in a few hours in a day into this game and throughout my experience during this time is just phenomenal. The maps are amazingly large (the maps feel alive, filled with AI interactions and no sign of dullness) and I can see IO Interactive put in twice the effort into this game compared to Hitman: Absolution.\n\nBesides that, I've seen no performance issue on my computer right now (currently running a 'Custom' graphics settings (mixture of 'High' and 'Medium'), 1080p on a GTX 750Ti). Everything runs smooth and I've seen no texture glitch, weird ragdolls or anything related to bugs and glitches. Its well optimized, in my opinion.\n\nFurthermore, the Online-DRM, here it goes. Throughout my experience with this game,  there are no server crashes. Everything runs fine.\n\nLast but not least, I think the episodic feature is pretty cool for a Hitman game in my opinion as I don't have much time to play my video games (school) and I'm not looking forward to rush to the completion of my games either so I'm cool with this episodic feature. Plus, there are many challenges you can complete in a mission (Ways to take out your targets, Silent Assassin, Suit Only, etc. ) which we, the players can take full advantage of the large map scale and obtain the full experience of a mission.\n\nLastly, this game is very well-made and I'm looking forward to the next episodes.\n\n"Phenomenal" - 10/10\n- Brandon","March 18","true","62.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Neither. Don't get fooled by the good-old "HITMAN" sign. It is a whole lot of a different game. Old IOI is now Reto-Moto. New IOI team consists of new professionals. This is how Absolution should be. GIGANTIC open levels, ASTONISHING, MARVELOUS level of detail of everything (exterior and interior), HI-End design, every part of the levels feels alive and breathing. A believable representation of what life of rich and powerful is like. Sadly without razor-sharp/stereotypical satire the good-old-IOI-Hitman had and without soul-crushing tracks from Jesper Kyd. The game now has real AAA+ game feel, unlike demo scene/underground-art vibe of before-reboot-Hitman. And here come the flaws. Poor performance on non-hi-end systems (and bugs related to. SSD is strongly advised), big bunch of oversimplifying gameplay features (casualization), shallow soundtrack, poor and illogical rating system, linear approach to special assassinations.. All of these things take away the little bits of immersion.\n\nOnly one issue is left standing in the middle - the episodic release policy. On the one hand very affordable prices starting from 5 USD for intro pack (don't get started with paid demos. Free demos are done for, we have youtube now), 19 USD for a full experience. This system encouraging one to play on and wait for the next episode (Episodes are coming every month, and you don't have to pay for them) thus extending the game's lifespan. On the other.. some players want it all in one take.\n\nThe sum is: this is a total reboot, a new game with no connection with an old franchise.

Neither. Don't get fooled by the good-old "HITMAN" sign. It is a whole lot of a different game. Old IOI is now Reto-Moto. New IOI team consists of new professionals. This is how Absolution should be. GIGANTIC open levels, ASTONISHING, MARVELOUS level of detail of everything (exterior and interior), HI-End design, every part of the levels feels alive and breathing. A believable representation of what life of rich and powerful is like. Sadly without razor-sharp/stereotypical satire the good-old-IOI-Hitman had and without soul-crushing tracks from Jesper Kyd. The game now has real AAA+ game feel, unlike demo scene/underground-art vibe of before-reboot-Hitman. And here come the flaws. Poor performance on non-hi-end systems (and bugs related to. SSD is strongly advised), big bunch of oversimplifying gameplay features (casualization), shallow soundtrack, poor and illogical rating system, linear approach to special assassinations.. All of these things take away the little bits of immersion.\n\nOnly one issue is left standing in the middle - the episodic release policy. On the one hand very affordable prices starting from 5 USD for intro pack (don't get started with paid demos. Free demos are done for, we have youtube now), 19 USD for a full experience. This system encouraging one to play on and wait for the next episode (Episodes are coming every month, and you don't have to pay for them) thus extending the game's lifespan. On the other.. some players want it all in one take.\n\nThe sum is: this is a total reboot, a new game with no connection with an old franchise. The game with reasonable demands for processing power of player's PC. The honest episodic approach, and some casual gameplay-elements. The eye candy level-design and an average soundtrack. Interesting, fun objectives and challenges and linear approach for completion.","May 31","true","20.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Where do i start.\n\nI purchased the intro pack of this game basically so that i could get access to the initial beta to see if the gamewould be any good.   I had my reservations after IO had only supplied the first 3 small tutorial missions as a whole Beta experience "but whatever right?".\n\nNow that the full game has been released i have to say that unfortunately, my reservations have been realized.  Ok yes I've only purchased the Intro Pack (whichs gives you access to all current content on release day), but where is the game?  I am a massive fan of the Agent 47 franchise, and ave previously purchased all of the game on both console and PC platforms (Don't judge me too harshly for the consoles, I was young!)  this game has a tutorial comprised of 3 missions and one main mission in Paris.\n\nSo it seems that IO believe that a game is worth even the intro level price of £10.99 for one mission and 2 targets.  Id have happily paid the £39.99 if i hadn;t read it would only allow acces to up to 4 main missions.  whats happened to the game like silent assassin where we had 10+ missions and an armoury.. or contracts where we had much the same for the same price level.\n\nUnfortunetly for me this game seems like yet another one of the embarrassing cashcows that studios are releasing today.  this is going to hurt the franchise more than help it out.\n\nOn a positive not,  in my experience the game does run well, its not too clunky and the levels seem fairly well thought out.  but i have yet to experience more than one mission, so who know how much potential the game actually has.\n\nI am sorry IO, but for me this is a fail more so because you seem to be screwing your fanbase than for the actual game.  it just wasn't what I personally expected a studio of this size to bring to the table at all.","March 11","false","2.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

I would expect it's going to take 150+ hours for the complete story so I think it's well worth the money.

They didn't patch bugs in time, although they've done a lot of bug fixing work since the game was released. And there are still quite a few of them out there especially the challenge unlocking system. They sort of got around the bug but it's just not fixed, which is the most annoying thing. The elusive target is delayed for two months and we don't know whether they are going to stick to the original plans of one episode per month.","May 14","true","80.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

After the second, I'm beginnnig to think these episodes are going to be excellent. Despite people disagreeing over the episodic nature of the release, I think it's helpful.  I'm able to play the map multiple times, do most of the challenges, and, if the map is large and done well like the last one, will provide hours of fun.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's always online is annoying, but the developers aren't going to change that.  Great game that took a risk and it looks like it's paying off. Keeping my fingers crossed for the rest of the episodes.\n\nOne of the benefits of the developers releasing this game in chapters and as a DLC is that you can see the reviews for each episode.  In other words, if there were a few episodes that weren't good or as good, you could buy them.  The reviews for the individual episodes are much more reflective of the game than the "full experience" version (e.g. full experience is still "mixed" but the reviews for each episode are "mostly or very positive") If you're unsure about the game, I'd take a look at those reviews as well.","April 29","true","5.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I've played every single Hitman game, with Hitman: Blood Money being one of my absolute favorites of the genre. The level of sandboxing in that game was beyond anything previously seen. This, in turn, left me rather unhappy to see Hitman Absolution which was extremely linear and not at all a true Hitman game.\n\nHitman (2016?) continues the trend of Blood Money. There are tons of different ways around every single obstacle. It's beautifully sandboxy, and the mapping has so far been excellent.\nPeople seem to complain about there only being two real maps released at this point (with only one of them being a non-training map). I find this curious, considering that I've spent close to 20 hours on that single map so far without getting tired of it. I completed Absolution in less.\n\nI don't know how much people expect to get out of the €12.99 that you currently need to pay for the currently available material - but if you're anything like me, you'll know that 20 hours of gameplay (and counting) is way more than you should expect. I sprung for the full experience, and can't wait for new maps to become available. I'm having an absolute blast!\n\nAs for graphics/performance, I have not had any issues. The graphics (much in fact due to me not being able to run the game at High Texture settings) are still perfectly fine, and I have not had any issues with lag. Your mileage may vary of course - know that the game does require ample amounts of RAM to run well, and close to 6GB of VRAM to allow higher texture settings.","March 17","true","26.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

First, if you don't like the game in its episodic form, why not wait for all episodes to be released before buying. I find it remarkable that people hit the pay button, knowing full well that the levels will only be released in episodes, and then complain about getting into the very thing they knew they were getting into. The online-only system is a hindrance for those with connectivity issues, but that can hardly be an indictment against the game's conscious efforts to return to its roots, with some additional shebang (larger levels, variety of starting options etc.). In fact, almost none of the negative reviews give ANY credit to the developers for these, arguably, more critical facets of the game. if you're someone whos serious about the hitman series and its core characteristics, you wouldn't really pay heed to the rabble's rather mundane complaints. i've played hitman from the very first title, and this is by far shaping up to be the best yet.","April 30","true","6.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

But everytime you do it you get something new, like hiding a sniper or begin the game as the cook or the bodyguard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JackVibe/recommended/236870/","JackVibe","JackVibe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JackVibe/","37 products in account","DRM featureAlthough the game is notorious with its DRM feature, I've only been disconnected during gameplay three times during my 78 hours of playtime, and the game also pauses its gameplay for you to reconnect to the servers if you were disconnected. I have a stable internet connection and it was never a problem for me.\n\nGameplayHITMAN focuses on replaying each episode/level. Besides the smaller two tutorial levels, Paris (Episode 1) and Sapienza (Episode 2) were both massive levels with more than 25 ways to assassinate two targets. The gameplay promotes exploration and puzzle-solving on the player's part. I call it puzzle-solving because you learn to put pieces together (i.e. after acquiring this particular disguise from this particular NPC or from this particular location, and then going to a particular location on the map with this particular item to assassinate your target). You have the choice to follow instructions from "Opportunities" to complete your objectives or disable these instructions for a completely guide-less gameplay. The mini-map and the Instinct mode can also be disabled if you prefer a challenge.\n\nAs you complete challenges for each level, you unlock new starting locations, weapons, and gear for you equip yourself. This contributes to the replayability and gives you various methods of exploring the level and completing the objectives. If you enjoy a focus of stealth approach (social stealth or cover-based stealth) to exploration and puzzle-solving, I personally feel you cannot go wrong with this game.\n\nAtmosphereThe art style of HITMAN is clean and invokes the feeling of the spy thriller genre. The level design is gorgeous, realistic, and true to their respective locations (although important dialogue are usually spoken in American accents, which personally does not bother me that much). Dialogue between NPCs are interesting, and feels like a living world. HITMAN's classic composer Jesper Kyd may be gone, but the music is still amazing and fitting to the setting. It doesn't distract you from the action, but also changes dynamically according to your action. If you look past gameplay and technical issues, the game looks beautiful (even on the lowest graphical setting), and sound wonderful.\n\nContent ReleaseEach episode/level is set to release monthly. I personally feel the game was released in an "unfinished" state, although post-release updates have fixed certain bugs and improved quality-of-life feature. IO Interactive is listening to the community. The high replayability of each episode does help pass time between release dates.\n\nAdditionally, the "Contract" mode provides a way for the community members to create content for each other. If you like making challenges, you can create contracts for other players, and if you want new targets to assassinate, you can look through contracts set by other players. IO Interactive also releases a more complicated version of these contracts in the "Escalation" mode. Each Escalation begins with a simple assassination that increases difficulty (e.g. additional targets, time restrictons, etc.) as you go on. Note that both Contracts and Escalation modes use existing levels as settings, so if you are not a fan of replaying the same map with a different assassination target, this may not compensate for the wait between each episode's release date.\n\nConclusionHITMAN is a beautiful game with high replayability, albeit with occasional technical issues. If you prefer Assassin's Creed without all the non-Assassin stuff, this is the game for you. If you are unsure about the episodic release, you can always buy the episodes separately.\n\nI rate this game 8.5/10. For now.","May 2","true","107.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

Quickly addressing the technical bugs of the game: I can't say I've ever run into any DRM issues so I can't comment on that , and yes, the game could use some better optimisation but at the end of the day playing on ultra graphics doesn't really imporve my gaming experience over playing on high or medium. Now the game itself has some VERY fun gameplay, each level so far has been humongous, with so many different ways to kill your target it almost feels like you are writting the narrative, not being guided through a set path (unless you choose to leave on the hints, which is your choice). As a result of this the game has some excellent replay value, and has given me hours of entertainment after only 2 episodes - it's not about just killing the target, it's about doing it in style, and discovering all the unique and cool avenues the game offers you. In part I feel this makes up for the episodic release format, and while I would have prefered for the developers to wait and release the game as a whole I feel it would be unfair to not recommend the top notch gameplay (despite only being partially released) available right now.","March 16","true","49.2"," 31 of 58 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","31","58","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkwarjo/recommended/236870/","darkwarjo","Warjo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkwarjo/","105 products in account","Ok, my first try at a longer review so please be gentle :)\n\nFirst of all i'd like to clear some things about the game:\n\n1. No it's not Online Only, but yes, the Offline stuff is basically just story/training. So we better hope servers keep up.\n2. It's Episodic, wich means there is not much to play storywise right now.\n3. It's basically a sandbox. If you like to murder people in every way possible, this is where to do it.\n\nOk, now that those are out of the way, lets see what it's all about.\n\nThe story seems interesting enough, altought it's pretty quickly played through the first steps, it did leave me wanting to know more. I play this with kb and mouse, but the game also seems to recognise controllers too, as it did notice mine right away. The game play was solid, nothing really new there either, but it worked out like it's supposed to do. I'm a bit bad at rating graphics, but for me it really looked nice. Some random npc:s in crowded spaces lack detail, but it's barely noticeable if you don't stare them too much, it's impolite anyways!\n\nThe bad (the stuff that most negative reviewers scream about) is the basically always online stuff. If you wanna have a rank from the main storyline missions, or if you wanna play contracts, or any other live stuff, you have to be online. If you are in the middle of a contract and the servers go down, it's mission over, start again after they get back online. I bet that will get people riled up every time a server goes down, it will force you to start over, or you can wait to get the connection back, waiting for servers is not something a pc gamers patience is capable of.\nThe second bad thing is the shortness of the first part of the game. It's not actually short for a episodic game, but it feels short for those who are not used to it. There's also an annoying DX12 bug (at least for me and few others) that seems to crash the first prologue mission if the dx12 is on, so i recommend using DX11 at least on the first mission, other than that the game seems to be working nicely for me at least.\n\nThe Good (that most reviewers seems to completely under rate!) is that this game really is more old school Hitman than the Absolution. You have to sneak, try to find opportunities and ways to move around without being noticed. It's done well. Some may disagree with the way game handles "random events" as they are made so that they seem random, but in reality they trigger when player is near. There are real randomities too, but few of those key thing do wait for player to be around. I think it's a good way for this type of game, but i do realise it pisses some people off too. The game still has a good replayability value as you can do almost everything in so many different ways and after that you can just do your own contracts and see others fail miserably in them!\n\nI dont want to rate this game because it's just the first episode, but i can sum stuff up here to try and help you to make your decision:\n\nIF you like to play a story driven game and just play story: Wait till the episodes are done.\n\nIF you like your game to have a variety of maps and different layouts for you to roam in: Wait till the episodes are done.\n\nIF on the other hand, you just can't wait and love the Hitman series: buy now and learn every freakin' detail of the paris and prologue maps you can.\n\nIF you like doing challenges and create challenges for others to do, that has something to do about killing people: Just buy already.\n\nIF you hate online stuff and you have a 56k modem, stay away!\n\nIF you feel like you have to throw a screw driver trough someones eye, throw a hammer at a security guard, throw a battle axe at random bystander (yes, there are battle axe and swords!) or maybe feel the need to crush someone under a weighty chandelier/lightrig/speaker, or just have the basic need of dressing as an oil sheik. Buy.\n\nAnd if you decide to buy the game, i think you should buy the complete set, unless you really can't afford it. It will give you the episodes to come and it's fairly cheap still. And i bet buying the complete set of episodes separately will be more expensive. But ultimately, it's totally up to you.\n\nIF you managed to read my bad english all the way here, I thank you.  I hope you like the review and if you buy the game, i do hope you don't dissapoint :)\n\nFinal Verdict: Recommend WITH RESERVATIONS! Not really for every one, at least not yet. But for me, who has been enjoying all the old Hitmans, this really is a game i think i wil be returning frequently.","March 12","true","24.0"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

I've devoured each and every Hitman game since then, played each of them a multitude of times and returned frequently over the course of years if only to return to a few handpicked favourite levels of mine. Like the the Hotel in Contracts or the casino in Blood Money and while we're on the topic; Blood Money's by far my favourite game of the series.\n\nThe level design, non-linear approach and responsive, intricate mechanics, having a base of operations, the newspaper reports that served as summaries of your past work, all of that made Blood Money an excellent game. A couple of years later, blending out the forgetable Absolution, which had more likeliness to a weaker iteration of the Splinter Cell franchise, I thought we'd finally get a worthy sucessor to Blood Money.\n\nAlas, I was in for a surprise. The new game's again subpar to older Hitman games, in almost every aspect. I mean, thankfully I can't pull a sniperrifle out of my pocket anymore (Absolution anyone?), but other than that we've basically went one step forth and two steps back.\n\nNaturally the graphics are better, however the animations are not. Aiming down the sights of your gun looks weird and it's even worse once you crouch and the professional holds the pistol like a ♥♥♥♥ing scrub. It just looks completely unappealing and I simply cannot comprehend how they ended up with worse animations than in Hitman's predecessors. Instead of holding larger rifles in his off-hand, they're now awkwardly slung over 47's shoulder on an invisible string.\n\nGunplay feels unintuitive and unrewarding, granted Hitman never had the greatest, but I remember spending a ♥♥♥♥ton of time just trying to get off the perfect series of shots when confronted with a target and its bodyguards and when in doubt, I finished one by one off after critically wounding them; another feature that's gone amiss. Also, remember how older games allowed you to shoot through doors? Yeah, that's gone too.\n\nThe new game's level design is pretty neat, to be fair, and paired with better core mechanics it'd most likely make for a great Hitman game. But not as it is, not when the game feels much weaker than its predecessors and more like a beta for a potentially promising Hitman game somewhere down the road.\n\nTo summarize;\n\n+ level design is fantastic\n+ graphics are much better\n+ wide variety of options to complete mission objectives\n+ proper disguise feature reinstated (to a certain extent. hell, you could put on a disguise and practically sprint through to your target and shoot it - nobody would blink an eye at you.)\n\n- core animations are partially worse than in its predecessors\n- former, much liked core mechanics missing (being able to wound, store a weapon in a suitcase etc)\n- gunplay is absolutely boring\n- killing melee animations are stale, unrewarding and furthermore very repetitive\n- AI is literally braindead (kill a main target, e.g. the boss of an organisation, everyone's back to business as usual within 5 minutes)\n- additional, former core assassin weapon arsenal has to be earned through a redudant online xp rewarding based component\n\nAll in all I'm very disappointed with the new game and uncertain how IO went from building onto their franchise, to stripping so many things away over the course of the last couple of installments.","May 1","false","10.8"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","11","19","2","0"

I've played around 6/7 hours or so and think I've still got plenty of approaches to try.\n\nOverall, I've enjoyed every minute of it so far. If the upcoming episodes show the same level of variation and depth, it will be the best title in the franchise to date, without a doubt.\n\nRecommended for fans of the previous Hitman titles...

Its absolutely a worthy successor to Blood Money in that regard. It plays like Blood Money, except smoother and have great new additions, like the piano string dragging your kill along.\n\nHOWEVER:\n\n- The game is always online. This is mostly a mild annoyance and at least you can reconnect since a patch.\n- Several annoying bugs. Guards have a tendency to die when you knock them out in a corridor. Guards often spot you when they're not even on the same floor. A guard even died during a cutscene, ruining my perfect score.\n- ELUSIVE TARGETS. What the heck is this? Seems like a good idea at first, but for some reason there is a CERTAIN DATE to actually do the mission. I'd be fine if you only had one shot, thats ok, but a time limit where you have to do the mission? I missed the last elusive target because I had to work for the weekend in a place with no access to the game, so I had no way to do the mission during that time. This meant that I missed the elusive target. Now I see the next elusive target will reappear exactly the next weekend when I am again working. Meaning I will once again miss the target for no fault of my own. This feature alone makes it so I can never, ever recommend this game for anyone unless they somehow reveal that elusive targets will reappear at some point. But until then, stay clear of this mess of bad features.

Not to mention that it's redundant when the piracy protection is already Denuvo.\n\nAnother great dissatisfaction is that I cannot set texture resolution beyond medium, I have maxed out all other settings and the game is running smoothly, to me resolution is more important than anti-aliasing and the like because the difference is much more noticeable when I'm in close range, I think it's fair that the player should be allowed to use the settings one wishes for his own machine, without limitations.\n\nDespite all those reasons, because I see the potential of a great game nonetheless, I'm rating it positive temporarily until further developments, I hope your consumers can talk some sense into the developers so they can make the appropriate changes, that way everyone gets to enjoy the game they now own, and continue buying into your system.\n\nP.S.

It's brilliant and the unlock/feat/assassination system is well-made.\n\nI predict about 15 hours of content for the one level, not including elusive contracts/user-made contracts. Then there's more levels to come in the next few months.\n\nHOWEVER. The server issues are an absolute nightmare. You are a slave to both their servers being online, as well as Steam's (yes, if Steam servers are down, then you can't play online on Hitman either).

For 15 bucks is not too bad. The problem is it's packaged with DRM that boots you out of the singleplayer if you go offline and the game does not perform particularly well. The lighting is also glitched for me, causing it to flicker and scatter in weird ways. Noticeable and annoying, though the game is still playable.\n\nBuy if/when it's patched.\n\nEdit: Well, I need to revisit as I got sucked into the challenges. There are several ways to go about each mission and the challenges are sort of ticking off the boxes for taking different approaches. Paris is the only one that gives you rewards, such as extra drops, starting points, equipment, etc. to tackle the mission with. This gives you a reason to go back and take the mission on from different angles.\n\nIt really depends on the person if you're going to find that interesting.

I've bagged 11 hours so far and while I had a lot of fun I can't lie that a lot of it was just repeating the same steps over and over. That doesn't mean there aren't other ways, but taking the path of least resistance can many times get you where you want to.\n\nYou can get good mileage for $15, and at least you'll see if you even want to give the rest of the game a go. I still think it'd be best to wait 'til all the missions drop since you can go at it in one go and waiting a month for the next locale is kind of a drag, but if you liked spending time figuring out things in the previous games I think you'll enjoy this.","March 13","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's brilliant and the unlock/feat/assassination system is well-made.\n\nI predict about 15 hours of content for the one level, not including elusive contracts/user-made contracts. Then there's more levels to come in the next few months.\n\nHOWEVER. The server issues are an absolute nightmare. You are a slave to both their servers being online, as well as Steam's (yes, if Steam servers are down, then you can't play online on Hitman either). It takes (for me) about 60 seconds to go from menu item to menu item.\n\nProvided you can get around this, the game is brilliant. Once they fix these issues, this game will be greater than even Blood Money.\n\nSpecs and performance:\nIntel i7-4790K @ 4.4GHz\nGTX 970 @ stock\nInstalled to SSD\nWindows 7 (DX11)\nSet to high settings everywhere except for shadows.\n\nFPS: Anywhere between 45~ in NPC-dense areas to 120FPS in the bathroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n> Always-online DRM\n> Servers are down\n> Can still play game\n> No progression, unlocks, equipment, clothing, contracts, leaderboards, feats, opportunities while offline though.","March 11","true","42.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

For 15 bucks is not too bad. The problem is it's packaged with DRM that boots you out of the singleplayer if you go offline and the game does not perform particularly well. The lighting is also glitched for me, causing it to flicker and scatter in weird ways. Noticeable and annoying, though the game is still playable.\n\nBuy if/when it's patched.\n\nEdit: Well, I need to revisit as I got sucked into the challenges. There are several ways to go about each mission and the challenges are sort of ticking off the boxes for taking different approaches. Paris is the only one that gives you rewards, such as extra drops, starting points, equipment, etc. to tackle the mission with. This gives you a reason to go back and take the mission on from different angles.\n\nIt really depends on the person if you're going to find that interesting. Once you get a path down you'll probably use it every time as it's optimal or provides you with a costume to quickly get around.

Graphics are ok, but physics are much better than previous games.\n\nI only have 2 major problems with this game though :\n\n1- It doesn't feel like a TRUE Hitman game. The game holds your hand throughout the entire story, IT EVEN TELLS YOU WERE TO GO TO PICK SOMETHING UP AND IT HAS  MARKERS!! If you don't understand what I mean, imagine a hitman where it would tell you on the map where the poison is, and it actually tells you to go get it, then once you get the poison it shows you where to go to put it in the target's glass,etc. Yes the game really does that, you need to turn off 7+ options to remove this hand holding, which is very annoying . There's no ''purist mode'' like in Absolution\n\n\n2- Too expensive. There are gonna have 7 missions, meaning you'll be paying 70$ , but each Mission won't take you more than 1-2hrs.

Im am so disappointed. This kind of crap has happened on several game released lately.\n\nAs far as the game play, yes i enjoy it, its Hitman. If you are a Hitman fan then you will like it. Its along the lines of Blood Money, not that linear crap they pushed out last time. From what ive seen game play was solid except one issue i found. Open doors are invisible to the AI. Meaning I opened a door, entered  a room and stood behind the door. A guard walked into the hallway that i just came from. I could not see him, the door was between us. But he still saw me and shot me through the door. I never saw him but died anyways.\n\nOther then that the rest of the game play was good. They added more complexity to the AI comments and behaviors. One example i liked was if you "accidentally" walked into an off limits area. In past games you would be automatically considered hostile and the guards would start shooting at you. In this Hitman they act like real people, they will tell you that you are not allowed in that area, they will escort you back outside of the area where you came from, then go about their business. They only get hostile if you refuse to comply.\n\nIve seen alot of review complain about graphics, or settings grayed out, low FPS, etc. I did not experience any of those problems. I could play on high/ultra settings (1920 x 1080), none of the settings where disabled, graphics were smooth, not one complaint. My video card is Nvidia GeForce GTX 780 Ti (12gig).\n\nAlot of people also complain about the constant internet connection. Yes, i also agree that is crap and i had a problem with it. In the middle of playing their server went down, so i got kicked from my level back to the menu. My internet was online it was just the Hitman server that was offline. The game allowed me to switch to offline mode to play. But in offline mode it would not load the game save which was saved in online mode. I just stayed in offline mode, started the mission over from the beginning, and F their online mode.\n\nNow for the really sucky part... If you read the fine print, they say that they are only releasing the game with the Paris content then plan to release more content 6 more times through out the year. The Paris content is literally *ONE* mission on one small map of a house. Yes its a big house, but still one location all the same. Really? I waited two years for this game to come out and paid $60 just to end up with one house and one mission??? I am not counting the two very small tutorial training maps you play first before unlocking the *ONE* mission. If you count those then you have three whole missions for $60. With the release of content 6 more times are those also going to be solo missions? So i have to wait a year just to get one complete game of a whooping 7 missions ?!?!?!?!?!? Oh' boy what a deal, not.\n\nIn a nut shell, yes it's a fun game.\nYes, Hitman fans will enjoy how they went back to their roots of being an open world/map with multiple solutions.\nThank you devs for allowing me to skip cut scenes. I hate it when games force you to watch their entire blah blah.\nHowever i feel that the devs took the lazy approach releasing a game with only *ONE* mission. I feel very cheated compared to the past Hitman games.\n","March 11","false","19.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The eposodic sales methord is intresting. Currently i dont have the funds to pay full price so to play a fair chunk of the game for a small fee is nice. However, im not sure that this will be a benefit in the long run. Comparing this game to somthing like the tell tale games the story is drasticlly missing and feels really disjointed making the satisfaction of finishing a mission not graet enough to make me what to find out what happens next.\nThe gamplay is really good though, simply put its a good hitman game. However there is a magor flaw currently and thats the DRM lock of this game. I started playing online played through a fair chunk of the paris mission made a couple saves and was thurally engoying myself. However, i was sudley signed out due to a server error... So i said fine online gamplay features wernt a consern of mine yet. So I tried to load a game in the offline mode and i had no accsess to any of my saves that i had previously done when i was online...... This is bad as i quite often play games on the go with the use of a gaming laptop when im traveling. This is a magor let down for me and in this case the reason i can not recomend this game right now.

Blood Money is probably one of the most fun games I have played (I still play it very frequently, coming up with different ways to play the missions).  Yes, Absolution took the wind out of my sails, but it happens.  Every series has a rough spot.\n\nSo I pay for the preorder, and the beta seems very familiar.  It's as close to blood money as I could imagine it being, and I got excited.   I played through the trainer levels (which worked superb) and was stoked for launch day.  Launch day comes, my game is preloaded, I press play, and...\n\nNothing.   I check file integrity.  Run as administrator.  Everything I know to do.  The game will only work if I set it to DirectX 12 (which my card does not support).  So, at this point, I'm on day two of owning this game, and I can't play it.  I've searched forums for answers to no avail.\n\nI was alright with how they were spreading out the game.  A map a month.  Gives them time to focus on a particular map and make the game stronger.  If the map was already done, they could focus on the online aspect.  Make it stronger.  Make it better.  Unfortunately, now instead of getting to work on the next level, they need to fix what's already out.  What's already broken.\n\nUbisoft, Square Enix, and any other developer, mark my words.  If you continue to release broken ♥♥♥♥, you are going to ruin the community you have strived so hard to maintain the attention of.  Your core audience.  How difficult is it going to be to release games with no money because no one will buy the latest AAA release because they want to wait a few months because they know it's going to be worthless experience until that point?","March 12","false","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The fact that IO Entertainment takes time to really polish the level desing and compliment the creativity of the player is a really good thing.\n\nPros:\n- excellent level desing\n- youre motivated to be creative with your kills, your opportunitys and your timing\n- my medium spec pc had almost no game crashes or connection issues\n- its back to the roots of being a sandbox puzzle game where your goal is to be creative with 'normal' items\nI CAME IN LIKE A CANNONBALL\n- great UI, but some controls are a bit odd, per example you cant change your weapon/item using mousewheel\n- This game makes you think\n\nCons:\n- too little level for the 50 bucks asked, but after playing sapienza, im really looking forward to the next levels and ideas\n- At time of writing i've played 15 hours and im done with the main missions, and only got escalations (missions where the difficulty hardens) left.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nSInce only 2 episodes fully released im judging upon those two. Paris is a good starting level, though a lot of liniarity, something i personally think of as Meh. Sapienza is a beautiful town to live, play and kill and has ranked as an instant classic among all Hitman levels. The 2 training missions are completely skippable but i dont recommend to do that.\n\nill give hitman a 6,8 out of 10. The lack of levels is the main part of this rating, though i am REALLY curious about whats to come. I personally like the episodic nature because of the love IO games is giving to Hitman\n\nSee this as an Early Access game, it makes the game so so so so so much better :)\n","April 30","true","16.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Very fun.\n\nI haven't had any connection errors with the game - I'm running pretty average internet (TPG) on win 10 and it hasn't disconnected me once yet which is good.\n\nMy only recommendation for the game is giving us the power to choose how we upgrade our character. So as we gain mastery levels, we choose if we want a new weapon, a new starting location, etc as this will give a bit more satisfaction to the player. It's a bit frustrating now for the Paris level, as I am left trying to achieve all of the hardest achievements (killing someone with a speaker, etc) in order to get the final (and most juicy / enjoyable) starting locations and weapons.\n\nOverall, 2 thumbs up (out of 3)\n\nTiax rulz","April 30","true","10.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riktigaraketer/recommended/236870/","riktigaraketer","Gordon Ramsay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riktigaraketer/","185 products in account","At the time of this review, there have been four levels released in total. Two intro levels along with Paris in the intro pack, and Sapienza.\n\nHitman took a quick nosedive after absolution. The game was panned by critics and fans alike, for not being a very good hitman game. It was story focused instead of the pseudo-sandbox like game like Blood Money, which had you try to kill targets in a level in a variety of ways.\n\nThis game, I'll just call it Hitman since it for some reason doesn't have a title (I hate when an established franchise does this, ♥♥♥♥ing stop it) is trying to return to its roots. The main reason most people give this game a miss is the business model, along with the always online. I'm not a fan of the online part, honestly. It doesn't bother me too much, servers seem stable and my internet is the same but I'd like the option to go offline. With denuvo, this game shouldn't worry that much about pirates.\n\nThe part where they release one level each month (Which you can buy separately, though you need to have bought all the previous levels to play the latest one AFAIK) is a source of controversy, but in my opinion if the levels keep the same high standard as Paris and Sapienza, it's justifiable. If you're not hooked, i'd suggest waiting for all levels to come out before making a decision about buying it or not.\n\nNow, for the actual game. The performance, at least on Sapienza, is a bit lackluster. It doesn't look amazing but it does have a lot going on, the framerate hovers on about 50 for me (FYI, my setup is a 980, i7 4790k and 16gb DDR3 RAM) which is definitely playable but could be better. This is on very high settings.\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscent of Absolution, there's the same way to subdue, throw things at people and interact with objects, but it has been very much refined. The shooting is more satisfying, the objects give a nice "Thud" when you hit people with them, and the movement is good, although being in cover can at times be a bit finnicky. Luckily you don't spend that much time in cover, since hitman is all about hiding in open sight using disguises.\n\nThe level design is honestly some of the best I've seen from any game so far, sprawling, big levels with every area having something of interest. NPCs having conversations (sometimes with useful information, others mostly funny), a lot of very small but great details that adds to atmosphere (A guy greets you differently depending on your disguise for instance) and over all it feels so very living. Pretty much everything makes sense, although you know, there are sometimes things that were obviously made for gameplay reasons. Which is fine, it works great.\nLots of paths, lots of interesting ways to kill your target. Opportunities are the easiest ones, I strongly suggest turning them to "Minimal" in options, or you'll find your first playthrough very droll as you are stringed along a series of objective markers. Though there's always very creative ways to get your target which isn't necessarily suggested by the game.\n\nThere's also a story going on, though it's not that pronounced, mostly background dialogue along with a cutscene at the end of each mission.\n\nHitman is shaping up to be amazing so far, and I REALLY hope that the next couple of levels keep the same or higher standard. Because if so, I would go so far as to say that it outshines blood money,","April 30","true","31.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While it hasn't caused any problems to me, there's fair share of people who have had serious connection problems.\nNot to mention the game still has pretty bad optimization and a share of bugs, while they have fixed some of the most glaring problems, they have managed to break other parts.\n\nBased on the recent activity devs do work on the bugs and listen to feedback, which is how it should be and the game has really high potential. If they manage to fix all the problems and improve the Contracts mode to be much more precise tool of creating custom hits on the pre-existing maps, there will be a flood of extra quality content made by players themselves.\n\nBut lets move on to the just launched 2nd episode. Sapienza is hailed by a lot of people as the best or one of the best Hitman maps in the whole series and for a good reason. While it might not be the most difficult hit of all time, the  variance in the areas and massive amount of ways to kill the targets is amazing.

I found it very well done.. only a couple minor bugs which isn't too bad for such a major game. Personally I found the game a bit on the tough side for my gameplay style. I loved how I could blast my way out on earlier hitman games which I had botched a stealth hit.. it was.. satisfying. This game, however, you can pretty much forget that. You need to follow the rules: stealthy.","April 25","true","6.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Blood Money was the 1st one I really got into and only played the 2nd one when I was very young.\n\nBlood Money is one of my favorite games of all time. It got to the point where it became too easy, but none the less fun. Where I could complete all the stages in record times with a Silent Assassin rating without saving, even after not playing for months at a time. I ended up setting up challenges for myself like push or throw EVERYONE over a very particular ledge and such.\n\nAbsolution was fun, but never felt like a true hitman game. It focused all too much on story, the disguises didn't really work and the stages varied a lot in scale. Still played a bunch of it, and early on I did very well on the leaderboards.\n\nHITMAN is like a jolt of nostalgia on crack. The stages are expansive, the objectives are fun and routes and methods are many. The episodic format does not bother me, but I know people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Each mission takes a long time to master and offer a lot of variety in their execution. They also have plenty of Challenges and Unlockables for each.\n\nSomething I wish they did implement is a remnant from Blood Money. I always enjoying having to purchase and upgrade my equipment. You could also carry a lot more items previously, though you have more drop points.\n\nIn short, I am enjoying HITMAN and would recommend it to anyone that liked Blood Money, or just stealth games in general.","April 30","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The fact that IO Entertainment takes time to really polish the level desing and compliment the creativity of the player is a really good thing.\n\nPros:\n- excellent level desing\n- youre motivated to be creative with your kills, your opportunitys and your timing\n- my medium spec pc had almost no game crashes or connection issues\n- its back to the roots of being a sandbox puzzle game where your goal is to be creative with 'normal' items\nI CAME IN LIKE A CANNONBALL\n- great UI, but some controls are a bit odd, per example you cant change your weapon/item using mousewheel\n- This game makes you think\n\nCons:\n- too little level for the 50 bucks asked, but after playing sapienza, im really looking forward to the next levels and ideas\n- At time of writing i've played 15 hours and im done with the main missions, and only got escalations (missions where the difficulty hardens) left.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nSInce only 2 episodes fully released im judging upon those two. Paris is a good starting level, though a lot of liniarity, something i personally think of as Meh. Sapienza is a beautiful town to live, play and kill and has ranked as an instant classic among all Hitman levels. The 2 training missions are completely skippable but i dont recommend to do that.\n\nill give hitman a 6,8 out of 10. The lack of levels is the main part of this rating, though i am REALLY curious about whats to come. I personally like the episodic nature because of the love IO games is giving to Hitman\n\nSee this as an Early Access game, it makes the game so so so so so much better :)\n","April 30","true","16.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Very fun.\n\nI haven't had any connection errors with the game - I'm running pretty average internet (TPG) on win 10 and it hasn't disconnected me once yet which is good.\n\nMy only recommendation for the game is giving us the power to choose how we upgrade our character. So as we gain mastery levels, we choose if we want a new weapon, a new starting location, etc as this will give a bit more satisfaction to the player. It's a bit frustrating now for the Paris level, as I am left trying to achieve all of the hardest achievements (killing someone with a speaker, etc) in order to get the final (and most juicy / enjoyable) starting locations and weapons.\n\nOverall, 2 thumbs up (out of 3)\n\nTiax rulz","April 30","true","10.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Two intro levels along with Paris in the intro pack, and Sapienza.\n\nHitman took a quick nosedive after absolution. The game was panned by critics and fans alike, for not being a very good hitman game. It was story focused instead of the pseudo-sandbox like game like Blood Money, which had you try to kill targets in a level in a variety of ways.\n\nThis game, I'll just call it Hitman since it for some reason doesn't have a title (I hate when an established franchise does this, ♥♥♥♥ing stop it) is trying to return to its roots. The main reason most people give this game a miss is the business model, along with the always online. I'm not a fan of the online part, honestly. It doesn't bother me too much, servers seem stable and my internet is the same but I'd like the option to go offline. With denuvo, this game shouldn't worry that much about pirates.\n\nThe part where they release one level each month (Which you can buy separately, though you need to have bought all the previous levels to play the latest one AFAIK) is a source of controversy, but in my opinion if the levels keep the same high standard as Paris and Sapienza, it's justifiable. If you're not hooked, i'd suggest waiting for all levels to come out before making a decision about buying it or not.\n\nNow, for the actual game. The performance, at least on Sapienza, is a bit lackluster. It doesn't look amazing but it does have a lot going on, the framerate hovers on about 50 for me (FYI, my setup is a 980, i7 4790k and 16gb DDR3 RAM) which is definitely playable but could be better. This is on very high settings.\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscent of Absolution, there's the same way to subdue, throw things at people and interact with objects, but it has been very much refined. The shooting is more satisfying, the objects give a nice "Thud" when you hit people with them, and the movement is good, although being in cover can at times be a bit finnicky. Luckily you don't spend that much time in cover, since hitman is all about hiding in open sight using disguises.\n\nThe level design is honestly some of the best I've seen from any game so far, sprawling, big levels with every area having something of interest. NPCs having conversations (sometimes with useful information, others mostly funny), a lot of very small but great details that adds to atmosphere (A guy greets you differently depending on your disguise for instance) and over all it feels so very living. Pretty much everything makes sense, although you know, there are sometimes things that were obviously made for gameplay reasons. Which is fine, it works great.\nLots of paths, lots of interesting ways to kill your target. Opportunities are the easiest ones, I strongly suggest turning them to "Minimal" in options, or you'll find your first playthrough very droll as you are stringed along a series of objective markers. Though there's always very creative ways to get your target which isn't necessarily suggested by the game.\n\nThere's also a story going on, though it's not that pronounced, mostly background dialogue along with a cutscene at the end of each mission.\n\nHitman is shaping up to be amazing so far, and I REALLY hope that the next couple of levels keep the same or higher standard. Because if so, I would go so far as to say that it outshines blood money,","April 30","true","31.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While it hasn't caused any problems to me, there's fair share of people who have had serious connection problems.\nNot to mention the game still has pretty bad optimization and a share of bugs, while they have fixed some of the most glaring problems, they have managed to break other parts.\n\nBased on the recent activity devs do work on the bugs and listen to feedback, which is how it should be and the game has really high potential. If they manage to fix all the problems and improve the Contracts mode to be much more precise tool of creating custom hits on the pre-existing maps, there will be a flood of extra quality content made by players themselves.\n\nBut lets move on to the just launched 2nd episode. Sapienza is hailed by a lot of people as the best or one of the best Hitman maps in the whole series and for a good reason. While it might not be the most difficult hit of all time, the  variance in the areas and massive amount of ways to kill the targets is amazing.

While the monthly episodes first appeard as an issue for me, I must admit that when episode two released I got way more intrigued by this solution. It feels like you get a "new" game each month.\n\nThe replayability is key here, and you should be able to spend between 5-10 hours on each episode if you want to master them. Unlike Blood Money, full mastery of the levels are rather hard this time, and some of the challanges the game encourages you to do are extremely challenging if you do them without the help of Google.\n\nThe graphics are on point, but they could added more blood ;)\nMy main issue is the sound, in particular the music. In comparison with prevous titles in the series, the soundtrack is poor in this installment of Hitman. While the voice acting is good, some occasionaly poorly post processed spoken lines further damages the sound experience.\n\nGameplay-vise this might be the best Hitman so far. Its both smooth and logical.\n\nIf you enjoyed the Hitman games before Absolution, I can really recommend this game.

This one is especailly is a great imiprovement over previous generations of hitman games. Although HItman may not be perfect, the game developers did a great job in expanding the physical space of each mission, and giving us even more intereactions with our environment. Small improvements of course will be game graphic and fluid movement of our player character, but beyond that, the strategies and the locations are what makes Hitman really fun to play and replay as well.  For the first 2 locations in the game that i have played so far, as soon as i am placed into these missions esepcially for the first time, I become completely and happily lost from the immense freedom and chaos that I felt in these locations. The numerous interactions especially those intended to take down our taraget that we have in our environment are desgned with so much creativity andi imitation of life-like experience in the real world. For example, although there are only certain beverages that the targets will drink, so you can poison them, this hitman games has made it possible to poison almost every drink that we come across. We can pretty much flood any sink as a distraction as well. Although some interactions aren't necessarily useful. The options are always there to make the Hitman world very realistc to our everyday life. The reactions of NPC (Non-playable Characters) aren't perfect, but from my experience, I feel like I am being dropped into a real world as agent 47 and trying to blend in with the people around me as I commit a murder with a vareity of improvised weapon that are invisible to average people. With so much details and complexity in a reflelction of our everyday world, the game guides me through these opportunity that pops up with waypoints, which makes life a little easier in this huge open-world stealth game. This game just takes a lot of planning and patience to get through successfully, but it makes you engage mentally as I try to plan my assasination through and physically as my heart trembled and my eyes glanced quickly from one corner and person to the next one. The also cool thing about this game is that although it is not designed as a shooter game, you still have that option available with a variety of weapons at your disposal as you playthrough the game long enough. The only think that I could think of for improvements are just to improve interactions and environment just a little, but that's not a big deal for me because I say it is good enough already. Other than that, the Hitman team did a great job in their work !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:D","May 5","true","41.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I am not a patient person and I don't like to sneak in games as I am easily frustrated with trying to understand when I am seen and when objectives have been failed because of some esoteric game play rule I wasn't aware of.  This game has some of those things but because it gives the player so much control over how to complete the objectives I oddly don't feel frustrated by it.  In fact I have enjoyed most of my time in game, discovering each scenario and how to navigate inside of the world.\n\nMy inital reaction to finding out it was episodic was confusion, but after having received the first installment I realize the brilliance of this plan.  By only releasing one per month or whatever I find myself exploring more of the map and retrying scenarios.  If these had been released all at once I would have played through it and honestly probably would not have looked back.\n\nMy only complaint is the always online component.

If you aren't into 100% a game or if you just want to experience each level once or twice then you probably won't get your moneys worth right now.\n\nAt first I was very cynical toward the casualisation of this game. It introduced new concepts to the stealth genre that would only serve to further handhold. Specifically the 'Opportunities'.\nInstead of being diligent and eavesdropping on NPCs to see if you can pick up on hints to devise a plan, the game will HIGHLIGHT the conversations and then give you precise directions on how to do your mission based on those, which is a total kick in the teeth. Now, you CAN turn this highlighting off, but in a score-based game its a total pisstake, don't you think?\n\nThat aside, there is a lot to do in a mission zone. Episode 2 gave us Italy and, oh my gosh, this is a HUGE and detailed (if a bit static) level. HUUUUGE. And its all used! You have no reason to go to specific parts of the map, but if you do they're all lived in! Theres a hippie with a sea-shell decorated room. Theres a street performer, theres a cafe, theres an icecream shop, a beach with sunbathers. Heck, theres even a road leading out of town where a car accident just took place.\nTHIS is where the game excels, you have to admit that there is a certain giddiness when a game you play has high attention to detail. In the mission, you will often hear NPCs talk about one of the targets deceased mother, who was old and frail. Lo and behold, if you look around the house, it LOOKS like it once catered to a disabled woman: The stairs has a chair lift, her bathroom had disabled facilities, her bed has a bell, and its all decorated to show her tastes.\nInfact, if you look around town, you'll see that not only can you go into almost every apartment room, but you can even tell who lives there! They will never go to their rooms during their scripted cycles, but you can deduce where they live based on their personalities and how the room matches it!\nFor goodness sake, theres even the room that Agent 47 most likely lived in just before embarking on the mission!!\nMy point being is that IF they were to simply reuse this map, it would be completely fine! Without changing any assets, they could move around NPCs, change the context, and it would make totally justified.\n\nThe joy of the completion-ism of the game is that the game will demand that you assassinate the target in certain ways, and you have to discover how exactly to do that. I do believe that they could afford to be more cryptic, like we know that you can use a cannibis joint because the game tells you. How cool would it be if a player randomly stumbled upon the joint, made a post on the forums about it, and then someone else found a use for it?\n\nI do take issue with the escalation missions. Escalations are when you do a shorter mission, and then you do it again four more times with extra rules. Its an incredibly lame way to increase play time because for about 95% of these they dont change how you play the mission in anyway. I play a mission for 10 minutes killing the target, then hiding the body. And then in the next level it says "Okay, now this time, kill the target, and hide the body". DUDE I JUST DID THAT!!\nWhat they should really do is give you the option to tackle the Level 5 mission from the get go, and if you do it then it auto-completes the previous four.\n","May 6","true","90.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While there is still some bugs left, we can at least be sure they will be fixed due to the episodic model. In addition to that, the content of the full game (season 1) seems to be reaching an enormous amount. Aside from the missions, there are a lot of challenges to complete in every level. Escalations bring actual changes to the level setup and give you new goals to achieve. Elusive targets are nice because they are real hardcore, only one attempt and only a limited time of availability. Something that I expect to get better in the future is the contract creation mode, where the community can create and share contracts. However, there is absolutely no way to filter these, no community rating system, nothing. Once we get this, this will be a great feature.\n\nVerdict: It is good and it will get better and better.","May 26","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Certainly a player doesn't have to repeat a level and discover all different ways of killing targets, or complete more of the many challenges tied to each contract, but that great variety is where the real strength of Hitman lies.  If you enjoy the cerebral and planning aspects of stealth games, and the blind experimentation and discovery of puzzle games, Hitman (series) is possibly the best combination of those two genres, and Hitman (game) is the best that series has been yet.","May 22","true","44.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Bear with me.\n\ntl;dr I'd totally recommend it for newcomers (which is what I'm gearing most of this review for).\n\nI'm a fan of Giant Bomb, and loved to see how much fun Brad and Dan had with this game on some of the UPF's as of late. I'm usually the type of person who jumps feet first into gaming and buys all DLC available. Not sure where I picked that up, but there you have it. So when I saw how much fun they were having, you can only imagine my surprise to see all the negative reviews. I took the time to read through them and there were a few common themes. I decided to pull the trigger (pun entirely intended), but went for the Intro Pack, since I can stand losing $14 on a game I won't play much. So, after my brief run with with, I have to say...it's pretty fun.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how this game was broken up into episodes, and truth be told I approve. I like that I can just buy the intro package to get a feel for the game and, should I sink enough time into to warrant the purchase, buy the next episode, or even buy the rest at once. I understand why, on the surface, that looks bad. It's easy to say "Well, that's because they don't have a full game and are looking to get more money from us!" Some DLC may be like that, sure, but I don't see that being the case here. If they sold each episode as a near full price AAA game, yeah, you've definitely got a case to make. However, here the intro game is the price of some (if not most) indie titles, and the full DLC (at $9 a piece) brings it up to the typical $60 price we're accustomed to. Why I love this method is it allows more freedom in what you want. Even the intro package still has a fair amount of replay-ability (which I'll get in to in a second), so the base package is well worth the price.\n\nGraphically, this game looks great. I have a GeForce 970, 16 gb of RAM, core i5 box and can play this at near the highest settings. The environments look terrific, though I have noticed some broken animations, like a chief using the Force to stir a wooden spoon 15 away from him. Those haven't been too apparent and haven't really detracted from the game, although I do wonder how bad they'll get the further into the game I go.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, but with a few minor quirks. I've been noticed through walls on occasion, and I wish the option to be able to drag a dead or unconscious body appeared right after the animation. Too often I've been in a situation where I have to knock someone out and have only a few seconds to store the body before a passing patrol. I played a lot of Splinter Cell: Conviction, and I had the most fun with the single player missions and finding new ways to kill people and clear levels. Ultimately, that open ended play was my biggest draw to this game. Aside from the elusive contracts, Allowing me to go back and try to kill someone with an explosive toilet seat will definitely trigger something in me to want to keep playing.\n\nI've read the reviews from the hardcore fans of this series, and I see exactly where they're coming from. If you've played every Hitman game in the series, the complaints given here are well within their right to exist. However, if you're like me, you may not need to be interesting in pay for a ton of content you may never see, and just want a game with decent stealth and puzzle mechanics, and the freedom to find new and exciting ways to murder bad guys (and anyone else unlucky enough to wander into wrong bathroom). If that sounds like you, I highly recommend the Intro Pack for starters.","May 31","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Because it would have "all the paris episode" plus prologue...\nThe prologue is just the tutorial with two very simple (<- and I MEAN it) maps and the Paris Episode is just ONE (1, Uno, Um). I played for 3 hours and I finished (done Paris twice).\n\nNow I'm wondering... will the next locations have just one map too? Maybe they are counting the tutorials maps so we can expect 3 maps for locations? So it'll have 5 other locations suming 16 maps plus 2 tutorials... By the complexity of the Paris map I got to say... not enough.\n\nThe game mechanics are good enough, while still worse than blood money (especially because of player triggered scripts), it's a very good improvement over absolution, the game tries to rescue the feeling and the gameplay from the blood money merging it with some mechanics from absolution an example is that when you're in disguise just a few people using the same outfit will recognize you, so you have a lot more exploring freedom, while it's still more realistic than blood money. The inventory system comes directly from blood money, where you can have infinite items on it, but larger weapons are in display at all time, preventing you of passing unnoticed while carrying a shotgun and dressed as the cook.\n\nEven with the content that's being promissed for the year I think it'll be a lackbuster, with this amount of content the game should, at least, have some new bonus gameplay features, maybe a small co-op exclusive campaign or some kind experimental assymetrical versus or just a remake of some fan favorites maps from the previous games.\n\nThis game, as-is,  is way worse than Ground Zeroes, I have around 10 hours played on that game, the map was huge, there was a lot of approach options, like a dozen of side missions and an actual story, a brand new engine, a pretty decent A.I. and I think it was around the same price as the intro pack.\n\nAnyway, the intro pack is kind of cheap... but the lack of content for a game with "enter a world of assassination" as slogan it's simple bizarre, more like "enter a very, very, very little room of assassination", if they used the intro pack to lure in more players, it was a missfire...\n\nI'll update the review as more content become available, but right now, the game can't be recommended to anyone.","March 12","false","6.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I LOVE HITMAN! Just not THIS hitman. However I know I could have, but I don't see that this game is in Beta, or any reason it isn't supposed to be complete.\n\nHere's the problems:\n\n-Not every one likes Tutorials, but I feel I need to experience every bit of the story I can. A Reboot to Hitman?! With Absolution features?! *Heavy Breathing.* Tried playing through the game 10 minutes in on six seperate occasions. Disconnected from THEIR server. Oh no worries, I'll just finish up and connect later to update my save game. Nope! I am Kicked out of the gameplay and returned to their Menu. Thought I was making a mistake, then I saw all the issues online. That made me mad, but I wasn't going to give up on you Hitman!\n\n-I'm not really one to care about graphics, but this is 2016. I was surprised by the download of 7 some gb, but now I know why. I ran a benchmark, Hitman Absolution by far has the better graphics, and that game is older then this?! I would have waited for you Hitman, but 60 bucks for this? Come on! Come on guys! I have a Titan X, there's no reason for the game to look like a Xbox 360 game! So much clipping in it that totally broke the atmosphere of the game too. I don't think even Blood Money had so many issues with everything feeling so flat! Also I love Hitman for its design choices, this feels empty and flat as well. Everything feels so 2Dimensional. The execution buttons, The menus. Doesn't feel like a complete game. Especially a $60 game. Disapointing.\n\n-There are some technical issues, the graphics aren't on point, but what about the game play. A lot of the game play is recycled from other games. Which takes away from a new feeling or a more viceral feeling. The item usage in the game is all I could tell in which they added. I couldn't even make it far enough to use guns though. :-( When I finally got a gun it crashed... Not much I can say on the game play, because I couldn't play it for 10 minutes at a time. For the hour that I tried to make it work though, it felt like the same old Hitman, probably not in a good way though... <.< Sorry Hitman...\n\n-I will follow this game, and hope they finish it, or fix it, or whatever we're calling it these days. However I'm not putting any money down, until they get their shisa together.\n\n","March 12","false","0.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Playing on maxed graphics, the world looks fine within about 50m, nothing special, but not terrible.

If servers are down then thats it, it kicks you off the game and no progress is saved which is very unfortent if your halfway through a assassination. (You DO get the option to play offline but you are limited, and challenges and feats, etc are cut off from you.)\n\nNext is the Episodic content, its different but I think it could only work with only certain games, but if the future content is good as they promise they no complaints.\n\nI would say to avoid Hitman™ for the time being and see if any improvements have been made or changed, but if not either avoid fully or wait till its on sale.\n\nIn total its a no from me for the time being, but don't let my review make up your final judgement.\n\nEDIT 1: More In depth Description and Spelling Errors.","March 12","false","2.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This review is going to take the format of a response to this game's criticisms, because my main motivation in writing this review is to illustrate my own confusion as to why this has mixed reviews.\n\nMy understanding is that people are super upset that this game is episodic and that, therefore, the first episode contains only one 'real' stage and two tutorial stages. I can understand how that would upset people who somehow thought that wasn't what they were getting...but if you're at all familiar with episodic series like Life is Strange or any of the Telltale Games, why are you upset about this? It was never presented as anything other than what it is.\n\nFurther, if game length is the concern, that basically tells us what kind of game you wanted to play. In this latest Hitman, if you are a one-and-done kind of killer, then this first episode will be done in about 2 hours - the approximate length of an episode of Life is Strange, but nobody was upset about that. Unlike Life is Strange, this game could have a great deal of replayability, should you be interested in experimentation.\n\nThe one 'real' stage is a masterpiece of level crafstmanship, with more details and methods of entry, attack and escape than were ever available in any stage of Blood Money. Fans of the series should be floored by the care that went into this one stage and the TONS of voice acting that went into bringing it to life. Instead, it seems like a lot of players just completed the level once and were done. Why? I have put in TWENTY-FIVE HOURS playing this stage, completing challenges. I haven't even really touched Contracts yet, but I plan to start making some.\n\nThe always-online DRM complaint I can understand far more than the length complaint, but that frustration just hasn't happened to affect me very much. Square Enix's servers died twice on me and booted me out, and I was and am STILL pretty salty about how saves can't be converted online to offline...but is that a dealbreaker? I don't see why it would be, unless your internet connection is prone to shorting out. I don't like it by any means, but I can deal with it, because this first episode has me very much impressed.","March 16","true","49.7"," 31 of 59 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","31","59","0","1"

Have every release since codename 47. The problem is I don't have this release. Well I will have in a year when it is finished. WTF?\nIt must be my fault. I miss understood the definition of release that square enix was using. I assumed they meant ..."the action of making a movie, recording, or other product available for general viewing or purchase."... When they actually obviously meant ..."to give up, relinquish, or surrender (a right, claim, etc.)"...\nDO NOT SURRENDER AND AVOID THIS TITLE FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS.\nI know there will be lots of haters out there now telling me that the graphics are great and the concept is the best ever and it promises to be the crowning jewel in the franchise. This all may be true, but at the moment it's just promises.\nAs I write this I am looking at the howls of frustration on the forums and blogs about the DRM and the servers being down on release day, so their first promise of being able to play a snippet of the game on release day(choose your own definition), has already been broken.\nYou see here is the awful truth. If I or anyone else knew that it was a year till they finished the game, I wouldn’t have pre-ordered it this early. I would have been excited and eagerly awaited the release, but I wouldn’t have thrown down my hard earned. I’m sure no one else would have either. I mean it could be worse, at the moment we only have a single mission we can’t play until the servers get fixed. If the game was complete we would have more missions we couldn’t play until the server gets fixed. (What can I say I’m a glass half full kind of guy.)\nSo in conclusion I don’t recommend this, I might change my mind later when I can play it or even when I get it.\n","March 11","false","10.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

I'm not too familiar with the classic Hitman titles, so I cannot compare. I only completed Absolution, and I find this one a better experience, it feels like a puzzle with multiple solutions, and it's fun to try them all. I think it works very well with the episodic release model, because it would leave a player with a single level until a new one is released. Willingly or not, he'll have time to learn the environment and try different approaches. In Absolution I personally was too focused on the story progression, and didn't care for the mechanics of the assasination - and when you rush through a level, you might miss a lot of fun. In this game it's quite different, it feels quite natural to replay the same mission multiple times; you memorise the events and characters, and see them from a different angle each time. Challenges stimulate you to try different approaches, but I wish some of them were not explained, leaving discovery of their meaning to the player (like hidden Steam achievements).\n\nI do not experience any performance issues, I have GTX 960 and an old Phenom II x6 CPU, the game is locked in Low textures, but looks great and gives me an average of 40-50 fps in its benchmark. I switched to Exclusive Fullscreen mode for a smoother experience, and do not notice any lag or stuttering. No bugs either yet, touch wood. Online mode works fine for me, I don't see a problem in being connected while playing. Offline mode worked in beta, I expect it work here as well. So technically I have no complains.\n\nBut of course, as usual, most things related to Russia are wrong, sometimes so ridiculous - it's cute. I mean, people calling each other "comrade", privates telling a KGB general to shove off or saying "howdy" instead of saluting, Soviet vodka having a non-existent brand (and furthermore, a word that was invented about 10 years after), Soviet privates wearing sailors' vests... I think it was intended as a joke, really, it couldn't be so ridiculous on purpose. Or could it?..\n\nPerhaps, the AI could be a bit more realistic in terms of noticing you. I mean, if a person is engaged in a conversation, he is supposed to look at whoever he speaks with - instead he's noticing a crew member on the upper deck with a corner of his eye and raises an alarm. I'm not complaining, but it is just a bit unrealistic. A bodyguard is alert and looking out for dangers around, but it's not natural to find the same eagle-eyed perception in, say, a mechanic (especially if he's busy mending something). People might be short sighted or just absent minded, you know. Several grades of alertness would be an interesting idea.\n\nWell, and if we're really nitpicking - I don't like the protagonist's voice much. The actor is somewhat straining to sound rough and tough, and it sounds cheap, more suited for a teenagers game like Borderlands or Bulletstorm. Agent 47 evidently has high intelligence, he acts with precision and focus - I'd expect him to speak in the same fashion. And his voice should be as unremarkable as his looks - to blend with any disguise. Good thing he doesn't speak much.\n\nBut all in all, I enjoy this game. I recommend it to anyone who likes stealth, puzzles and silenced pistols. Looking forward to the coming episodes.","March 13","true","33.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The gameplay is awsome, you can explore huge maps and discover many things. The opportunity idea is awsome and brings us back to "Hitman: Blood Money" which also was great. The reason this game haven't got 10/10 from me is because the preformance is so-so, and the amount of levels is not high, but generally i honestly think it's worth the buying because of the spectacular gameplay. To sum up:\npros:\n-Awsome original new gameplay.\n-Huge and detailed maps.\n-The elusive target thing is cool.\n-Interesting and fun challenges.\n-Challenging contracts.\n-Many easter eggs and discoveries.\ncons:\n-Not quite good preformance.\n-The episodic element is unnecessary.\n-Only 6 levels.\n\n9/10, Absolutly worth buying.","May 18","true","39.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This entry in the series does seem to be more plot driven than previous entries so far, which I like (though only two episodes have been released at this point so it's still left to be seen how good that aspect turns out to be).  I was hoping that each episode was going to be more than a single mission per episode which has turned out not to be the case.  It looks like the developers are expecting community made content to make up for the lack of official content which is dissapointing.  It didn't take me long to complete the training and first two episodes which is also dissapointing.  I could go through and complete the levels in different ways and unlock other stuff but that gets boring quick for me and is a poor substitute for the lack of quality and quantity.  On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 5.  My final opinion may change one way or the other once all the content has been released.  If you are a fan of the Hitman series than I recommend checking it out but wait for it to go on sale as I feel they didn't really earn their $59.99 on this one.","May 19","true","10.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The semi-open sandbox puzzles of previous hitman titles such as Contracts and Blood Money return with a mixture of certain gameplay elements from Absolution (sans the obnoxious disguise system or level design of Absolution). In fact, the changes to the disguise system in this iteration give it a nice balance between the useless disguises of Absolution and the lack of any challenge that occurred with the disguise system of Blood Money. And, this is further reinforced with the expansive level design of the currently available episodes.\n\nI've gotten nearly 100 hours played in this game with most of that time being spent in Paris and Sapiezna. Both are  incredible levels boasting tons of various ways to go about eliminating your targets and the little touches such as conversations revealing the background story behind your targets and their motivations. Sapienza especially has tons of small conversations and small easter eggs that make the level a lot of fun to replay and explore.\n\nThe game isn't without its problems of course. The always online DRM and the finicky servers for the game can make it incredibly frustrating to play at times when you're kicked out mid-mission after setting up the perfect solution in a level. Fortunately, I haven't had this happen personally that often but the issue is certainly there and you should be wary of it if your internet isn't all that great. And, a lot of the patches end up adding in issues that were never their to begin with (such as the 'subdue kill' bug) which only results in more patches that continue the cycle.\n\nRegardless, these issues haven't outright ruind the game for me as I end just having an absolute blast playing through the current levels and trying out different ideas and routes. If you've got a fairly competent computer, a somewhat solid interenet connection, and are a Hitman/stealth game fan that's in need of a modern Hitman title that has the potential to rival Blood Money or Contracts then I'd say grab the full experience or grab the intro pack and give it a shot.","May 30","true","115.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is very reminiscent of blood money which is great seeing as that is one of the best hitman games in the series and a far cry above Absolution despite its age. The DRM is painful however I couldn't play for more than 20 minutes without the servers discounting and all my progress since my last save being lost and although you can play offline you loose a few features most noticably being able to place higher caliber weapons on scene (for some reason) but that comes with being an early adopter and I hope the servers will be brought up to snuff with time. Nevertheless I feel like this is a great start and is fairly priced for what you get I could spend hours on this one level however the levels themselves do not justify the pricetag but I feel we are also paying for the base mechanics as well and that for a similar or lower price the next installment will have much more content. I feel that this game is going to a good place I would not recomend buying it now if you are new to the franchise but for the long time fans who hated Absolution this is for you and for the rest of you pherhaps wait for the full release and a price drop if your unhappy with the release format.","March 16","true","27.9"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","32","61","0","0"

Put it this way: if you don't like it, at least you didn't burn $60.\n\nAs far as the gameplay itself is concerned, it is very fun.  If you need an example, think of Hitman Blood Money, or the big open levels of Hitman Absolution (also the slow-mo shooting mechanic is gone, bummer).\n\nEveryone says there's online-only DRM, but there's more to it.  The problem is you can't access the challenges, or customize the way you want to go about executing a mission unless you're online.  Want to start off working as a party attendant instead of a guest?  Go online.  Honestly, this is a terrible decision and I hope they get rid of it in the future.

There are heavy restrictions placed on you should you choose to play offline (or if you're forced to play offline in the case of a server outage). This, combined with the lack of offline/online save syncing makes for a pretty miserable experience unless you can guarantee you'll always have a consistent, stable connection to the servers - which is not really feasible considering the servers may go down at any time, or for scheduled maintenance.\n\nIf they would allow online/offline saves to be synced with each other, I would change this to a "recommend if you can tolerate the other offline restrictions". However, I don't see this happening, so I regretfully suggest you pass on this one.\n\nFirst, the good:\nMuch closer to Hitman Blood Money than it is to Hitman Absolution\nThe "Opportunity" system is fairly innovative for those who would like some help figuring out ways to complete a given mission - but it can be disabled if you wish to figure everything out on your own.\nThe bad:\nIf you lose connection to the servers for any reason (including issues on the server side), you get dropped from your mission and lose all progress since your last online save or online autosave.\nOnline saves do not sync with offline saves. I'm not sure who thought this was a good idea, but nobody else does it this way. This means if you're playing online and later want to play offline (perhaps on a flight, or somewhere else you don't have a reliable internet connection), you cannot load your online save. You'll instead be forced to create a brand new, offline-only save that is in no way linked to your online save. Yeah...\nWhen playing offline, you are limited to selecting a single starting location and a single Agency drop location for missions, as opposed to the several you get while playing online.\nNeutral:\nYou're forced to play the tutorial misssion twice. Once as a guided mission where you're forced to complete it a certain way, and again in a freeform style of your choosing.","March 12","false","8.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

A too long shot. I hate to be the naysayer, but this game hits us rather than the ingame targets.\n\nGenerally, the game itself is solid. Various ways to eliminate your target, broad mission environments, exquisite level of detail, high quality cinematics, etc...\n\nIt has some graphical issues with the lighting going haywire at times, and those settings limitations are agitating. At least let me try at max and then lower the settings for better performance, but sadly, no way Jose. And there's also that annoying mandatory to be online at all times. I was in the middle of the Paris mission, and I got disconnected and literally the game kicked me out to the main menu to load again. And speaking of menus, they're very tiring and confusing.\n\nBut this potentially good game lacks the most fundamental aspect of all - and that is content. At first I thought that the episodic releases would be fine with me, but I was wrong. The folks at IO should have released the game when ready, meaning, including all other missions. This "intro pack" is very unsatisfying. IN A NUTSHELL - NOT RECOMMENDED AS OF YET.

It has improved upon its predecessor, Absolution, and in turn took elements from older games, namely Blood Money to please fans and give a greater gameplay experience.\n\nIn turn, you are able to explore your level, choose how you want to kill, how you want to look and how you want to approach your target, or targets. You can choose from a great variety of weapons inside a level, ranging from screwdrivers to lethal syringes, fire axes, various pistols and even rifles and shotguns in some cases.\n\nThe only level in the intro pack is the Showstopper level, which is disappointing, but already nice in its own right. The graphics in this game are stunning, of course, and despite people disliking 47's new appearance, I'm content with it as it doesn't necessarily matter.\n\nDo you remember how he looked like in Hitman: Silent Assassin™? It was an abomination. An inflatable balloon, more like.\n\nYou can as always disguise yourself, and instead of an action bar to choose your weapons from, it returns to the weapon wheel in a Blood Money style fashion.\n\nThe episodic model is overall disappointing if not annoying, but I can safely say that under the circumstances of the company, it's understandable. IO Interactive had lost a lot of money and needed to make some in turn to avoid being closed down or laid off by Square Enix, and the game itself seems very promising as well.\n\nHowever, not every game is perfect. HITMAN™ suffers from various performance problems, even on my machine, lowering my FPS to >30 in crowds, specifically in the Paris level. I hope IO makes an optimization patch in the near future.\n\nThe gameplay can be tedious as well, as sometimes the characters make one cycle onto an area that can be used to kill them, I.E. the showstage in Paris, only to never return or return in perhaps 10-20 minutes.\n\nHowever, I think the game should still be played assuming you can do so. I suggest you have a good machine, as older machines probably lag like sin.","March 11","true","6.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

And the Sanguine show (level in Paris), and damn this level is good...\nYou have all  you want to see in a hitman game (at least from a hitman hardcore fan perspective):\n\nThe map is huge, like huge huge, bigger than bloodmoney or Silent Assassin and it's  very detailed. All the room has his purpose, very well designed.\n\nLot, lot and lot of ways to kill your targets.\n\nThe general mood of the "sanguine show" is tremendously good. it's the classy/rich yet disgusting vibe of the high society we like to see when you are in the 47 suit and your job is killing people.\n\nGame Mechanics are very classical, but effective.\n\nBut, and there is a but :\n\nYou need to be online to play the game, and it's a very big letdown, who wants that kind of thing? if it's a DRM thing, it's not preventing anything, and it bother legal user more than anything.\n\nIA seems kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on specific things...\n\nThe Episodic thing, come on square enix, we know it's your decision since you  editing the game, but come on, this kind of model works on heavily narrated game like Life Is Strange, but it's not the case with hitman, and it really grinds my gear and thousand of other consumers.\n(Some users seems experiencing some performance issues, it's not my case i have a i7 3770K / 16 go ram / and a gtx 970go and it's smooth, sure i can't supersampling and my shadow quality is set on medium, but all the rest is maxed out and i'm at avg 74 fps.)\n\nIn conclusion, i think  we have a very good game and a very good Hitman here. If you like the license or if you are a fan but hesitate to buy the game, you can go peacefully, at least pay the prologue to see how it's good. Sure the game from what we saw has some defaults, but it's still a very good Hitman.\nBut i must warn you, if you don't like all the episodic model just wait till the end of the year.\n\nHope my review is helpfull, have a great game, or not.  ;)","March 17","true","20.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The always online even makes sense as they are releasing the levels episodically which love or hate really encourages replaying of the same levels.\n\nWhy replay the same levels? Because they are massive and there is a TON going on at the same time. There are options everywhere. Unlike absolution which was a constant straight forward path, there is simply a wide array of options in this one.\n\nThe online mode makes sense in the fact that you need to be online to gain unlocks which work with the online part of the game. You can still play the game offline if you wish but you will be missing out on a huge part of the game which is fun, contracts. Soon to be released are elusive contracts that come with rewards, there is a catch though, you cannot lose or abuse these contracts. If you lose then the contract is lost forever. You will be able to do these contracts based on the knowledge you have of the level, every floor and every possibiliy simply by replaying. The maps really allow you to explore to your hearts content, and do things your way and the best part is that they never get old.\n\nI'm super excited for the future of Hitman and I cannot wait for Sapienza (which looks massive mind you) next month.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4eXBDKYwQ\n\nIf you have your doubts then just get the intro pack for 15 bucks, you get everything that is currently in the game at the moment and each episode will then be 10 bucks, it's a great pricing model albeit not very well marketed.","March 19","true","49.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The first episode (Paris) is big and expansive including a wide variety of ways to take out the targets (my favourite is the sniper rifle) and more.

It's pretty much everything you could ever hope for in a Hitman franchise game, albeit the DRM and arguably the fact that it's episodic.\n\nThe Paris level is large, interesting, and provides thousands of ways to replay it. The challenges allow you to try to approach the mission in completely new ways and the sheer diversity of the level is enough to keep my interest throughout multiple playthroughs. The more you get to know the level the better you get at breaking it and finding interesting ways to complete it. In the game FTL you're pretty much replaying the same thing over and over yet it's the diversity of how you can play it that makes the game interesting. So why all the hate for Hitman?\n\nAs for the DRM it's really not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. I don't care for it but I've only been disconnected twice in 24 hours of gameplay and the game autosaves fairly frequently. The new model of gameplay encourages you to save the game at vital points anyway so what's the big deal?\n\nAs for it being episodic I really don't care. I'm a little bit disappointed but it does allow me to focus on playing one level at a time and getting the most out of it. When I get bored I'll just play something else. I am optomistic that it will give more time to the devs to make the game the best it can be. Many developers abandon games after they release them and it's nice to know that we get pretty much weekly content to keep us playing. I definitely can't fault people that feel differently.\n\n","March 19","true","58.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I love the way there is so much variety. I wanna try so hard to find all the awesome ways to do things. This definitely feels like IO-Interactive took all of the feedback of Hitman Absolution and focused on making this game as epic as possible and as open as possible... and YES! It is open. Paris mission alone has a lot of interesting ways to take out targets and try and get all the achievements to open up even more ways to start the mission or have different tools to take with me on the missions.\n\nOf course, one of the big flashy things for PC is DirectX 12 and on AMD GPU? It definitely helps. It's like a free overclock on top of my overclock hah. On the benchmark? I get 7fps average boost versus Dx11 on top of my 1920x1080 on Ultra (no super sampling though) so I went from 75fps to 81fps so I'm super happy. :)\n\nMy full specs are...\nWindows 10 Pro 64-bit\nIntel Core i7 3770K @ 4.40GHz Ivy Bridge 22nm Technology\nCORSAIR Hydro Series H80 (CWCH80) High Performance Liquid CPU Cooler\n16.0GB (4x4GB) Kingston Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 2133MHz (11-12-11-30 @ 1.65V)\nGigabyte Technology Co., Ltd. Z68X-UD7-B3 (Socket 1155 BIOS F11a)\nASUS VE278 27" LCD (1920x1080@60Hz via DisplayPort with RGB full)\nMSI R9 390 Gaming 8G (OC 1120MHz core, 1525MHz mem & +10% power)\nCreative Labs Sound Blaster Recon3D Fatal1ty Professional PCI-E\nVisiontek's Bigfoot Network Killer 2100 PCI-E Network Interface Card\n\nSo after performance I might as well talk about graphics and as you can see from the screenshots? It looks fantastic. The environments are very nicely done! So many voices and conversations, the music is spot-on and very nicely done! The Paris and first training missions beats are stuck in my head haha. I just love how everything has tied together so well on this. :)\n\nAlright... so meow for my opinion on the episodic. Mine is fantastic. I do Love it... why? How many game releases have been flakey in the last two years or so? So many big titles falling flat on their faces on release!!! Unlike Watch_Dogs where $60 just evaporated out of my wallet? With episodic, IO-Interactive is essentially risking people not getting the rest of the episodes if their first episode flops or if they feel it's not the game they wanted... but luckily for them? It's not a flop. It works great.\n\nThe Square Enix always online DRM is a bit of a bummer since they don't let you cross-play offline and online save games... there should just be a warning like "hey if you continue this will be converted to an offline play session & save" or at least let it log it and still carry to the online mode... but maybe that progression system is their form of copy protection to revent people who pirate the game from getting all of the goodies? Just my guess. Tbh I'll be buying the upgrade pack since this went so well so far. :)","March 12","true","12.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

First off, it runs smoothly with the occasional freeze. Once or twice that nearly cost me a mission but usually it was fine. The game looks great. And it feels immersive and really like an assassin game should feel. Plenty of ways to kill your targets and the world in which they operate works without your presence. They keep doing their thing even if you aren't there to eavesdrop or interrupt their schemes. I get a steady framerate (gtx 970) and use high settings. Sometimes when the load is especially heavy the game freezes up and then continues like nothing happened. Never crashing or anything weird like that. It's far from perfect but ok.\n\nI purchased the intro pack. And after trying it out I know I will buy the rest of the game. But this allowed me to try it out and feel around it. I don't know when I'll buy considering the current selection of missions is few. Though the game challenges you to repeat the same missions over and over again in different ways which actually works. It's fun to experiment in this game. And rarely does the game punish unjustly for your attempts at freeform assassination. You can't go in guns blazin but that isn't unfair or wrong. This is the wrong game if that is what you want from your gaming experience.\n\nThe bad stuff\n\nAlways online DRM is really annoying for people with unstable connection or living in more rural parts. I have a great connection and wasn't annoyed. Which mean that during my brief time with the game (will update if needed) their servers worked well. But I understand that people have a problem with this. It's just not justifiable for a single player game with some minor online features.\n\nTriple A games cost a lot. And this game is obviously no exception. So it might annoy people to sell a not finished product at full price. I agree. That's why if you want to try it you should buy the intro pack first. I don't recommend anyone who just want to see if this is any good to buy the full game. But I felt I really got something out of the 13 euros I spent on the intro pack. It was fun. It felt modern and good.\n\nConsidering that the full price is for unreleased content I can't recommend it yet. But I will recommend the intro pack which is what I bought.","March 21","true","6.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Everything is really smooth, quick, perfect, controls are great just everything.\nand graphics are a step in the right direction but nothing thats eye catching (I play on absolute max in 4K on my 980ti).\nIt is worse for th episodic nature, lack of difficulty, and the month by month release.\n\nAgain, ill say it, ive had NO ISSUES WITH THE ONLINE, i can see why others might have but it doesnt take long to connect to the server and there is an offline mode regardless.\n\nFinal verdict is that it is worth it for now, and im sure it will only get better. Buy the intro pack if you want to test it out without commiting, its definitely worth the money.\n\nEDIT: funnily enough, as of loading up the game after the review, i had a little bit of a hiccup getting online. I though i should note this, even if it only set me back a couple of seconds.","March 17","true","29.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Like many others, I consider Blood money to be the best in the series, got some great memories from that game. Personally I kinda enjoyed Absolution, although you had to play it 'right' otherwise it didn't feel like a hitman game at all... too much action and gunplay, plus the AI was kinda hit and miss.\n\nAfter spending my first 6 hours or so with this installment, i feel there's a return to form. This feels much more like hitman games of old, and as much as the negative reviews are because of the way in which this game has been released, it says nothing about the gameplay, which is solid.\n\nCostumes actually work this time around and blending in to the crowd is good fun. There's lots of ways to create distractions and diversions to clear yourself a path so you rarely have to come into contact with suspicious characters. Lots of interesting ways to dispatch of your target. I'm ok with the way it's been released, it'll give me chance to get to know each level as they come out, I intend to spend a lot of time in this game so that's fine by me.\n\nIf it continues like this with future installments, i'll be happy.\n\nGood game/10","March 12","true","19.5"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

The Intro pack gives you three levels, two tutorials and a story mission, Paris. The first two levels are decent sized levels, but Paris is freaking big and dense as hell, it’s like two or three Blood Money levels rolled into one. Just look at my playtime. There are plethora of ways to kill your targets and there’s a lot you can find and learn by exploring and listening in on conversations. Paris has a lot of interconnected subplots that you can completely miss out on.\n\nPeople have been complaining about terrible performance and terrible loading times, but I have had absolutely none of that running on Mid-High settings on Direct X 11 and my computer ain't all that high end. Not going to totally discount them though, so fair warning. Also if you want to unlock challenges right now you need to have a stable internet connection. Also there are bugs, the most egregious being sometimes the game doesn’t want you to drag bodies around. Pretty much any problems this game has can be fixed with patches though and IO are taking fan response into account. I'm definitely looking forward to the next level.","March 18","true","78.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

The large open sandbox style levels of Blood Money combined with the sharp controls of Absolution. There is a lot of nay-say about the fact that this is an episodic game; but any review by a steam user that complains about this, bought the game with full knowledge of the fact and thus should not complain simply on that point alone. The arguement is whether the current offering is substantial for what you paid. If you buy the intro pack alone and hate it, then you are not going to be sold by the future missions because you have experienced what Hitman has to offer in a nutshell. I have played 7 hours thus far and completed the Paris mission in 3 different ways; yet I find myself wanting to perfect it and try every possible combination. Therefore I have every confidence that the the full experience will live to its potential when it completes this year and potentially expands into 2017. I Actually I feel that the episodic nature helps the game. It encourages you to milk every possible outcome and try each mission in multiple ways where arguably if you had the full experience on launch, you'd probably blitz through it in one sitting and not take the time to explore all of the possibilities available (or even play the game a second time). This is the way that gaming is heading unfortunately, but if other titles follow by Hitman's example they will be more refined experiences in the long run. It's a slippery slope and undoubtedly a lot of companies will abuse this model, but this game is not an example of that.","March 16","true","42.3"," 42 of 81 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","42","81","0","1"

The deicision to release this episodically is going to hurt this game a lot! The graphics are nice, and the mechanics are very similiar to Blood Money, albeit not as deep and rewarding. It's basically a dumbed down Bloody Money and focues more on the targets, NPCs reacting to you than the other way around. Everything is scripted, and static until you interact with it. Blood Money destroys it immersion wise.\n\nOverall it's not worth spending full price for the content they have released thus far! If you want to try and see how well it runs on your system, and if you like the gameplay you should consider the intro pack (which is the one I got), at least you won't be burned if you decide that the game is not for you, because waiting for them to release the next missions over the course of the year, would be painful to say the least.\n\nStill there is still enjoyment to be had with the barebones content offered here, just be prepared to get bored of the same locations after a couple of hours.\n\nWARNING: The game has an atrocious always ONLINE DRM implementation, which means if SQUARE-ENIX's servers crap out, you will be kicked out of your game session. This completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and anti-consumer feature needs to go, or I suspect they will lose many sales over this "feature" alone!\n\nOVERALL: Not worth it for the full asking price! Consider the INTRO PACK, and beware of the completely absurd Online DRM thrown on top of the STEAM DRM and perhaps even Denuvo...

I absolutely loved it and I can't wait to see what they do with the rest of the season. I might not fully support the whole splitting the game into chunks ordeal but I can faithfully say that while that might suck, the game does not disappoint me. I wasn't a big fan of Absolution, but I absolutely loved Hitman 2: Silent Assassin through Hitman: Blood Money.\n\nPROS:\n-Gameplay: It's better then Absolution, feels like Blood Money to me. They took some of the best things from Absolution and applied them to this game.\n\n-Graphics: They are absolutely fantastic. (even with some of the framerate issues)  Everyone and everything looks absolutely amazing and the people look like... actual people. My jaw hit the floor on a few occasions at how beautiful everything looked, and seeing April's content trailer made my jaw hit the floor even harder. I cannot wait to see the map for April on my computer screen.\n\n-Audio: The world feels alive and responsive, I felt like I was in a real place during the Paris Fashion Show. I don't think the audio ever broke my immersion at any point during my playthrough of Paris.\n\n-Music: It might not be Jesper Kyd, but it's there and what is there didn't sound like absolute crap to me. I liked it, but I would like Jesper Kyd back.\n\n-Story: While there isn't much here, it intrigues me and I actually can't wait to see where it will go throughout the rest of the Season.\n\nCONS: -Some framerate problems. It will probably be patched eventually but I noticed some issues during my time playing the game.\n\n-Graphics options were greyed out for me, it again, will probably be patched but it's a current issue with the launch state of the game.\n\n-Always online, I understand why it's like this but I don't support it.\n\n-Poorly added in DirectX 12 support, this is my first game that I own that supports DirectX 12, and the way it's added into this game is ♥♥♥♥. I had to switch over to DirectX 11 because 12 kept crashing the tutorial level for me.\n\n-Slightly too easy for my tastes but as I do replays I will probably tinker with the games numerous options to make it harder for myself.\n\n\nDo I recommend you buy this game in it's current state?: No, if you aren't a die-hard Hitman fan.\n\nDo I recommend you to buy this game down the line?: Yes, I'm sure by 2017 when the physical version releases a lot of these bugs will be addressed and fixed.\n\nDid I enjoy my time with this game?: Yes, and I'm not done playing through all of it yet. I still have yet to touch Contracts Mode, Escelation Mode, and Elusive Targets (When we get one)\n\nThis review will remain updated throughout the course of 2016 as my opinions shift and change with the later levels of HITMAN™ and I will of course edit the review when I finally get around to Elusive Targets, Escalation Mode, and Contracts Mode.\n\nWas I given a key for review by the developers?: No, of course not, I bought this game with my own hard-earned cash and so far I'm getting my moneys worth of enjoyment.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my opinion of HITMAN™, if you do not like my opinion I will respect it, but please remember to respect mine.","March 11","true","33.5"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

There's 3 training levels and 1 main level out currently. If you're not a completionist then I can't recommend this for you. Out of the small amount of content that is currently available I've gotten 19 hours of play out of it which is more than most full campaigns I've ran through. The Paris level that is currently available is a fairly large place to explore. I also turned off the hints to get more playtime out of it. I think the graphics look fairly good and they certainly put detail into the setting. There are plenty of ways to kill the targets that you'd expect from a Hitman game.\n\nThe game requires an internet connection to access all of the features and if you lose connection during a session you'll be booted the the main menu. I've only had this happen once. Otherwise the game runs extremely smooth for me.\n\nI already like this installment more than Absolution and if you don't mind waiting on levels to be released throughout the year then I recommend the game.\n\nEdit 1: The Sapienza map got released along with bug fixes. The game runs even better now and the second level is massive to explore. The newest level also brings new items to loadout with. I also like that when you unlock the new items you can use them on the old level.\n\nCPU - i7-4790K\nGPU - GTX980\n32GB RAM\nWindows 10 OS","March 16","true","39.8"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","0"

Would have preferred whole game for $60. Spent $60 on the "complete experience" so I'd have the right to complain about that.\n* Lots of people are reporting technical difficulty. I am mercifully not one of them. Windows 10, GTX 980, latest drivers.\n\nConfusing things:\n* There's supposedly an offline mode. I could not figure out where the hell this offline mode is and how to turn it on. Halp.\n\nGood things:\n* The crowds of Absolution, and very little else from Absolution.\n* Contract mode.\n* Escalations are super fun, I was doubtful at first but well done.\n* Only a few enemies can see through disguises. So far, this encourages creativity rather than stifling it.\n* I have gotten in zero gunfights.\n* Lets you screw up royally the way Blood Money did.\n* Gives you MANUAL SAVES (!!!)\n* Auto-saves are on a timer. Why? Because there's NO CHOKE POINTS (!!!) and the levels are NOT LINEAR (!!!)\n* Instinct is not necessary, and can be disabled, along with the mini map, enemy icons, awareness indicators, opportunities, and tutorial text.\n\nOn the whole, it's a pretty worthy successor to Blood Money. Gameplay-wise, they have clearly learned from their mistakes. The business and technical aspects of things seem to be pretty sloppy, and we shouldn't simply forgive that. Square Enix needs to get their house in order - and I do not mean their studios, I mean SQUARE ENIX - and we need to hold them accountable.\n\nBut, do I recommend HITMAN? Hell yes I do. We live in a day and age of Steam Refunds, if you buy it and it doesn't work or you can't get the online portion to connect, then return it! Otherwise, get ready for Hitman the way it was always supposed to be - not a cover shooter, but a complex, systems-based murder puzzle game.","March 12","true","13.1"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","20","38","2","0"

People also complain that there is only 1 mission, but there is really 3 main missions that can be completed in multiple ways + a lot of contracts and other modes that increase the replayability even more. For an "intro pack" I think there is well enough content in my opinion.\n\nBut on to the actual game. I have been a big fan of the Hitman series since the start and have played every game since then. While I don't feel like this edition of Hitman really brings that much new to the formula it still feels very polished and the gameplay is still as interesting now as it was in the first game. The one thing that have always impressed the most in any Hitman game is the levels, they are often huge and very believable with tons of npc:s roaming around and paths and things you can explore that take many playthrough to discover. The Paris mission here really shines in those areas and is probably one of the best in the series in scope and complexity (The Hotel mission from the first game is still my favorite though)\n\nThe biggest differance to the game this time I would say is the "challanges". Every level has a big roster of challanges to be completed, most often killing your target in very specific and interesting ways. My biggest gripe with the game however is that there is no difficulty slider this time, meaning that there is no limited saves or even penalty for saving. In the old games, if playing on the higher difficulty you where only allowed to save once or twice, or on the higest not at all. This made every moment very tense and the feeling of consequence and that anything could go wrong at any time made the game very immersive. To have an unlimited save system really destroy any tension. You no longer feel anxious while you are drowning your target in the toilet and hoping that no one will open the door, if that happens you just have to hit "reload". Because of this I prefer to play the contracts right now where no saving is allowed, especially the Escalation contracts are very fun where every time you complete the mission another requirement is added to the mission. So for example on the first go you have to kill your target. After this you have to kill your target again, but this time you also need to hack a computer, and so on, the requirements gets added for every time you complete a previous level.\n\nAll in all, I am positive for the full game, and if they just fix the save system for the main mission to make it a bit more hardcore like the contract mode is now, fix the crashing and get rid of the Online Drm, I think this could be one of the best Hitman games yet.","March 16","true","53.3"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","23","44","0","0"

The performance is also really good as far as I can tell, I'm using a Radeon Strix Fury and AMD FX-8350, and I can run Hitman on Max setting 60 fps, 1080p, even in the areas wih hundreds of people.\n\nHitman does also have 'Always online DRM' although the servers are faultless in my experience, so it won't always be Square Enix's fault if you disconnect. I know it would be better for people if Hitman didn't have the DRM, but Square have done all they can to make sure it doesn't interfere with the game.\n\n","March 16","true","19.4"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","23","44","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zuon/recommended/236870/","zuon","Zuon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zuon/","192 products in account","I think this game is getting too much unjust criticism. The devlopers did not lie to you. You knew this was going to be an episodic title, just like the critically acclaimed Life is Strange. You knew there was going to be one main level at launch. They said they were focusing on nonlinearity a la Blood Money, and they did. The performance is very good considering the game's visual fidelity - Grand Theft Auto V performs worse than this on my GTX 970 (I know GTAV's world is larger than Hitman's, but anyone who knows how open worlds are procedurally generated knows this isn't much of an excuse). The always online DRM, while I may not agree with it, does not cause me any problems playing through the game, and I have not had any disconnections. The lack of challenge progression in offline mode doesn't affect me personally, as I think it's fun to play a Hitman game with only the standard equipment, and try your hardest not to use anything but the fibre wire. Other players may disagree, and for those players, it needs fixing, but it does not affect my personal enjoyment of the game.\n\nAll in all, the developers worked hard on this Hitman game, and it shows. It feels just as good, if not better than Blood Money and the developers were honest to us from the get-go. For $15 you get a tutorial level, 2 sandboxy tutorial missions (that you can still complete in different ways), one fully fleshed out campaign level, and several alternate targets you can choose to assassinate in each level. And if you payed $60 and want more content from the get-go... be patient, man. As I said before, everyone knew this was going to be episodic. Life is Strange released episodes 2 to 3 months apart with delays, and no one really criticized it. Additional Hitman levels are scheduled to release monthly, and you WILL get what you payed for, but in the meantime, maybe do something besides play video games? Get a job, spend time with your family, create your OWN project? There's a lot you can do while you wait, and each time a new episode comes out, you can make your playthrough of that new episode your "zen time" for the month. If you just want to bum rush the entire story in 24 hours, WAIT. BE PATIENT. You will get to. That is all.

It's fun!!\n\nThere are a couple semi-annoying bugs, but they are minor.\nIt only happens when you save and restore a lot.\n\nI actually like that they are releasing the levels one at a time.\nIt forces me to reply the levels and learn all the cool stuff to do there.\nEvery time I replay a level, it's completely different.\n\nIf you like Hitman, get this one. It's the best by far :)","May 3","true","48.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I generally enjoyed the game so far, playing every location that is currently available multiple times. The challenges and the contracts mode does add a lot of replay value to the levels if you're into exploring different possibilites to reach your goal.\nAlthough I'm not necessarily a fan of the incremental release of the different locations I'm glad I bought the game and had a lot of fun with it since.","May 10","true","40.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The level design is quite decent and deep, with multiple solutions to any given problem. The performance on my GTX 770 is pretty decent in spite of the hefty system requirements. The levels are full of life and the environments are beatufilly rendered. Sapienza is a particular highlight though I find that Paris is not too far behind. The major caveat for me is the absurd always online DRM. I was already kicked out several times of a game for losing server connectivity, and in a couple of instances, just as I was finishing the level. Needless to say this was sort of infuriating, and more than a little frustrating. This is abosolutely pointless, as I would have thought beuying the game through Steam should be enough for DRM purposes.","May 11","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've now actually come to appreciate it.  Instead of just doing what I would noramlly do, and blow through the campaign, I only have one bit to play at a time.  The two levels available now are both unique and challenging.  I've spent more time on these levels than I have in any other game of a similar sturcture, and I've played Hitman since the original.  This game is super fun, and it's the perfect game to play for a relaxing experience.\nSome small performance issues on my AMD 7950, and graphics drivers stop responding on my nvidia 980m.  So it does need some polish I feel, but it's not bad enough to be unplayable.\nThe game is a worthy addition to the Hitman franchise.  Has the best elements from the newer titles, but when I play the game, I feel like I'm taken back to my playstyle of Hitman 2, or contracts.  Feels good.\nDon't let the mixed reviews convince you to pass this one up.  If you are a fan of any Hitman game ever, buy this game.","May 10","true","52.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the sandbox hitman we were all waiting for around Absolution's release.\n\nThe timed release model sucks, but I don't conflate that with gameplay. The gameplay in this title is absolutely solid. If you want to experience the entire story at once, wait for the game to be fully 'released' by the end of the year. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure most older Hitman fans will appreciate the new methods of madness in this world of assassination.","May 10","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pulling out a gun and shooting someone in broad daylight almost never ends well, simply because you can't survive more than a few gunshots in a row. That feels more realistic to me than being able to mow down countless civilians without consequence.\n\nI also like that some objectives cannot be achieved without ingenuity or nonviolent methods. For example, in order to destroy the virus in Sapienza, you have to reach the lab (which is heavily guarded and has many keycard-locked access points) and find a way to destroy it without getting immediately spotted by the numerous guards (whether that be with a kill switch, manually, via stalactite, from a distance with a gun, or with a penetrating sniper rifle [though that can't be used until Sapienza has been mastered]). To reach the auction in Paris (almost certainly a necessity in order to kill Dalia Margolis), you have to find one of four specific and rare disguises, a secret invitation, or a hidden access route. I like the way the game makes you plan out your actions and try to learn people's habits. The always online component is annoying and sometimes buggy, and my computer isn't fully equipped to run the game at a good framerate, but I still think it's pretty great.","May 11","true","204.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
