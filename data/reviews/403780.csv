"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatothernerd/recommended/403780/","thatothernerd","Sir Lagalot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatothernerd/","26 products in account","A vast improvement over the first Color Symphony, this game has addicting and challenging platforming and interesting and unique mechanics. The only downside that is worth mentioning is that on some occasions you can clip through the walls and floors which lead to unwarranted deaths, although this is very infrequent. Overall, I'm very pleased with my experience so far and believe it is worth the 10$ that it is listed at.","November 18, 2015","true","8.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Solid gameplay and framerate, excellent controls and responsiveness. Highly recommended.","March 13","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
