I am so damn overwhelmed by the cool spawn and spaceships docked there. I have no idea of what to do, so I request help from a fellow player. One thing leads to another, and I am now in this guy's faction. its just the guy, his friend, and me. He surprisingly has about six ships, 2 for mining, one with a jump drive, a few fighters, and some other huge ship with unknown purpose,also a space station orbiting a terraformed planet. Guy teaches me the basics, and then logs off. You can not blame me for wanting to try out the stuff. First I try building my own ship, a core, a power supply and a thruster, and I realize the ship is simple and fast. I land on the planet. I forget to press shift. ship flies off even with me getting out of it. I'm stranded in the planet. SHEEEEIIIIT. I start mining blocks, and build a pilar trying to reach the space station. I am successful, and get back on.\n3rd Hour:\nI now am familiar with the basic controls of the game (I took a while to get used to the controls of this one). I am curious, so I decide to take the warpship for a spin. The jumpdrive jumps about 8 sectors per jump. I start charging and jumping all over the universe,the setting is relaxed, I'm listening to some slow trance,and I am actually having a lot of fun exploring. Suddenly I see another station. "I should dock there" I thought. As I arrive near the foreign station my systems begin to fail, and I start getting blasted. I mean BLASTED by lazers and projectiles of all sorts. The ship is dead. THE SHIP IS ♥♥♥♥ING DEAD!!! THE GUY IS GONNA KILL ME!!!!!! How would I look him in the eyes, the one person who helped me out, who took me under his wing, I was ashamed. I managed to find my way back to my faction's station, and about half hour later the faction leader who took me in logged on. oshitoshitoshitoshitosheeit. First thing he asks me: "hey man, have you seen the jumpship, you know the one that looks kind of like a satellite?" "Y-yes I s-s-aw s-someone stealing it". He looked at me, then he kicked me out of the faction, and blew me back to spawn.\n\n\n10/10 would steal a jumpship and lie about it again\n","December 26, 2014","true","127.3"," 984 of 1,037 people (95%) found this review helpful 571 people found this review funny","95","984","1","571","22"

I came across this game. This is one of the coolest games I have ever played. Some people say this is a Space Engineers clone...it is not. And I am sure (Idk who or why) someone has called this a Minecraft clone...GOD no. (It's in space, come on now.) I will break this up into different sections, with a TL;DR at the end, as well as a section for those who read the whole thing! Thank you.\n\nONE MORE THING: The demo unlocks the whole game for free. The developer said it will stay that way until it goes out of early access, and that buying it is mainly just to support development.\n\nWhy it is awesome:\n\n1. Customization. You can build any kind of ship you want. A ship for transporting things, a ship for mining, a fighter, a massive battle ship, a mining ship with salvage beams (Those are beams that mine for you. SO you shoot at something, it being an ore, rock, or even parts of another ship or station) or any combination of all. (This is not all, of course)\n\n2. Fighting. The fighting is incredible and fun, and fast paced action. It is like a Star Wars battle. You can have your fleet of 20 ships versus another player's fleet of 20 ships or against Space Pirates, or in single player, you versus a bunch of pirates (Idk yet if you can have computer controlled fighting allies in singleplayer) The complex weapons systems are for a whole other part of the review.\n\n3. The complex weapons systems. There is the basic cannons, lasers, and missiles, and they are fun and damaging. You can make the cannons and any other weapon touch each other to make 1 very damaging weapon, or you can space them out to have many of that weapon firing at once. Here is where it gets complex. You can combine weapons. *SPOILER HERE* So you can combine the cannon and the missile to make a shotgun like weapon on your ship. *SPOILER END* Cool right? And there are over 80 combinations (so I have read). So lots of fun to be had with weapons. (And don't be afraid to stack them up a ton. If you have the weapons available, and the power available, make some crazy weapons systems.)\n\n4. NPCs. This is where Space Engineers is lacking so far, but will have them in the future. There are, like I said, Space Pirates. They have killed me many times. But if you have the power and the numbers, fight them back and steal from them and you shall be granted rich reward...so I assume. There are also NPCs at some shops.\n\n5. Shops. You can go to a shop and buy anything in the game. You need a lot of money for many things, but you can get a lot of money fairly easy with the right knowledge of what is really valuable, like ores and glass. (More fun with shops later in the review)\n\n6 Space Stations. You can do a lot of the same stuff with stations that you can do with ships. I am not sure what it has weapons wise, but I am sure there are good things with that. I know there are turrets. Automated turrets and controllable I think. Very customizable. To make a space station though, you need 1,000,000 credits. Which tbh, isn't that bad. I saw one guy get like 2 million credits from selling a bunch of salvaged (collected) glass. And with a faction you can claim a station as yours and make it invulnerable to damage and stealing. It also makes any docked ships invulnerable too. So griefers aren't a problem with this HAHA!\n\n7. Factions. You can make a faction and build on faction points with players to join it (Idk if npcs can join or not), taking over sectors and systems, defeating enemies, and so on. With a faction you can claim a space station and make it invulnerable to damage and stealing. And you can claim a whole system as your territory. Again, there are 128 x 128 x 128 (I think) sectors in a system, so that is a TON of space as yours. With a faction, you can also make your own shops! You can price items how you want, decide what is on your market, and sell things to other players, and maybe even npcs. (You may not need a faction, you may only need a space station to make a shop. I can't remember) And with a faction you can keep growing your territory until you take over everything MUAHAHAHAHAHHAHA! (Not even kidding though)\n\n8. Build mode/Advanced build mode. Who doesn't love a good build mode for easy ship/station construction? With regular build mode you can do all the basic stuff like placing/deleting blocks, flying, sped up flying, connecting blocks and groups, and all that stuff. With advanced build mode, you can use symmetry (For precise building), copy/pasting/saving pieces of ships or stations as templates, mass building with placing up to 10 blocks in every axis at a time (So you can build a 10 x 10 x 10 cube with one click), rotating blocks, and a few other things. So very fun and easy to use. Makes for easy building of a massive ship.\n\n9. Jump drives/Warp gates. *SPOILER HERE* The jump drives and warp gates are a great way to get around fast, but you need alot of power. With a jump drive, you can "jump" up to 8 sectors away. With warp gates, (I think) you can warp up to 128 sectors away. So very convenient.\n\n10. Asteroids, planets, stars, stations. These are all procedurally generated. Very cool.\n\nNow, for the cons. However, some of these are personal opinions and may not matter to you.\n\n1. *PERSONAL OPINION* This game has blocks, not voxels. Sometimes I prefer voxels instead of blocks because realistic smooth surface terrain is cool, but it is not a big deal, this game is still great.\n\n2. Memory issues. I have noticed a lot of people having memory issues where it gets very laggy and a message pops up in game and says you are running low on memory, and to increase the max and min memory in the launcher, you can edit the memory settings like it says, but some people still get the issue. I have fixed it for the most part, but some people can't. Maybe the devs will fix this or optimize it.\n\nOther than these, that's all I got for the cons. Great right? lol\n\nNow, this section is WHY it is NOT a clone of Space Engineers.\n\n1. It is blocks, not voxels.\n\n2. It has planets, stars (Stars that you can actually go to and burn up and die, not just the background sun), sectors, systems, and galaxies.\n\n3. It ALREADY has NPCs, I know SE will have them, but this game already does.\n\n4. It has customizable weapons and complex combination systems.\n\n5. It has more than just 1 type of metal block. Just saying lol.\n\n6. Build mode/advanced build mode.\n\n7. More content with factions (SO FAR).\n\n*Don't get me wrong, I still love and play Space Engineers, but I wanted to clear this up for people who think this is a clone because it most certainly is not*\n\n*ONE MORE THING BEFORE WE WRAP THIS UP* It is still early access (For those who don't know what that means), it is still being developed, it will change, get worse, get fixed, get better, and maybe even become something different.\n\n*TL;DR*\n\nNow, for the people who didn't feel like reading all of that, here is a basic summary:\n\nIt is an incredibly fun game with many unique features, and very few bugs that I have noticed. Not many cons at all, and I suggest this to any person. STILL early access so things will change, get worse, get fixed, get better and maybe even become something different. NOT a clone of Space Engineers. (I covered that in the above section)\n\n*FOR THOSE WHO READ THE WHOLE THING*\n\nThanks for taking the time to read and I hope you found this helpful. :)","February 4, 2015","true","76.0"," 445 of 459 people (97%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","97","445","459","44","22"

The Void now controls over 90 Sectors in several galaxies and is the heart of the SOS Network. With over 78 fleet members, we are controlling to largest vessal known as the "Void Battlecruiser Mk. XII." With this strong vessal at hand, it holds a crew of 50 and cargo capacity of over 1 million blocks (Standard NDAs apply :3).

BattleShip, The Void, begins. More additions to Space Station.\n\nDay 6: War comes alive; multiple squads of highly suited pirates are approaching, we respond by sending 2 squadrons (of 4 ships each) to attack the hostile parties. While our fleet is attacking the pirates, I am aboard the Fleet Space Station, initiating Emergency Protocol Omega when I see Alpha Squad has been blown to bits. 4 more Squads of pirates come up on radar, the Station is now in red alert, warp gates are firing up for our last ditch effort. Shields are down to 75% and dropping fast, Bravo Squad is fleeing from the Station. Shields are now down to 69%, warp gates are at 85% charge, I quickly launch our Escape Pod Protocol, everybody aboard the Station is now aboard the only highly advanced pod we had. The warp gates are now ready to teleport, Escape Pod 1 is entering transit, all our advanced anti-ship weaponry are covering their taxi towards the gate. My fleet are shouting at me to come aboard quick, when I realize I am the only one keeping them from death. I am the last stand against the threat, Escape Pod 1 is now entering the warp gate, any time now they will be safe, sectors away from the threat. Shields are now at 27%, we just lost power as soon as Escape Pod 1 enters the warp gate. With power at criticly low levels, I initiate the emergency shielding systems, when ... another fleet arrives!? This can't be, our neighboring fleet has come to the rescue! With over 8 squadrons of advanced fighters, they broke out a very thrilling war. With Anti-Ship guns firing at the pirates and our neighboring fleet to the rescue, power is coming back online on the Station. The Void Space Station is now fully operational, with her crew at Echo Base. The pirates are fleeing from the battlefield, we've defeated them! Thanks to the help if our neighbors, our Space Station is forever safe.\n\nDay 7: We have completed the S.O.S. BattleShip TheVoid. Space Station Alpha has been upgraded extensively.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/recommended/244770/","Asvarduil","Asvarduil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/","46 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOnce upon a time...no, wait, never mind.  I'm still bulding the U.S.S Defiant.\n\nStarMade is a block-buildy game In Space!  The best way to explain it to people is, to start by imagining MineCraft.  Now, take your awesome castle, and put thrusters and guns on it.  That's StarMade...only, it's not quite as engaging, even about seven months after my original review.\n\nSome changes have happened, including a price hike to $14.99.  Thus, I'm taking the extra hours I've played in the intervening months into account, and doing a re-review.  Has it improved?  Well...you will see.\n\nWhat Works\nFirst, the visuals have improved greatly from my prior review, and the game overall looks pretty nice.  You can build some neat ships and stations.  The Pentas/Tetras/Corners allow for somewhat blocky re-builds of your favorite Sci-Fi ships, or your own custom creations.  Some recent texture updates from the developers have made good ships look even better!\n\nPerformance is also improved to the point where the game is at least playable on medium-grade machines.  This was a critical problem for me in my previous review, but the developers deserve credit for working to make the game behave more efficiently.  Good job there!\n\nThe UI has improved a lot in seven months too.  There are some issues with resizing individual windows, but the game is easily understandable via the UI, and gives you most of the tools you need to build ships, which is the game's primary mechanic.  The secondary mechanic, shooting stuff with your ship, is also well-accounted for, with shield, structural HP, and armor HP being presented well.  There are some placeholders about, as this game is still in development, but progress is being made.  I'm sure seven months in the future, the UI will be a lot better than it already is, and I look forward to that.\n\nWhat Doesn't Work\nBefore I get to anything heavy, I have to talk about the crafting system.  The crafting system is OK in a survival setting, and some much-needed tuning has happened...but ultimately, to make a decent ship, you need a lot of blocks, because in this game, bigger ship = better.  There's additional problems with that that we will get to, but the crafting system as it stands actually hampers the process of doing the main thing that you should be doing in a game about building starships: actually building starships.  To solve this, the crafting UI and system needs a pretty massive interface revamp, and some thought should be taken to all the 'wasted' blocks about, things like plantlife that could be leveraged to make more interesting builds.  It's as if the developers started off by copying MineCraft, then at some point decided, "oh yeah, the point of this game is to make ships!"\n\nNext, there's a problem with how the shipbuilding mechanics in this game are balanced, specifically: any ship you make is a fighter.  You don't need crews to tend to large ships.  You just need your ship to be bigger than an enemy's, because a bigger ship fits more systems in it, and systems are what cause you to win fights, eat asteroids or planets, or whatever.  The recent Cargo system that was released yesterday will help prevent planet-eating miners from being quite as big of a problem as they were prior to this (good luck fitting a planet in your cargo holds), but those of you wondering whether or not to buy into this game should know that, especially in multiplayer, the shipbuilding mechanic is unfairly weighted towards building big ships; smaller ships are thus forced out of niches that are realistic, such as bombers/interceptors.\n\nAs big of problems as those points are, there was one critical problem in my prior review, that there's nothing really to do, no reason to actually build a ship.  This one, big, critical, overarching problem persists to this day, and it makes the entire game, all the well-crafted bits, completely pointless.  There are some feeble attempts to remedy this - specifically a "race gate" minigame setup was added to the game in a more recent release.\n\nThe reason I say, "there is nothing to do in StarMade", is tied more specifically to two things.\n\nIn Single-Player, there's really nothing to explore.  StarMade randomly generates universes, but other than finding slightly different ores on planets, you may as well not bother.  There are randomly generated space stations too, but do they reward anything?  Not really, unless you salvage the station.  In StarMade, you'll soon discover one thing: due to how the Crafting system works (above), it's generally better to avoid conflict altogether, or your lovingly-crafted spaceship will cease to be, and you will have to grind out a new ship.\n\nIn Multi-Player, it gets worse.  The Faction system in StarMade is...well, a faction system.  Ideally, players pool their resources to create fleets, stations, and stuff, thus providing a natural objective for PvP.  Sounds great, right?  Unfortunately, due to not designing the Faction system to account for humanity's darker impulses, the only way to secure anything you own, is to create a one-man faction, and set a planet or space station as the home base...rendering the systems inoperable by non-guildmembers, and storage secure.  In this way, your stuff is safe from griefing, and as far as I can tell, it's the way the game is designed to be played.  That's well and good...except that's not really the point of a Faction, now is it?.\n\nThe way I suggest for the developers to fix StarMade's pointlessness is two-fold.\n\nFirst, there needs to be a meaningful progression that doesn't come out of your workbenches.  You should have to explore, and give exploration some meaning besides "where are the ores?"  If you want to create a civilian ship, ask yourself: why create a civilian ship?  Trade, mining, and ferrying come to mind.  Those are some great candidates for randomized quests that can be rewarded with blocks, money, or useful ship blueprints.  For that matter - make the premade ships not suck so much!  Existing ships can serve a great purpose - teaching new players the nuances of StarMade's shipbuilding mechanics.  In this way, players build better, interesting ships, which forges a stronger community and makes PvP more reasonable as an implicit objective.\n\nNext, you have to fix factions.  Single-player factions destroy the fun of multiplayer in this game.  My suggestion is for players to have 'personal home' blocks that can be used to secure a personal space on a station or planet against anyone who's not them; all chests/cargo areas in that are similarly preserved.  Similarly, creating a faction should require a party of at least two people.  The home-base constraint can still apply, and should.   The game needs better in-faction control to help Factions defend against spies and ne'erdowells.  As long as players make single-person factions, your multiplayer is broken.  You're just putting single-player on a multi-player server.\n\nThe TL;DR\nI have a love-hate relationship with this game.  On the one hand, I really do like building starships.  On the other, this game is less of a "game" in the "you can win or lose" sense, and more of a starship building simulator.  The price of the game was increased to $14.99 from $9.99...I see nothing that justifies this price hike.  As a result, I emphatically do not recommend purchasing StarMade.\n\nThis game will be fun, possibly for weeks, until you begin to see the legion of flaws and the fact that this game is a simulator.  $14.99 is how much completed indie games cost on Steam; this game is neither completed, nor sufficiently fun enough to bear that price tag.\n\n","December 6, 2015","false","285.9"," 391 of 472 people (83%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","83","391","472","20","80"

After spending about 5 minutes with red beams flashing everywhere around my ship and me firing to no effect on the station I decide to close the range... cause i thought my cannons where out of range... I must say the shield hit effects were epic and they were the last things i saw before my ship imploded. that ended my first day.\n\nDay 2:  I play with my friend with a few of his mates and we build a small planetary hideout kitted out with basic factory and power generation capabilities along with a bit of a decorative sense. we decide to build a space station and begin work on ceaser station.\n\nDay 3:  After an all nighter building our station it is finally completed We look upon our basic station with pride it had an internal medium hanger bay and a small exterior bay. little did we know that while we were building our lttle station the others had been amassing a fleet. Blissfully unaware we continue expanding our station. making a cool interior command room, hanger observation room, a working red alert system with logic blocks and a nice room to watch the planet we were orbiting from.\n\nDay 4:  My friend and I are discussing on skype what our plans are for the station today as we connect to the server. We decide to build another (larger) hanger bay and a med bay. While im working on setting up the docking zones for the large hanger my friend decides to go out in our mining ship to replenish our rapdily depleting supply of money and materials. While he is out I notice 4 new contacts appear on my screen all of a sudden, blissfully unaware I check my navigation bar to see what the new contacts are. Bunny Buster, Major Pain, Meals on Thrusters and 1701. I wondered if they wanted to trade with us (we had just set up our shop) so I asked them if they would like to dock... the response i got was not the one i hoped for... One ship fired what must of been over a hundred missiles all of which quickly turned to face the station and our fighter craft and begun to speed towards us. Realising we were under attack I screamed for reinforcements from my friend and ran for the fighter hoping to get into it and fly off to allow its shield to recharge. The first volley of missiles totaly obliterated that hope, I watched as the core (all that survived of my fighter) spun past overheating. And decided to do the last thing that I could, I ran for the control center deep in the center of our station hoping that the attackers would get bored before they shot through all the intervening rooms and armour blocks. Upon reaching the control room I played my last card... I activated the Red alert system we had spent half an hour setting up. Immediatly all the lights in our station turned off... and .5 seconds later red ones turned on to replace them. That done I activated the build block so I could watch them destory my work. The ship that fired all the missiles was now steaidly pouring barrages of missiles into the station which while not having much dammage lowered our shields slowly. A second ship oppened up with Ion beams (as i latter found out) which almost instantly stripped the remaining shields from our station. The remaining two ships then closed and each fired a single missile one they had coloured green the other red. I thought that my station could easily withstand two missiles I mean it had surrived hundreds so far... how wrong I was each missile detonated with all the fury of a nuclear weapon punching giant holes in our beutiful home (turns out they had mergered pulse and missile blocks to make these missiles). I watched on as they fired the seconds volley and counted the seconds till  my command centre exploded around me. and so ended my 4th day.\n\nDay 5:  I joined up with the  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s  AWESOME GUYS who destroyed my station so i could learn their ways... and boy did I learn lots ;-)\n\nThis Game lets you do SO MUCH, every weapon can be merged with other weapons to create different effects e.g cannon to cannon to create a rapid fire cannon (good for missile defence if mounted on a turret) Pulse to missile makes the lock on nukes. Missile to Missile make swarm missiles which independantly lock on to hostile targets. There are jump drives, cloaking devices (which I recently figured out how to use) Scanners, Radar jammers And more. This game is great and getting better\n\n10/10 strongly suggest you buy it! If you do and your interested in multiplayer please tell me.","March 1, 2015","true","16.2"," 110 of 113 people (97%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","97","110","113","31","0"

I'm gonna list some features I like below, and as the game grows I will add onto this list, and other things.\n\n-Liked Features ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-People don't move or skit around when on ships. This is a big one, and a lot of space building games have players glitching or even getting stuck in walls becuase they don't treat the ship as a anchor.\n\n-Much like an open world game. If you see it you can probably go to it. This game blows my mind on how expansive it is. You see that red dot in the distance? Thats a star, you can go there. That yellow dot? Another star. Seriously this game is crazy with this stuff and it blows my mind.\n\n-Populated servers. If you haven't played on a server yet do it. Great expierence.\n\n-Movable Asteroids. Its just fun to push them around, or even use them for cover.\n\n-Block Variety. This is another big one for me becuase its real nice to have a large list of blocks just to build nice looking ships with.\n\n-Advanced & Basic building. You can go very advanced with building in this game to get the most efficiency out of ships, or you can go basic, and get a alright ship.\n\n-Logic Systems. Probably one of the best things a building game can include, absolutely amazing!\n\n-Planets. You can even orbit them, or mine them out! Seriously planets are amazing they even have there own axis of rotation.\n\n-Wormholes. You can travel throughout the galaxy on wormholes.\n\n-Pirates. While they variety is lacking in the base vanilla game, you can add in your own Custom Pirates into the game.\n\n-PVP. Great expierence this one its fun watching two giant frigates battle it outside a planet.\n\n-Weapon Combinations. Probably one of my favourite features. Being able to combine a Rocket with a Cannon to make a shotgun is just the best.\n\n-Breaching. It was done alright fun as all hell though.\n\n-Shipyards. Absolutely amazing. Although I don't use it much its really fun to see a friend dock his        ship into our base.\n\n- Great Tutorial. Gotta say helped me out a bunch!\n\n~Developers + Support Team~ --------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- While I am not a developer my self I will say that they probably have one of the best support teams and dev's I have seen in early acess. I reported a bug about a wormhole spawning in my spawn when I first got the game and within a day it was on the bug tracker and my issue fixed! The developers also keep frequent updates, and are amazingly active on the forums.\n\n- The demo is the full game. This is amazing for early access you are giving players a chance to play the game, and see if they want to support you! Great move on the creators.\n- If you are gonna do early acess this is how you do it right!\n\n\n~Servers~ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- My expierence with servers have been fun. If you are gonna play starmade you absolutely gotta do it in a server. The game normally feels empty in singleplayer but in multiplayer servers usually add there own custom pirates, and tons of players populate the game! Seriously give this a shot.\n\n~Community~\n- Probably one of the friendliest communities I have ever met! Seriously they are a major help and I suggest you visit the forums here. " http://starmadedock.net/forums/ "\n\n~Some bad things~ -------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA review isn't a review without some bad things. The game is still early acess so I won't really put bug complaints here.\n(This list may grow)\n- Windows block out some things. Not sure if this is a bug or intended, but you cannot see the sun, planets cores, and missiles through certain pieces of glass. If this was intended maybe instead of blocking out all particles like that you can just dim them.\n\n\n*~~~~~~* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","May 29, 2015","true","19.6"," 100 of 107 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","100","107","4","6"

I've had more fun with it than I ever had with Minecraft, despite the obvious similarities between the two games. I find myself thinking about StarMade when I'm at work, plotting out new ship designs and planning raids on other factions. I cannot recommend this game highly enough.\n\nSo what's the appeal? Why is StarMade so great?\n\nFor me, the answer is that it fulfills the promises of games like Space Engineers, Eve, STO, and even legendary franchises like the X series. It is one of the first sci-fi games I've ever played that strikes a perfect balance between space combat, ground combat, ship design, strategy, and a vibrant in-game economy. The game is still early-access, and this is somewhat obvious at times (particularly on planets, which currently do not spawn pregenerated structures or mobs), but there's just so damned much to DO - particularly if you're playing online - that you'll rarely care.\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of the game is ship and station design. You'll start off floating in the void of space, somewhere near the center of a proc-gen galaxy. You have 25, 000 credits and some basic building components, which can be used to make a large fighter, or, more likely, a small, all-purpose vessel. Whatever you decide, every single aspect of the design is up to you. Want a donut-shaped ship? Do it! Want to fly Moya, the Galactica, or the USS Enterprise? It'll be expensive, but it's totally doable. Want turbolifts between decks, drone racks, or a tractor beam? Build the right components and you can install them anywhere you want on your ship. Be careful though, because every block you place serves an important purpose - and every block can be destroyed. This means you can lose gravity partway through a fight, potentially jettisoning your friends into the void of space. Or perhaps the logic that controls your turbolifts will go down, trapping you on the command deck until repairs can be made. StarMade is, IMO, the most complex and well-executed science-fiction simulator available, with its infinite possibilities offering countless moments of drama, terror, and triumph.\n\nI could keep raving about how great this game is, but, well, I kinda want to play it instead. I HIGHLY recommend that anyone who's a fan of sci-fi or sandbox games give the game a whirl. Trust me, the $10 or so that they're asking for is an absolute steal.","December 24, 2014","true","74.3"," 99 of 106 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","99","106","7","0"

I am so focused on getting this done so that I can as soon as possible take it into outer space and blow the crap out of my rivalling faction’s outpost that lies 9 solar systems away. I must prove like many other factions in StarMade, that the “ACE Pirates” is a faction that are to be taken seriously and I am sure that when this battlecruiser is done, they will never even consider launching a missile at even the weakest of our mining ships.\nStarMade is all about building spaceships and continuously upgrading them as time flies by while having such a blast. Whenever one thought that one’s interstellar battlecruiser was too big, an hour or two later they will not think so anymore. StarMade creates this need, this addiction to keep on destroying, keep on mining and to keep on building that spaceship of yours that you will brag about to all the people on the server – until someone with some space dreadnought that is twice your size shoves a missile down your throat. When such things happen, StarMade emotionally attached you to that ship, and it emotionally attached you to making that ship beat someone else’s. StarMade makes you think of your spaceship as your children, you want the best out of them and you keep on encouraging them – or even force them to be better that others. That’s what happens when you get this thought; “how shall I build this weapon system to one-shot that guy?”.\nAt first StarMade would seem very similar to Minecraft – which it is in both its aesthetics and fundamental gameplay. They are both games based on blocks and building. But apart from that it has what Minecraft lacked and made me stuck to the game ever since, namely to be able to build space ships. Not only are the textures so much sharper, and the building materials come in different shapes apart from cubes, but the scale of StarMade is just outstanding. Robin Promesberger spent a decade to code the engine for it and runs so well on even low end pcs. With this you soar the universe, explore millions of different planets, solar systems and galaxies. There is not one world, but hundreds to explore – all in one game!\nIf you thought space was lonely and think that it’ll be like that in StarMade, I’m sorry but you thought wrong. StarMade’s multiplayer is a fantastic experience of interacting, trading, obliterating and befriending your fellow astronauts in this vast universe of space. Not only is it fun to mine and survive in space alongside them, but joining a faction by teaming up and creating a coalition can be just as exciting. A fully established faction will sometimes be forced to operate in such a way that is almost as complex as modern day politics! For example, a leader that divides certain members to either build, produce blocks, fight or mine. Mine where? When? How? With what? These are all fundamental questions that must be solved within the faction, forcing the players themselves to figure out what’s best for them and for the faction so that they can stand out as a better faction. This is StarMade’s multiplayer experience, which is both unique and enjoyable for the casual to hardcore gamer.\nI mentioned continuously upgrading your spaceship and how this hooks you onto the game. To be able to continuously upgrade your ship by adding more modules, more shields, more guns, you have more or less no limits opposed to other scifi shooting games. Your ship depends all on how well you can plan, how well you choose to get resources, and of course how well you design your ship with all these resources you get. Much like the modpacks for Minecraft such as tekkit and feedthebeast, you can build huge factory complexes. In StarMade these are the essential and fundamental parts for wrecking space scrubs in the universe. It takes a long time to get a hang of it, and there is quite a steep learning curve, but you’ll eventually understand the game, and when you do you can do anything you ever wished to do in in space. The part of StarMade that I find most satisfying is when you explode someone’s ship with a missile whilst piloting the spacecraft made of all those resources which you collected and strived hard to turn into modules in your factory complex. It is very amusing to watch the guy’s dead ship drift away for you to take.\nLike more or less everything in this universe, there has to always be the downsides. StarMade unfortunately lacks many sounds for certain parts of the game and gives a less immersive feel. Currently the game has a very limited AI simulation, which means that playing the single player mode will feel very lonely. However this can be quickly solved by hopping on to the first multiplayer server in the conveniently placed server list that exists in the launcher. StarMade also lacks a proper third person view perspective, something I and probably many other people think is a natural view point in games.\nBut for being in alpha, that is quite alright, and the gameplay itself is outstanding and addictive to say the least. StarMade is about building stuff, and sometime later blow stuff up with that stuff. The intense multiplayer creates the competitiveness to progress with designing your ships, and forces this competitiveness to go on. And in the process, forces you to blow up one another in this blocky arms race in space.\n\nThe Good\n+ Infinite universe,\n+ Smooth immersive multiplayer,\n+ Well established ship building system\n+ Rewarding progression\n\nThe Bad\n- Lack of AI simulation\n- No third person view\n- Few sounds.","December 29, 2014","true","9.4"," 91 of 98 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","91","98","12","2"

It was great. Sure, it is technically in the development phase even now, but if you are curious of whether to purchase this game or not, I would have to say it is likely worth the buy considering the following:\n\n1. Final version will likely be much more expensive, so buy it now to support it's development and get it cheap!\n\n2. Despite the level of development, there is so much to do. Seriously, people are still posting versions of famous starships rebuilt for starmade while others create their own original ships.\n\n3. The community is fantastic! If you have the ability to, you should try setting up a server for you and your friends.\n\nLastly, many of the complaints I have heard of this game are technical in nature and have been already fixed as of this review. There is only one complaint I have worth mentioning and that is the fact that the system requirements are probably a little higher than listed here. I have a good setup beyond what is required here, but I have to turn down the settings to play this game without issue. I do not believe this game to be as poorly optimised as minecraft, but it definitely can slow down or screw up if you do not alter the settings.

So I feel I can create a decent review...\n\n\nStarmade, is a must have game. There, there's my review.\n\n\n\nAs of Aug. 11 2015\n\nHave you ever eaten a pretty bad meal out for about 12 bucks? Afterwards you regret going there in ther first place because all you're doing now is sitting on the toilet and hating yourself? Well starmade isn't like that at all. It costs less than $12.00 currently, at $9.99. It also will make you not hate yourself! :D (Well, unless you spend 50 hours building a ship to have it blown up by pirates or other players on her first voyage.)\n\nAs of Aug. 11 2015\n\nStarmade\n-Procedurally generated world, it's never the same.\n-Takes imagination, or you can go download other player built ships.\n-When they say "open world" they mean, "open universe". Only limitations are your own imagination and creativity\n-Quite literally the universe is your sand box, build it, and they will come.\n-Save Yourself some time and learn how to use advaned build mode. (but first make sure you understnad how power works)\n-Oh yeah, there are ships and stuff... Did I meantion you can build whatever you want? (press "m" to spawn a station, press "x" to spawn a ship.)\n-Devs are super acive in the community, makes for easy vertical communication. Which is very refreshing\n\n\nThings to note:\n-Little bit of a learning curve.\n-Because code  for the game hasn't been streamlined perfectly yet there are some issues on multi-player servers due to lag when more than 15 players are on at one time.

Now I spend time thinking about maybe giving it a another shot. I got into the game just after the big graphical re-boot having played Minecraft for years and checking out every voxel based, procedurally generated game I could find. I trolled Greenlight and found many wanna be contenders but Starmade impressed me with it's vision of what it wants to be. Like any relationship we fall in love with what could be, an ideal, sometimes a projection we place onto the other. I am love with what Starmade is trying to be, but has not yet become.\n\nI lost interest for awhile when the docking update changed how turrets and ships dock. I was having a blast using the quirky old system to make a wide range of ships. The new system looks great and will solve many foibles and allow for a great variety of new designs. Just like with the Minecraft updates I got to enjoy a new game play each time Notch added something. Starmade is developing much the same way but because of it's own ambition each major update is quite disruptive. I have seen other early access wallow aimlessly, become abandoned or run off the rails in development. Starmade is doing none of these things. The danger, as I see it, is that Starmade may have trouble fulfilling it's grand ambitions.\n\nYes this game has a learning curve and I had fun riding that curve. This is the gold-standard for a complex game. If the learning is fun; success, if it is tedious; go play a game more suited to your short attention-span. A simple game is easy to learn and may become boring. A game with depth and possibilities is going take time to master but will remain engaging.\n\nIn it's current state (shipyards just released) Starmade is a very solid, playable early access game. There is a smattering of enemies to keep you improving your ship designs. There is no story arc yet but the ship-building is very polished. The Devs have built a proper foundation for an amazing game. It remains to be seen if they can build an engaging experience onto their ground-breaking mechanics while maintaining balance.\n\nLook elsewhere for the hate, I'm going to tell you what I love.\n\n>Design matters. Where you put modules and how you protect your ship will really make a difference. Lots of room for tactics, countermeasures and cool systems. My first death in the game was a suicide. I designed anti-personnel pulsers in the airlock. Two passes and you are still ok, the third pass: you're dead. (You can come in, look around and leave safely or... linger and die.) I died testing the system and laughed my ♥♥♥ off.\n\n>If you can dream it up you can build it. The first major ship I built was a salvage craft. I designed it to rescue shipwrecks. It was big and turned like a pig but fast and survivable. (I used it for daring rescue of a huge ship that got cored by pirates. It was an epic mission that left massive chucks missing from the old Flat-top but both vessels made it home intact. WooHoo)\n\nOne of my favorites is the Tholian Enervater: a spider-themed hunter-killer. By design this craft can pursue a small fighter, slow it down using (web) multiple tractor beams (locking it in the crosshairs), rob it of power using (venom) an electro-mcGuffin ray and finally kill it. The theme of the spider worked both visually and tactically. Very Cool, good job Devs.\n\nI decided to make a Whale-ship that could swallow a pirate-craft whole and then eat it. It worked just as I had hoped. (Unfortunately collisions are unavoidable)\n\nI have stealth designs, a 'Tuttle-craft' for repairs, a surveyer/scout, a carrier/salvager, a mining ship with a huge beam.  = ]  Racing has just been introduced so now 'Tuning' will be a part of designing an efficient racer.\n\n> Hey, it's fun to fly too. Never mind the awesome build mode with simple and powerful symmetry & mirroring to reduce keystrokes... this is a very good space cockpit interface. Starmade features a huge number of elements introduced by previous space games but incorporates them well, often getting better results than its predecessors. It may not have the graphical grandeur of Klingon Academy but the systems controls are simple and easy to use in combat. After narrowly escaping from battle and badly damaged, I was able to reconfigure my systems and piece two non-functional weapons into one cobbled together mess of a gun (without going into build-mode). As I limped home I felt like Scotty, under an instrument panel with sparks flying, griping to the ham fisted captain who got us into this mess in the first place (oh, wait...that's me).\nDog fighting is still a bit slow and not very dynamic with the current AI. I hope for more variation in their tactics besides "Send more guys".  Multiplayer servers often have custom pirates so there is lots of room for variety.\n\n>Potential. There's that dirty word again. With human crews for opponents in a more populated (by NPCs) world this game could be epic on a level beyond the average tired space-shooter game. It already has nailed the galactic map, shop-economy, building, flight control, and optimization. Read the developer's blog (Bench) to get a look at what is to come. The game updates every couple of weeks with new features, bug fixes and optimizations.\n\n>Powerful logic-driven systems. Think wireless redstone only more stable. Weapons with aux effects, electronic countermeasures and transporters. Shipyards to generate virtual designs and a BluePrint for your builds to save, share, upload, download & modify, all seamlessly.\n\n>Friendliest PvP I have ever seen in a game.\n\n>This game is better and more polished in it's Alpha state than many 'finished' releases I have bought.\n\n>Going into 2016 there has been a cargo and thruster update offering realistic, mass based acceleration and more thruster dynamics with user customizable settings. Fleets are set to add another dimension to the Meta-game. Slabs are expanding build-potential.\n\nFor the earth bound crowd who complain that game is broken: try to find it in your imagination that this game is still in the chrysalis phase. The grub's body is utterly dissolved in the cocoon before it can be reborn into a butterfly.\n\nEarly access is just that... if you don't get that stop bothering the developers and go play something with Zombies.\n\nFor the Developers: Schine on.","October 14, 2015","true","355.1"," 79 of 86 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","79","86","15","2"

I had no prior knowledge to its existance, and I wish I had. The prospect of freely being able to build my own ship, and on top of that, exploring an almost infinite number of galaxies and systems, was one of the one things I have been searching for in a game.\n\nThe good:\nThe game runs like a dream, due to its blocky, basic style, yet looks great while doing so.\nExploring the initial galaxy you spawn in is a blast, flitting between systems, mining for resources and credits, trying to work up enough money to repair that station you found, or to even build your own station from scratch, and exploring the mysterious wormholes that spawn in various locations in the galaxy\nShip combat is a blast, there ae multiple weapons systems, upgrades, and combinations to use to your advantage. Want a huge flagship that fire seeking rockets that move faster than any ship built? Sure thing! You want a tiny scout ship with the laser cannon capacity to rip apart said flagship with a few well placed shots? Doable!\nWarp drives take alot of the time out of flying at a constant speed of 75 kmph (max speed in my singleplayer games for some reason.)\nThe plane setting ability allows for perfectly symmetrical building, perfect for making models of famous ships, like the sloppy Battlecruiser I spent hours on. Building in itself is also fun, as you get to explore what possibilities you have with weapons and defensive systems, along with the logic blocks they've added in. I'm still exploring the destructive capabilities of certain weapons themselves.\n\nThe gray areas:\nGenerating a planet takes ALOT of computing power, and my poor little Dell ♥♥♥♥♥ itself trying. "Get a better PC" yes, I'm aware. Money is limited, sir. And at the moment, I have none.\nPirates steal blueprints from your catalouge, but when they start using a turret I designed for my flagship (a jumbled block of power generators, sheilds, and a seeker rocket array) to try and kill me and/or chase me down, (note: no thrusters are on said turret) it gets comical really fast.\nStars, Pirate stations and Crabs often have MUCH to big of a range for their respective sizes. I was taking hits from a Prate station's turrets from 2 sectors away, hull damage from a star that was 3 sectors away, and a Crab found its way across an entire galaxy, flew into my space station, and buzzed of the little health I was rocking on, after I warp drived several times and used a wormhole to get away from the accursed station it was hiding in.\n\nThe bad:\nMost Pirate turrets do RIDICULOUS ammounts of damage, especially to a new player only starting with 2.5k credits. Just asking that for new players' sake, tone it down a bit?\nPirate stations have a nasty habit of generating in the sectors right beside the spawn shop, and even though it says you're protected, you can get endlessly spawnkilled.\nMoney is a bit difficult to come by, especially when you need something the size of an aircraft carrier to be able to get away unscathed, and the factories require HUGE ammounts of resources to make shipbuilding materials. I know some servers have made it so that you start with large ammounts of money, but trying to play singleplayer can be downright infuriating at some points from the lack of knowledge new people might have, and lack of money/resources. A "peaceful" type of setting might be nice for this.\nOn the rare occasion, I've had Crabs spawn inside my claimed and repaired station, and it gets to be very tedious patching holes in both my cruiser and my station.\n\nOther than the few issues I've seen, the game is amazing. I especially enjoy teaming up with other players in large battleships to take town a pirate base, and man, is that a blast. I hope the devs take even more interesting routes with this game, and make it even more fun!\nCheers,\n\nUPDATE ADDITION:\nI can no longer play this game, because the laucher repeatedly crashes the game after loading the world i created. until i can successfully load up a world, i hate the game :>\n~Doge","January 9, 2015","true","84.7"," 62 of 66 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","62","66","4","2"

Factions have absolutely no player capacity limit. You can easily end up with five hundred factionmates with you.\n\nNow, let's talk about the pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n- Infinite procedurally generated space universe, countless galaxies, special stars, derelict stations... so much content to explore.\n- Ships are fully customizable, and can get really accurate thanks to the advanced building mode at your disposition.\n- No size limit, feel like building a 400 megatons titan ship ? Feel free to do so, this game doesn't restrict you one bit.\n- Full multiplayer support.\n- Full controller support.\n- Developpement team pays huge regard to community opinion. You are the key to a better StarMade.\n- Totally functional logic systems, you can finally make your 50 meters squared chip in space.\n- Factories, automation.\n- AI-controlled turrets and probes.\n- Awesome active community on the StarMade forums, and the StarMade registry.\n- So much pros, I surely forgot something.\n\nCONS:\n- Glitchy, that's to be expected of an Alpha.\n- Can crash on multiplayer... hope your ship was full-stoped before you did.\n- Tough on low-performance CPUs\n- Hard learning curve, you'd be best watching some tutorials on the web before throwing yourself in the game.\n- Larger ships are incredible stronger than smaller ships due to buffs in shield systems and weapon systems depending on number of blocks, more on that later.\n\nNow this game might be for €9.99, but it sure is worth twice as much, if I had one gift to do to a bored gamer, it would be this game.\nIt has been on developpement for about 4 years (More, already ?), but is still progressing at a sustained pace. The community can't wait to see further progress, and neither can I.\nShips will become overpowered exponentially with their mass, if one dreadnought is 50 megatons in mass, it will still be much stronger than 200 corvettes of 500 kilotons. This is due to the exponential increase in stats the more blocks you have connected in one array. This is sad because that can inhibate epic space fleet battles. Fighters will never be able to breach through larger ships due to the former having weak weapons compared to larger ships, and the latter having too much shield recharge rate for the former.\nSchema and the developpement team plan on upgrading this though, to make smaller ships stronger and more of a threat, and larger ships more exposed to swarms of smaller ships.\n\nI guess I'll take my leave, before this review scares other people.","January 30, 2015","true","248.3"," 68 of 75 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","68","75","4","0"

I could not tell you how many times I stopped myself from punching my screen and snapping my keyboard in half just because I knew that if I did, I would not be able to play anymore.\n\nMinecraft never got my attention any more than "oh, that looks neat". The idea of building a house and then what? Oooooo I have a house or a village or a Grand Castle! Good for you! Now what does it do? What do you do with it? That does not capture my intrest. You know what does? I can build a Grand Castle, pack it full of power generators, shields, engines and 'frikkin laser beams to go blow up anything I come across in the Galaxy.\n\nNot all is fun and games in the 'verse though. There are issues. Glitches and bugs and bad coding, Oh My! Sometimes your turrets will teleport themselves halfway across the sector. Sometimes your ship wont fully load and it looks like you are missing half of it. Weapons 99% of the time work great, 1% of the time, they work about as good as a screen door on an airlock.\n\nYes, the Devs are very active. They do listen to the players. Updates rather often.

I've seen this game constantly change every month with new updates, each one improving the overall experience dramatically. This is still an early release, and like any other early release, your experience is not a guarenteed satisfactory one. There will be bugs. You will get frustrated. But overall it is worth it. And like many others that have reviewed this game, I agree that Starmade is one of very few early access games that I'd be ok with calling a "full" game, even though it is still not officially released.  Despite the occasional crashing and glitches, it is a very enjoyable game. But it is also a sandbox game, which means it is whatever YOU want it to be.\n\nI would not call this a minecraft clone. Do not listen to anyone who says it is. I do believe one of the developers of the game mentioned they based it off of minecraft, but it is a totally different experience. Some people have tried comparing it to the minecraft mod galacticraft, but even that is totally inaccurate. Still, if I had to compare, I'd say starmade was a mix of Eve Online, Dayz, and yes, Minecraft.\n\nBuilding: The building mechanics in this game are EXTREMELY advanced, and surpass minecraft by a long shot. It has everything I wanted in minecraft and more. There is a symmetry mode when building a ship or space station, there is an "advanced building mode" (activated by holding down ctrl in build mode), and there is an option to build more than one block at a time, and choose how many blocks on each axis (x, y or z) you want to place at once. This is customizable in the config, though the default is a max of  10x10x10. On one server, you could build up to 50x50x50. Now if you use x, y and z symmetry (and you have enough blocks for it) you can build quite a large mass in one click (though I wouldn't recommend it due to the lag involved). There is also wedges, coming in I believe 4 different types, and a wide range of different colored blocks. Overall, the things you can do with build mode is just insane.\n\nPvp: On many servers, they have an "anything goes" rule to pvp. Essentially, this feels alot like rust or dayz, or even EVE online.  People can easily betray you, destroy your ships and stations and then warp out of your star system before you even knew what happened. Due to a recent update, factions are now extremely important in controlling and maintaining multiple star systems in your galaxy. There is always a risk in forming an alliance with people you don't know, but it is usually worth it. I'd advise to keep some secrets, however. Don't go around the server bragging about your new ship, or how many credits you made in a recent raid on a pirate station. If you are in a faction with random people, try to keep a hidden storage box somewhere in a remote system with backup supplies in case the faction falls apart.\n\nAs for the actual combat, it can get pretty chaotic. There's three really basic weapons, cannons, damage beams and missile blocks. Theres also effect modules and computers to modify your weapons. If you connect an explosive effect computer to a missile computer, it increases the missiles blast radius. Connecting an ion effect computer to a cannon computer decreases the enemy ship's power, useful for stopping the enemy from warping away from you or cloaking. Theres also blocks like the stop effect computer, which can stop a ship from moving completely.  The shield capacitor block gives your entire ship some shields that stop your actual blocks from recieving damage. The shield recharger will recharge your shields automatically (if you have enough power) after you take damage. The amount of customization means no two pvp battles are the same, everyone is constantly improving their ships and experimenting with different ratios to try and find the perfect balance between damage and manueverability, or power consumption and protection, etc.\n\nMining and crafting: I can't say too much about this, as I haven't really experimented enough with the new crafting system. Mining was not very profitable before, it was too hard to find resources and the amount of work involved did not seem very worth it to me. Due to the new universe and faction update, as well as the new shop update, mining has become pretty much a neccessity if you're playing on a survival server. If you are in a system that your faction owns, you get a bonus amount of minerals when you mine a block. This does help quite a bit, and with enough people in your faction it shouldn't be too much of an issue. But if you're playing solo, don't expect to make a multi-million block ship anytime soon. The largest ship I've ever made was about 20 million blocks, though I mostly used credits to buy the blocks i needed in shops, as well as having a friend using the (very old) crafting system supply me with the rest.\n\nAlso, NOTE: This game, for the time being, IS FREE TO PLAY! It has always been free to play. HOWEVER!!! Like when minecraft was in beta, this will only be temporary. When the game is finally released, the price will go up and you will no longer be able to play for free. Ignore the title "demo version", it is not a demo. You have full access to the game for free right now. But I highly suggest buying the game as soon as possible, as it is getting closer to release every day.\n\nYES, I do definately recommend this game. It is very fun, and somewhat easy to learn, but it can get pretty complicated and technical if you want it to be. I'm not really sure what else to say. More content is being added every month. It is unlike any other game I have ever played, in that you can really immerse yourself in the game and be that spaceship pilot you always wanted to be as a kid. There are an infinite number of planets to explore, asteroids to mine, stations to capture and/or blow up with missiles, pirates and bandits to kill, loot to grab, ships to build, alliances to form, enemy factions to destroy, and fun to have ^_^","December 12, 2014","true","32.1"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","62","68","0","5"

But updates are consistent, the core mechanics are solid, and the game already offers an ton of fun to those it caters to right now. But because it is still very much in development, a number of mechanics are still missing, meaning that for now it does cater to a more specific group. Namely the one that absolutely can't resist building creative things with a full suite of editing tools, blowing them up and strutting around in their creations in front of their fellow community members.\n\nThe comparison to Minecraft is easily draw of course, and one should rightfully compare the two. However, even in mimicing some elements, the game always implements them in its own unique way, making it a breath of fresh air for some veteran MC players like me. That said, the implementation is usually more complex and intricate than its counterpart, so be prepared for a learning curve, thankfully often rewarded with the awesome result of your contraptions.\n\nFor now, the worlds are pretty scarcely populated and static, meaning that if your desire is not to build and start exploring all sorts of wonderful places, you might be disappointed. A huge amount of content is planned, but it will take time, with the first of these updates hitting soon in the form of massively upgraded space stations.\n\nInterfaces and tutorials are also quite barebones for the time being. Very useful and functional once you get a hang of them, but harder to learn and slapped together in places. If learning isn't your sort of thing, move on for now.\n\n===================\n\nIn short, the game already features a great amount of mechanics that can provide you with a lot of fun if you like building, warping & blowing stuff up in your own creations, but for now, lacks content and might seem intimidating to players just starting out.\n\nGood:\n- Full suite of building tools\n- Very optimised\n- Very scalable\n- Infinite universe\n- Procedural damage & debris\n- Innovative hexagonal planets\n\nBad:\n- Improvised interface\n- Lack of explorable content\n- Steep learning curve\n- Unbalanced economy\n\nIf you have any sort of creative or adventurous spark to you, definately try it and start creating or join a world without limits!\n\nIf not, maybe skip it and check back in another 6 months or so for the next batch of updates.","December 5, 2014","true","0.4"," 52 of 56 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","52","56","0","0"

The power disparity is being fixed in the future by assigning ships scores based on their components so waves of pirates spawn that are more tuned to your ship.\n\n- Pirate stations spawn more frequently the further from the galactic centre you are, but with a radar jammer they're not particularly threatening.\n\n- Combat balance has improved pretty significantly from when I originally made the review and I'm more happy with where it sits. Shipyards make repairing damage a lot less of a pain and shields are generally more powerful.\n\nI still wouldn't recommend it, but it's on its path to being a decent game.\n\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI have mixed feelings on this game, but keep in mind it's still alpha and is subject to change.\n\nFirst off, the good parts:\n- The game is very atmospheric, abandoned stations really feel abandoned and ships are easy to design to give off particular vibes.\n\n- The ship, building and station construction is pretty fun and there's more tools available than what you've got in minecraft, such as being able to specify an xyz area to fill in or placing a wireframe of a shape and being able to lock your construction to only let you place and remove blocks that are within that guide.\n\n- The universe gives a very good sense of distance and getting pulled into a one-way wormhole and finding yourself 2000km from where you started is simultaniously spooky and awesome.\n\nAnd the not so good parts:\n- Combat is atrocious, creating viable ships is not obvious at all and too damn expensive, but of course the enemies are all equipped with them. The weakest pirates in the game will straight-up annihilate you unless you're flying a multimillion credit ship. The reason for this is twofold - I never saw a pirate alone, they always come in packs of 5 or more and defensive equipment is seriously underpowered. You can place hundreds upon hundreds of shield capacitors and the pirates will simply blow through your measily amount of shields in seconds and start doing hull damage. This is where they start to damage and destroy the actual blocks your ship is made up from, which gets very expensive very quickly. It's also demoralising to see a ship you worked on for 3 hours torn to shreds from a single, small-scale firefight.\n\n- Enemies are too numerous. For how powerful they are you should only be seeing one or two of their home stations in a system, but you frequently see 6-8+ pirate stations, usually within firing range of the majority of the points of interest. This means evasion is simply not an option and even with a jump drive you're likely to land on top of a pirate station when travelling for more than a few hundred KM.\n\n- Moneymaking is a boring grind, you equip a ship with salvage modules and spend 25 minutes firing beams at planets and asteroids hoping to find minerals to turn into materials to craft with. There's nothing to spice this up with, you just shoot beams at stuff until they're gone or you get bored. Most guides I read referred to looting abandoned stations for systems to sell or use, but as it turns out the devs thought that was too overpowered and so now every block you get on a station turns into a part which is 5:1 to a basic crafting block. I dismantled an entire station (with a build block to save my sanity) and only got a little over a hundred thousand credits after turning the debris into materials and then into engines. It just feels like an arbitrary restriction on an already lengthy grind for money.\n\n- Less serious, but the default settings for the server config have some questionable values. By default the maximum speed is 75 m/sec, you'll want to crank that up to somewhere around 200-300. Space still feels big without having to spend 35 minutes flying through void to get somewhere.\n\n\nAs it stands, I can't recommend it. If it goes on sale for $3 or below and looks interesting to you, you probably won't regret it. Right now I'm regretting having paid the full $10 for it, but it might get better with time.","May 3, 2015","false","244.2"," 167 of 232 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","167","232","7","10"

In short, it is completely overwhelming. I spawned into my server and did the tutorial..... twice. I then realized how poorly made the tutorial is and proceeded to go find youtube videos on how to get started. This helped tremendously and I returned to the game ready to become a space exploring master.\n\nI quickly built my first little ship and flew to a shop to buy some more parts with my starting credits. I had my first mining ship ready to go in a little over an hour and from that point the game has only gotten more awesome. I soon lost my first ship to a wave of rogue pirates and had to start over. I was upset but it taught me the simple truth that space is not a friendly utopia. My next ship was still a mining ship but I equipped weapons, light armor, and some shields to ensure my long worked for investment would not be lost again.\n\nI now have some friends on the server with me and we have all started building capitol ships, cruisers, and stations. The game's building system is the most wonderful thing I have experienced in a "voxel" style game. The ability to mirror on all 3 axes, bulk block place, free rotation camera, copy/paste options, undo/redo buttons, and template saving/loading are just a few of the functions this game offers IN ALPHA. You can even save/upload ship templates from the registry or your computer into the game server for purchase and building! I could not ask for a more appropriately envisioned building system.\n\nIf you see the reviews stating the game has a steep learning curve, they would be right. But don't let that dissuade you from grabbing a copy for free while in alpha! Its free, what do you have to lose other than some time? It is definitely worth a look at least.\n\nThe controls are a bit clunky but that is because the range of motion and movement directions and ship menus are so plentiful they had to map nearly every key on the keyboard to a button. It takes some getting used to especially the getting around in 0G part.\n\nThe game is buggy and occasionally runs out of memory or has a java fatal exception. Its an EARLY ACCESS title and to expect perfection is just not realistic. It isn't even that common of an event honestly.\n\nEven with the few negatives I've mentioned above this game is still unreal. The scope and size is just absurd. I looked at my first galaxy where I spawned in and realize it would take months to explore all of those stars. Then I found several neighboring galaxies and the realization dawned..... YOU ARE SO TINY AND INSIGNIFICANT. You are a speck of dirt in one solar system, in a galactic neighborhood with thousands of other solar systems, in a galactic cluster containing thousands of galaxies, in a universe containing thousands of galactic clusters..... It blew my mind to see the scale on the map. Sure it sounds "big" when its written out in text or as you see the stars from in the game. But opening that galactic map.... it is so overwhelming.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you want an overwhelming space experience, like building spaceships, want something different from many other games on the market, and are willing to accept and understand what EARLY ACCESS means, then please download the demo and get started. I chose to purchase a 4 pack of this for myself and some friends not long after getting the demo version. It is that good.\n\nI don't do this often, but if you would like, add me and I would be happy to help walk you through some of the basics. I have several private servers up and running on US East Coast including one to provide a slightly safer "new player" friendly environment.","March 8, 2015","true","223.9"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","53","58","8","1"

They are offering the full version of the game as a "Demo" for Free. Yes Free. You can play it as much as you want now, during Alpha - and then decide to buy. I don't know of many other Early Access games that are doing this ... in fact many of them are asking 25 to 40 bucks or more just to play a buggy Alpha version of their game with no guarantee they're going to keep developing or finish the game. I don't really like those odds and I have thrown money into Early Access games that are now collecting dust in my Library because the devs just stopped working on it.\n\nStarMade is asking a very low price of 10 bucks right now ... that's less than you probably pay to go see a movie! DO IT. This price won't last. When the game grows in popularity and is more developed, that price will go up. This is smart marketing. Rather than asking a big up-front price for the Alpha and then slowly lowering that price via sales on Steam over time, these guys are smart. Ask NOTHING up front (Free Full Version / Demo) and a very small buy-in price. I'm impressed! Steam 'works' because players read reviews, players look at what's popular and selling fast in Early Access ... so asking a low up front price or even better, letting us play it FREE will get this game a lot of attention and fast.\n\nNow - The Game Review - Worth It?\n\nYES - YES - YES.\n\nThis game is really solid for an early access game and has a lot more functionality and items than I was first expecting. I did not think it would have so many building parts and that exploring would be limited or simplistic in looks but WOW was I wrong.\n\nThis is Minecraft-In-Space!\n\nGraphics - The textures, colors and graphics are awesome - better than most minecraft texture mods.\n\nCrafting - Gathering resources is easy and fun -- no blocks dropping off into space or down holes ... just ZAP and it's in your inventory. Putting bits together is easy and though the GUI for the crafting screen is still pretty rudimentary, it's intuitive enough you can get it easily.\n\n*EDIT* (Dec 11th) - After playing this a lot more over the past 4 days, I have come to realize the crafting system in StarMade is actually very complex (deceptively simple looking at first) and takes some learning to get the hang of (videos by other players helped) - so don't be fooled by the simple Minecraft look - it's a lot more indepth. There are factories of varying levels and power supplies must be maintained, and parts for your ships must be manufactured and assembled in a more complex way than I first realized. Again, I am very surprised at how much complexity they've already put into such an early Alpha game. StarMade's been in the works for quite a few years and it shows with how polished the crafting system is. If you were afraid it would be too 'simple' then let me reassure you this crafting system will challenge even the most detail-oriented game crafters.\n\nTutorial - The Tutorial is very indepth and helpful (needs a little grammar / typo work - hey I'm for hire!) ;). I would advise doing the tutorial and then watching some player guides on youtube before you really start building your ship because it's somewhat tricky at first to get all the blocks in the right arrangement for a power efficient and secure ship while at the same time making it look good.\n\nShips - Building your ship is pretty simple once you get the hang of the control blocks and such. Again, do the tutorial! I've looked at some of the amazing creations others have made online (videos and screeshots) and am very impressed at the unique and endless possibilities for your ship creations. Imagine if some of the insane things you've seen built in Minecraft could lift off and fly through space!\n\nCombat - I have done only a little of this so far being a newbie - but it seems solid and the options to upgrade and customize your ship's weapons is indepth and varied ... the crafting nuts who love space games (EVE Online?) will love this! There are shields and jammers and turrets and all the usual spacecraft type combat arsenals.\n\nExploration - Flying around is a joy and the controls are so simple even my 5 year old can do it and loves it. Radomly picking a direction and heading off into the great unknown of space for some far off sector of the galaxy is really fun and relaxing too. There's some good 'Explorer-zen' in this game.\n\nVast Universe - The Galaxy Map is pretty amazing too. I'm still trying to sort out navigating it but having a great time buzzing about the starter galaxy to get the hang of it. Scrolling out to see the sheer immense (infinite) size of the Universe was pretty mind boggling the first time!\n\nPlanets! - Last but certainly not least - The PLANETS.  O-M-G. I was absolutely stunned the first time I entered the atmosphere of my first planet and took a look at the amazing creation before me. The physics are well done and the geometric shape of the planet is fun and so very minecraft-esque! *Edit* Planets are "Dodecahedrons" technically! The planets actually slowly rotate and it's such a fun feeling to bounce around on them, explore and gather minerals and such. Definitely my favorite part so far.\n\nSummary (TLDR): THIS IS MINECRAFT-IN-SPACE ... DO IT!!","December 7, 2014","true","148.0"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","41","45","0","0"

My hours spent are fairly low in comparison to most of my other games, but I also spend quite a bit of time on the standalone version. Yes, you can download the standalone through the Starmade.org website. If you buy it here, you can link accounts and have full version there, aswell.\n\nActual features time.\n+ The vistas you see in space are absolutley breathtaking.\n+ Massive ships are made far easier to build using the Advanced Build Mode tools. Size sliders, anyone?\n+ The community so far has been great. The skin system was fully released and fixed recently, so now you can make your astronaut look however you like.\n+ Best weapons customisation I have seen in block cannons by far. You can slave systems to other systems to create combo weapons, such as seeker missiles or rapid fire cannons.\n+ Great factions system, and while teh new chat took some getting used to, it's quite a bit better than the last one. (Messages scroll in the proper direction now)\n+/- You can make amazingly huge ships, all it takes is time and dedication. However, these large ships can be laggy.\n- Coded in Java, some users will experience issues.\n- Still has some major bugs, but I havn't encountered any that have truley broken my game.\n\nAnd that's about it on what I have to say. I would LOVE to see more texture packs from the community, and rotating blocks and joints would be amazing aswell. All in all, it's a good space battle and space ship building game.\n\n[EDIT]: Just updated a few days ago, and the game is probably 50% better than it was before because of the new Rail system. Easy docking, the ability to move ships on rails... it's a beautiful thing.

I can say that I fell in love with this game. It's not so much survival, as it is more like Minecraft than it is Rust, but space pirates!\n\nMind you, I hate Minecraft. I put a lot of hours into it while I was away from home with no internet, but that game is boring, but it was the only limitless, unbeatablish, game I could play at the time. I also ran out of storylines on other console games.\n\nI've gotten lost in the game and lost track of time. I'm a military guy. I go to sleep at 2200, wake up at 0530 and go to work. The past couple nights, I've stayed up till 0100 and woke up at 0530. The space exploration is fun. Finding planets and trying to build an epic ship. Pure Awesome. Accept the space pirates.. They like to blow up your ship and send you back into the void crying.\n\nTotally worth the money. It's still in alpha (I'm pretty sure), and being so, starting the game for the first time took some googling, you have to dedicate ram to it yourself. To put it in fullscreen took googling, you have to go into the javascript and actually change part of the code *hint hint* You also have to go onto their site to register that you bought it through steam, which is simple.

Fleet commanding to have multiple ships in single player by your side, and more features to the NPC's like piloting or certain room control (IE: Engineers or gunenrs)\n\nAll in all the game is beautifully made and well worth the 9.99$ investment","December 7, 2014","true","20.8"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","35","38","0","0"

I caution you to not fall into this line of thinking and give Starmade a chance. As of this writing, the game is completely free to play and downloadable from the developers website during it's alpha period.\n\nIs it Minecraft in space? No. It's a starship game with a block building motif.\n\nLike many people cutting their teeth with block building games, I felt restricted. Even with mods and redstone advancement I felt my creations were static and dead. I felt any attempts to construct creations of grandeur were less not a matter of creativity but more overcoming the limitations that the game enforced. Resource management and collection was more of a hinderance than anything, and I spent more time micromanaging furnaces than playing the actual game.\n\nWith Starmade I felt free to explore and expand in any way I chose. Even in survival mode the pursuit of expansion seemed more rewarding and the progression of my ships was smooth. The game developers provided basic tools (admittedly with a bit of a learning curve) throughout to make sure that you are able to build and play the game fast. You spend less time flying around collecting materials as asteroids with resources are plentiful and respawn throughout the galaxies. Automation, factories, logic, and filtering sort your materials the way YOU choose. Building tools that mirror and place blocks in bulk, with in-game guides make it fast and easy to lay down your ship designs. Blueprints and shipyards make saving your designs and testing out new things a breeze.\n\nAny aspect of the game of interest to you? Focus on it! You can go as big or small as you want. Build planet-sized mining rigs, or quick-rapid fire fighter craft... or make small stealth ships to just explore the universe. Best of all, the developers and community are in constant communications... sharing ideas and opinions, fixing bugs and adding enhancements to the game constantly. The list of upcoming features is fantastic and after watching it's development for years I have yet to see them cancel or reject a truly anticipated feature.\n\nStarmade is one of the few games that I allowed myself to fall into because I felt there were no limits.\n\nI played for three years, primarily before it was Greenlit. Starmade was the one game I could always come home to. It became my favorite game to play anytime I had free moment. Sadly, I am writing this review now only as I am parting ways with it.\n\nSpace, by it very nature, is empty. When you are lacking content you have to make your own fun, and it's hard playing multi-player games alone. It is true there are quite a few Starmade servers with players on 24/7, but the current state of the game does not encourage teaming up with those who may be untrustworthy. Factions are available though somewhat limited at the time of this writing, and there are no 'personal' access blocks. That being said, I can't get a single one of my gamer friends interested in playing Starmade.\n\nI am not a game developer and will not attempt to act as if I know the solution, but when I demo Starmade to my friends from the ground up all they see is the void of space and not much else. In most survival games the start is a mad rush to get yourself equipped and protected as soon as possible. Your first dirt hut is an amazing achievement. In Starmade, you may as well never even leave the starting shop if you so choose. There is no call to action, no shove out the door, no impending doom, nothing making a new user wish to 'do' anything.\n\nI believe in Schine (the developers of Starmade).  I have no doubt that with their efforts and the support of the existing fan base they will absolutely polish and shine Starmade into a diamond. I just don't know how long that it will take. With that in mind, it's time for me to dock my ship for now, shut down the reactors, mothball the factories, and close up shop.\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the fish.\n\nEdit: Note - As of Jan 16th, 0.19549 personal blocks have been added.

I've spent a few hours on this game with a friend of mine, she and I trecked through space in what could only be described as a "Miner's Life". Due to the game being far from complete, it is without question that methods of income are highly limited. The game begins you off with only a few blocks, the essentials for a hopeful star-merchant or space-hero, the basic thrusters, some cannons, a core for your ship, power supply blocks and some armors. Being a new-found space explorer, it is without question that chasing down pirates it THE stupidest thing you can attempt. ( Although it may be possible to successfully bring down a pirate at the start. )\n\nEach system is a bit complex but it doesn't mean they are impossible for beginners to learn.\n\nPower System suggestion: DO NOT CLUMP YOUR POWER SUPPLIES! It's ineffective.\n\nThe way the power supply works, I found it highly effective to line your system up in two 1 x X (X being any number you can afford ) lines that are spaced by one block each. So your systems would look like this:\n\n-------------------------\n-------------------------   Each dash being power blocks.\n\nI'm not adept enough to figure out how the weapons systems work but from my research they're highly ineffective when clumped. I've seen a lot of suggestions stating that thirty cannon block separate and independent of each other are far more effective than all of them combined. Making bigger cannons practically useless.\n\nAlso included in this game is a crafting system which I have not personally tested, it allows for the mined raw materials to be crafted into processed variants.\n\nAlso worth noting: Each star CAN be approached. It's a matter of designing a ship that won't be obliterated by the time you reach it. Planets can be approached as well and even be built on to house a base or landing dock for the miners and would-be pirates.\n\nThere are still a lot of systems that are implemented that I haven't even touched. A lot being complex or lacking an updated guide. For example: Turret systems, boarding systems, in depth power supplies, and as I've said before, weapons sytems.\n\nIt is a game worth checking out and I highly suggest trying it with a friend.","October 28, 2015","true","43.8"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","31","32","4","1"

BUT and yes that is a big, big but.\n\nThere are some very serious issues with performance when it comes to loading planets.... like game dropping out issues, even when everything is turned to low it still does not help.\n\nI honestly cannot get near most of them because they are too big and it causes a critical error. And no it isn’t my pc as I am running decent hardware.\n\nBeing Alpha I understand we are bug testing. So I am not angry as such, more disappointed at something that shouldn’t have even been an issue in the first place, the description says this game is built to run on older PC's and I am telling to right at this very moment this would not run on an older PC if my rig cannot handle it.\n\nI recommend this game to those who are interested but I warn any who purchase that there will be that optimization issue that stops players from exploring some planets.\n\nSo devs:\n\n1.

If I were to give you description of what the multiplayer side of this game is, I would have to say it's shapping up to be a cross between Mincraft and EVE. So far the game is Minecraft in space with a touch of EVE, but with the direction they are going it will end up like I stated. As for single player, it's completly Minecraft in space.\n\nThe things you can build in this game are only limited by how far you're willing to go! You can build simple stuff or go bat sh*t crazy and build a fully 1:1 working space station. If you want the ship to rise from the ground out of a hidden hanger, you can build it.

I love both of those things, I believe that many people can agree with me too. It has many, many, many different items for buildings well, basically anything you want. A Battleship/Starship Destroyer? Why not. A space-station? Sure. Basically a ship which is OP (loads of energy storage, very fast regeneration of energy, tons of shields and shield regen ect)? Go ahead. This game is saying "go ahead, build anything, even the most complicated, most awesome looking ship, with a station on a planet, which is icy and next to a giant handmade tree" and does it very well with its limitations (you can make a lot of things, when I say a lot, I mean more than [insert large number here].\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are very impressive, especially for Early access. There's lens flares, realistic lighting, tons of graphical settings (such a very high FoV of 30-110!) There are resolutions higher than 1920x1090, which I have not seen a lot of in games. The maxinum View distance is very amazing, even on the '10000'  of '20000' setting, I can see way further than I would even need too. I have a load of fps even on the higher settings, which I would not have of though since the game is this beautiful. Heck, you can even choose between pixely or realistic looks! So tihs is highly rated for this catergory, and it's well earned.\n\nWhat StarMade has to offer\nExplore, build, trade with others, buy from others, colonize planets, make factions, play with others, command a fleet, become a god, create a money factory, mine asteroids, blow up planets, and so much more.\n\nPros and Cons\nPros:\nAdvanced in graphics\nExcellent use of engine features\nSo many possibilites\nTons of options\nMultiplayer\nCheap enough\n\nCons:\nMirror mode options are confusing\n\nRecommendation?\nWell, I guess it's a hard game to get the grips of, but it's for most age groups. Starmade is educational and actually very  fun. It helps teaching about space, basic star-ship building and much, much more. This is a mini Space Engineers if you will. It's a quickly developing game that has yet to see its true light of day in the Steam Store since it's one of the most hidden gems on the Store. Maybe it's due to lack of sales for Starmade, or because the developers don't want to make a game with little-to-no bugs in itself available to the whole of Steam. Anyway, Space Engineers is a very similar game with just a bit more depth. Both games are great and I will soon review SE.\n\nFinal Rating\nA clean 8.5/10 - Worth for everyone\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my reviews about games like this possible.","August 24, 2015","true","7.9"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","38","49","3","3"

I went in believing it would be some kind of Minecraft clone or waste of 10$, I almost even wanted a refund at first. Yes it IS IN ALPHA, it IS UNFINISHED but god damn, 6 hours in and there's just... So much content already.\n\nThis current version of Alpha is not worth 10$, it's worth 25$ at the  least  so much to do from making buildings and factories on planets to colonizing them or stripping them bare for resources.\n\nPirates and robbers keep it new and the game continues to amaze me. For once I can make a ship, simply put down a gravity generator and have my friend walk around and do maintenance/man the guns/repair or stargaze as I fly around. He doesn't fall out and it's not laggy. You play Space Engineers and hope for smooth riding in your friends ship as he flies but in Starmade  you can do just that\n\nBeautiful game, amazing graphics whether you want them simple or HD and all around something I will be playing for quite awhile\n\nGameplay 8/10  It is still in Alpha but a lot is already on the table, I could see space fights becoming more engaging other than that basic mechanics on and off planets is great.\n\nSound 6.7/10  Not any background music yet, it leaves a lot of atmosphere out but setting up a simple Chillstep playlist on YouTube makes it fantastic as you play.\n\nGraphics 20/10 ] If you don't like voxel based games, then you would obviously dislike the graphics here. If you  do  like blocks and cubes and such, you should love it. I play on high settings with ultra shadows and the realistic texture pack. On top of that my favorite feature is the procedural background image of the galaxy on the 4k resolution. Absolutely stunning. I can't express how amazing it is to be on a planet and seeing both sunset and the galaxy mesh together in one.\n\nCreative Level and Difficulty  This game does have a learning curve to get ahead of. At first you have no idea what the hell you are doing, it's very discouraging and hard to get through but once you have the basics, the rest will eventually catch up. The logic system (similar to Minecraft's redstone system) is very simple as with the ship building in general. You don't have to wire every bit and piece together, all you have to do is select what mother block you want your other blocks to be connected to and place them. Easy peasy. Once you get past the beginner phase a universe of oppurtunity arises at your feet.\n\n[h2] Overall in its Current State 8/10 [/h2]\n\nIt's in Alpha. So much done right in such a little time span and release version. This game has the potential to uplift the "Minecraft Genre" and be a real successor in its own dominant space setting. 100% worth your 10$ if you enjoy space crafting, exploration, blocks and planet colonization.\n\nIt's a really good game.\n\nJust get it.","January 5, 2015","true","43.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","24","26","10","1"

Devs like this are what make Early Access games worth it.\n\nAnother reason is the community. I yet to find one person that is a complete jerk. Also, people seem to make some amazing creations. I find it so entertaining when you finish building a ship that you think is so brilliant and you decide to join a server to show it off to find out someone has made a ship 50x stronger. It's just great to see all of the different ships.\n\nThese two reasons are what make me love this game better than any game in my Library. But, there are of course problems with it.\n\nThe biggest problem is the amount of players in servers. A game like this with trillions of galaxies should definately have at least 100 players a server. The problem is you're lucky to see 10 players at a time on a server. This could of course easily be fixed by people getting the game, which I really hope happens.\n\nThe idea of this game getting popular makes me overjoyed. I would love to see big faction wars between 2 major factions and a bunch of miniature allied factions assisting them. Also, a few huge mother ships sending out a bunch of fighter jets, which can actually happen. This stuff is implemented into the game, the problem is there is no people to join those factions.\n\nI would love to see this game get players. It has outstanding potential as long as these devs are able to keep working on it. But, that won't happen if the game gets thrown aside and in my eyes, that would be a tragedy.","December 15, 2015","true","30.1"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","25","28","3","2"

You build a small ship. Then build a bigger ship. then maybe build a space station for all your ships. Definitley better with friends, but is fun in singleplayer as well.\n\nOf course this is still in alpha and it does have tons of bugs and crashes sometimes.

The logic and rail updates only adds more to this, being able to add a bit of life to them.\nThe main problem I feel, however is just how lonely it feels in survival.

I like a few things in specific: Strategy, Sandbox, sci-fi, Factions, and community. I tried Eve Online, but the subscription ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. I tried Minecraft, but it was too basic. I tried Starbound, but it's only 2d and doesn't have depth. THIS fits all the rules. You start as a character with essential supplies and you just need to survive. Single Player can be boring, but the multiplayer servers make this game live up to its potential. Make alliances, kill space pirates, build ships, watch them get wrecked, build better ships, wreck the ships that wrecked yours, and explore in an almost (if not) infinite universe. And about worrying about people taking your precious supplies or looting your corpse? Don't worry, When you die you keep your inventory, and in a faction you can choose one planet/space station where NOBODY can steal your stuff.

So first, yes I know this is an early access title, but the tutorial kinda' sucks to me. I was still clueless on what to do afterwards, but perhaps maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, idk. The game feels a bit empty with nothing to do, but I wasn't expecting much considering it's an early access title. The reason I've been playing so long was simply out of sheer excitement to keep building onto my ship, and even try to make a little mech or something haha (it's extremely time consuming). It's strangely addicting.\n\nIt's a sandbox space sim where you start off with nothing but a few things in your inventory. You have a ship core, you hit the X key to create a new ship, name it, and then you build onto it with parts, etc. To make stuff you need to mine of course, so you go out in space and find asteroids or planets and mine them. After you mine and get resources, you need to make factories in order to make stuff with what you mined. Pretty simple, like most crafting games. You can build ships, bases, create factions, you can claim solar systems and make them your faction territory, you can go and fight pirates and destroy their bases. But thats really all there is to it (or at least from what I've seen). With that being said, I think this game was aimed more at multiplayer.\n\nIt's not a bad game, just wish it didn't take me 100 years to figure out what to do when I first started playing. And also, the pirate stations seem to be there to troll you, as you cannot mine them after you take them out, instead you have to pay an exorbitant amount of money to repair them (15mil), which is really silly to me and kinda defeats the purpose. Idk why the devs did that. Without the help of guides and YouTube videos, i'd be lost and wouldn't have played as long as I did.

I've played it for the past year or so and have watched it grow up so quickly. The developers really put a lot of effort into this game. One thing I wanted to clarify. This is NOT minecraft PLUS space. This is minecraft IN space. Don't expect the typical tools you would find in minecraft. The whole idea for this game is to build spaceships and live in space. Currently living on the ground is quite rudamentary. I'm pretty sure that there are plans to improve the ground aspect, but at the time of this review these features are quite non existent.\n\nYes there are warp gates\nYes there are space stations\nYes there are warp drives\nYes you can have multiple people command one ship\n\nThis game is really fanstastic.

I swear I just got this...\n\nI've been following Starmade since early early times and have much more playtime from a previous version (before steam) and then life happened and I stopped playing it for awhile.\n\nThe more "recent" updates wrecked most of my previous knowledge of this game and I had to start learning anew, thank goodness this game is really great so I don't mind at all.\n\nYes, this game is early access so alot of what you see is going to change and is changing with every update. BUT.. the devs are like the coolest people ever. Why? Well, they don't believe you should be paying for an early access game while bugs are still being worked out and the whole game itself is changing. They realize this is an unfinished product and being so have put the game up for $11, ONLY if you want to support them and what they're doing. This is totally optional because they've put the exact version as a demo for free so you can play it first and see if they are worth supporting.\n\n~I do support the devs and what they are doing so I did buy it. Even though it is early access its great~\n\n+ Multiplayer Servers\n+ Paid players and demo players CAN play together on MP servers\n+ ALOT of content, like I can't even start to say how complex this game can get...\n+ I think I'm addicted to it... I put 5 hours on it last night alone...\n+ The devs are realistic people, not trying to steal your organs for an unfinished game.\n+ If you hate people you can single player this bad boy and even admin command yourself to creative play!\n\n-/+ Alot is changing and going to change, what you see now will probably not be the same(similiar in the next update) therefore your knowledge and playtime can become obsolete, but hey! More content ^_^\n-/+ Making money only takes forever until you can spend a few million to build a proper salvager. On the other hand this is stopping new players from building capital ships in an hour. Pretty balanced (sort of) economy\n\n- Pirates are ♥♥♥♥♥\n- Trading Guild sucks at restocking shops\n- I think I'm addicted to it...\n\nI think thats it, at least for this current update.

I was here before that, and so we fans waited 1 1/2 years for this game. It came. We bought it. Like alpha but better. Appearently people are having trouble with NVidia cards. No problem with my Saphire Radeon R9 270 card. We have factories, lazers, a "sniper rifle. (which is really a different colored pistol) One game very close to this is Minecraft quite obviously. But it is almost the opposite of Minecraft but still in the same world. Try to imagine the Galactic Craft mod as it's own standalone game. But, much much much much MUCH more. I would highly reccomend if you like designing space ships, fighting with space ships, exploring space (tons of that!), And, blowing up planets with OP massive cannons that crash the game and server :D. (like TNT mountains in Minecraft) A must have for only $10. The building has almost no limits, as this game is being constantly updated.\n\nPros:\nBuilding infinite space ships.\nBlowing up anything you can. Even shops, just watch out for dem' space-cops!\nFighting other space ships then, 1: taking them as your own 2: salvaging them\nKilling peeps with lasers and "snipers"\nExploring and mining planets with that salvage laser on your space-craft.\nThen, Blow them up!\n"Reck Sum Nubs"\nThere's a crafting system, but very different compared to Minecraft.\nHey look a shop.

They're an ambitious bunch and they work hard to put out a consistent stream of updates WITHOUT leaving the game riddled with bugs and breaking save files.\n\nUpdate:\nI've seen a lot of reviews complaining about lack of content.\n\nFirst, think of Starmade more of a Minecraft in space at this current stage in development.  The universe IS empty.  And at this very moment, the Dev's are holding a ship building contest to add 2 more factions and a larger variety of ships to the universe.  Until you build it or join a server, your world will be just as empty as Minecraft's world.  But what you CAN build...is freaking gorgeous.\n\nSecond, updates.  Like I said, when they do update, they do it right.  Without game breaking bugs, without ruining save files.  Do I want to see more updates?  Of course I do!  But everything I have seen since I've purchased the game, I am happy and excited for.  Their last update, FLEETS, made me drool on my keyboard.

Yes, there’s no way around it, this is essentially Minecraft in space.\n\nIt’s not long been released on Steam Early Access where you can purchase it for $9.99 on Windows, Mac, and Linux. But it has been playable in its early stages before Early Access for quite a while. It’s actually been in the making since 2010.\n\nIn StarMade, you can build your own spaceship block-by-block, customizing it with weapons fit to take on space pirates – you’ll need them. Once satisfied, you can then get into your spaceship in order to explore distant stars and galaxies.\n\nYou’ll come across more than pirates too, as there are abandoned space stations to pick from, and the treasures you find inside can be traded to make a fortune. Or, you can use the materials to make your own space station, or a factory, all in order to make huge quantities of sellable items for a profit.\n\nIn multiplayer you’ll be able to find other factions, which you can join or fight against, and I’m sure you’ll be glad to hear that StarMade has dedicated servers.\n\nThe idea behind StarMade is to provide you an infinite space to make your own way within. As in Minecraft, you do as you please, exploring the various possibilities of the game’s intricate sandbox design.\n\nAbstract:\n\n??/?? (Awaiting Full-Release)\n\nRecommended for it's current state at $9.99, there is enough content to keep you occupied for hours. I played this game before I purchased it on Steam, so I knew what I was getting into.","January 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","19","23","2","0"

You build your own ships, space stations and planetary facilities.  You even get to build custom turrets and thanks to the linking system your weapons are custom designs too.  The master builders and community in general have released tons of highly detailed massive ships and space stations for you to use if you want to as well.  You can destroy planets and go to war with other player factions in multiplayer for people that enjoy PvPing.  If you prefer to explore you'll never run out of new places to go with over 9 quadrillion galaxies.  I've only fully explored 3 galaxies in a server before.  Each galaxy is just massive and full of pirates, planets, asteroids, trade stations, shop stations, and derelict stations/ships (as of now, soon to be even more to explore) so it's easy to get sidetracked.\n\nThe Devs for this game are very involved with the community.  If you think you have a good idea for the game you can submit it on their forums and they'll actually take a look at it and implement it if the community supports/likes the idea.  They also have a road map (google Starmade Roadmap Trello) so you'll have an idea of what to expect for major updates.  They do graphical updates as well and quite frequently update textures into high res textures.\n\nI've been playing this game since the rail update.  I just recently started logging hours through steam though.\n\nDon't be discouraged by any of the negative reviews as most of them are people with technical problems that never sought out Starmade's support team.  The singleplayer version of this game is free to download so try before you buy.","February 1","true","85.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","2"

You can play the game as a astronaut in a nearly endless universe, salvage asteroids, ships, stations and planets and use the resources you get to make blocks with factories.

They have creative mode. They have slabs like in minecraft. They have teleporters (still being worked on but are useable). Missiles aren't the most powerful weapon in the game.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games, but I know some people who don't like it very much. It is still in early access, so if you are looking for a polished, complete game, go away.\n\nNow for a discription. You can do almost anything you can think of in this game. It comes with lots of colors (pink and teal hull now!), weapons and details. And pirates to blow up. The developers have large plans and continue to make it better every two weeks! If you want a space sandbox where you can build the spaceship of your dreams, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a survival based game, I wouldn't buy it right away, because it is more of a sandbox than a survival. It does however have really good physics. Explosions are realistic and obviously thrusters were re-done. The weapons are also getting more balanced so missiles aren't OP and you can 1-shot anything. Even if they weren't they redid ship health so its more of breaking essential parts than blasting at a core. Basically this game has loads of content, but not around all areas like crew.\n\nPlease don't compare this to space engineers This isn't really aimed to compete with them. This is more of a building - fighting fantasy game than... survival? I have only seen the trailers for space engineers but it looks more realistic than fantasy-ic. It still looks good though, I'm not saying its bad. This game is just more of a build anything game. So FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN: space engineers = survival, so get that if you want to survive in space, and starmade (from what I have played) = build a functional dream ship and blast pirates, so get this if you want to... do what I just sayed.\n\nSHORT(ISH) DESCRIPTION\nNow if you are a guy looking for a short description if the game (like me), here is what I can come up with: A block-based building game where you can build the ship of your dreams that actually functions and blast pirates with it. If you are wondering about multiplayer: Team up with friends and fight to the death in a battle of empires... or if your just playing with friends troll around with pirates and have fun laughing at the sad trading guild ships... until they use start using your blueprints...\n\nSo that is really all I have to say. Don't underestimate what this game is aimed to be. Just look at the dev. plans somewhere. Or just the game itself. It isn't as bad as really old reviews say. I hope you think this is good if you buy it. Schine is really serious about its quality and brings constant updates (if 2 every  weeks is constant for you).\n\n10/10 would explode pirate stations again. Oh wait i can...

If you are smart enough, you will be able to go anywhere and enjoy the huge number of planets, asteroids and stations you can find (nearly infinite).\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY:\n\nShip and stations designs are easy. By pressing Space after entering a Ship core, you can launch building mode.\nThe Ship core it some kind of box where the player can enter and control the ship.\nIt's a strange way to use vehicles but the designer is enough well made to compensate this strange design.\n\nLike in Minecraft you use blocks, you place them with left click and delete with right click (you have tons of other contols by pressing left ctrl).\nFor every ships, you have to plan it's energy usage and mass.\nThe bigger the more expensive it will be for you: like the cloak wich needs more energy depending of the size  of the ship. The interresting aspect of this mode is the way you use weapons and tools.\nEvery items needs a computer to be used. You put an appropriate computer and the weapon or tool block related, and you conect them. The funny thing is that you can mix weapons and some upgrade blocks to change their effects, like EMP or Shield Drain, ect...\nYou can even place turret docking blocks with AI blocks to create an automated sentry capable to fire anything you want from missiles to beams.\nFor tools you have less possibilities but you can put more blocks and computers to create massive Salvage beams (some kind of mining laser) or even create you own Antenna relay to scan your sector and spot anything that moves.\nYou can even hold personnal weapons or tools (you have a basic mining laser) but you can't upgrade it much, like for the ships.\n\n\nYou can also place a building block on a planet or a location you own ( with a faction block), to customize it.\nFrom the plants to the soils, being able to change a planet so quickly is excellent and gives you plenty ways to create.\nBut you can't harvest materials by this way, you have to clear a path with the editor and go mining yourself.\n\nAbout crafting, it's not a good aspect of the game. Because you have too much materials and it becomes quickly too complicate to build nice recipes (bad crafting menus when you use crafting stations). In fact you will spare tons of time by harvesting raw materials and selling them to the Galatic Traders. These guys are the owners of the "space cotton buds" They are neutral npc that sells all blocks you can imagine and they buy everything you can bring !\n\nWhen you got the way to gather quickly, you get quite a lot of credits (the actual currency in the game).\n\n\nBut space is a dangerous place...\nPlayers can be hostiles, you will notice that with a nice Faction system. By yourself you can create a faction, claim locations in its name and even conquer other players properties. Before doing that you need faction points with the help of other faction members and enough fights against enemy factions. This system is really good and surprises by it's quality for an early acess game.\nBut your not alone because some pirates are roaming...\nThey hide in somes big space stations with heavy turrets that does quite a lot of damage.\nBut if you can manage to enter them... you will get tons of items !\nBe ware pirates are fliying in fast ships and dying is quite normal when you begin.\n\nDon't forget to buy enough stuff to build few basic ships when you first spawn.\nAnd find a nice planet to land.\n\n\nAt this moment you will have time to study the blocks, the ways you have to earn money and CONQUER THE UNIVERS !\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\n\nStarmade is a real surprise. Quite impressive and cheap (the price will change), the gameplay it offers is amazing for an early acess.\nOk i have to admit the game is rough around the edges: need some balance about the trade and crafting system. The tutorial wich is empty especially in front of game mechanics such as Factions or Logics. The physic for ship flights needs to be better because it's like driving in a "soapbox" or the punch of weapons wich are a bit weak especially on foot. Physic on blocks would be cool, like on some planets where lava "floats" in the airs.\nBut the overall quality is really good for this kind of game, the developpers are even planing to add creatures (actually there is one alien spider you can see in the tutorial). And seriously, being able to build so much crazy things with turrets, landing zones, weapons, antenna and even warp gates...\nit's amazing !\n\n\n\nN.B: The game is quite stable, even if i had to play it on an old computer.\nYou can also play alone on a dedicated server and set the difficulty of the AI.

I advice you not to, since maintenance on your spacecraft is going to leave you wondering if it wouldnt be just as much work just rebuilding it from a blueprint.\n\nIn that regard if a mode would be included that would be a bit more focussed on PvE instead of just gathering and building, this game might just be the first of some to finally bridge that particular gap. And I for one would love this game  in a mode where a team rushes to build a fleet to wage war on the AI and than tries to maintain that empire, not its ships.","April 24, 2015","true","7.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

My first impression was horrible. But I'm glad I persevered.\n\nAs for the long text review: there's a summary in the end.\n\nAlso if you don't like text and prefer a video over text, have a glance at how powerful the game is and just how much cool stuff and creativity you can have with it in this example.\n\nIntro\nI got it as part of a bundle some time ago and decided to give it a try. The launcher was not the best experience. When I finally got in-game, the tutorial was broken. As if this was not annoying enough, without a tutorial I was *completely* lost and had no idea what to do. Oh, and the sound was bugged. It took me quite a while to find how to fix it. Then the performance was horrible and again it took me a while to find how to fix it (increase allocated memory, get Java 64x). So I ditched Starmade and was glad I did.\n\nBy the way: The tutorial was quickly fixed, and a new launcher is underway. This sums up quite nicely one of the positives of this game: The devs. They're active, they're quick, they're good. But most of all, they are just part of the community. I started watching a few tutorial videos and whatnot on youtube and only after I had watched quite a few I realized at least two of the youtubers were actually devs. They're so helpful and chill it's unbelievable.\n\nAfter watching online some of the stuff people were doing with the game and how so many love it I decided to give it another go -- now with the knowledge of where to find solutions to the problems I'd certainly encounter: Youtube, and to some extent the forums. Oh and I'm so glad I didn't give up.\n\nMain\nThen onto something that might be a pro or a con, depending what you're looking for: This game is whatever you make of it. So if you're looking to hop into space and find everything done and ready... keep looking. Here you start with pretty much nothing, in the middle of the vast space and next to a shop. Go from there, good luck. It's up to you what you want to build or do. Where you want to go. With whom you want to ally and play. And so on.\n\nThe big pro is that the limit is just your creativity. The possibilities are vast. If you like being creative, inventive, ingenious, and if you like to build not only your own game but a whole universe (ok, a whole "stronghold" in universe) -- then this is for you.\n\nThe cons stay pretty much on the realm of the interface. The interface can be pretty powerful but many many aspects are really non-intuitive. Also the launcher is really barebones (thankfully a new one coming). The tutorial is also quite lackluster, so there's no other way: To learn tricks and all the power the interface has you have to dedicate some time to watch tutorials and whatnot. Thankfully there's plenty of good ones so no excuses there.\n\nBugs exist, as well as some balance issues and whatnot. But it's a game in alpha so they are quite ok. And I know nowadays it's a bit old to put a half-arsed game out there and call it alpha as an excuse to have produced a crap game. But this is not the case with these guys: They're hard at work, and updates and content are being churned out quickly. All that with lots of transparency and community input. Just a couple of days ago I was in a Q&A session with them (and I'm a nobody!) that lasted some 3 hours, in which the replied to a ton of questions and played/had fun with the community. Thumbs up!\n\nSo to sum it up\nPros:\nVast, both in terms of "map size" (pretty much infinite) and in terms of possibility;\nBe creative, build your own world, your own ships, and do it your own way;\nVery active, supportive, friendly and helpful devs;\nAn active community with lots of tutorials, general help, and content to download (like ships, stations, skins, etc.).\nCons (bit hard to think of that many but I'll try so don't blame me for being a bit unfair):\nInterface is powerful but somewhat bareboned and rather un-intuitive at times;\nThat includes the launcher and many "hidden" options that will give you a better experience;\nBugs. Yeah it's alpha, yeah they're to be expected, but they're there;\nAmong them I'm mostly bothered by the sound. Or lack thereof. It often bugs out and goes nearly silent;\nThe mp can be a bit spread thin, with many servers having just but a few people logged in each;\nBalance can be a problem, and more veteran players have a huge upper hand upon novices;\nYou can bypass the last one by playing single player for a while, or by playing on a strictly PvE server. But doesn't that spoil the whole point of the game? Maybe. It's your choice.\nThere's not all that much "environment" as of yet (although devs say much will be added). So at this point the universe feels a bit empty and plain until people (and mostly you) start to actually build stuff.\nConclusion\nIt's hard to give a note. On the one hand if you're expecting a somewhat "polished", "arrive-and-play" type of experience, you'll be greatly disappointed. On the other hand, if you're into being creative and being responsive for the creation of your own experience, then this can easily be an 8/10 -- with the potential to go at least up to a 9 once a few things like the sounds are sorted.\n\nI highly recommend it, if it's the kind of experience you're looking for and you are prepared to what's involved in grabbing it yourself.\n\nps: And as time passes the game only gets better with frequent updates. The ideas the devs still have "in the oven" make me very excited for the future of this title.","December 18, 2015","true","171.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","1"

The developers have done something that hasn't been done for a long time - actually let players try the game without hassles or schemes. Becuase of this, i was able to discover that StarMade is what i've been looking for in a space game for a long long time. I highly reccomended that anyone who loves Space Engineers or Minecraft give this a try, becuase this really is a great game. It's not the same, but it has some similiarities. In this game, problems are solved with blocks, and i think thats something to appreciate.\n\nThis game is best played in a Multipalyer setting, however i DO reccomended that you play single player for your first 20 hours to make sure youre ready for a PvP setting. There are lots of little things that i had to discover the hard way, and while it was fun, some might not be as interested in tough love as i am.\n\nI really hope this game takes off.

For the features that are in they are fairly well implemented as well as a whole, there are more features in so far then some games have at full release. Gameplay and look is similar to how games like Minecraft and similar 3d open world sandbox games where you make your own story. It is obviously in space, even though you can go onto planets.\n\nThe game at this moment is capable to being modded, with its Block Editor(which allows you to make/modify new or existing blocks). The server config which is also the configs for single player is fairly customizable, with the ability to toggle/change settings that are normally reserved for mods in other games.\n\nShips are dynamic in that they are all different based on what you built them with and what types of moduals you placed in them. Also the fact that you can mix and match compatible moduals together to create a new type of weapon or utility tool. The most common example is that by default a salvage(aka mining) modual will just do a burst beam, but if you connect the salvage computer to a cannon computer with just the right ratio of moduals you can get a constant steady beam for the salvage modual and mine/eat things to your heart's content.\n\nBuilding is fairly straight forward for its most used functions, as well as for those who want more tools, there are more precise tools and options. Gameplay is very much like other games of it's genres. As a side effect though, with this game's many options and complexity, there will obviously be a learning curve. Where the player will need to learn how to setup the blocks and moduals, as some have their own placement rules. Thankfully there are many tutorials and Lets Play videos out there so learning will not be too difficult.\n\nIn all I recommend this game to anyone who likes; space games + open world sandbox games + lots of options, for its $9.99 USD price at this moment. As well as the developers currently have the full game for free as long as it's in early access. I bought it though, because it's pure awesome in my opinion, and I'll gladly pay the $10 for the game as well as the fact that buying the game helps to continue it's developement.","November 16, 2015","true","408.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

I understand this is an "Early Acess" game and far more will come in the future.\n\nBesides all of that, I do personally really enjoy this game and what it has to offer currently.

The blueprint system is also tedious, requiring you to add every single material one by one. The "buy-to-spawn" mechanic is now gone on any public server I can find, requiring the construction  of ships block by block or with the annoying blueprint system.

It's essentially minecraft in space with a good dose of space sim play like that in Elite and Eve online.\n\nIt does have however it's caveats;\nThe tutorials are clunky to the extent it's easy to miss key components, and the ship management needs to be drastically simplified. Such as connecting weapons to computers should for the novice user, be automatic and not manually mapped and so forth.\n\nIt has a ton of bugs, yes I know it's early access I get that. But I understand this games been around for awhile prior to being released here on Steam. So you would think something as simple as sound would be a priority. I've ran this on two systems with it either silent or randomly loud repetitive fx's.\n\nIf you build a ship, fly off then start the tutorial, forget about your ship. On return spawn you are back at the beginning with your ship lost in space. And without a core to build another ship your essentially screwed and have to wipe the universe and start again.\nHopefully the above bugs get sorted out in further builds.\n\nYou would think with the bugs and clunky ship building I wouldn't recommend this game. For early adopters who want to see this game develop, bugs and all, I would say go for it. And I'm keen to see where this goes.\nFor those who expect the concept being sold here is what you'll get, taking into consideration that yes this is an early access game, then I ask you save your coin and come back later.","December 8, 2014","true","2.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I totally give the Devs a salute for their love for this game. They are a small team so at times when personal stuff comes up you do notice a slow down but the care and love is there, If you are like me and tired of developers that just want your money and you wonder if one day the game will just be dead then have no worries about the Schine team. As far as gameplay goes It's kind of boring playing by yourself but so is Minecraft. The build tools are amazing and make up for that plenty as you can see from my hours played. You have 5 basic shapes of blocks which I think does make for a more Minecraft feel even though they could do more variety with the second gen voxel system the game uses. I'd like to see more but i can respect if it is to keep the blocky feel of the game. They do alot on making multiplayer very viable and there has been a lot of focus there.  It's private servers like Minecraft but there are public websites and people who run them that let anyone in like minecraft if you want a bigger server to play on. Google it and you will get a good list. So I say give this game a try if you want Minecraft in space and to take what you build into battle. The Schine team has accomplished a lot since I bought this as far as adding quailty into the game and it's gameplay. Plus they are always working on something so you can expect more from these guys.  This game is worth the price and you will not regret it in my opinion.","March 17","true","860.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

I was scrolling through games and stumbled across this game. Quite frankly i thought that this was just going to be another of the thousands of over-glorified Minecraft clone set in the future blah blah blah. But i got it anyways because some of the clones are pretty good... and it was only $10\n\nI am glad i did.\n\nYou will start out on a small space station "shop" with some basic components that will allow you to build a tiny, but functional, ship (and yes, you CAN build your own spaceships block-by-block) as well as a weak gun and enough money to get you places. At this point you can start heading to smaller asteroids and even planets (Planets are VERY laggy) and start mining new materials to ether refine, use raw, or sell for cash for better parts. But it is not all easy, you will be attacked at times and you will need to defend your turf.\n\nNow for some cons:\nThe MAIN issue i have with the game is LAG! LLAAGG! for the most part the game runs smother then a hot-sword-through-butter, even on some not so good computers. But when you enter planets, or even some space stations, you can encounter MASSIVE lag spikes, some even freezing the game. I HAVE been able to solve this by editing the "server settings" to make the planets smaller and that solved most issues. but it is defiantly an issue that must be resolved before it goes into final\n\nIn the end:\nI give it a 9/10. it has great game dynamics, a good building system, and overall fun gameplay, with the only major issue that need attention being the "Planetary Lag", but the game is worth every penny","August 5, 2015","true","8.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

From what i understand this game has been out for years and hasnt really progressed. The community has been waiting over a month since the last update for bug fixes that are killing gameplay.\n\nWhile indeed the game is fun it is not particularly stable. Servers are a whole other story entirely. Server support seems minimal or just poorly done, either or.\n\nThis game is only fun with other people, there is no real single benefit apart from unlimited blocks, but even then that kind of kills the point in my opinion. I would stay away from Single player and join a multiplayer server but that obviously brings you to encounter the above.\n\nWhat devs dont seem to realise nowadays is people would prefer a stable game over faster released additional content. People are ditching this game for purely this reason. Its like trying to put together a new desk while standing on your head..overall you're creating more problems for yourself in the long run.\n\nWhen it comes down to it I paid the money for this game so i'm going to stick with and hope for the best. I do enjoy the game and have played a lot of hours but everything above causes so much frustration.\n\nI do of course understand this game is still in Alpha but if given the choice im not sure I would purchase this again.\n\nSummary ~ Great concept, shoddy execution.","August 2, 2015","false","551.9"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","3"

So, if you are one of those people - pass on this for now.\n\nFor others, I'll state that while you can build some ships and travel through space, flying through space is very slow and as others have noted, there isn't really much to do - you can mine stuff and you can salvage stuff - oh, and you can sell stuff to the shop in order to buy stuff.  There's stuff, stuff and pirate stations...\n\nDespite the lack of other stuff, the game shows potential.  I really like the build aspect for the spaceships as it allows for lots of customization, but flying the ship isn't that great because of the overall control scheme - switching between flying and building shouldn't be so easy that you do it by accident and end up exiting and losing the ship in deep space.\n\nI didn't play this game before it came to Steam, so don't know how the planets were before, but the current design is...interesting.  They have a good size to them and I actually like the multi-faceted appearance, but travelling from one face of the planet to another is kind of weird (in both a good and bad way).  One thing I don't like so far is that there doesn't appear to be liquids - lava is simply a glowing non-flowing block - dig one out from under another and the hole remains with the other lava block just "floating" over it.\n\nAnother thing I feel needs to be improved - space stations.  I know they pushed an update that changed the mix of abandoned versus pirate stations, but considering how long it takes to fly anywhere, it is still a pain to travel a long distance only to see you're being shot at by a pirate station or that the station is degraded, thus only good for scrap - and you'll need more than scrap if you want to upgrade your engines in order to fly faster.\n\nTo summarize - unless you simply wish to support the dev and/or really like space games/sims, I'd wait until more of the features are added to the game.  At that time I'll revisit this review and hopefully change that "no" to a "yes!"","December 22, 2014","false","4.6"," 162 of 292 people (55%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","55","162","292","14","32"

And I was in-love with it, you could build anything you wanted in space. Be an asteroid miner, be a fighter, cruiser, dreadnaught, anything. And with multiplayer, the RP scene is pretty big. I recommend this game for anyone who likes games like space engineers (It's like that but not as complicated or taxing on your pc), or people who enjoy minecraft, and anyone who likes space.\n\nThe planets: When I bought the game they used to be flat round discs, now they're multi-sided (3d-octogonal?) You can land on them, get out of your ship, and explore them.\n\nThe pirates: There are npc pirates in this game. They're fairly difficult at first, but once you get a semi-decent ship they're easy. You can set them to use your own ship designs if they become waay too easy.\n\nStations: There are two types of stations in the game. Pirate stations, and Abandoned stations. The pirate stations have turrets and spawn pirates, these have loot that can earn you a LOT of money (Very dangerous with custom ships). Abandoned stations, they're just abandoned, they used to be completely empty, but now they spawn npc drones that attack you (Like a defense system).

Its more like EvE then minecraft. Better crafting the Minecraft. I can not stress how cheap this is for $10 bucks. Still in alpha and is already better then EvE Online. Let me say that again........ ITS BETTER THEN EvE Online! Let that sink in.\n\nThe crafting system allows you to create anything you can imagine and its very well balanced. For instance you can make any ship currently in EvE, and if you don't like there design you can tweak it to your hearts content. The primary gameplay focuses on taking and hoding sectors of space. Your faction claims them and then gains faction points based on how much they currently control. You can make turrets, drones, titans, all with AI control so you can gurad your systems while offline.\n\nYou can create space stations, and colonize planets. You can board and hijack ships and stations. The game is simple to understand and learn, but would take a lifetime to master every intricicy. Bigger is not better in all cases. A small covert ops ship can decimate and unpreppared titan. I could literally talk about htis game and compare it to EvE and Minecraft for weeks. But I would rather play it and leave others to make there own choice. I still have an EvE account and activlely play, but there has been more station spinning and Que rolling since this game come out on steam. Its free to try, demo is the full game and you can join a server to see what its like. Its hard in the begining but some basic understanding of EvE will help you adapt quickly. It is more of an RTS then anything else, gameplay wise.\n\n-The best way to play is online with other people. There is no feeling like flying around exploring.\n-Finding a huge base, some sick player created ships, and then realizing none of them have faction modules.... So its all yours for the taking.\n-Creating turrets to protect your bases and watching someone warp in on top of it and immediatly exploding.\n-Creating a large troop of Drones, and releasing them a couple of sectors away from someones base.\n-Blowing up someones planet as they beg you to stop.\n-Camping someones homebase while offline... with your turret monster.\n\nIt just Keeps getting better as I play. At first you are trying to figure otu the mechanics of all the blcoks and how to accomplish what you want to to do. But as I go along I am coming up with really complex ideas and then, overtime testing them.\nMagnetic mines, Shotgun turrets and stop effect Lasers, oh my.\n\nYou are sleeping on the next great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabidbat/recommended/244770/","rabidbat","Rabid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabidbat/","335 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a tough one for me, I'd not recommend it to casual gamers yet, but do so for those who are more technically inclined and enjoy being part of a games development cycle.\n\nBuy this game if you like arcadey SpaceSims and building ships and are prepared to deal with lots of bugs and a long and slow development cycle.\nDespite it's Minecraft like roots this is not Minecraft, do not expect "Minecraft in Space" or that if you can run Minecraft you can run this game, it is pretty resource hungry and begs for a decent gaming PC.\nDo buy if you like tweaking things and have a good understanding of PC's. You'll need it to get the most out of the game.\n\nThis game is the very definition of Early Access despit it's 3+ years of development. You are buying to play test it and report bugs, to help the development. If you are expecting a complete and optimised game look elsewhere.\n\nDo not buy this game if you own a Intel HD GPU, have low memory or just a basic desktop or laptop. You'll just end up playing at 5fps and crashing everytime you see a 1km long ship. Also avoid if you expect a fully functioning game anytime in the forseeable future and are easily frustrated and have little to no technical knowledge with computers and are not willing to learn\n\nPros:\nMassive Universe. Too many galaxies than you'll ever hope to explore.\n\nDecent and customisable Mechanics. Want newtonian physics? Turn them on. Don't like them? Turn them off. Most of the game can be customised via config files. Planet sizes, sector distances, ships speed, and more can be set to your liking.\n\nYou can build virtually anything you can think of. From a tiny X-Wing fighter to a 1:1 scale 1.7km Battlestar. Despite it's blocky voxel nature you can create some really detailed ships and stations only limited by your imagination and PC's hardware specs.\n\nFun PVP. Active servers and community, you can always find a server with people on it. Player battles can be fun and (now) drawn out affairs when ships are evenly matched,\n\nGreat for Roleplayers.\n\nGreat deal of content to work with and weapon/system variety. You'll always be finding new things to experiment with.\nCan that weapon maybe be used as an engine? Players are always coming up with new ways to use items.\n\nPersistant Universe done right. Dock your ship at your home station and log off. It's safe, unattackable and will be there in the morning unlike other games even though other players can still visit it. No frustration of days, weeks or months of work going down the toilet in 5 minutes to some a-hole griefer like you experience in games like Rust and ARK.\nStill while invulnerable there is a mechanic of faction points, allow your points to get too low and you eventually can be attacked at your home base.\n\nMakes you become part of the PC Master Race for real. No seriously, you will need to make your PC beast and up your PC gaming hardware and techical knowledge. No more 'I haz PC, so I iz Master Race' because you own a 13 inch Intel HD notebook with Windows, You are really gonna need to be Master Race material. XD\n\nCan for now play the full game free. But hey it's $10, don't be a tight ♥♥♥ and support the devs. If you try it for free and like it, BUY IT.\n\nAnd no doubt a bunch of other stuff I cannot think of right now.\n\nNow sadly onto the.....\nCons:\n\nUses Java.\n\nGame is Alpha, bugs and stability issues a plenty.\n\nBeefy system requirements. Forget where it says this game is scalable and designed to run on older computers. You'll be wanting powerful modern hardware to run a server or even play single player with a decent frame rate. 4GB of memory, 1 GB dedicated GPU or better a must. 64 Bit OS and Java, 8GB memory recommended. Even then large ships, stations and planets all at once will make your computer and probably you cry.\n\nRequires know how. The game defaults to very low memory, you'll need to know how to increase it, you'll need to know how to force your Java on your laptop to use it's AMD or nVidia GPU instead of the Intel HD crap it defaults to.\nYou'll need to know how to tweak game settings. If gaming for you is turning on a box, inserting a game and little else, you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nConfusing interface. Options on the two different launch screens and options in game. They can all differ. What is available in game may not be available on the launch screen and vice versa. Some features may not make sense to you or may be ones you've not encountered before. e.g draw distance here works different to most games.\n\nGreat for Rolepay. yeah, because there is no gameplay as such outside of building and mining. You have to make your own fun. Don't expect quests or epic battles with AI. AI pirates and trade guild are fixed one patch and broken the next.\n\nSpeaking of which, patches, often they fix one thing while breaking another 2 or 3 things, and often you'll have to wait for the next patch (often months) for the issue to be fixed, just to find out it is actually broken more. No idea what the play testers on the test server are doing. It's clearly not play testing when things like the broken AI gets through to a release after just being fixed the previous patch. Hot fixes for such game breaking problems are extremely rare.\n\nMassive Universe, which will often feel more dead than alive due to lack of anything to do other than build and mine. Only life is the odd station with respawning space spiders.\n\nPVP: If you hate PVP and prefer PVE, you might hate this game, with nothing to really fight or kill at the moment other players will come looking for fun. Which will be seeing how fast they can blow up and loot your ship.\n\nSingle player spam and lag: Be prepared to see a "Server is under heavy load contact a server admin" message in a big red box every 2 seconds even if your game is running fine. Experience random lag for no obvious reason even on a decent machine.\n\nDiscriminates and punishes Left Handers. Yep that is right, if you're left handed like myself and rebind the WASD setup common to games these days to the Numpad as many of us lefties do, you'll find your controls conflict with building debug keys that are also bound to the Numpad and cannot be changed right now. Go into build mode on a entity with no systems press 8 (e.g forward) and POW your game crashes. Left handers be warned. :p (only affects build mode, regular play is fine.) Devs have no intention of fixing this yet.\n\nStupid and uneccesary updates: Pirates broken? It's okay here's a patch that changes a perfectly fine block texture or renames an ore.........\nWho cares about the gameplay, we need to give the 2D artist something to do....... O_o\n\nUsual game forums based bad decisions. Space whales? let's add them to the game, because some forum junkies like the idea, forget the other million people actually playing the game who have no idea space whales are actually a thing being considered and feel they're completely stupid. Schine ignores the majority of players actually playing just like a real AAA studio. :p\nSeriously how about updates on the launcher or voting option so all are aware of what is happening? If we can have a "email bug to devs button" surely a "vote on stupid decisions button" would not be hard?\n\nAnd no doubt a bunch of other stuff I cannot think of right now.\n\nSummary:\nStarMade is a great game with a lot of potential and fun to play with friends if you're willing to make your own fun. Sadly though it often goes 1 step back for every step forward it makes.\nIf you're patient and a space game fan who knows what is inside his/her PC and how tech works, and have a full understanding of what Early Access is and how it works I recommend you try and buy itt.\n\nIf you're 12, love minecraft, think a 500 ping is great, love space whales, have no idea what a CPU or a GPU is, and expect Early Access games to be complete within a month of release, then please go away and stick to Wii U or Xbox.","October 15, 2015","true","425.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","4"

There are plenty of customization options. The weapons system is probably one of the most interesting that I have seen as well as the power systems.\n\nThe best part is that everything is MASSIVE. There is no end to it. There are pirates with suitable rewards for pve, entire planets to mine away, stars that will burn you if you get too close and traders who will sell just about anything. There is a strange mix of realism with fake rules that works really well with one another.\n\nThe building system is easy to pick up, with more depth the deeper you go. The crafting systems could use some work, but the anaysis of systems is beautifully done. With regular updates and great support, I can see this game going VERY far.\n\nAlso, do not call this Minecraft in space.

I have often let my emotions run amuck when I encounter a feature list as enormous and tantalizing as the one I read before I began to play this game for free.  To whet your appetite, here's a small portion of features already included in the alpha release.\n\nBuild voxel spaceships/stations/settlements of all conceivable shapes or sizes using an absolutely enormous number of blocks.\nEasy-to-use interface and building mechanics which make construction an enjoyable experience.\nFull multiplayer functionality including factions, player-created economies, and servers which can be customized and modded to create a unique experience on a server by server basis.\nA nearly endless universe containing entire galaxies and solar systems all laced with an unchartable amount of planets, asteroids, space stations, pirates, wormholes, and intrigue.\nPVP and PVE combat, fight from the helm of your capital ship, cockpit of a fighter, or on foot using a huge and customizable selection of weapon systems against an enemy faction, space pirates, and crabs\nModding support.\nImmensely detailed crafting system.\nA full set of explorable, player created content and a community which constantly puts out a huge number of original masterpieces and recreations, from TIE Fighters to the UNSC Infinity.\nA development team which truly listens to the community and implements player ideas and creations into the game\nA roadmap which includes programmable AI, AI creature support, a player-driven quest system, and so much more.\nYou can build whatever you want, you can fly what you build through a truly endless world, you can do so with large amounts of people.\n\nI can't think of another game that claims to do this much and actually delivers.  Best of all devs consistently release new features and quality of life patches that constantly reinvigorate my interest in this game.\n\n\n\nIf building your own spaceship and conquering the galaxy sounds at all appealing to you, I recommended you try this FREE alpha version of a fantastic game which is not even near completion yet.

What a great setting to host this style of game.\n\nInspired by Minecraft I believe Starmade is truly a new unique procedural sandbox experience.  The universe is huge, seriously...huge.  They way the game is developed is perfect for exploring star systems mining the planets exploring building factorys etc then moving into new star systems later.  I have 40+ hrs in so far and I am still learning new things. There are so many functional blocks in this game that do incredible things.  Its your imagination truly that limits you in this game as to what you can build.\n\nBuilding ships is the main focus, building with efficiency at first is very tough to do without doing some sort of research.  Power reactor design is vital, you can build a solid block for a power reactor but building it in different ways grants you more efficiency and more power. ;)\n\nI strongly recommend reading up on the game via wiki or other sources before playing, and play the tutorials.  Lots of you tube videos as well, this is a very large environment with lots going on.  It is amazing the things you can build and achieve in this game.  Just takes time to learn everything and patience.\n\nEDIT: always save your blueprints after or while building.","December 20, 2014","true","244.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

There are occasional bugs and after a while the game does start to get a little old.  But the developer has stated multiple times that he wants to make sure the fundamentals of the game are in place and are stable before he starts to expand the game.  Even so there is already a growing community of builders on Reddit and YouTube who have built some incredible things and I would highly reccomend checking them out before purchasing the game.

If u fly away from Spawn, like 6 systems or smth like that, there wont be Shops. Okay, build a Station and play in that system for a while and BOOM there are shops... How that? Well, the Trading Guild (Some "NPC" Faction) built them. And thats not all, just an example. What I'm trying to tell u is: This game is freaking awesome and everyone saying it's a bad "Minecraft Clone" just doesn't want to see it.","March 1, 2015","true","148.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

I love the idea of being able to build a ship and travel to other planetary bodies.  The idea of building around your "core" block is an interesting one as you'll need to come up with designs that protect it from enemy fire.  There's a lot here for ten bucks (though the price will increase later on as development continues) and is an easy recommend to those who enjoy open world sandboxes.\n\nEdit: After some more testing, I am getting some really nasty lag.  My guess is that the single player mode still connects to an online server of some sort.  If this is the case, I'd really like the ability to play offline to eliminate the lag.  Hopefully the devs will address this and the server issues in a future patch.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVc3EvbVovk","December 14, 2014","true","1.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

(Well you can also make a nice big gun and attack other players) Then you need to mine asteroids and pretty much anything you find and upgrade your ship. May seem easy but its hard as hell. Pirates will be a constant threat. Teaming up is very important if you don't want your new shiny ship to be blown to the next universe by pirates.\nI could go on about how to play but wheres the fun if you already know everything?\n\nJust remember this game is in Early access and its going to change.

Game.\n\nIt's easy to get into, and deceptively complex.  For example, they have logic blocks, aoe triggers, effects (on pretty much everything from lights to weapons) that you can do all kinds of  things with.  Those are  just a few examples.\n\nThe game is freaking huge...not sure if it ever ends tbh...so many sectors in a system, systems  in a galaxy, galaxies in π and you have 42 (Gorilla math was used).\n\nThe exploration is like a box of chocolates.  You could find a random shop to buy and sell  things, you could find a pirate station with turrets and ships attacking you, or asteroids, and I even hear you can find  a city but I've yet to find one.  There's planets and asteroids to mine, stations to build,  ships of every kind to make.  There's cloaking, radar jamming, scanning, jump drive (warping / long distance travel), push / pull weapons (tractor beam anyone?), drainers of all types, cannons, missiles, you name it, they probably have it.\n\nYou can save your ship designs locally and on servers (multiplayer) and load them onto  another server using blueprints.  Think template that you fill with all the components and when the blueprint has all the parts it  needs you can spawn it.  You can build bases and outposts, or repair undiscovered /  unclaimed stations and  claim them as your own  / build on it.  There's factions (corps  / guilds) and every faction gets to claim 1 home base which is invincible to damage unless  they run  out of faction points (hard to do unless you claim alot of systems or die alot),\n\nVery customizable server settings so each multiplayer server you play on is probably different from every other.  You can customize your singleplayer server.cfg as well if you so choose.\n\nThe cons:\nThis is more on the servers you play on but when there's alot of people it tends to lag / warp.  (It's Alpha).  The initial RAM settings for the game is 1024  which  is really low.  If you are on a  64 bit OS you will want to download the 64 bit Java and change the RAM settings.  You can do this by going to the menu in the launcher > Options > Memory settings\n\nI have 16GB RAM so I changed mine to 8192 1000 1000  and I stopped getting running out of memory errors  in game.  You will also most likely want to disable procedural background if you get alot of lag...caused me several seconds delay getting out of my ships in high pop servers.  All these options can be changed in the launcher, there's also advanced settings in  the launcher.\n\nAll in all, this is a very fun game I would highly recommend it and I would buy it again.  I figured sooner or later there wont be a free demo and the price will most likely go up so why not support the devs now and not have to worry about it later on.\n\nGet in a faction with people or with friends as this amplifies the fun factor 10 fold.\n11/10 would buy again.","December 19, 2014","true","176.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This is one of those rare gems of a game that keeps you coming back for more forever as it is constantly improving through its passionate and dedicated dev team and community.\n\nBut more then that. This is a game that has a nearly infinite depth in its mechanics and advanced build modes, logic systems, weapons systems..etc..etc which leaves you with nearly limitless possibilites in which to build whatever ship, base, station you can imagine.\n\nThe mulyiplayer aspect is often quite engaging as well with its caring community, factions and moderators that always have interesting events planned and fun things to do, ranging from huge PvP tournements like Blood and Steel where you bring the deadliest machine you can build to wage war against other teams. Along with server bosses or christmas events..etc..etc\n\nOr even something as simple as taking a noob out to fight the pirates for the first time to hear them get excited when they get there first kill in their newly built fighter ship. Or even having to save that same noob later because he jump driven his ship into a star because thay havent learned that they should chart there course a little more carfully when traversing the cosmos.\n\nAll of these things add up to a game that is absolutley satisfying , so long as you can muster the patience to overcome the admittedly steep learning curve required to understand the workings of this game competently.\n\nI certainly recommend this game to all who love space, sci fi, sandbox and voxel building games. But must say that it isnt for the faint of heart or those without much patience. But is for those who want to build the baddest mutha of a ship this side of the galaxy has seen","December 31, 2015","true","175.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

ANYWAYS the game is quite big, on some older servers I've joined to ♥♥♥♥ around on, I've seen serveral galaxies explored and on top of that the galaxies themselves are quite large, solar systems (even with a fast ship) can take roughly 20-30 minutes to traverse, longer if pirate infested (which in my opinion there needs to be less pirate stations due to the fact that heat seeking missles dessimate anything that touches them and the pirates and their stations have cannons for days).With that in mind if you have a well built ship which will take ages due to the credit and resource cost if you're crafting (more on that later) getting a ship that can not only hold its own, but fight back against a pirate station is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get.\n\nAgain, if you have a strong ship that goes fast exploration is enjoyable as you watch the planets and stars go by but can get boring after a while and one starts to resort to the use of jump drives more and more.\n\nAnd for crafting/getting resources, its tedious and grindy especially if you get a large ore haul and try to sell it but can only give each store around 4.5k ore before its completely stocked on it (if this happens sell until you're annoyed and then keep the rest for crafting use) I won't call crafting necesarily fun, its moreso a process of gettings components/ resources together, going afk or mining for a bit, and then coming back to check up on your factory.\n\nHowever building is truly the highlight of this game, there are several blocks to choose from each of these with their own colors and set shapes (there are 4 i think,being the cube,hepta,slope,corner and maybe something I missed?)With all the shapes and colors available allows for many designs and chassis shapes for ships and allows for one, if given enough time, to make their own unique ship but this is the only thing ,aside from making your own station, that there really is to do since exploring isnt too fun if you ave a long range jump drive and just hop over to a point of interest look at it and go back home.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to too many people I know but this game does have a great potential and would like to see where the devs take this game (I'm aware there might be a few things I missed once I get something decent together in my head for those parts I'll write it in)\n\nAs of now I give this game a verdict of 4/10 but there is a present potential there and I can't wait to see what will be coming up in future patches.","July 8, 2015","false","45.9"," 73 of 134 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","73","134","2","0"

Tenacity perhaps...\n\nThe bad:\n- The crafting interface.  Yes it has a filter to search, but no categorization.  Browsing a small list is painful.\n- The UI elements.  Ok, this is early access, some of it is likely developer art.  Recommend these guys go look at Space Engineers for a better example of UI.\n- The flight model.  Flight games *scream* for a joystick and rudder system - this system only supports one controller at a time so unless your stick does everything, it comes out to be much less useful.  Using a keyboard and mouse to fly anywhere near a planet is basically an exercise in frustration - get a gamepad at the minimum for when you step inside a ship.\n\nThis game is like Minecraft in space, but without so much grinding trying to find resources (they are in fact very easy to get once you build a salvage ship - you will spend more time waiting for the resources to process than actually acquiring them.)  If you like *building* things, you will enjoy this game.  If you like *fighting* things, your enjoyment will probably be short-lived.  If you like *exploring*, you're enjoyment will also be short-lived.\n\nBut it's still Early Access, so give it some time.  It will no doubt improve (just see how far Space Engineers has come along.)","December 9, 2014","true","156.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game's Minecraft like take on spaceflight and spaceship/station building is simply fantastic. While my current ship building ability is akin to a 3 year old drawing on the wall with crayons, I'm simply in love with the full gamut of things available to build with. Looking on Youtube you can find users who've built fleets of Titan class ships that look absolutely gorgeous and wonderfully showcase what this game can let you build.\n\nThe first ship I built was simply a small cube. It was hideous, but after a run in with a pirate station (which chased me for a fairly long ways) I had to rebuild. I landed on a planet and mined the only thing I could see: lava. I wondered what I could do with lava and found out that while it's useless for crafting, it makes a seriously bright ship. So I built a ship out of lava. After watching some videos on youtube I realized that I'd just wasted a significant amount of time doing nothing, and I built a better ship purely for mining. It's ugly as sin, but it can demolish an asteroid in about 2 minutes, so I'm happy with it for the time being. After I mine a bit more I'm going to dive into crafting, then I'll make a really big ship. (Currently mine doesn't have an inside) I'm also hoping that (since I know how to use Photoshop) I can possibly contribute to some of the texture packs on http://starmadedock.net\n\nSo far I haven't recommended any game to my friends as much as I have this one.

The ship building is fairly simple to get started. The game shows you how to make a basic space clunker, and how to mine the environment, and you will find it is easy to get moving.\nThe problem lies in how spread out some of these planets and resources are, ESPECIALLY in multiplayer.\n\nThe second main issue is the clunky launcher and massive memory/fps issues. I have a very respectable gaming setup, and I am always crashing, you need to have 64 bit java, and the correct memory values input into the game launcher, the one before you actually start the game. Why the game has essentially two launchers is ridiculous. The game online suffers from the same problem Minecraft does online, you have to hike 50000000000 miles/galaxies away to get started because everything is claimed or you will get ganked.\n\nSo if you are looking for a fun space sandbox, look elsewhere.

I've been playing it since learning about it, about .4x release or so, back on Minecraft when i asked a few of my buddies about any other games like it. And by far this game TRUMPS Minecraft when it comes to sheer size, exploration and sense of seclusion.\n\nThe game itself is a massive sandbox for those wondering about it. It allows you to build practically *anything* from houses,  hovercraft and mining vessels, to fighters, gigantic mining stations and factories! The game itself requires a very good computer to run (a 400$ Acer like me, cannot handle the newer patches to the game for instance. I'll be able to play the game in February in earnest when i build my new gaming rig :) )\n\nThis game also supports exporting projects from 3-dimensional tools like Blender as blueprints! which then can be implemented into the game and 'purchased' with in-game currency. This helps when you see a 3D model and think "if only i could fly it" ;)\n\nCombat is heavily based upon your ability to protect your 'baby' (your ship or creation) and it gives you a VERY wide variation in weapons and protection possibility! From mobile sentries to stationary defense platforms you can protect worlds, sectors or even entire quadrants! The game is literally stagnated only by YOUR creativity. YOU control the fun. YOU control the environment for the most part. And as the game says in the description, it is YOUR universe.\n\n\n\nPersonal experience with the game:[/i] I first started up on a mini-server called Illusive with 4 buddies of mine. we made a faction called "The Fringe". We hung around the spawn for a couple days, learned how to build basic ships and began an adventure out into the void which lead us nearly a THOUSAND sectors away! it took us nearly an hour to reach our base... what started out as a derilect NPC shop out of supplies. We branched off, made 7 massive combat vessels over the course of 2 months and made 6 sentries capable of holding off the average A.I pirate (special made ships which turned out to become more aggressive over the years.) Our three flag ships....\n\nThe Leviathan: a massive Dreadnaut carrier (blender model i made) designed to carry 120 small fighters with 2 lasers. With 1k engines and a little over a million shield the beast didn't move fast.. but it could take a beating.  Leviathan picture[thesurviver.deviantart.com]\n\nThe Liberty: A smaller ship, designed to be made in bulk as carriers, support vessels, combat cruisers. These were going to become the backbone of an A.I based defense fleet of about 15 ships. Lead by my buddie's "Shadow" Liberty shown here.  Shadow Liberty[thesurviver.deviantart.com]\n\nThe Behemoth: A project i was working on for nearly 2 months and ended up halting because the size was killing my frame rate (at least until next month ;) ) And at nearly 18million it was not going to be something i could simply spawn in. With that in mind i made this beast a floating battlestation. With 6 guns capable of a mind-boggling 1mil damage output per second, a shield of nearly 100million and a battery chamber that engulfed the inner body of the ship, it wouldn't be going down without a fight Unfortunately my computer couldn't run ascreenshot without crashing the game once i got the second 3 barrel cannon on the ship, so here it is in the prototype stages Behemoth wrapup part 1[thesurviver.deviantart.com] after the first month this is what had been made....\n\n\nAnother ship, which i unfortunately do not have a picture of, is an even BIGGER ship that a member of the Fringe we picked up later had built. It held 18 turrets on either side, with a gun that lined the middle of the dual hull ship with a damage output that made my ships sound like a laughing stock. He spent 7 months building it up. The ship was called the Keldon. I have a partially damaged blueprint of the ship personally saved and will hopefully be able to repair it. However sitting at a whopping 128million to spawn it? i'll be working on it in singleplayer. lol","January 17, 2015","true","85.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I saw the trailer and I bought it right after that.\n\nI have probably spent 95% of my playing experience in singleplayer.  I didn't have any help from real players so this review will be in that perspective\n\nFirst, I'll go with the cons.  You can get pretty lost in the launcher for the game.  Also, if you don't set your memory to a good level and don't set the graphics to a level your computer can handle, you might not even be able to run the game at a good speed (or at all).  There is also a bit of a learning curve to the game.  For the first few days you play, you will probably spend just as much time playing the game as you will watching youtube videos trying to figure out how to make things work properly.  As for the youtube videos, a lot of them are a bit outdated, and finding a recent video can be difficult.  There's also not a lot of content when it comes to singleplayer, but that's because this game was built more for the multiplayer experience.  Although there are many planets and systems, they are very similar to each other so the only thing that makes you explore is having to move to the next system to find more resources.  For where the game is at, I think the build mode is pretty great, but it could use some tweaks to make it faster and easier.  For example, I find it a bit tedious to have to go into 'advanced edit' and having to press an arrow 5-10 times and look at a tiny picture of the selected piece, trying to find the right orientation of the block you're trying to place everytime I switch to a different part of a ship.  And I find that most of the time, I get the wrong orientation because in some lightings it's very difficult to tell which direction the block is facing in the tiny picture if it's all one color.  I think a system where you could click and hold the mouse button then move your mouse in different directions to change the orientation would make building 1000% easier (maybe they already have an easier way and I don't know about it).  That's all I really have for cons.\n\nFor the pros, this game is just amazing.  If the thought of building your own ship and scavanging the galaxy for resources excites you, this is the game for you.  If you want to build a ship with a ridiculous amount of salvage modules so you can mine to the core of a planet in the click of a button, you can do that.  If you want to build extravagant space stations where you can store all your ships, you can do that.  If you want to kill pirates and plunder their stations, you can do that.  All this I'm explaining is still only scratching the surface.  Once you get into multiplayer, there are factions you can join and wars you can fight.  This game is so fun and is only going to get better with every update.","February 1, 2015","true","14.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That said, the only thing that took me a second was the ok button to launch the game is on the connections window(after the launcher) was hiding out of view at the very bottom!","February 1, 2015","true","072.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I saw the trailer and I bought it right after that.\n\nI have probably spent 95% of my playing experience in singleplayer.  I didn't have any help from real players so this review will be in that perspective\n\nFirst, I'll go with the cons.  You can get pretty lost in the launcher for the game.  Also, if you don't set your memory to a good level and don't set the graphics to a level your computer can handle, you might not even be able to run the game at a good speed (or at all).  There is also a bit of a learning curve to the game.  For the first few days you play, you will probably spend just as much time playing the game as you will watching youtube videos trying to figure out how to make things work properly.  As for the youtube videos, a lot of them are a bit outdated, and finding a recent video can be difficult.  There's also not a lot of content when it comes to singleplayer, but that's because this game was built more for the multiplayer experience.  Although there are many planets and systems, they are very similar to each other so the only thing that makes you explore is having to move to the next system to find more resources.  For where the game is at, I think the build mode is pretty great, but it could use some tweaks to make it faster and easier.  For example, I find it a bit tedious to have to go into 'advanced edit' and having to press an arrow 5-10 times and look at a tiny picture of the selected piece, trying to find the right orientation of the block you're trying to place everytime I switch to a different part of a ship.  And I find that most of the time, I get the wrong orientation because in some lightings it's very difficult to tell which direction the block is facing in the tiny picture if it's all one color.  I think a system where you could click and hold the mouse button then move your mouse in different directions to change the orientation would make building 1000% easier (maybe they already have an easier way and I don't know about it).  That's all I really have for cons.\n\nFor the pros, this game is just amazing.  If the thought of building your own ship and scavanging the galaxy for resources excites you, this is the game for you.  If you want to build a ship with a ridiculous amount of salvage modules so you can mine to the core of a planet in the click of a button, you can do that.  If you want to build extravagant space stations where you can store all your ships, you can do that.  If you want to kill pirates and plunder their stations, you can do that.  All this I'm explaining is still only scratching the surface.  Once you get into multiplayer, there are factions you can join and wars you can fight.  This game is so fun and is only going to get better with every update.","February 1, 2015","true","14.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Hard to sum this game up in one short sentence.\n\nThis will take time to reach a point where you are comfortable with all the features in the game spanning the crafting side of things and most things just take time in single player because, well space has a lot of space.\n\nI'm playing on a Mac (eat me, idgaf) so I obviously ran into some errors while trying to play this game, like a buggy tutorial. I managed to over look that and educated myself through youtube on how this great gem works and found plenty of support there. (Yogcast has a series on this I hear, so that's worth checking it out if you like their previous works.)\n\nSO will take time due to high learning curve, great for voxel fans and great for space and sci-fi enthusiasts.\n\nI don't have the time for this game but It's nice.\n\n(If you're working a job with plenty hours, this game may frustrate you with the time base commitment needed to overcome the steep learning curve. Download the demo first, see what it's about and then consider supporting the team if you believe in this cause. I have a full time job, starting me off on a pretty disappointing and frustrating foot, but worth it later on.)\n\n","November 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Currently, without a more complex/dynamic NPC faction system, my biggest problem is that there isn't enough to do in single player. I don't have a ton of time to invest in playing on servers, so I think that solves that problem, just not for me. Another problem I have is that there are a TON of systems and mechanics to learn, and perhaps they're not the most intuitive. I haven't played in months, but the crafting system was a bit confusing for me back then, and more stuff has come in since then.\n\nNow, done with the negatives...\n\nThis is a great game. Open world? Not good enough, try open space. The building system is fantastic, and you should check out some of the ships and stations people have made- they're absolutely stunning, nothing short of spectacular. The combat mechanics are fun and exciting, and there's a lot of room for ships of different combat and non-combat roles.\n\nI can only say GET THIS GAME.

I can now recommend it. You can call this minecraft in space, bit it's now a lot more than that. It can be a MMO, but with built-in anti-greifing  to some extent (only your faction home is protected). Faction permissions have improved quite a bit to prevent bad faction members from stealing resrouces and ships.\n\nAlso it's a lot of fun. Build whatever you want, build elevators, huge hanger doors, tiny ships, huge ships. The universe is big enough that you can find your own litte corner of the galaxy not to be bugged, or, fly off to a far off galaxy if you want.\n\nYou can now have your own fleet of ships that will fight to defend you, mine, or fly off to whever you command them (in fact, fleet orders can be used as a kind of slow auto-pilot).  The role of NPCs are being expanded. If you're running your own sever, you can write your own NPC scripts and load them for custom game experience.\n\nWhen you first play this game, keep in mind that block placement matters for many system blocks (esp. power and weapons). Usually due to the coplexity of the game, young children don't play it as much, so it's generally a more mature community. If you've grown out of Minecraft, this is for you.\n\nAlso, you can play the game for free as of now, and can lauch it direclty wihout using steam (which is how I normally play). The only thing is, most servers WON'T allow you to connect unless you've bought the game-- so go buy it.","May 28","true","26.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

Try the demo to get an idea for yourself. i hear they are working on the game but i have notice they are puting more new stuff in the game than polishing it. Effectively scaring potential new player from the game. I have no problem with caring for existing player but without attracting and keeping new players this game will remain an unfinished product played by ship builders no offence intended.

It's true. However, it has enough complexity, unique block shapes, and sheer /content/ to make it very much stand on its own. This complexity, though, can also be a bit overwhelming, especially if you want to make a ship that "does everything." As of right now, it's not the best at explaining what a lot of blocks do, so you may find yourself on the wiki alot.\nDespite that, StarMade is still an excellent game. The visuals are pleasing, the mechanics are ultimately as complex as you want them to be, to a point. The sheer amount of ship customization is jaw-dropping, and allows for making truly unique, awesome ships that are tons of fun to use and play in. Like Minecraft, it doesn't particularly have a story, and so you find yourself making your own narrative, which is a bit of childish fun missing from a lot of games.\nOverall, StarMade is a fun game, and if you're willing to stick your head into the wiki a little, the potential it has is mind-boggling. It could use a bit more explanation on certain mechanics and blocks, but finding them out is often its own reward.","February 4","true","54.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not that much to do other than build ships and  mine resources. Should be played with friends or multiplayer for sure though!\n\nThe Goods:\n- World size\n- Ship building system is awesome, build anything and fly it\n- Wide variety of ship building blocks\n- Blueprint sytem allows you to build saved ships by collecting the required blocks. This way you can download cool ships, and collect the required stuff and create it. Good for if your not the best ship builder :P me...\n\nThe Bads:\n- Clonky UI\n- AI\n- Sounds are needed for sure\n\nOverall, I think its definitaly a game to get now, I can see in the future this game being a awesome game.","January 1, 2015","true","9.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It's like Space Engineers and Minecraft fused together. You get to build awesome ships and spacestations, fly around a huge galaxy filled with wormholes, planets, asteroids, and your common space pirates. Pirates can be very annoying due to their massive amount of space stations and ships. Their space stations, if not discovered, will appear unknown on the map, but once you find one, you'll want to turn tail and run... that is unless you have a great ship.\nIn the game, there are shops to buy parts for whatever build you're making. Though if you have a lot of loot from asteroids, pirates, or whatever, you might make the merchants go bankrupt... But don't worry, there are plenty of other shops out there.\nAlso I forgot to mention you are able to mine things! Asteroids are filled with minerals that you could craft or simply sell. Not mentioning you can mine planets, and get mega butt ton of awesome stuff!\nI bet you're wondering about wormholes from the first paragraph. Do not go towards one! If you are in the sector of a wormhole, it will suck you in, and spew you out into a part of the galaxy. They don't as much hurt you, they can just get really annoying.\nFinally we have Pros VS Cons:\n\nPros:\n-Awesome Universe\n-Buld Awesome stuff\n-Many things to do\n-You don't need a awesome gaming PC to play (Unless we're dealing with planets)\n\nCons:\n\n-Planets are very laggy and in some cases crash games\n-The Pirates don't play fair and auto-aim to the most important peices of your ship\n-If you don't place your turret or ship core right, you could get out of your ship (Like outside your ship)\n-Some players are trolls and will mess with you and your stuff\n\nBut in overall you can have fun with friends, make a faction, work together, and maybe hyave a war with another friend!

I stopped playing for a while and then when browsing through steam, wallah, StarMade. I was like, Uh Mah Gerd, I have to get this. So I bought it and relearned what they changed.\n\nStarmade is a space sandbox where you have to pretty much build your ship from scratch, build up resources, build another, bigger, better ship, farm pirates, buy supplies, build another bigger, better ship... get into crafting, realize it's better to farm and sell pirate loot, etc. etc. Your ships can go in any direction you want them to, they can be the fastest, the ship that packs the most punch, a healing ship, a power regen ship, whatever your imagination can design within the confines of this game.\n\nIf you can get a group of friends together you can make a local server fairly easily, FOR FREE, or you can join one of the many official servers that, from what I've seen, are well populated. On these servers you can hold grand battles, roleplay, whatever you can come up with. I personally like building ships, host a game, and have some of my friends build ships as well and see who has the better vessel. The game also allows you to save and upload ships to different servers, which can be handy when your 'Baby' gets blown to smitherines.\n\nIf you don't like some of the options for your hosted or singleplayer world you can change it easily in the game files, like how many credits shops have and can recharge, or the universal speed limit. I would recommend looking up some of the options before changing, because at this stage in the game you don't know if changing a certain option will make that specific world unplayable, but the developers put a warning in the options notepad stating whether or not the option is safe to change, and they do tell you the min. and max. variables that are allowed for that option.\n\nAs of now the game is in it's early stages, there are much to fix and add, and fix again. So don't be expecting the most perfect game, that has a lot of content. It is not as buggy as when I first started playing, so I am glad for that.\n\nI would reccomend this game to any sci-fi, space building, crafting, co-op loving, kitten adoring... did I mention space, gamers out their.\n\n\n9/10","December 14, 2014","true","176.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Make your own 3 block micro ship or make hundred thousand block ships! You will spend hours exploring a big sector of a single galaxy, when there are around a hundred big sectors in each galaxy, maybe even more!\n\nYeah, also, unlike those other modern space sims, there is no loading screens between transitions to other places. It is all physical space that you have to go through. Only the visuals are buggy slightly (but very rarely). The game devs are heavily involved in the community (from what I have seen) No waiting 3 months for a bug fix update!

It has so much potential as a sandbox space game that I can't help but get a little excited when I see it in my library. Now that it is on steam I have a lot of faith in the development.\n\nI do have the occasional bug. However, the game is solid. The physics are pretty good around planets and the multiplayer aspect of the game can be pretty fun. The AI turrets are a solid part of space combat but the AI ships have something to be desired in terms of how far they will go away from where you start them when AI enemies come for you.\n\nThe combat itself is pretty straight forward and can be pretty entertaining, there is nothing like hiding in your factions home planet or station while your AI Turrets take out the enemy while viewing it all through a glass wall. BTW when you are running a server you can have the game spawn as many ships of any saved design as you want.\n\nThe game is neat-o.","December 21, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But a s others have said the big problem is Bigger ship = Better Ship. Small ship have 0 combat ability really. So people are flying around in these massive ships. You spend a bunch of time building this huge ship just to have it blown up by a slightly bigger ship. Very discouraging at first. There is currently nothing to do other than pvp but theyre working on that, so thats ok. Bear with me, this is my first review ever, i know it sucks.

None have come close to Minecraft, and Minecraft with Mods just seemed like all you could ever need when it came to games in it's genre.\n\nHowever, there were things that Minecraft, even with Mods, never did perfectly. For example, I built Ships in Minecraft and enjoyed it, but they weren't the best. First, they were fixed in place. May as well be a building, even if it was a pretty good looking building at that. Second, they didn't really DO anything. They looked cool and you could walk around them, but that's about it. I mean, you could add redstone functions and stuff but they really didn't have a purpose. Also, once Minecraft or the mod packs were updated, you would have to restart your world from scratch or try migrating your saved world to the new server. Good luck with that!\n\nEnter StarMade- a game which does so many things right. If you ever found yourself wanting to build ships from scratch like in Minecraft, this is your game. Period. It's not just the fact you can make ships block by block- you can actually FLY them. I mean, through space. You can add functions to them, such as shields, thrusters, doors, turrets, lights, and armor. You can add Weapons like Missiles, Beam Lasers, Cannon lasers, pulse weapons... You have to build power for your ship, and you can make use salvage beams to gather materials. You can dock to other ships or space stations, meaning you can effectively have carrier ships. Ships have artificial gravity, and best of all- it's all multiplayer as well.\n\nHow cool is it that you can build a carrier ship with your friends onboard, have them fly off in fighter jets as you pilot the large carrier ship? As cool as it gets if you ask me. You can also build space stations and explore small planets with their own gravity. You can use black holes to travel across the galaxy, and there is infinite space to explore. Of course, don't forget space pirates you can fight.\n\nWhile the game is early access, you get a very amazing experience for the money. Crafting isn't the same as Minecraft, but it is still fun. The core of the game is about making your own fun, but there is a growing community of people and plenty of online servers you can explore.\n\nWhile there are of course cons to the game. Some may find the lack of clear goals a turn off, or how their is an initial learning curve with how the ships work, however, If you can make your own fun building with friends, salvaging, and attacking pirates, and aren't afraid of looking online if you have a quick question, than you are in the right place. While the game can use more content, there is plenty here to warrant getting into the game now as there is plenty to keep you busy. Money well spent.\n\nIf you are still on the fence, I would like to tell you about the Blueprint system. You can save Blueprints of ships you build, allowing you to create the same ship again, even on other servers. You can even take ships you create in solo play to multiplayer servers, or take ships you create from old versions of StarMade and play them as StarMade is updated. I have not lost a ship through all the updates we have had in the last year thanks to the blueprint system- compared to Minecraft where I have had to restart servers and lose everything every time.","December 30, 2014","true","135.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

As an early access game, you would expect it to have lots of glitches, bugs, or flaws, but surprisingly, StarMade has almost none, except for one where at certain angles players and npc's appear invisible. The only thing really that makes this game an early access game is that there are some gameplay mechanics and items that havent been implemented yet, such as certain items not having implemented fuel usage, but they are going to add that in future updates. All I can really say about this game is that i trust the developers to make this game even greater as it is now, which I am sure that they are going to do.\n\nI r8 9/10\nPros:\n+Doesnt seem like a minecraft rip off at all, except for the obvious blocky and pixely design of the game\n+Huge amounts of variation, you can make almost any ship you can dream of, big or small\n+Nearly infinite universe, There are thousands of things to discover, you can claim entire planets and solar systems for your faction (a clan of sorts)\n+Tons of suff to do, you'll almost  ever get bored, as you can mine, build, travel, hang out, and have huge faction against faction space battles in huge space battleships\n+Friendly community, many players will help you if you have questions and dont know what to do\n+Modding, I haven't really done this yet, as I only got the game several days prior to writing this review, but i have heard from several other friends there is some great stuff you can get from mods\n+Lots of servers, there are only several more than 100 servers, but with an infinite universe and high player caps on most servers, all you'll really need is one (One good server is Freaks R Us, there are several players that play on that server a lot that will help you if you need it\n\nCons: (Will not be listing stuff not implemented yet because it's in early access)\n- Long distance between planets and shops, making it a drag to go to a different planet or space station\n-Space Pirates, the main enemy NPC, is pretty overpowered unless you have a massive ship armed and ready. DO NOT approach pirate stations soon after starting the game in single or multiplayer\n-kind of a grind to salvage and sell natural resources for credits to buy ship/building parts\n\n\nThats my review of StarMade, the space exploration/building/pvp, I bought this game out of a Humble bundle for $1, so you cant really go wrong, and i recommend that you do the same, its still on the humble bundle website for 2 more days at the time of this review, so if you want to, go get it for $1.\n","August 17, 2015","true","12.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

If you're planning to put workshop support in, just after it's come out of early access then that's fine . Thirdly, the map doesn't really work, again all this is my opinion, but the map is very confusing, I get that it's split up into sectors and that you can see stations and stuff, but, for me at least, it takes about 2-5 mins to select the sector that I want, however apart from these three things and maybe just adding stuff in the game is amazing.","June 19, 2015","true","7.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

First of all it is recommended to finish tutorial as it covers the basics of game. Secondly, have patience and try to understand the simple mechanism of computer + modules, which is the core mechanism to build systems on a ship. Once you are done, you should be able to build your self a basic ship with basic working systems. With time you will discover more like how to make efficient systems, use logic to create complex systems and more.\n\nAll in all its a great sandbox and it can be your go to space sandbox, sci-fi rpg (if you have a couple of your friends with you) or can be your space ship design simulator :P.

However I will give the most honest answer I can.\n\nIt's been far too long since I should have made this post. I have been playing StarMade consistently for over a year and discovered it far before that. (There is a good chance I have hundreds of hours but I don't use steam to launch the game so that is surely incorrect in my hours played) Since then it has undergone massive changes and very much so in a positive direction. Visually and gameplay wise it continues to become an amazing game. This review will be from the perspective of an experienced player around December 2015\n\nGraphics: This isn't any Star citizen, nor is it Space Engineers (a game it is often compared to) when it comes to graphics. The universe is cubed. It follows the trend set fourth by Minecraft (despite being planned long before MC made it's debut). I must say however, I never had such faith in the graphics of a voxel game. Even with shaders installed and a great texture pack, Minecraft can hardly come close to the visuals of StarMade. This is due to the use of built in normal, emission and specular maps. Additionally it has some very decent shadows as well. Like much of the rest of the game, a lot of this is configurable.\n\nScale: The universe is massive. Often times I will hear new players remark on how large a ship is. To me the same ship may be small. The feeling of walking around a kilometer long spaceship is awesome and getting to that point in the game is worth the money alone. Space itself is split up neatly into grids, which allow this universe to exist at this scale. From sectors to systems to galaxies, you could spend your entire time flying and never see the same stars again. The only area where scale is lacking is planets. These objects often sit under a kilometer in radius. That said, I know it is intended to bump up the scale where possible. Despite pushing a java game beyond what is possible, we will eventually reach it's limit's. At least for now those limits have yet to be reached.\n\nSetting: The game is purely science fiction based. You can if you want turn on options for a more realistic experience, however the idea is that creativity should flourish and it should be fun to play. The universe is a bit empty right now, however rest assured. I myself am personally working on various assets that will be in the game and additionally we will see mechanics introduced that turn this into a bustling dynamic universe. Aliens, flora, space derelicts, cosmic anomalies. All of this is planned. Some of it is already in the game!\n\nBuilding: Building has never been simpler. All blocks and materials are 1 cubic meter. I think this is the advantage this game has over similar titles. There is no need to build a large chunky machine that serves a specific purpose. Or to place it in a way on your build so that it actually functions. You can have a ship that makes just about no sense, but it will still work. If you like it, why should the game punish you for that? Additionally there are crazy awesome build tools. Templates for shapes, copy/paste, undo/redo, and symmetry planes just to name a few. All of this easily accessible from your ship.\n\nCrafting: Crafting is simple and complex at the same time. There are 24~ resources that produce just about every block in the game, most of which you will eventually find a place for on your ship. These resources are fed into factories and can be automated and made more efficient.\n\nCombat/gameplay: There is a lot to learn here and it will likely be where a new player will get stuck. Combat can be exciting, however I expect balancing as well as new features to be added till release. There are multiple approaches though; shield tanking, armor tanking, dps based. You can use missiles, lasers, cannons, or turrets or combinations of all of this. You can install jump drives to escape, you can install jump inhibitors to prevent escape! No idea is too crazy for StarMade and a lot of science fiction based features have made their way into the game simply because they are awesome.\n\nI imagine learning how to play the game will be the hardest part for any new players. Learning to play is worth it however. The game's demo is free but will not be updated beyond beta or public release. As the game approaches full release the price will increase so now is the time! Take the time to learn and see what is possible and you will be getting your money's worth!\n\nTLDR; Easy building with great tools. Simply yet deep crafting system that makes sense. Massive universe and massive scale. Anything in the realm of science fiction is a reality and may become a part of the game as it develops!","December 1, 2015","true","141.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

I like the concept of flying literally great distances to planets I can SEE in the distance and get there and land on them. I like building your own ship and I also really like the overall look of the game.\n\nI do not enjoy the controls. I do not like the many crashes involving my java. I do not appreciate the sound issues. If you have windows 8 the sound probably isn't going to work unless you do the workaround (which the devs put in the launcher for you). I like that. Don't like the fact that it is happening and I have to fix it myself though. Although being so early in the development I understand there will be things like this.\n\nI did not play this game before it hit steam but I've seen and heard the stories. Planets used to be rounder and gravity was less goofy. However that wasn't overly noticeable and it is MUCH easier to land on planets when the sides are hexagonal and flat.\n\nMy BIGGEST issue comes from having to tweak my game settings drastically do make it work. I put everything up on ultra and the draw distance was massive. I have I think 16gigs of ram right now and a GTX770 with a i7 processor. The game lagged hard during some of the loading phases. This isn't THE top of the line, but it's at least in the top 10-15%. I can run anything on ultra with no issues right now and seeing this game come to a crashing halt kinda sucks. I haven't googled this or anything so there very well may be something I"m doing wrong   =)    if anyone knows you can comment on this but I might find out by the time you do.\n\nOverall through the glitches the game is pretty damn enjoyable. Being able to construct a spaceship in game is super easy to do and the controls are listed right on the screen unless you disable them which is a big help when you're new.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the game is still pretty early in the development phase and it WILL have bugs and it WILL feel incomplete but I as of right now I kind of like it as a way to get my exploration fix in.","January 6, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fantastic game and concept, but as an early access game it is very buggy. Three hours of work going into building a huge battleship could be lost because the game crashes due to some miscelaneous error or some glitch occurs on a planet you're landed on and launches your ship 3 sectors over while you're still on the planet, stranded.\n\nI have thus far rage-quit twice due to these errors, swearing I wouldn't waste my time again by playing this game. Only to come back home from work dying to play it again because of all the ideas you'll get thinking of ways to arrange your hangar, or what weapons you'll place where, or what station or faction you'll attack next. I can imagine them fixing many of the bugs and creating an amazing universe to explore in the future of this game, there's just so much flexibility they have with it.\n\nIt's a fun game now and can only get better with time as the bugs get ironed out. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has a creative imagination and wants to have big epic space dogfights.","December 12, 2014","true","32.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Even though the space in this game is not realistic (it's in the km distance ranges) it works 100% due to the way everything looks and feels. Jumping through space is freaking awesome. Designing ships is awesome.\n\nIF I COULD ADD ONE THING TO THE GAME, IT WOULD BE THRUSTER TRAILS THAT CAN HAVE THEIR COLOR CHANGED WITH THE ROD LIGHTS (the same way you change bullets on weapon modules, place it in front of the barrel) =DD\n\nIf the trails were like 1-3 blocks in length, that would be awesome, and would add incentive to actually having thruster blocks in a visable part of your ship, instead of "fake" thrusters that most people make with Crystal blocks to show glowing plasma / hot turbines. This works and makes a ship look great, but I would honestly love trails to see some distance / speed. It would also be helpful to finding other ships when they're moving fast (some servers have +speed mods). It would also be awesome if the trails extend for a very short period of time when a ship jumps, that way ships that stay behind can see a "thruster ghost" of all of the light left behind from the thrusters. :3\n\nAlso aminals. Not really super important, but it would be cool to see some actual life forms in the game aside from pirates and shops. :3 just saying\n\nBUY THIS GAME EARLY ACCESS, OR WAIT TILL RELEASE, EITHER WAY IT'S EXTREMELY AWESOME. =]","November 7, 2015","true","108.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

My personal reccomendation to anyone who likes spending their time really making stuff, is to get this game. It might seem complex at first, but with enough time anyone can learn it and if you don't think it's worth paying just yet, they have a free version on their website, along with what I believe to be the equally free demo here on Steam.\n\ntldr: Minecraft in space is fun, and pirates kick ♥♥♥ when they can spawn the ships you build","January 24","true","219.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Building all type of ships, space stations, machines, hulls/armor, and a whole bunch of cosmetic blocks. You mine for resources and can refine them to create mesh and composite, which are the basic crafting items.\n\nI don't even have the best computer, but I could run the game pretty well.

That said, some parts aren't as "streamlined" as other voxel-based games, StarMade brings the gritty, complex aspects of a space dogfighting game to something comparable to Lapito's Galacticraft mod for Minecraft. Once you get the hang of connecting ship/station elements and managing a faction, the game truly feels totally immersive. Some of the better RP servers go to show this.\nFinal words:\nBuy the game. Even if you don't like how it is now, TRUST ME, the devs like schema are without a doubt the best at always pushing progress and killing bugs.

Such as Minecraft for example! But thats a different game, this game has cool features while Minecraft is... Minecraft. StarMade is a space game where you run fly around space in your... hey... where's your ship? When you first spawn you ain't got jack ♥♥♥♥ other than some starter equipment for a tiny, tiny, tiny ship. But you do have 25,000 bucks to spend on equipment. Spend it wisely, and dont just die and lose it. While building, please for the love of god don't ♥♥♥♥ing press BACKSPACE. It will delete what ever you are currently holding in your hotbar. It says "drop" but since this is space and all, space does you a favour and just eats it so you don't have to see junk everywhere. Neat right? Well so far the only things bad about this space builder is the clunky controls that take a while to get used to, and the "drop" feature. Oh yeah, dont forget the GRAPHIKS THAT SUK!!! The graphics aren't bad. They're blocky and why the ♥♥♥♥ does it matter? Some of the amazing things that everybody needs to know before buying is that 1. You can purchase a crew. 2. Singleplayer (should've already known that) 4. (because ♥♥♥♥ 3.) multiplayer. 5. You can create big spaceships. 666. There's space stations that could be even bigger than the space ship! 777 (won me the lotto!) Pirates and Storeowners to spice up the experience. 8. Easy to create servers. 9. SPAAAAAAAACE!!! And the big 10 inch ♥♥♥♥, 10. Weopons... and lots of them.\n\nIf you like Minecraft, buy this game. If you hate minecraft, buy this game. If you like Space Builders, buy this game. If you like to instantly have everything at the start, don't buy this game. If you hate getting used to controls, don't buy this game. If you love space games and/or beutiful games, buy this game.\n\nTL;DR?\n11/10 Would SPAAAACE again.\n\nYou still reading? Good, reading makes you smart. Now read this with the testicals in your head.\nI hate Minecraft as you have obviously read, but that's my opinion. Hating me because I hate a Minecraft just shows how bad your "community" is.

There is no random "night time" where the big bad pirates come out, instead, they fly across the universe with you, looking for each other, and each incounter can have different things happen, as the pirates can take your own self-built ship and use it against you.\n11/10 This game is fun as hell.","April 4, 2015","true","66.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's really fun, and has a lot of potential.  The building of ships is awesome but even beyond that you can build space stations and land bases.  Really almost anything you can think of.  Some of the features I found hard to use like the games own version of red stone.  The game uses logic modules that I found a bit rough but then I didn't spend a ton of time on it either.  Also the lag was bad, this could have been the server I was on but I have a feeling it's the size of the galaxy.  As people move further out and more and more is generated the game slows down.  Oh and that brings me to the final issue.  Space!  There is so much of it you almost never run into anyone.

I know its alpha, and i expect issues, and the one i have noticed thus far is how occasionally I will come across a station that is there, but i cant see it, and it acts as iff it is not there.  Shooting missles at it gets a pinpoint hit in the middle, and it seems i can blow them up.  However, when i log off as this is happenening, i cant log on the same server for days.\n\nI know those stations are there, but something buggy is going on at the same time.\n\nGreat game, mechanics, future promise.  This one has it all and more than most of the alphas out there.  If this game, Space Engineers and Empyrion had a love child.  It would be the expectations of the entire "Space Minecraft" fan group.  Just pop some fun pills and give that some thought.\n\nI recommend this game to those who love building massive ships and stations, then sending them into battle with friends...

It's really fun, and has a lot of potential.  The building of ships is awesome but even beyond that you can build space stations and land bases.  Really almost anything you can think of.  Some of the features I found hard to use like the games own version of red stone.  The game uses logic modules that I found a bit rough but then I didn't spend a ton of time on it either.  Also the lag was bad, this could have been the server I was on but I have a feeling it's the size of the galaxy.  As people move further out and more and more is generated the game slows down.  Oh and that brings me to the final issue.  Space!  There is so much of it you almost never run into anyone.  If not for the chat you might as well play it alone.\n\nAll in all it's an awesome game that I have no regrets buying.","November 27, 2015","true","195.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just can't stop playing it i thought for me to learn it and focus it would be better to do singleplayer.\n\nWhich yes it was looked up some admin commands when pirates turned up and lagged the game out alot after learning some controls i actually find the quite easy to play now.\n\nTo me the game is a great mix of Eve online and minecraft. it runs really well on my couple of generations ago pc. I let it load up watch the FPS to see it stablize then play the game pretty much lag free apart from approaching planets to mine them. If i travel in space the game is always lag free.\n\nBuilding spaceships is really exciting to me as you will spend many hours working out a ship design thats works best for your style of play. Then of course if you play multiplayer it's all about building bigger then all the other players which some ships i've seen are getting upto 6million blocks taking them weeks to months to finsih with very interesting designs and variety.Then you have logic blocks for well doing logic. watcvhing videos on youtube people have made semi automatic ships for mining which i am absolutly amazed people worked out. (planning on working on it myself).\n\nI wish there were alot more players playing i think with a bigger community that put the effort in it could become as popular if not more then minecraft. the ideas are great and the game overall is to me excellent it just need some more to make it feel more alive, some fixes in lag for loading planets and some better ai in the ai block. Which are all things they addressing in the future from what i have been reading (dont quote me on it though).\n\noverall atm 8/10","February 7","true","209.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It also features a better base feature set that space engineers, with a much easier to use build system, an early game mining system that doesn't see you having chase rocks after you knock them off the asteroid, and no need to constantly hurry back to your pilot seat every 5 minutes to recharge your suit.\n\nNeedless to say I could go on comparing to Space Engineers, but to do so would be a waste of time as this is a StarMade review, not Space Engineers.\n\nThe game is easy to pick up and learn, with an extensive wiki with guides from how to get started to building turrets and much more. Intuitive control and a graphic set that while not the most complex or outstanding, offers brutal simplicty and ease of being able to recognise a block straight away makes building, the main feature of the game, to be anything from a 5 minute dirty job of a starting craft to a 20+ hour capital ship a fun thing, not a slog of constantly fetching more material. And with a dedicated development team and interesting mechanics, this is a game that really should not be overlooked if you want a sandbox open world spaceship building game.

And instead of getting a shovel, you're given a bulldozer. The way the weapon system works is great - if this were in minecraft, it'd be like strapping 4 bows to your arms, but instead of arrows you shoot pickaxes to mine faster. And do you like that epic mansion you built in singleplayer? Why not save the blueprint and rebuild it in multiplayer? All you need are the resources. AMAZING. What's more, the game is free. FREE. Go and try it out, then pay for the game anyway because it's damn fun.\n\nTHESE DEVS CARE. Lots of updates, great community and massive potential. The game has a lot of great things in it, the core mechanics are solid and lots of different elements. Let's review some of the common comments:\n\nGreat multiplayer - valid (this game is built for sharing with friends or strangers)\nBoring single player - mixed (there's not much "to do" other than fight pirates, build spaceships and mine resources. There wasn't much to do in Minecraft in Beta either. Quests are coming.\nBugs - invalid (the game is free, try it first, and yeah it's an alpha)\n\nReal talk: you'll probably never build anything epic. You want to build the Enterprise? You won't. But you CAN download the blueprint. My only warning is that the game isn't optimised yet, and there are lag spikes even on recommended system requirements. Memory leaks are common in alphas and so I'm ok with this. Some funny bugs though, a trade guild convoy of about 5 ships crashed into a planet and was stuck. Dropped fps to about 1-5fps, practically unplayable, but also hilarious. Would lag again.","January 15, 2015","true","12.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","3","5","4","0"

I enjoy the creative aspect more than battles, and the scale of constructs is mind-boggling sometimes.\n\nI've had pleasant experiences with the community and other players - some of the ships and stations in-game were created by players and uploaded during contests.

Download and play. Decide for yourself.\n\n/TL;DR\n\n\n\nCaution: If you're creative minded, you may lose more time than you realised. I keep going to sleep at 5AM, thinking it's about 1AM when I FINALLY check the clock.\n\nFor the massive scale constructor in all of us. Game can be played for free though you can buy it now cheaply before they scale the price for release and get patch support after release (demo won't be updated). Literally "Early Access" I suppose.\n\nNot sure what the hell a voxel is? Never played Minecraft?\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel\n\nSo basically, this game is a giant sandbox where you do as you damn well please. Mine the materials, put out factory complexes, refine the materials...build an Imperial Star Destroyer?! You can be as imaginative as you want - build your ship in any way, shape or form that pleases you and hurts other people's eyes if you wish. Or as uncreative as you like - build famous ships straight out of sci-fi from X-Wings to the Enterprise to B-Wings to the Voyager, the Yamato, the Sunrider*, the Galactica...the list goes on. Hell, someone's building a Death Star space station. You can do that too - then host a server, get friends to join and wait for the "That's no moon..." quotes. For the reference, your character is a 1x2 figure. Now imagine the 10,000,000+ block ships some people have floating around. Yeah. Welcome to Starmade.\n\nCurrently no music in game. Might I recommend FTL: Faster Than Light's* soundtrack? xD\n\nWhat I'd kill for:\n- Assuming I haven't missed it, the ability to move entire planes up and down. Think of the X-Wing's attack and speed modes. Yeah, this would probably kill memory and likely will never happen, but I can dream right?\n- Better optimized lighting. Preferably a gamma setting. Current lights are a serious drain, especially in large numbers. Simplified lighting setting basically removes lighting altogether. (AFAIK, devs have said this is on the todo list)\n- ...less confusion. Oh granted, the game teaches you the basics well enough - mine this, refine that, build and laugh, but there's no advanced tutorial. Good luck to you trying to figure out how docking or turrets work.\n- 'Destroy' option for inventory. Assuming I haven't missed this too, can only seem to drop blocks. Can't destroy them. The game will happily solve this based on a timer by removing things from memory after a certain time/distance.\n- Control sensitivity options. It's beginning to annoy me that I can rarely (if ever) get my ship to be level with the hangar it's being constructed in. Can never seem to roll 'a bit' to the left or right to be level. >_>\n\n*Check Steam's store for these games. Sunrider is a (free) Visual Novel. FTL: Faster Than Light is an indie...RTS/RPG/Roguelike mashup? Can't describe it properly, draws from a lot of elements.\n\nDo I recommend it? Hell yes. If you're social, there's a ton of servers out there, albeit sparsely populated. If you're like me and like firing up sandbox games to get those creative neurons firing, you're not in this for the combat, you're here to make a giant spaceship. Besides, if you're in it for the combat, you'd want to play on a multiplayer server against other players anyway.","January 10, 2015","true","95.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A little glitchy due to beta stages and can lag quite badly if building/encountering large ships or you play on a low spec system. New rail system makes docking much easier,and the possibilites for moveable objects (i.e, landing pads that move into hangars,elevators, soild doors, etc) is now immense. Turret system is a little more complicated but once again its gives more options for design and construction of turrets.

You have to do it in presets that cost to much in-game money it starts feeling like the junk guy from Star Wars 64 racing game. This game lets you build ships, space colony ships, and even planets block by block. This game takes time to understand the fomula but if you love minecraft and space this game is for you. This is defenitly not for players looking for hardcore PVP and amazing graphics, but it is for those who are extremely creative or die hard fans of star trek, star wars, or star fox, hell just be a fan of stars period.\n\nIn my time I made my single player be about a woman whos possibly the last survivor of a space colony that blew up and she crashed landed on different planets then let my friends play it and see the story out. The game also lets you make factories so they build units and store them into a box while your out "please note that going to far from your galaxy or logging off a server will pause the units being made" and you can make complicated systems using the in-game tools. Want an R2D2, you can make it, want an arwing from StarFox you can make it. Seriously you can build like crazy here anything you want but I'm going to warn you about servers and enemies in a sec.\n\nServers can be really empty I mean even if theres 16 players online most are already in a faction or doing their own thing so if your like me and you made a peaceful little space bar/club and you advertise it, players might raid it or blow it up for fun. If you built a huge base on a planet far from everyone and even got rights to the planet dont be serprised if that server is down within a month of you playing. Servers either die off or restart everything due to updates. Personally what I did was test out a server, build a few things and add to it but not get emotionally invested in my creations. I also want to point out you can save all of your designs and copy/paste them in your game files! Lastly Enemies in the game are lock on killers. Seriously no sound as of yet to let you know your #$% is getting attacked and that motha@#$% gotta a cannon the size of godzillas dammmmmmn! Enemies lock on way to robotically and fast so when you see the sign [respawn] you realise what happened and cuss your screen off. BTW if your ship blows up that it... no more ship unless you saved the blueprints and build another one.\n\nIf your just starting the game a huge tip is to look for a server that gives you a lot of [credits] and has a high "mph" so you can learn to build and explore faster. Also if your completely new to the game I highly suggest looking for a quick tutorial video on youtube. The tutorial ingame is so wall of text you'd reread my reveiw 5 times and still wouldn't complian.

Said messages are impossible to toggle off, and will dominate the screen every thirty seconds, just in case you've forgotten about them. You won't, no matter how hard you try.\n\nThe tutorial, it doesn't even fill that basic capacity. Vague, confusing item descriptions.\n\nShipbuilding, if you manage to get that far without crashing or lagging and then freezing, is extremely vague, but I will concede that might be part of my frustraition in even getting that far.\n\nIt usually gets to about that point consistently in the tutorial, and then the game lags, freezes, and crashes, or just generally freezes for fifteen minutes and dumps you on a barren asteroid in bumble**** nowhere, should you decide to abort the tutorial, out of concern the tutorial might be the problem.\n\nEats up RAM, regardless of settings. I mean, 8 gigs is PLENTY to work with. This isn't Fallout 4 we're playing here.\n\nApparently, there's quite a bit of fun to be had in this game, according to other reviews and videos I've watched, but I haven't found it at all. Extremely frustrating. Here's to hoping it gets better in the future, because from everything I've seen, there's so much potential here.

However, the team of developers is small and despite trying to keep to a two weekly release schedule of updates, they don't make it as often as they make it. In fact, they haven't released anything in a month and the last few updates only consistent of small bugfixes and the updates before that consistent of a completely buggy "Fleet" system that makes my ships rubberband like crazy and has extreme limitations. Schine claimed to be done with the fleet system over the course of several updates, but this is ridiculous.\n\nI could wholeheartedly recommed this game if it had regular updates and felt like it comes closer to at least the beta (after being years in the alpha), but as it stands, you are better off not buying it.","May 21","false","239.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","1"

I don't mean the controlls of how the game works, i mean the buttons on my keyboard.\nEven the customizational buttons like "walk forward" can be double bound with a button that has nothing to do with what you are looking for.\nWhy would that even be possible.

I'm confused.........\n\nany help would really be appreciated... I've even turned down all the settings and still, nothing but glitchy sound and really choppy video. Thanks. happy gaming!","January 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","3"

It's VERY early beta/alpha and I don't expect much of it right now. But I have high hopes of this game. The in-depth system's and territory system couple lead to a massive community when given the chance (MMO maybe?)\n\n-Right now the weapon's just don't feel right and you don't feel like you have the power to wreak havoc upon a ship or destroy it quickly with major caliber weapons. That being said this game needs a quick overhaul on some graphics and some music (music is something I think every game needs and it's a lil bland without it)\n\n-There are some bugs that don't help the game out, like when I logout inside a ship that ship disappears\n\nAt this point I don't have much to say about the game and I wouldn't recommend it.

The tutorial locked up on me, and I was unable to quit it, and thus, was unable to move. I had to wipe everything and try again, skipping the tutorial right from the start. Realistic graphics are obviously bugging out, because textures were cycling. Turning on shadows turns the world into a dark, muddy mess with characters becoming creepy silhouettes. I ended up just having to put everything on simple graphics because the "realistic" options made it look terrible. No improvement in preformance from doing that, either, but at least it didn't look high definition posters glued on to a bunch of cubes.\n\nShip building is easy, but early ship possibilities are unimpressive and ugly. Controls are rather simple but the physics are wonky. My ship got tapped and was sent into space, with no easy decernable way to get back to it. Larger planets constantly load and reload, bogging down the server.\n\nI decided to uninstall since I wasn't having any fun. Maybe I'll revisit it later, but for now it's just too buggy and underwhelming.","August 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","17","38","0","4"

The problem is they created the game from the ground up without Intel cards in mind, resulting in a game that is broken for many people. Shame on them for selling people a game that people had to bend over backwards just to get it to start up, and for not even mentioning the problem until after we bought it. A game should be sold so that people can run it WITHOUT having to waste time fixing it to run, and if not, they should at least inform you of the problem before you buy it. Stop expecting people to bend over backwards to run your game and just fix it yourselves. I don't care if you have to rebuild it from the ground up, I payed money for this game and I have been hoping that it will eventually work so long that I can no longer get a refund. JUST FIX IT!!!\n\nThis is like selling a game on an iphone, and then telling them that it doesn't work on their device AFTER they buy it. The only difference is that Apple usually forces the developer to stop ripping iphone users off and fix the problem themselves.\n\nYou want my advice? Buy Minecraft while it's on sale, get a free space mod. It may not be as good, but at least it will work as soon as you install it.","June 18, 2015","false","1.9"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","9","22","0","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/recommended/244770/","goldenagegmr","GAGMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/","425 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is confusing.  You will not know what to do when you first turn the game on & it will take you some time (hours or longer) to figure out exactly how to do things.\n\nAlso, ignore the 0.1 hours played since I've not been playing the game through Steam.\n\nThe game starts you out near a shop in the middle of space.  The tutorial broke for me so I couldn't use it.  I had to figure out everything by experimentation & through guides online.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is build a ship & you have no idea how to do it.  I spent 4 hours figuring out how to build a ship with some long video showing me only to have it vaporize once I went into a warp.  Not only did I just waste 4 hours of my time I ended up pennyless with no ship stranded at the starting area.  After a lot of frustration I ended up making a smaller ship after selling what little materials I had left & went to my first planet which was kind of cool in a way.  The planets aren't really planets in a sense.  More like, several pieces with their own gravity stuck together.  If you walk around you'll see dead drops & if you jump over the drop you'll be pulled down by the other sides gravity.  Sort of like a janky Super Mario Galaxy.  Only half the planet had any atmosphere & it was always the half facing the sun which I didn't understand why they did this until I realized the side with atmosphere is supposed to be daytime while the space sky is night.  I guess it works but it's wierd looking up & seeing half day/night skies.\n\nLater, I relogged in to find my ship was gone.  Then as I searched around for it I realized it had spawned in the middle of the planet I logged out of which is kind of funny.  Here's a video of the experience.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Zp4JUkF5_1E\n\nBeen playing the game a bit more & harvesting asteroids with a new ship I made which seems to be the easiest way to make money.  Harvest & then sell what you gather.  Managed to build myself a half decent ship as well even though it's unfinished.  The whole thing still rather confusing.  I don't really know what I need to get hyperdrive working properly so my ship doesn't vaporize. I'm probably not gonna be trying that again for a while. Exploring that far away might not be worth it yet anyways.\n\nThis game also has performance issues.  Being an Alpha build I guess that is to be expected because the game runs badly & locks up on me at random moments.  Usually it locks up during the first loading sequence or when I shoot something for the first time.  If you're running a lower end machine I really don't recommend running anything on high settings.  I tried having shadows on High & it dropped my FPS down to single digits.\n\nIf you do decide to buy it, do it to either support the devs or to see it through it's development cycle.  If you do plan on playing this game expect to spend several hours trying to figure out how to do anything because it's currently very confusing.  Hopefully the tutorial won't break for you like it did for me.  There's a lot of potential here & I'll probably end up playing this game more in the future & when it gets better overall.","August 14, 2015","false","0.0"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","15"

Most games I can set the settings in nvidia to automatically switch to nvidia card or to internal intel. But this game does not get detected and setting it manually in nvidia does not do anything because the game will still try loading on the internal graphics regardless if you force load the nvidia card while the game plays. And disabling the intel graphics just mean you get new problems loading. It looked like it tried loading on a graphics card that does not exist, and removing and reinstalling does not work.

And yes, I know it is in Early access.\nJust saying this for people who look for a game more near to final release.\n\n"Keep an eye on this, it might become really good - just not recommendable enough YET"\n\n\nSo far it's mostly some smaller things - but as said, especially controls bugging me\n\n* Mouse wheel direction for scrolling through action bar cannot be reverted\n* ... also does sometimes "jump" back instead of forward when scrolling too fast\n* Sounds stop working after a couple of minutes, only ambient stays on\n* Having several mining beams does still seem to be buggy, as only one of them actually mines, both in individual and combined mode\n* When flying around, ships gets slower. But there is no friction in space... (or just make counter-thruster toggable in general, see SE)\n* UI is improvable and like making it scalable and more readable font. Also stuff like available (and direction of) gravity would be helpful.\n* Button to switch "jetpack" on/off would also help.","September 5, 2015","false","3.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","6"

I would expect that a space sim should be made for exploration but the slow speed does not help with that. You also have no ingame mechanism for speeding up your ship except for the jump drives. You have to resort to hacking the config files. Would have liked it if I could rather add more thrusters to gain speed or at least build different kinds of thrusters. You are in constant search for the right kind of minerals if you want to make anything advance. You cannot place factories on your ship which means if you wanted to explore and get equipment at the same time then you're screwed. I cannot recommend this game to anyone.

I am writing this post on 12/20/2015 and the game was launched over a year ago via Early Access on 11/27/2014. Over a year later and the core mechanics of this game are still completely and utterly unstable.\n\nJava simply can’t run everything these developers want to do. Beefed out servers hold and run a nice small set of players mining and building, but as soon as it is time for anything more than that get ready to have even the most technologically sophisticated servers buckle under the pressure. My group’s latest attempt to get back into this game netted us server crashes and pings in excess of4k - 10k for one player simply attacking a Pirate station.  Not some sort of galactic struggle for dominance, but a simple PvE interaction between one player.\n\nI’d love to spend a hefty amount of time here to write more, but it just doesn’t feel worth my time. The developers seem to still be making updates, but are focusing on non-critical items to this game such as the problem mentioned above. This game would be quite a bit of fun if the core mechanics worked properly and it is a darn shame that they don’t.\n","December 20, 2015","false","58.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","3"
