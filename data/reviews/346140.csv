Since there isn't, I'm giving this game bundle a 'yes,' but only barely. Unlike the poster before me, I was able to download and run the games with no trouble (I'm using a laptop with Windows 7). I have different opinions on each game in the bundle, so I'm going to break my review into a section for each game.\n_________________________________\nMountain Crime Requital. Overall Rating: 3/5\n\nPlot: 2/5. You play a doctor who has been summoned to a secluded mountain resort, under the pretense that the owner has suffered a heart attack. Once there, you realize that the owner is nowhere to be found, and the other guests start turning up dead.\n\nVoice Acting: 0/5. The voice acting in this game is horrid to the point of being remarkable.\n\nArtwork: 3/5. The characters look awful, but if you can ignore them, the overall scenery is decent.\n\nPuzzles and HOS: 4/5. The puzzles aren't bad (some may find them too easy). The hidden object scenes are set up so that you have to locate objects in order to assemble an item you need.The scenes are drawn nicely and are not too dark or full of unnecessary clutter. Occasionally there is an item that has been named strangely due to mistranslation.\n\nGetting Around: 3/5. You are provided with a map of the resort, and when you open it, it will indicate areas in which there are actions to be performed. Unfortunately you cannot click on the areas and be instantly transported, so there is a great deal of backtracking.\n_______________________\nWeird Park: Broken Tune. Overall Rating: 4/5\n\nPlot: 2/5. You play a journalist who is sent to investigate the disappearance of a fellow journalist at an abandoned circus. Once there, you begin having random sightings of a ghost clown and a midget dressed as a harlequin. As for the midget, he is supposed to be more than he seems, and is linked to a broken music record, which you find shards of throughout the game. Although he is supposed to be a major factor in the disappearances, the only interaction you ever have with him is seeing him darting around walls.\n\nVoice Acting: N/A. Your character doesn't have any conversations with anyone.\n\nArtwork: 3/5. The characters leave much to be desired. The overall scenery looks nice though.\n\nPuzzles and HOS: 4/5. The puzzles are pretty good (some may find them too easy). As for the HOS, some are typical HOS, in which you locate various items, while others require you to find broken parts in order to assemble a useful item. The HOS are nicely done.\n\nGetting Around: 1/5. There is no map provided, and there is a great deal of backtracking in order to figure out what you are supposed to do next.\n________________________________________\nBehind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge. Overall Rating: 0/5. I was unable to complete this game due being unable to find items that are needed in order to progress.\n\nPlot: ?/5. This game is a sequel, so why wasn't the first game in the series included in the bundle? You play a mother who defeated a wicked witch in the first game, and now the witch has used her magic to escape jail, and has absconded with your son’s soul by using mirrors as portals.\n\nVoice Acting: N/A. From what little I did play, there seems to be no voice acting.\n\nArtwork: 3/5. The characters and their animations are poorly done. The scenery itself is nice though.\n\nPuzzles and HOS: 0/5. Unfortunately the niceness of the art is trumped by the issues I (and other players whose comments I found on various forums) have with being able to find items we need to continue playing. The items are often hidden to the point of being too difficult to locate amidst clutter and things of the same color. To make the matters worse, is the hint feature in the game proved useless for me. I got stuck and clicked for a hint. It directed me to go in the church. I went in the church and clicked the hint again. Instead of showing me what to do in the church, it directed me to go back outside, over and over. On top of it all, I could not find a strategy guide anywhere online either.\n\nGetting Around: 1/5. There is no map provided. Plus there is a great deal of backtracking to find items (or parts of items) you need.\n_______________________________________\nVampire Saga: Pandora's Box. Overall Rating: 4/5\n\nPlot: 3/5. In this game you bounce between playing a young man and his grandfather. You start in the 1950s as the young man getting a bizarre phone call from grandpa, in which he sounds distressed, and is claiming to have just killed a woman. You rush over to his house, and once you make it upstairs, you find grandpa has barricaded the bedroom door with furniture. He is outside the door, still insisting that he has shot a woman. He goes on to indicate that he knows this woman from years ago, and that she has tracked him down. It is then that the gameplay switches, and you are playing grandpa as a young man during the Spanish-American War. He is a deserter, who has stowed away on a ship. Unfortunately this ship is carrying dangerous cargo.\n\nVoice Acting: N/A. The dialogue between characters is all text.\n\nArtwork. 2/5. The characters are expressionless, rigid mannequins. Scenery is okay.\n\nPuzzles and HOS: 2/5. Puzzles are okay (some may find them too easy). The HOS vary in enjoyability. I found myself having to use the hint feature an awful lot because some of the HOS were dark, so items were hard to see. In others the items were hidden behind things to the point only a tiny sliver of the items were visible. In others the items were placed on the very edges of the frame, so they were barely visible. Additionally, there are some items that are incorrectly translated to English.\n\nGetting Around: 2/5. There is no map, and there is a huge amount of back and forth between areas. You will find yourself too often wandering between areas trying to figure out what to do next. In these instances, the hint feature will simply tell you "There is nothing to do here right now," instead of directing you to the area you need to be. Sometimes reading your journal will tell you what you need to do, but not often enough.\n______________________________________\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town. Overall Rating: 2/5\n\nPlot: 1/5. You play a man who is washed ashore after a boating accident involving him and his girlfriend. The town he discovers is within a dense fog, and is strangely deserted. The man believes his girlfriend must be somewhere on this island, so he embarks on a mission to find her. During his explorations, he finds evidence of a serpent cult, yet journals of missing residents and other shipwrecked people describe victims being transformed into fish folk with gills. I’m trying to see the connection.\n\nVoice Acting: N/A. In this game, the only dialogue is between the protagonist and his girlfriend at the beginning, and it is all done via text.\n\nArtwork: 4/5. Of all the games, I think this one had the best artwork. Though the characters still looked like mannequins. The scenery was very nice.\n\nPuzzles and HOS: 4/5. Puzzles were okay. The HOS were well done- items were detailed, and some cunningly hidden, but still able to be found.\n\nGetting Around: 1/5. There is no map, and there are a lot of different areas to visit, multiple times. So you will spend an enormous amount of time backtracking. The hint feature is helpful in that it will light up an arrow and direct you where to go.\n","March 2, 2015","true","18.4"," 52 of 57 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","52","57","2","10"

The fourth and still no end?\nBehind the Reflection 2\n\nThis game is a bit older and actually it shows. The style in which the HOS are built are innovative but sadly this game is quite bugged. When you manage to get it going, try to play it. The story is a bit, well... not the best of all stories involved in HOG.\n\nPro:  Decent graphics and sound for an older Hidden Object Game.\nSome of the riddles or puzzles are more challenging than others.\nCon:  The game is incredibly bug ridden, you'll have to finetune it for yourself if you want to enjoy the game at all.\nQuirky Hint system ... If you want to enjoy the game without any gamebreaking bugs, I advise not to use the hint function at all. I encountered twice at a puzzle that the skip function caused a bug to hang the puzzle up.\nMountain Crime Requital\n\nThe game has some nice graphics and a really weird murder mystery as backdrop story. I encountered one bug during gameplay, which might have to do with OS. The cutscenes of the final part were badly out of sync, but the game was still nice to play, even though there were some things that weren't giving a perfect gaming experience.\n\nPro:  Good graphics and Soundtrack.\nThe HOS play slightly different to other HOG's you have to search for stuff to get things in working order.\nRiddles which are either challenging or very easy.\nCon:  If you want to say so, it's at times disturbing. This game has corpses galore...\nVampire Saga - Pandora's Box\n\nFirst, this game play best in windowed mode. Then it has a lot of stuff that gives the game as a whole an inadequate game feeling. In my opininion it's one of the weakest titles as HOG's go and probably the weakest title on this bundle. (There are still two other titles who might get this honor, if I have to say.) The story in itself, well - meh, everthing superfically cut and pasted to make some ... let's just say, it's on a margin above the HOG "The Flying Dutchman" ok?\n\nPro: N/A\n\nCon:  Runs perfectly in windowed mode, if you play it otherwise it looks crappy and is having some lag troubles.\nNo voiceacting.\nNot even a story that keeps you on your heels, looking for more suspense.\nEncountered some bugs during play. Minor, at least with this you won't have a big disappointment.\nWeird Park - Broken Tune\n\nDon't even touch this game if you suffer from coulrophobia (fear of clowns) because it has a story that is ladden with clown and fun park stuff...\n\nActually this game isn't as bad, though some solutions do need a lot more footwork than you might feel justified. The game has also a tendency to crash at some point. But that might also come from another reason. I am torn between seeing the good and the bad stuff in this game.\n\nPro: Change of pace because of some sinister backdrops.\nNice and decent graphics.\nInteresting story. At least in my opinion this wasn't wasted.\nCons: Crashing at some times, but at least the autosave is working perfectly and I didn't encounter any bug that corrupted the savegame file.\nToo much running around in this game... it's at times annoying, but you need to do it and revisit some HOS at least three times.\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town\n\nSinister Tale of a couple out on the coast of Spain when suddenly something unexpected happens. And another nice twist of the story at the end of the game.\n\nPros:Nice story with a male protagonist.Nice Graphics.Nice and challenging puzzles.\nCons:A lot of actuall footwork...Sadly doesn't support modern resolutions.\nFinal Verdict: Recommended\nThe games are all playable, some of them are classics of the Hidden Object Genre, and I didn't encounter any big troubles, actually all games were easily finetuned if there was a need to do this.","July 29, 2015","true","33.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/346140/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1 is a collection of five hidden object games. In chronological order, it was the first appearance of each game on Steam. However, Weird Park Trilogy was released (containing Weird Park: Broken Tune), Mountain Crime: Requital followed as a stand-alone before Twisted Land Trilogy finally arrives.\n\nWeird Park: Broken Tune\n\nYou're investigating the disappearance of a journalist in an abandoned fair park. However, a little gnome seems to prevent you to discover what happened... because everything seems tied to the death of Louis Gauche, a clown that lost his life during a representation... Besides, you'll find scattered around parts of a music disk, what is it meaning?\n\nHere's what I wrote about the game in my Weird Park Trilogy review:  I enjoyed the dark settings and the soundtrack. But I had an hard time to find my way sometimes, relaying on the hint buttons. Besides, the ending was promising a real good sequel.\n\nIndeed, Weird Park: Broken Tune is my favorite game from the bundle because of its unique atmosphere. The graphics were reflecting the fact that something bad happened and that paranormal activity was perhaps also involved. The gameplay was well-balanced too.\n\nFor more information about Weird Park Trilogy, I suggest you to read my review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/372260\n\nMountain Crime: Requital\n\nYou're called by a patient of yours to an hotel build on the ashes of a children hospice that suffered a tragedy. However, customers began dying... and they're all tied to that tragedy...\n\nThe game was my second favorite from the bundle, though I found a little longer and though the gameplay is different from the others, as you're gathering items in a scene that you need to build an object for an action.\n\nAs I've already reviewed the game and that I fear that copying/pasting it here will make me reach a characters limit for the review, I prefer to give you the link to it: http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/394680\n\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town\n\nAfter a problem in the middle of the sea, you end up in a strange town, with your wife being dragged by an unknown man. What terrible secret will you uncover?\n\nI must admit that while I enjoyed another somber story (the game is during the night, in a foggy town, with many mysteries around), I was quite confused about it. Given the twist at the end, I thought that it was a second opus in a series. In reality, it is really the first in the trilogy.\n\nHere's an extract of my Twisted Land Trilogy review: The plot of the first game is perhaps basic but with all the questions arising during your quest and the fact you're seeing ghosts, you bet that there is a dark cult under it. Though the end tells you how Mark came on the Island, which is a shocking twist, playing it a second time had made more understanding of the story than the first time. The graphics are correct, the soundtrack is also too, but the problem is that you're doing a lot of backtracking for an object.\n\nFor more information about the trilogy, read my review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/398630\n\nBehind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge\n\nAfter defeating a witch, she's ready to take revenge on you through your innocent son. Will you manage to save his soul?\n\nI was quickly bored with this game. Given the fact that it was a direct sequel to another game, I felt like I was missing something. Based on the same gameplay of Mountain Crime, I didn't really enjoy it - I played Behind the Reflection 2 before Mountain Crime. The items weren't easy to find, though the puzzles were well-balanced.\n\nThe graphics were correct, though the soundtrack didn't let me a memory.\n\nVampire Saga: Pandora's Box\n\nWhy is your grandfather hiding a young girl and seems scared of her? What happened in his past? Did he really meet vampires?\n\nThe plot is alternating between the present and the past of your grandpa. It means that you're alternating between a cosy house and an old boat. And that game, while not being a total disaster, is the worst in the bundle. I found it very ridiculous, some dialogues are coming from uninspired minds and it becomes a parody of some sorts. It wasn't always easy to find your way around. The graphics were correct, that's true, but it does not save the game in my eyes. I really wondered why this joke was put in a bundle\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI really enjoyed that bundle, well, at least for 3 games. I can't say that the two other games weren't appreciated but I was quickly bored with them, even if I got an hard time with Twisted Land. The question is: should you buy the bundle when three of them are on Steam, with Twisted Land and Weird Park being in their trilogy and with Mountain Crime being a stand-alone? If I had written the review earlier, I would have say that you had to buy it. However, now, the bundle could be seen as not worthy.\n\nIn reality, for the price, it's worthy to buy it and to try at least Twisted Land and Weird Park. Indeed, their trilogy are nearly 20 euros while the bundle is half the price. I will admit something: it's because I've played them in the bundle that I bought the two trilogies nearly at their release.  Else I would have activated them from a bundle or would have waited for a discount. As for Mountain Crime in my library, the reason is called "trading cards" and "badge". The two other games are only on Steam in this bundle.\n\nI will not change my mind: Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1 is still a bundle of five games and is still worthy of any purchase. True, for those already owning the three games through the trilogies and the stand-alone game, the bundle isn't at all interesting. For the others, it's still a good bargain, at least, you will know if you like Twisted Land and Weird Park and if buying the trilogies could be a future action.","March 17","true","14.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/346140/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Right off the bat I will say that if you’re a fan of hidden object games then this is a great bundle for you. You get five games for a great low price and each one offers something different.\n\nMountain Crime: Requital\n\nA game you can buy and play separately on Steam now in a bundle. Your character is a doctor that was invited to a hotel to treat someone but things start to go terribly wrong. There is a snow storm, dead bodies galore and an ending that will either shock you or down right make you laugh. It’s not the best story but I found enjoyable for the sheer absurdity of it all.\n\nThe game play is a little different from other hidden object games. The hidden object scenes are not aimless clicking for a list of items, you’re actually looking for important pieces making each scene fit better into the storyline itself. The art is dated but not bad, the voice acting his laughable and the soundtrack is fitting. While not a masterpiece it was my favorite out of the five.\n\nWeird Park: Broken Tune\n\nMy second favorite of the bundle and another game you can purchase on its own on Steam. I found it to be insanely creepy but that’s because I highly dislike clowns. The story isn’t too creepy, though. You play a detective investigating a series of deaths at an amusement park. Once there you find out there is more than meets the eye as the park is haunted by a ghost clown and Loki.\n\nThe game play is very basic, good ole fashioned hidden object scenes along with challenge mini games and puzzles. The artwork is fitting for the dark atmosphere mixed with unsettling music as well. The voice acting is nothing to write home about but the game is good enough where that doesn’t matter. This game is the first in a trilogy which you can also find on Steam.\n\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town\n\nI liked this game, it wasn’t amazing in any way but I enjoyed playing it. This is the first in a trilogy which you can purchase on Steam and the name is very fitting. The game starts off simply enough, you’re on a boat with your wife after you just went diving on treasure until things go awry and and you find your boat in shambles and your wife missing while you’re on an unknown island. Everything else is pretty confusing. You keep seeing ghosts, clues you find point in different directions, there really is no clear danger at all until the very end and there is no interactions whatsoever. I did like the ending, though, I saw it coming but I still liked it.\n\nThe game has fun hidden object scenes as well as puzzles and mini games. The game doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel. You can get through the game in one sitting, it’s not very long or involved but still enjoyable. The art is alright, not the best. No voice acting but the music worked. It’s a very middle of the road game.\n\nBehind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge\n\nAnd now we get to the bottom rung games of the bundle. This game is not bad but it’s also not good. It’s a sequel to a game I did not play and is not on Steam, however, at the beginning they give you a brief run down of the first game. In this game the witch you put in jail before has escaped and returned for revenge by taking your son’s soul. You set off on a rather boring mission to find her, defeat her and save your son. The game has you going through portals to very weird lands and even different time periods as you chase after her all of which are kind of outlandish and seem to have very little to do with you or the witch aside from Salem.\n\nThe hidden object element of the game is a little different. Each time you look for an item it’s part of a puzzle, so you find pieces of armor that you need to put together for a skeleton or a windmill or a sword. Also mixed in are more traditional hidden object scenes as well as plenty of mini games. I didn’t have any issues with the game play, though some of the objects were hard to find just because of the artwork or where they were placed. No voice acting and the art is kind of meh, but not a bad game for a bundle.\n\nVampire Saga: Pandora's Box\n\nLast but not least, my more disliked game in the bunch. Unfortunately I played this one first because I saw the word vampire and got excited. This is the first in a trilogy not available on Steam currently. I found the story to be utter garbage. You start of as Tyler who rushes to his grandfather’s house because there is some big trouble going on. Then you switch to playing grandpa as he retells his story of stowing away on a boat trying to get back to America. The crew dies and you’re trying to figure out why and it’s just not interesting. You save a girl name Laura and protect her from the likes of an evil mummy, yeah a mummy. The game doesn’t even mention vampires until right near the end. More happens but I don’t want to spoil it, I just didn’t like it.\n\nGame play was another thing I did not like. Usually if the game plays well I can somewhat look past a bad story but this didn’t even get that right. There are plenty of hidden object scenes, you’ll be revisiting the same ones over and over and over again so don’t worry. There are barely any puzzles or mini games to help break up the monotony and there is a ton of back tracking with no map or easy teleport feature. I didn’t point this out in any other games because it wasn’t as big of an issue but in this game, the back tracking is super frustrating. No voice acting, probably for the best, and really drab music.\n\nIn my opinion you get two good games, two decent games and one bad game which isn’t a bad deal for the price.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","December 13, 2015","true","13.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

The games are older and thus don't have a lot of the "extra perks" that you can find in newer games, but all in all definitely worth the price.  These are Alawar games that follow the same style as the Artifex Mundi games (HO combined with point-and-click and puzzles).\n\nI have had no difficulties getting all of the games to play on my new laptop; either the problems experienced by other reviewers have been resolved or were possibly isolated issues.\n\nAs I said, these are older games with fewer bells and whistles.

One game crashes at the start screen, known bug for some time and nothing appears to be happening to fix it any time soon. So I'll base my review on the other 4 games I have finished.\n\nMountain Crime feels like the newest with the better graphics and general feel. This is the only 1 of the 4 that gives you a map to jump from location to location, which is very much appreciated.\n\nVampire Saga, Weird Park and Twisted Lands all show their age in graphics and game play. No maps means quite a bit of clicking back through rooms/areas, annoying but not too terrible.\n\nThe logic puzzles are easy enough for the most part. The hidden objects are also mostly easy, with only one or two items that might escape you at first due to odd naming or dual names e.g. brush could mean paintbrush, artist brush, scrub brush or broom (any two may be in a scene), but the lack of real penalty means this is also easily overcome.\n\nOverall, the games have good stories, twists and endings. They are a good length for this genre. The graphics are not too bad if you can bare the resolution and keep in mind the age of the games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/recommended/346140/","emblemparade","Emblem Parade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/","3124 products in account","The bundle is worth buying and offers good value for fans of hidden-object games. The individual games are not stellar, but most are pretty good. They are all straightforward games: none of them have achievements or bonus chapters.\n\nBehind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge. Note that you can play the first episode for free (with ads) on Android, and I indeed recommend that you start there. Both offer a forgettable, very dumb story with many hidden-object scenes and puzzle/mini-games, but no real point-and-click adventuring. The hidden-object system is innovative, but ultimately annoying. Behind the Reflection 2 is longer, but is also woefully unbalanced, with some of the puzzles being ridiculously easy, and others frustratingly hard. I used the "skip" button a few times. This is the worst game in the bundle. (The first free episode is actually better.)\n\nMountain Crime: Requital. The hidden-object scenes use an innovative system, but it ends up being far too simple. Otherwise, the puzzles are OK and the gameplay interesting enough. The story is quite intriguing: various clues left around can help you figure out the mystery, though you can just wait patiently and have all revealed in the end. The dialog and voice acting are atrocious, but that's the norm for this genre.\n\nVampire Saga: Pandora's Box. Though the resolution is low, and there are no animations nor voice acting, this is a solid, satisfying HOG. The hidden-object scenes are challenging, even hard, but usually fair. There is good point-and-click adventuring to be had, and a handful of puzzles. The story, though predictable, is revealed in a restrained pace, carefully building up on the atmosphere, well-crafted with graphics and music. The timing of the cut scenes is very slow, possibly due to using a "modern" OS, but just be patient and you will get through them. It's worth it for this lovely, understated little story.\n\nWeird Park: Broken Tune. A classic HOG, with good scenes and gameplay. If you play it in expert mode, you will get quite a decent point-and-click adventure that requires logical thought. The background story is spooky, but doesn't take itself too seriously, and there a few jokes. Fun!\n\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town. Though there are a few excellent hidden-object scenes, and a handful of mini-game puzzles, this game is primarily a good point-and-click adventure set against a nicely designed and scripted spooky atmosphere. No voice acting, but that also means no *terrible* voice acting, which is too common in this genre. The one flaw is that there is quite a lot of backtracking to be done for the point-and-click work. Still, this might be the best game in the bundle.","June 17, 2015","true","30.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/346140/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1 is yet another series of Hidden Object games. As such, gameplay is conducted in fairly the same way as all the others: You get a first person view of scenes and you navigate with your mouse by pointing and clicking. Through the story you will find hidden object games, puzzles where you need to move pieces, or find pieces, or find pieces and then move pieces, and so on and so forth.\n\nThe bundle contains 5 games, I'll be quoting the store page here:\n\n"Behind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge\nA witch's quest for revenge spells trouble for a young mother and her son in this haunting hidden object adventure! Guide the mother as she pursues the witch through time and space to save her son from a fate worse than death. Interact with a variety of characters, find useful objects, and then use the items to solve cunning puzzles. [...]\n\nMountain Crime: Requital\nSomeone is killing the guests at a mountain resort, and you could be next if you don't solve the mystery at the heart of this chilling thriller! Take the role of a doctor who's summoned to a remote hotel to tend to a patient, and hold on to your sanity as you discover the first victim moments upon arriving at the retreat. [...]\n\nVampire Saga: Pandora's Box\nWith a chilling crime at the center of its spellbinding story, Vampire Saga is not intended for the faint of heart. Join Matthew Ward as he steals aboard a cargo ship to escape the violence of the Spanish-American War, passes out and then wakes up to find himself alone with several sinister-looking coffins. [...]\n\nWeird Park: Broken Tune\nTake the role of a private detective hired to investigate a rash of "accidental" deaths that befell those who worked at the park before city officials shut it down. Search for clues as you explore creepy carnival environments, solve puzzles as you pursue a mysterious joker down shadowy paths, and find hidden objects that can help you solve the mystery of a portal that leads to a realm beyond insanity.[...]\n\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town\n[...] Welcome to Twisted Lands: Shadow Town, the first game in a new saga that will explore the emotion of fear. Guide the actions of a man as he searches a deserted island for his wife, who disappeared when their boat crashed on the shore. Along the way, gather hidden items, solve hair-raising puzzles and make one spine-chilling discovery after another as you draw ever closer to a shocking conclusion!"\n\nBecause they're all mostly the same in general terms, I'll be reviewing them as one item.\n\nThe puzzles are extremely easy to solve. In fact, in one of them I was solving them so fast I kept glitching the game every time I would get the reward or need to move a piece - they would end up disappearing and I had to go back to the menu and back into the game to get the item.\n\nYou can tell some of the games are older. The game play where you don't have a decent map in half of them, the graphic design as well are easy indicators, some don't even have voice acting (and trust me when I say: that's almost a blessing lol). This doesn't mean they're bad, but it makes them challenging and more annoying as you need to backtrack several times to find your way to things. this isn't necessarily bad if you don't mind all the back tracking, and in a way sort of makes up for the easy puzzles, but for me it just didn't cut it. I missed having a map (I think only a few had them), and more than that, I missed using the map to fast-travel to locations. Those items were a looot of clicking away.\n\nStory-wise they've done nothing new. Someone close to you gets lost, you're trapped somewhere, gotta find them or/and a way out... and all of a sudden you're a pretty dumb human who can't do anything. "Gee, I'm trapped in this room in a creepy old house, and I think there's a key under the ashes; but wait! I can't just sweep the ashes by hand!! I need something to sweep them out of the way!"\nScrew that, I'm sticking my hands in if that key can get me out. And if for some reason I didn't really want my hands all ashy, I'd grab the nearst thing to get the key out, not go through 50 different things to get to a sweeper. :P\nThat, however, is a fault all HOG games suffer from (and I do mean all of them), so if you're into them you should be used to it by now.\n\nVisually speaking the areas and the hidden object scenes are quite lovely. I liked all the details, the items were neither too hard nor too easy to spot, and they didn't go out of their way to hide them in ridiculous places, most the time. Characters, however, were rather hit and miss, leaning heavily on the creepy side of 'miss'.\nThe music and sounds were fairly good too, but the voice acting was truly, truly terrible.\n\nIf you're a fan of Hidden Object games, I would still definitely recommend this bundle despite its shortcomings. If you aren't, they might still be a good enough place to start, as they are better than the average - and hey! you get 5 in 1! ;)","July 8, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But, they certainly aren't top tier.  Of the five games, two of them I found to be unplayable:\n\n- Vampire Saga:  Pandora's Box.  I stopped playing after 20 minutes.  The graphics are too bad (low resolution) so it's very hard to see the objects in HOGs.  Also, there are some very blatant translation issues ("founded objects" instead of "found objects," "can't go ashore" instead of "can't go upstairs").\n\n-  Behind the Reflection 2:  Witch's Revenge.  The story is so unbelievably bad that brain cells were dying as I played.  I had to stop after about a half an hour.\n\nThe remaining three games are playable, though not all that good.  In increasing order of "goodness" they are:\n\n- Twisted Lands:  Shadow Town:  I got about 5.6 hours of almost tolerable gameplay out of this.  The biggest problem is that the story is pretty bad and the ending makes no sense.  I thought that was because the game is part of a series.  But, this is the first in the series (Shadow Town, Insomniac, and Origin).  Even ignoring the nonsensical ending on the assumption that it's explained in later games, the story is full of holes (gaps and logic errors).  Plus, the protagonist is a cad.  Other things:  the graphics aren't that great, there's no voice acting, the HOGs are foggy, fairly colorless, and too small (far away?  resolution issue?).  In-HOG issues: 1) won't accept an actual ships wheel, but will take the shadow of one just below it, 2) an electric fan not acceptable, but a paper fan just in front of it is, 3) a spade is not a shovel, 4) hedge clippers are not pruning shears.  Closely related in-story issues are 1) pliers don't cut fences, and 2) a microchip is not RAM.  More seriously, at one point there's an open electrical switch (the old Frankenstein type of switch) that works underwater.  For game mechanics, the diary sometimes gets populated when entering an area and not necessarily when things are encountered.  Also, HOGs get re-activated without story-driven reasons to return to an area.  You spend a LOT of time going back and forth across the island retrieving things and just looking to see if a HOG has re-activated.\n\n- Weird Park:  Broken Tune:  I got about 4.6 hours of tolerable gameplay out of this.  There's no voice acting except the introduction narration, but two characters go through speaches with us but they're just text dialog.  The graphics are pretty good, the HOGs are good but simple, and most of the mini-games are good.  But three were hard for me (square flipping, rotation, and tune memory).  One bug I saw was that I needed a hair dryer at one point but it wouldn't let me use it.  Exited and restarted and it worked.  The biggest problem with the game is the story:  it's very weak.  The first half is reasonable though thin.  But the second half seemed to come out of the blue and just ramble.\n\n- Mountain Crime: Requital:  I got about 5.3 hours of tolerable gameplay out of this.  First, the good:  the HOGs and mini-games are well done (the HOGs are interesting in that they're sort of Fractured Object Games (FROGs) but with whole objects instead of shards).  The plot is complex and interesting.  Now the bad:  even though the plot is interesting, the character behavior getting through the plot is stupid.  Plus, the voice acting just horrible.  It made me want to tear my ears off.  Then there are too many deaths and too many murders (9 in-game murders and several more backstory deaths).  The bodies pile up so deep you can't keep the dead straight.  But, the penultimate badness is the ending:  it's utterly HORRIBLE.  I can't explain it here as it would be a massive spoiler.  But, ugh.  It's terrible.\n\nSo, even though there are five games in this bundle and you can get probably more than 16 hours worth of gameplay out of it, at best, that 16 hours won't be well spent.  I certainly would never recommend spending the list price on it.  Heck.  I'm pretty sure I got this 5-in-1 bundle as part of an 8 game bundle and IT was on sale.  And, I still don't recommend it.","August 27, 2015","false","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I wanted to see if it was that god awful. Its not that bad. The puzzles the game throws at you are mostly terrible and some are even busted. The Anatomy dummy your supposed to put his organs back in does not work. I even followed the example they had and no dice. Use the skip buttons on all puzzles or play them and take another 10 to 12 hours figuring them out if they work at all.\n\nSo the setup for this game is your following a witch who has stolen your son. You click on the shiny object and then find 4 to 5 things in that same room that it shows you in small detail. Sometimes one of objects will not be in that same room. To be sure click on hint button and see where it points you. If its not in that room go to another room and complete a different shiny object event. Sometimes they will throw in a HOG but not that often. So music is good, sound effects are good. The story is not bad. The graphics of are a mixed bag. static pictures look good animation for most things are poor and feel very rushed. My review so far is a 6/10 not bad but not great. So far I have had no problem except for the truly tedious, dumb and boring puzzles the game throws at you. However the skip button does work so thats a plus. Finished this game. A slightly blurry cut scene and thats it. So around 3 hours finish. No extra bonus mission. No voices all text.\n\nStarted wierd park. Looks more modern. Graphics are little bit better. Standard HOG. Story is so-so. HInts take forever and the skip button takes a little longer then I would like. Probably would rate this a 6/10. I lowered my score game takes a downward spiral later on in the game. You enter a crazy world and its a ton of backtracking. A ton of backtracking and the ending is just a little sad and not worth the struggle. Sad.\n\nI attempted to play vampire sadly the hint button takes 1 minute to reload and its very hard to see what you need to  click on. Failure to launch. Skipping this one. animation was poor and HO scenes were poor.\n\nI am now playing Mountain Crime Requital. Looks to be the same people that brought you Behind the reflection. It plays almost the same way. click on sparkle look for items in the bubbles. Graphics look the best out of the all the games I have played so far. Does have voice but not very good on that score. Game gets very tedious at the end and relies upon a sad cliche of the mystery kind. Terrible ending and its very dumb. Also speech is a tad crazy. He looks likes he is freshly killed? 5/10 mostly tedious and a dumb story that starts out strong and dies at the end. Sad.\n\nTwisted Lands shadow town looks god awful. The hint button seems like it takes forever to load up. Feels like 2 minutes per object. Really? Ugh. Ugly looking game. No voice. Looks to be a super cheap game to make.  Not going to bother playing it. So in summary most of these games are not worth playing. Most are terrible and not very long and most are tedious. The only ones that were somewhat ok Behind the reflection 2 and Wierd park. The rest are forgetable. I would say save your money and buy something a whole lot better and less tedious. House of a 1000 doors is a lot better, Nearwood is a lot better. These are all made by the same company that made this and those games are worth playing.","June 28, 2015","false","20.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you're not already a fan of those, however, you should probably look elsewhere for a smooth entry, as these games are not really the cream of the crop of the genre. Still, though, you get two good games, two decent ones and only one bad one for a rather low price, which is why I'm giving this a thumbs up despite its shortcomings.\n\nTHE GAMES:\nWeird Park: Broken Tune - A strangely bland game, I thought. I really like evil clowns, and an abandoned amusement park sounds like a great setting for a creepy game, but still, I was a bit bored with this one. It felt very much like a by-the-numbers kind of thing, where not a single idea felt fresh or intriguing. Things get slightly more interesting (and surreal) towards the end, but overall, it's an underwhelming game.\n\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town - This one's more interesting. Both the setting and the story had me quite intrigued and motivated to keep going (the whole premise is a bit like Lovecraft's Shadow Over Innsmouth). The puzzles, HOGs and minigames are good, too, however, one problem with this game is that some paths between locations are maze-like, and you can *never* skip them. If you find yourself having to walk from Point A to Point B a couple of times and there's a maze section between them, then you will have to click through the maze *every single time*. It's not a major issue, since the mazes are short and easy, but it's still a minor annoyance. Overall, however, a good game with an interesting story.\n\nMountain Crime: Requital - My favorite of the bundle. It excels in pretty much all areas: The Hidden Object sections have an interesting little twist to them, the minigame puzzles are well designed, the setting (a recently re-opened grand hotel) and the story (a string of grotesque murders) are intriguing and the presentation compliments the atmosphere. I have no complaints about this one at all.\n\nVampire Saga: Pandora's Box - By far the worst game this bundle has to offer, in my opinion. It's a very bare-bones, visually off-putting experience for one thing, with bland environments, bizarrely ugly character models and the barest minimum of item combination puzzles,  but the real problem with this one is its actual Hidden Object gameplay. All the HO screens you encounter throughout the game suffer from one issue or another; they're either too dark to adequately see the things you're looking for, or they have a strong color filter that make the items blend in with the backgrounds, or (and this is my personal cardinal sin) they show you *more than one item that matches the description, but only one of them is actually correct. For example, there are screens where you're told to look for "a brush", but there are at least three different brushes lying around. Another screen has you looking for "a lamp", but there are four lamps to pick from, and of course you get penalized for too many consecutive wrong clicks. Unless you're a total HOG nut, you might actually want to skip this one altogether. The story has a few interesting and morbid moments, but it's not worth putting up with the bad gameplay, in my opinion.\n\nBehind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge - Very much like Weird Park. There's nothing damningly wrong with it, but the whole experience is rather drab. However, the HO gameplay is well implemented and the presentation is nice enough, so I still had some fun with it. One thing to note: This game's story is very closely tied to its predecessor. You might want to play that one first.\n","August 26, 2015","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game offers a hint option that points you in the right direction which is really nice. Even if you'd get stuck you don't have to Google for a walkthrough or anything. The hidden objects are not too hard to find, but they can be pretty nicely concealed as they meld into their surroundings. The game's story was a bit odd, but I liked the atmosphere and surroundings, the music added up to this atmosphere as well. The game doesn't take very long to finish, 2.5 hours or so, but I am okay with that lenght personally. I do recommend this game, it's quite fun to play.","October 9, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the exception of the execrable Behind the Reflection 2, however, they aren't bad at all; they offer all the elements you'd expect.\n\nIf you only play a few HO games a year, you could pick more choiceworthy titles, but if you're the sort of player who chews up HO games like popcorn, this bundle is an efficient way to keep yourself supplied for a while, particularly if you catch it on a discount.","June 28, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_greater_good/recommended/346140/","the_greater_good","The Greater Good","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_greater_good/","303 products in account","(I'll put my overall opinion at the top for those who don't want to read anything about the individual titles.)\n\nOVERALL:\nthe bad things first: No Steam Cloud support; as someone who plays on three different computers, this really is a problem; each of these games stores its save files in a different location, which I had to hunt down, and manually copy&paste from computer to computer every time I wanted to continue my game on a different system.\nthis bundle includes only "regular versions", although some of the titles have also been released as Collector's or Special Editions; in the Hidden Object genre, this of course means that some of the games may have somewhat of an unsatisfying or evil ending, a more positive or conclusive of which you'd only get by playing the additional content of the CEs/SEs; personally, I didn't care, since none of the games actually feel incomplete, but I thought I'd mention it anyway\ngraphics and sound range from very good to adequate; there's only one game (Vampire Saga: Pandora's Box) that's actually a bit off-putting in its presentation\nCONCLUSION:\nThe bundle is a decent little treat for fans of Hidden Object Games. If you're not already a fan of those, however, you should probably look elsewhere for a smooth entry, as these games are not really the cream of the crop of the genre. Still, though, you get two good games, two decent ones and only one bad one for a rather low price, which is why I'm giving this a thumbs up despite its shortcomings.\n\nTHE GAMES:\nWeird Park: Broken Tune - A strangely bland game, I thought. I really like evil clowns, and an abandoned amusement park sounds like a great setting for a creepy game, but still, I was a bit bored with this one. It felt very much like a by-the-numbers kind of thing, where not a single idea felt fresh or intriguing. Things get slightly more interesting (and surreal) towards the end, but overall, it's an underwhelming game.\n\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town - This one's more interesting. Both the setting and the story had me quite intrigued and motivated to keep going (the whole premise is a bit like Lovecraft's Shadow Over Innsmouth). The puzzles, HOGs and minigames are good, too, however, one problem with this game is that some paths between locations are maze-like, and you can *never* skip them. If you find yourself having to walk from Point A to Point B a couple of times and there's a maze section between them, then you will have to click through the maze *every single time*. It's not a major issue, since the mazes are short and easy, but it's still a minor annoyance. Overall, however, a good game with an interesting story.\n\nMountain Crime: Requital - My favorite of the bundle. It excels in pretty much all areas: The Hidden Object sections have an interesting little twist to them, the minigame puzzles are well designed, the setting (a recently re-opened grand hotel) and the story (a string of grotesque murders) are intriguing and the presentation compliments the atmosphere. I have no complaints about this one at all.\n\nVampire Saga: Pandora's Box - By far the worst game this bundle has to offer, in my opinion. It's a very bare-bones, visually off-putting experience for one thing, with bland environments, bizarrely ugly character models and the barest minimum of item combination puzzles,  but the real problem with this one is its actual Hidden Object gameplay. All the HO screens you encounter throughout the game suffer from one issue or another; they're either too dark to adequately see the things you're looking for, or they have a strong color filter that make the items blend in with the backgrounds, or (and this is my personal cardinal sin) they show you *more than one item that matches the description, but only one of them is actually correct. For example, there are screens where you're told to look for "a brush", but there are at least three different brushes lying around. Another screen has you looking for "a lamp", but there are four lamps to pick from, and of course you get penalized for too many consecutive wrong clicks. Unless you're a total HOG nut, you might actually want to skip this one altogether. The story has a few interesting and morbid moments, but it's not worth putting up with the bad gameplay, in my opinion.\n\nBehind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge - Very much like Weird Park. There's nothing damningly wrong with it, but the whole experience is rather drab. However, the HO gameplay is well implemented and the presentation is nice enough, so I still had some fun with it. One thing to note: This game's story is very closely tied to its predecessor. You might want to play that one first.\n","August 26, 2015","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only thing to remember is to turn this off when playing the other games as it destorts their graphics a bit.

Weird park had too many situations that could have been easily solved if the main character had any common sense (NEEDING string to tie a balloon instead of knotting the end, overfilling a popcorn machine until it breaks to get the contents instead of simply breaking the glass with one of the multiple hammers in my inventory, needing to put a magnet on a fishing pole to get something from a foot deep pirannha infested koi pond instead of any of my long metal tools to simply push it to land, etc etc...)","June 13, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
