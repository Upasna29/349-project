Containment: The Zombie Puzzler is a tile based puzzle game where you need to surround zombies with matching people. Once you've surrounded a cluster of zombies with pink scientists, yellow punks, blue officers or green soldiers they kill the zombies and disappear themselves. Then the tiles fall to the south like falling tiles and others come in from the north. Its easy to shuffle your people around, click one and then another. No matter where they are, they'll exchange positions.\n\nI say its like falling tiles, because the camera is overhead and these tiles are really people on a street. Its an easy, engaging and enthralling game. If a zombie is at the edge of the puzzle grid, you only need to contain it with three or two people if its in a corner. Zombies only need to be contained by north, south, east and west rather than including northeast, northwest, southeast and so on.\n\nSpend too much time and the zombies will target an adjacent human. After more time, they attack and turn them into a zombie. That's when things get interesting, because you need more people to surround and contain them back to death. If there are enough zombies you might lack the same color of personnel to contain them all.\n\nOn top of a standard shuffling of people, there are special abilities. These abilities are dropped in crates and you can find them in trash cans unless there is a zombie lurking inside. They add more depth to the game. You can get a sniper shot that puts a bullet in a zombie's head to kill it instantly. An air drop that bombs a horizontal line of people and zombies alike. There's a line of radiation suits that turns three people into any color. Electricity will zap three people or zombies in a line. A grenade will destroy an area of seven people or zombies while a Molotov cocktail engulfs several tiles at random. While you can only hold three abilities at once, which is more than enough, you can carry them from block to block.\n\nThe campaign is broken into several blocks per chapter with five chapters making up each of the game's three acts. It tells a story between the puzzles. The areas around the puzzles are all unique environments. Wrecked autos, playgrounds, streets and abandoned buildings. When camera moves from one cluster of humans and zombies you see text floating in the air over the road. Its nothing ground breaking, but its more interesting to see the seamless integration of a hovering camera between blocks.\n\nEach block is different, so the puzzles are more than just perfect square grids. Sometimes a gas station will explode and collapse blocking any new reinforcements. To keep things interesting the game throws new challenges, such as zombies coming in from the sides. Win the block before they get to your people or you have more to contend with. Other times zombies will target people from above and just drop in. Normal zombies turn into grander zombies that need to be contained twice, but the problem with this is that the mega zombies look too similar to the normal ones.\n\nThe campaign suffers a bit from no rewards for everyone surviving a block of game. You're just pushing on to complete block after block of each level resulting in no replay value other than its a good game. There is a survival mode that feels more like a traditional puzzle game where you get a score and graded at the end based on your time and survivors. You can get combos for killing two zombie areas at once and cascades for killing one area of zombies and then more people fall into place and kill other zombies.\n\nContainment is a blend of great puzzle design with a sprinkle of charm, humor, bad voice acting that fits the unpolished aesthetic. The game is never horrifying, but it is bloody. There are overhead visuals of zombies eating people, blood splatters here and there and its done in a half bloody half silliness. The game itself could look better. The people could look more pleasing to the eyes from this overhead perspective.\n\nIf you can look beyond its visual flaws and cheesy voices, there's a good puzzle game here. The low price makes it a good investment of money for your puzzle entertainment.","September 30, 2015","true","1.6"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

At its core its a puzzle game with strong elements of strategy.\n\nThe premise of the game is that you have to surround groups of zombies with the same type/coloured survivor to remove them from play.  Survivors consist of the soldier, the policeman, the cheerleader and the thug, each providing a different voiceover when a group is cleared which is quite nicely done.\n\nThere is one 5 act/20 level campaign which should take you around 5 hours to complete.  The learning curve is very well done which is good as there is only one difficulty setting.\n\nA range of harder zombie types provide the bulk of the challenge is this game as you progress through the campaign.  The simplistic gameplay is added to with environmental hazards that can kill off survivors or block more of them from coming through to reinforce the game board.  Additionally you can have up to three power-ups to blast away groups of zombies when in a tight sequeeze.  There are around 6/7 each individually adapted to provide a unique destructive effect when used.\n\nThere are three additional survival levels that you can play if you get hooked while the soundtrack is very basic.\n\nIf you are an achievement hunter it should take you between 14-20 hours in total to get the last one, as its a grinder!\n\nOverall Id say the game does what it says in the store page.  Its nothing special but it is enjoyable if you like this sort of game, as I have.  If you are a hardcore game then this is probably not for you unless you like a dose of casual on the side!","August 6, 2014","true","18.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Well, no, not really. At least, not a TYPICAL zombie game by any means.\n\nAs the title states, it's a puzzler - no hybrid zombie shooter-♥♥♥-puzzler. Just a puzzler.  So why the zombie inclusion? For the most part, it's not relevant really at all. It could be anything that takes the place of those zombies, but the important thing is it's a pretty good puzzler.\n\nIt's based on the "match 3" style of puzzle, and you start with a full grid of objects/zombies (a bit like Bejeweled) - and just like Bejeweled, once you clear a group, the spaces are refilled. That's about where similarities end.\n\nYour basic aim is to clear the zombies on the board, and the way you clear a group is to surround them with a colour-coded group of your little guys, doing their utmost against the contagion (go little guys!) As the game progresses, slight variations and hurdles are introduced to up the ante. Difficulty is kept nicely linear, and paced just right. I could go into deeper description of these hurdles, but I think doing so would rather spoil it for you. There's not much else to say about the mechanics - it does what it should rather well indeed.\n\nThe levels are tied together in a "story mode" format, and to be frank, the story is pretty rubbish, and terribly amateurly written. However, as this is in the form of text on-screen, there's no awful voice acting to listen to, and it skims along quickly enough, so that you soon progress onto the next level with a minimal of fuss. In short, you can easily ignore it, and it impacts the game in no other way than this.\n\nSo, even if you've completely had your fill of the over-used zombie craze, this is a worthy purchase, especially if "matching" puzzles are your thing. I picked it up in an indie bundle and was pleasantly surprised - so much so that I replayed it as soon as I'd finished the story mode. It's not exactly very graphically intensive either, so a moderate/low PC should run it capably too.\n\nAll in all a pleasant little puzzler that very much does it's own slant on a formula, and well worth the purchase. As always my metric is price, and I'd say this is worth a good £6-7. If you aren't so into puzzles, then I'd still recommend it, although you should adjust the price accordingly.\n","October 12, 2014","true","9.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

How long would the cakes and cookies in Starbucks stave off my hunger?  Would I really be lucky enough to be in a mall when the zombie apocalypse strikes?\n\nThese are the sorts of questions that keep me up at night but rarely do I have the same thoughts about other supernatural beasties.       If I’m out at night and there’s a full moon, I don’t check my pockets for silver bullets.\nOn the rare occasion that I’ve seen a bat, I don’t reach for the crucifix and the garlic.\n\nWerewolves and Vampires don’t stalk my waking thoughts but zombies...  the “what if” of the undead apocalypse is always there, shambling beneath the surface of my mind.... but enough of my problems...\n\n\nApathetic Fanatic\n\nSeemingly random questions at the start of reviews are great, but why am I sharing my aversion to puzzle games and my unhealthy zombie obsession?\nIt’s because these particular personal preferences have presented me with a dilemma.\nYou see  I’m about to play through a game called “Containment”, a zombie themed puzzler which means I should both love it and be completely disinterested at the same time...\n\n\nSurvival Flavour\n\nContainment certainly takes an interesting twist on the puzzle genre, instead of having colourful gems, blocks, fruits etc. to play with, here your puzzle pieces are zombies and survivors.\nThe survivors themselves come in various different flavours from chainsaw wielding punks to gun toting cops.\nEach level presents you with a block of these survivors and some zombies mixed in for good measure. If you do nothing the zombies will infect the survivors around them, turning them into zombies too!\n\nThis encourages you to play through quickly, spend too much time mulling over your decisions and your group of survivors will turn into a shambling horde, so expect some frantic and rushed decision making as you play.\n\n\nShuffle Around\n\nThe game mechanic itself is a fairly simple one, you swap the positions of the different survivors by clicking on them, and your goal is to reposition the survivors in such a way that a zombie is surrounded by the same survivor type.\n\nSo if you’ve got a zombie that already has a couple of redneck survivors standing next to it, you’d quickly want to scan the closest survivors for more rednecks, if there are some close by, you’d start clicking on them to slide them into position around the zombie.\nAs soon as our red necked buddies have the walker surrounded, they’ll take it down.\nThat’s one less to worry about, time to move on to the next.\nIt’s a simple rinse and repeat formula that makes this, like most other puzzle games, quick to learn, initially addictive but ultimately a little repetitive.\n\n\nTouches\n\nThere are lots of nice touches in Containment.\nDifferent survivors have different attack animations when they take down a zombie, it’s a fairly simple thing, but this variation really does add to the experience, you’ll find yourself looking forward to taking a zombie out with a group of survivors you haven’t “experienced” yet.\n\nWhen you complete a level, instead of the screen fading to black then loading in the next challenge, the camera will move away from your last victory and rush through the city until it focuses on the next group of survivors waiting for your point and click salvation.\n\n\nMigraine Free\n\nWith regards to the aesthetics, it’s refreshing to play a puzzler that isn’t all bright primary coloured eye candy and flashing lights.\nContainment knows its setting and has a palette appropriate for its post apocalyptic theme.\nEverything is pretty good looking too in its own top down, mostly static kind of way.\n\n\nThis isn’t just any puzzle game...\n\nThis is a refreshing entry into the genre and one which I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would.\nIt avoids the migraine inducing bright cheeriness which infects most other puzzlers, it’s gritty, it gives a nice “end times” vibe and if you’re in the mood it can be genuinely fun to play.\n\nIs it the sort of game that will make me want to rush through my working day to get back home and play?\n\nNo, puzzle games don’t do that for me, too shallow, remember, but it is a fun distraction in short bursts and one which I’ll definitely load up again.\n\n\nThis is a post apocalyptic puzzle game.\n\nIf puzzle "match up" games are your thing and you’re looking for something a little different in the genre, then Containment should fit the bill.\nIt’s a stylish, quick hit, post apocalyptic puzzler and there aren’t many games you can say that about!\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit  review-well.com [www.review-well.com]","May 23, 2015","true","1.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

Also there are a lot of environmental elements which you (or the enemy) can use. There are not too many levels, and each one seems to have been carefully hand-crafted, rather than just thrown together randomly.

The premise is very simple but the gameplay is very fun. I love killing zombies, but sometimes I don't feel like running around to do it. This game is an interesting puzzler. I enjoy this as a casual game to rest my brain from all my all pointing and clicking :). There is a sense of urgency since the zombies can kill the survivors, turning them into zombies. With each map, the only soundtrack you get is a pulsing heart, which hightens the sense of "must kill them all before I have too few survivors!". Using certain survivors to kill zombies will cause loot to fall. You can have bio-suits, missiles, grenades, lightning bolts, and mystery items to help you fight.

However I was always intrested in this title, as it's openly stated that it's a puzzle game. A zombie puzzler game. This is either really meh (zombies instead of coloured blocks) or pure sh*t (because noways you can sell anything, that has zombies) or something original.  For me, it turned out to be the third option.\nThe game itself is really simple. It's kind of a falling-block game, but instead of the most usual match-3 system you need to surround a group of zombies with similar "coloured" units (Policemen, armymen, vandals or scientists) and depending on the size of the zombie group, you can get a bonus unique to the faction you used to contain the zombie group.\nIt's very possible that this isn't the first game with this mechanic, yet it was new for me. Some additional mechanisms actually contributes to the "zombie game" feeling. Sometimes zombies charge your group, turning people on the borders to zombies. The zombies are alive, and will attack neighbouring humans and turn them. And with this, we reached the most intresting part of the game. Imagine the situation: you try to surround a group of Zeds with policemen, and another group with vandals. However you're unlucky, and both groups attack two people who are neighbours - and the two hordes became one - but you possibly don't have enough character of the same type to surround them. You'll either lose, or you should kill smaller groups in the hope of bonuses (like molotov cocktail) to divide the big horde into smaller, managable sizes.    This threat is kinda non-existant at early levels, but at middle-late campaign you should be very wary about how do you deal with Z groups fastly and efficiently.\nA small list about the game's different aspects:\nGame mechanism: traditional puzzle's mechanics (2-hit blocks and 1-colour-only blocks as well appear) with reasonable and well executed zombie mechanism\nGame graphics: well, nothing intresting. I won't rate this with numbers, it's just average - nothing too ugly now nothing exceptional to an indie puzzler game. You won't have trouble identifying anything on the screen.\nGame music: If I remember well this was actually really good, atmospheric zombie-music. However I think it's quite short, becomes repetitive after a while (played and finished the game a few weeks ago, please forgive me for my leaky memory)\nAddtitional note: Campaign is quite good. Starts easy, becames harder as new enemies are introduced. It's learning curve is very reasonable, only bossfights can be difficult for the first few tries. I also have to mention the campaign's narration - it's visible on the road as you move from board to board - it's really well written, gives quite an atmosphere :)\nAs the game's base price is low, and also usually appears in bundles, I do recommend it. Gives a lot of fun for low price if you enjoy puzzler games.\n","October 27, 2014","true","17.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Containment, rather achieving containment is where the puzzle element comes into play, and once achieved, your selected players that are containing the zombie(s) are slaughtered in a variety of ways depending on which npc's contained. Special weapons drops are dropped and unique to each npc, for instance, soldiers will drop grendades. You can have up to 3 special weapons at a time and in later levels you can't get by without them.\n\nThe end of the game has a bug in the last chapter that's been reported and a patch is in the works for it. If you're into zombies and puzzles this game may appeal to you. It was a nice, short diversion, and also an easy game to max out if you're one of the achievement crazed gamers.","September 4, 2012","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's basically a block-matching game. Zombies and citizens are in a grid. To kill the zombies, you you need to swap citizens among cells until you surround the zombies with people of a single color. If you take too many turns, the zombies spread to neighboring cells. You'll also occasionally get attacked from the sides of the grid. You have a variety of special weapons - sniper rifle, grenades, air strikes, gas masks (which create wild card citizens that serve as all colors), and others. The game is not hard, and the campaign is short (~2-3 hours), but the levels are randomized so there is plenty of replay. There is also a survival mode, though it is just like the campaign but without the ability to continue on if you lose (you have to start over in survival mode, but can replay a level in campaign mode). I wish the game got a bit tougher on later levels, or for a way to increase the difficulty, but the game is quite a lot of fun as is. Overall, a really nice and fun game.

In fact, to mangle a phrase:  "Unworth it at any price."\n\nI can officially say it -- I think the whole zombie thing has about run its course.  Don't get me wrong, some of my favorite titles are zombie titles -- Project Zomboid comes to mind, for example.  And I have to say that I get a ton of pleasure from other games like "How to Survive" and I have also played (thank you to Steam) both seasons of the Walking Dead.  I also use to read the Walking Dead comic in the early days, back when nobody knew who Robert Kirkman was or even thought that Image was still a relevant universe.\n\nThis game is an unpleasant combination of the old Nintendo game "Dr. Mario" and an ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI will say that the graphics are really good and the sound good as well.  But the game lacks a certain level of interest.  I've played many games like this -- what can only be called a Tetris-styled format.  In this case you have to surround groups of zombies with members of a "like" group  -- army people, punks, some weird chicks.  Can't say that I was interested enough in it to differentiate between the different types.\n\nSo there are some obstacles thrown in the way.  It's pretty predictable.  Again, I approach games as the casual gamer -- I don't have a time of time and so I look at games in a cost-response way:  Is this worth my time.  Nope.  Not even close.\n\nPerhaps I'm too fickle.  Perhaps I'm too stingy and I look at $5 like a lot of money.  Do I contract myself?  Very well, then, I contradict myself.\n\nI had a problem with the pacing of this one.  Maybe I should have stuck with it longer.  If I do go back to it, and I change my mind, I'll certainly change my review.  But there just isn't enough there to justfiy my time.

The different item/environmental hazard effects are good, and the setting (urban) is repetitive but still slightly different for each section. The music and sounds are good, but I usually play with all of the sounds muted and use my own - especially since the random quotes from the characters can get annoying when you've played this game for a while.\n\nThe learning curve is minimal to moderate - you have to completely surround zombies with units of the same color in order to kill them. The tutorial is very helpful and an appropriate length. The ability to hit ESC and replay a "block" (there are 3 Acts, each having 5 levels with a certain number of blocks within) before you are about to lose makes the game very, very easy; however, if you have a decent enough reaction time, you really won't have to resort to this. Personally, I only found the 20-level survival mode to be slightly difficult.\n\nBesides campaign mode, there are 3 survival levels (20, 10, or 7 levels respectively) you can play. When you kill a large number of zombies and/or "chain" combos by having your survivors set up so that zombies are killed consecutively, items will most likely drop. These items can be things like a sniper shot, bombing run, molotov, etc. You can hold and carry over 3 items, however, items that drop will stay at the bottom of the screen until you progress to the next block. One useful item is the armor vests, which will turn a horizontal line of up to 3 survivors into "armored" units. These units can take one zombie hit (they'll revert back to their original color), and count as a rainbow (all) color.\n\nThere are 4 unit colors - blue, orange, pink, green. Later, a special zombie type will require you to use a specific color to kill them, and this adds to the difficulty; however, you can always save and use items specifically for these enemies. There are 3 other zombie types besides the regular enemy, and 3 bosses (one at the end of each Act). In between blocks, the story is given in the form of text on the streets/ground - the story is average, but is still nice to have.\n\nThere are also environmental pieces you can interact with, which usually glow red/white. Examples are gas tanks, garbages, etc. Red hazards usually help you by killing an area of the game map; and white items can yield items, more zombies, or nothing. On the side/background, lingering zombies can slowly walk to and join the game map. Periodically, red x's will indicate incoming zombies that may drop/dig into play. If you take too long to kill a zombie, it will eventually attack a nearby character, turning it into a zombie. In survival (and the last few levels), the zombies have a shorter attack cooldown, and being slow can cause you to easily be overwhelmed (and lose).\n\nFor any achievement hunters, many of the achievements for this game are easy to get, however, there is quite a bit of grinding for the zombie kills (5000 and 10000) ones. There is an exploit for this, if you cannot be bothered to do it the regular way, but that will still take a bit of time.\n\nOverall, the game is a nice match-style game, and uses the zombie theme well. If you are interested, give it a try.\n\nRecommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","September 20, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The object of this puzzle game is to surround zombies with a chain of similar survivors to eliminate them. If you don't act fast enough, the zombies will begin to infect others. You can earn weapons along the way to help you out (grenades, snipers, air strikes, etc.) and, believe it or not, there are boss monsters to fight. I have only two complaints. 1.) The board is a bit cluttered to look at sometimes, and I occasionally found that I had a hard time finding the missing link in my chains. 2.) The graphics aren't exactly state of the art.

It is entertaining, and I like the attitude of the game; if I'd paid 15-20 dollars for it, I don't think there'd be enough to it for me to feel satisfied, but for $5 I was quite interested in the story, and it was a great way to spend a few hours.","December 27, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The object of this puzzle game is to surround zombies with a chain of similar survivors to eliminate them. If you don't act fast enough, the zombies will begin to infect others. You can earn weapons along the way to help you out (grenades, snipers, air strikes, etc.) and, believe it or not, there are boss monsters to fight. I have only two complaints. 1.) The board is a bit cluttered to look at sometimes, and I occasionally found that I had a hard time finding the missing link in my chains. 2.) The graphics aren't exactly state of the art.
