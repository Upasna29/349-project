In this game, you must place squares of different colors throughout the 2D map, which keeps moving as you progress with your square filling. You have 20 levels to complete, 5 of them being available right now, the other 15 will get available in future updates, you also have 2 game modes to complete: Classic and Copycat. Classic is about placing the squares throughout the map very fast, while in Copycat you are being on a static map, placing many squares, which will create a big art. Even in the Classic mode, you will find many small arts. You get the feeling of being a 2D artist. The menu of this game is very well designed. The graphics are well designed and colorful, the atmosphere is a dynamic and challenging one, the sounds are also enjoyable, the gameplay is very fun and relaxing, the engines are well optimized to run even on a very low-performant computer and the controls are also good.\n\nStrong PointsWell designed graphics for a puzzle game\nDynamic and challenging atmosphere\nEnjoyable and relaxing sounds\nRelaxing, but in the same time, challenging gameplay\nWell optimized engines and controls\nBeautifully designed main menu\nMany enviroments and arts\nMany levels and 2 solid game modes\nVery colorful and dynamic maps\nWeak PointsProbably a little too fast maps, depends from gamer to gamer\nSame soundtrack at every map, there should be more and mixed\nRight now, it's way too short for its price (this will improve on full release)\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 7.5/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nAudio: 7.5/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nStory: N/A\nEngines: 8.5/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 7.9/10","April 2","true","1.2"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","0"

I prefer to use the keyboard and mouse combo.\nAfter playing Puzzle Box for sometime I found myself thinking that any new person to games could pick this up quite easily and could enjoy the time spent.\nThe sounds and graphics are quite nice and polished.\nYou dont need a lot of time spare to play it. This is perfect for children where there attention span drops off fast. Just drop into a game and 5mins max your done , I found the average was around 2-4 mins on the lower levels and as you increase so does the difficulty and time spent to finish each level.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics look nice and sharp.\n- All ages can play { good for the kids to learn }\n- Sounds are suited well to the game.\n- Games are quite fast.\n- Heaps of levels to complete.\n- Difficulty scales quite well.\n\nCons:\n- A little repetitive for the older more experienced gamer.\n\nOverall:\n- 7/10","April 1","true","4.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

The game have "sectors" with  Classic or Copycat levels and those have Boom , Kubi and Claw sub-levels. You unlock new sectors with coins wich are rewards for doing levels and sub-levels. You unlock the sub-levels wandering around the menu of selections dor "sectors".\nThe game is for casual gamers , but the rules are a bit criptic and the difficulty of the game is high.\n\nPros:\n-I like the art style of the game\n-The diferent kind of mini games (Puzzle , Platformer,etc.)\n-The relaxing music.\nCons:\n-The game is very criptic Start Menu.\n-The dificulty of some games are very high rigth from the start\n\nThe game is still in Early Access and only have 5 sectors available of the 20 you can see in the Start Menu.\nI still recomend the game for with is now , but in the future the game look better.","April 1","true","5.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

The gameplay revolves around dropping block in the right places, but it's surprisingly not repetitive; the game is full of surprises and varieties (which I have to admit I was quite surprised by).\n\nMy only complains for this game are the menu (which is conceptually super cool but sometimes rather challenging to navigate through, especially due to it's size) and the drop light (the light that helps you drop your blocks more accurately) that is very hard to see - I don't know if this was intended as a part of the gameplay to add difficulty to the game, but on a lot of the stages it blends with the similarly bright background. It makes it rather challenging to drop boxes accurately, especially in moving stages.\n\nBut other than that, I'm loving this game. Hopefully there'll be Steam Achievements and Trading Cards in the future though!","April 1","true","5.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I never play before in this kind of puzzles, specifically when you need make a pixel art picture using colored blocks. Yeah, Puzzle Box - really creative game, even main menu looks awesome, becuase actually its a mini game. Soundtrack also pretty good, I like relaxing melody. But as Puzzle Box is an Early Access product, there are some last levels still under development, so need just wait a little bit, when they will be finished. I can recommend this great game for anyone and no matter how old you are :)","April 1","true","3.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

FAMILY FUINColorful little game with a happy little paint jar and an explosive smiling cube. The simple challenge makes it a great choice to entertain the whole family, with very pretty music that speeds up humorously when instructed to. Might be a warmup game to get your little ones ready for Early Childhood assessments like the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Also a good gateway for turning your kids into MLG squeakers. Also just relaxing and cheerful for anyone of any age range, especially after a long day of work. And it makes maxing pixel art a whole lot more fun and easy. Now git gud, son! No really, kid, git gud. It cost your dad money.

Game requires little tutorial as it is pretty straightforward as to how the game works.\n\nYou will have to press WASD of the selected colour (the correct colour on the palette will blink) to fill the empty blocks to create the image. Sometimes the colors on the palette are of different shades to its better to use this.\n\nOCD people, stay away. Because its pretty hard to get everything correct with 100% perfection.","April 1","true","4.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It has so many pro points: amazingly-done graphics, smoothing background music, multiple game modes to challenge yourself with, difficulty levels so your can play at your own speed, and much much more! Every level is fairly short so you can pick the game up and play whenever you have a few minutes of free time. I especially recommend this game to people who have kids as this game is something they'll love! The game is only 33% finished and based on it's current performance there is no doubt that it will become one of the best puzzle games of 2016.","April 6","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Played for a few hours and one of the things i'd liked is the music very relaxing which fit welldone with the game. About the controls have not any issues, played comfortable with keyboard and mouse and I did not need to change his controls key so leave it untouched. Basically you begins the game to filling some empty boxes which after you complete all of them it's created a pixel art graphic pretty cool and genuine so beating the level you gain coins to keep playing the next level and so and so. Eventhough is not finished the game feels solid so i can't imagine when it get completed with more fun even so I would recommend this game to anyone and highly recommended if you have kids which might be more enjoyable and will get a better experience with you and yours.
