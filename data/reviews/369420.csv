Unfortunately, when you arrive, the guy is killed in front of you. Investigating that death, you're being taken into the dark secrets behind the asylum.... Can you trust yourself as you're diving into a world of hallucinations?\n\nComparing to the first 9 Clues (in which Owen is also appearing), this one is more darker and psychological. I love how you're also wondering who is the culprit. And trust me, you're asking yourself if Kreutz is the big mad woman or if it's Will and if Zed wasn't manipulated.\n\nThe puzzles are easy, the detective mode is a welcome change from other HOGs and the HO scenes are also quite relaxing. However, the plot twists are really good. And finding the hidden "?" and the "Ghost/Phantoms" objects is quite challenging. Still missing some.\n\nHowever, if you're stuck in a HO scene, you can switch to a game of mahjong and while I need to do a second playthrough for these, I already know that it will be a good time, as it was already tested in other games.\n\nSeriously, that game is a real improvement from the first one and is nearly as good as Mind Snares or Grim Legends. The ambiance is really well set and the music is also good.\n\nDon't hesitate.

It seems that this time, Artifex Mundi combined all of its tricks and talents to give us an interesting 4 hours or so.\n\nOur lady detective managed to survive the mythological ruckus of Serpent's Creek, and won an ally in the process. In this sequel, we work alongside Owen; former mysterious British agent is our new partner. He receives a phone call asking for help, and we trace the call back to Mnemosyne Asylum that resides in a secluded island. We arrive the scene to witness a brutal opening to the mystery that twirls around a frigid lady doctor, a shy young nurse, a grumpy male nurse, a drunk janitor and a sick pyromaniac. The body count raises rapidly as we face the residing rumour involving an old fire and investigate the truth behind the occurences.\n\nI should declare that the gameplay takes attention to detail. There are references to our former adventure alongside both charming and disturbing details that enriches the current story. It is expected for you to notice many visual details if you are an achievement hunter. Hidden object scenes are fairly easy, and they come with the option of switching to a mahjong game - similar to domino play option in AM's other games -  if you were to be fed up with searching for missing equipment. Puzzles are not very challenging, and I bet that you'd finish the game without ever searching for the hint option. Oh, and this time they went into full trouble of completely animating characters AND detective mode cutscenes. Visuals are the best you would get in this genre, and art was pretty - and disturbing, fitting an insane asylum - enough for me to think that I'd make some as my desktop wallpaper if I'd come across.\n\nI have only one trouble about the game: that the ending was... ok, I'll say that I suspected the IQ score of our heroine for a brief moment. There was a climactic chat nearing the end of the game, and the moment and the place that the speech took place seemed completely inappropriate. Play and see if you wish. Aside from that, I have no complaints. Artifex Mundi made my day as always. Go for it. You know you want to.

The previous installment was 9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creek.\n\n*HOPA - Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure.\n\nGame Visuals\nI want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is nicely done with a painted feel to them. The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.\n\nGame Audio\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even its simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\nThere are only three difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual, Advanced and Expert.\n\nThe game is divided up into acts. There are total eight of acts in the game.\n\nDiary Notebook it has three sections. Game Objectives, Clues and Characters.\n\nThere is an option for locking the inventory in place. It's automatically lock in place at the start of the game.\n\nThe interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations.\n\nMost of the game's hidden object scenes consists of traditional word lists with some or no interaction.\n\nMahjong mini game is optional for anyone who doesn't want to go looking for the items in the hidden object scenes.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nThere are collectibles (sorta) in the game. Asylum Model Fragments, Hidden Clues and Phantom Objects.\n\nThere are thirty-nine different achievements. But each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","March 10","true","8.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

The story is very classic and predictable but is brilliantly told. The HOGs screens are beautiful, colorful and not cluttered. I had a couple of mislabeled items but the difficulty is very low. There's a lot of bonus stuff to collect: morphing objects, question marks, architecture model pieces. The game is very short though - 4 hours - and has no bonus chapter, nothing.\n\nI do recommend it but it's not a big up, rather a small one: the game is short and the story is meh. Get it on sale. I loved this episode way more than the first one, the path the player must take is way more coherent than wandering back and forth in a huge map, but I wished they kept the 'supernatural' feel until the end instead of falling into the classical whodunnit; the ending felt like a bit of a left-down.","April 4","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

They consistently manage to strike that perfect balance between above average production values, simple but enjoyable puzzle designs, and storylines just earnest enough to be entertaining. The first 9 Clues game, Secret of Serpent Creek (credited to Tap It Games, but so indistinguishable from Artifex Mundi’s own games that the distinction between them as developer or publisher seems a moot point), continues to rank as my favorite HOG to date, taking all the tenants of Artifex Mundi’s trademark design and wrapping them up into a lighthearted but endearing mystery thriller.\n\nThough it shares the same series, The Ward is not only a dramatic departure from the previous 9 Clues but from Artifex Mundi’s HOGs in general. The Ward can best be summed up as Artifex Mundi going through a phase of overwhelming teen angst. Cue the inexplicable violence. Cue the barely intelligible plotlines designed for MAXIMUM DRAMA. Cue the misunderstood sociopath who was only murdering people because another sociopath told them to (it’s OK though, they’re actually good, I swear, so let’s just forget all that murder business).\n\nIf Secret of Serpent Creek was trying to be Scooby-doo, The Ward wants to be Shutter Island. It’s aggressively grim and (for a HOG) shockingly grotesque in both its story beats and how little it hesitates to delve headfirst into the most disturbing of subject matter. And this is where The Ward lost me. Even before its narrative turned into a convoluted mush of character reversals, deus ex machinas, and astoundingly convenient circumstances (again, even for HOG standards), The Ward alienated me with how little it cared. Where past Artifex Mundi games verged upon the repugnantly earnest, The Ward is a melting pot of “mature” themes and purposeless cruelty handled with even less care than you’d expect from this style of game. I’m not sure if The Ward came from a place unsatisfied with the casual branding of HOGs or if Artifex Mundi just ran out of ideas and started scrubbing through horror films for inspiration, but the second 9 Clues has managed to eject every ounce of the first game’s charm and replaced it with a nauseatingly poor attempt at tackling “adult” themes.\n\nIt’s all downhill from there, as the narrative flounders around attempting to find itself, puzzles become more obscure and tedious, and a veritable cornucopia of bad accents meander through lines as if the voice actors are simultaneously bored and learning to read for the first time. I even ran into some graphical bugs, which apart from being the most amusing part of the game cement how thrown together The Ward feels. I suppose it was bound to happen eventually that Artifex Mundi would release a colossal dud given the speed of their production process, but with how much I loved the first 9 Clues I’m sad that The Ward had to be the one to break the formula. The Ward exists then as a reminder of why we can’t have nice things. Only exploitative representations of mental illness and thoughtless depictions of suicide. Try not to cut yourself on all this edge.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 15","false","3.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You and your partner, both detectives, get a call from a doctor there and arrive to find the caller has died under mysterious circumstances. You must now solve the murder, and the secret of Mnemosyne Asylum.\n\nAs per usual with Artifex Mundi games, the background art is simply gorgeous and detailed. The character art, when still, is fairly good, however it’s not the best of their games, and the animations are… let’s just say they leave a lot to be desired. It feels a little like they’ve almost gone backwards on this aspect. The music (most times creepy) and sound effects are, as per usual, good; the voice acting is unremarkable, which is good in that it is, at least, not bad.\n\nThe story isn’t overly original, pretty typical to most HOG games and to Artifex Mundi in particular.\n\nThe particularity of the 9 Clues series -and what sets it a bit apart from other HOGs- is the “Detective Mode”; in it, you are made to find a certain amount of clues in the room, and once you do, you are made to put them in order to recreate the sequence of events that occurred there. It’s an interesting change and nice addition to the typical HOG scene, as you’re not really told what you’re looking for exactly, but if you have common sense, it shouldn’t be difficult anyway.\nWhile this is not too different from other ‘find the sequence’ puzzles, it’s a nice change of pace.\n\nJust like other HOGs from Artifex Mundi, however, it continues to have the same downsides. For instance, you’ll need to find 3 items, but you can’t put one into the puzzle already because you don’t have the other two. Or things are in slightly ridiculous places or require to do slightly ridiculous things when any sane person would’ve just used something else that was handy. You can’t really escape those issues in HOGs, for the most.\n\nThere was also a very lol-worthy part on the game where you literally find a to-do list on placing a bomb and making it go off. Erm. Seriously?\n\nSomething I did really enjoy though was that this one had less backtracking to be done. Most the items you needed for any given section were within one or two rooms from where you were, sometimes even in the same one. Still, with Artifex Mundi backtracking hardly makes a difference, as they have fast travel through the map (speaking of which, the map icons aren’t as nice as in their other games, it made me a bit sad).\n\nWith The Ward, they’ve gone back into allowing you to replace Hidden Object scenes for a game of (wait for it, I can never spell it) Mah Jong. The rest of the puzzles found throughout are fairly similar to their other games, some a bit more challenging than others.\n\nThere are lots of collectables to be found: phantom objects, clue symbols, model fragments… it was nice, but it also started to get a bit annoying to have to be looking out for all of these.\n\nIf you’re a fan of HOGs, and a fan of Artifex Mundi, I definitely recommend this one.","August 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I loved pretty much everything about this game and found it to be a nice improvement from the first 9 Clues, which is a good game but it does not seem to be linked to the sequel at all. The story is solid and engaging with great game play to keep you busy.\n\nYou and your detective partner get a call for help and head to an insane asylum to check things out. Right off the bat, you know with a setting like that things can get pretty interesting. While there you investigate murders and a hidden past held within the walls. While not out right obvious who the killer is, I sort of guessed pretty quickly. Not that this was a bad thing, the game did a good job keeping things mysterious so at first I doubted myself. But, as the game title suggests, you collect more clues and find out the truth throughout the game.\n\nOf course the only way to progress in the story is to solve puzzles and play hidden item scenes. The artwork is great and fits the theme and the hidden items scenes are equally as detailed as well. The mini games are challenging and enjoyable, I only ran into a couple that made me mad for the sheer fact that I don't like certain puzzle types. The game has a enough variety to not keep you bored, though.\n\nMy only complaint is the ending, no spoilers but there is a bomb involved and two characters talk entirely too long while knowing there is a bomb. It just made no sense, but oh well. Everything else in the game was amazing. The game also has trading cards and achievements, though you'll have to play through twice to get all of the achievements.

There's a set of achievements for mahjong, and a set of achievements for hidden objects. Those two are attached to each other you either do one or hit the switch button and do the other. Completing one does not qualify for both though. So you have to play through and do either a full run of mahjong or a full run of hidden object, then go back start another game when you done and do just the one you didn't do before otherwise you won't have 100% of the achievements.

I got this in a bundle and it has cards so I gave it a try while the cards dropped and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe story, although borrowing from a lot from popular movies, is quite original and also engaging. You play the female protagonist, the partner of a private detective in the 1950ies, investigating in a remote and kind of rundown asylum with a troubled past.\n\nThe characters you encounter are well written and come alive quickly, even though most converstations are short (which I appreciate). The interaction with the NPCs and your partner is pleasantly natural and logical and mostly well voice acted. The cutscenes are animated well and the pace is fast enough to keep you from skipping through them.\n\nAlso many of the puzzles don't seem out of place (as they often do in these games), you have to do a lot of repairs, piece things together and often come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles. Even on casual (which I played) the help is not too obvious although you can completely skip larger puzzles. The option to play mahjong instead of clicking all the items in the collection puzzles is also a nice touch (there are even special achievements for the mahjong games). The "what happened here" puzzles are also adding to the variety although personally I felt them quite boring.\n\nThe only major criticism I have is the price: 8 $ for a game that is finished in 2-3 hours is just to much. But if you spot it in a bundle, you can count it as one of the games making the whole bundle worth buying.","December 25, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed the first "9 Clues" game, so I moved the sequel to the front of my playlist.\n\nI enjoyed this game. The story interested me more than the original. It's twisted. Like the original, it's a fairly short game. Around 3.5 hours to play through.\n\nThe hidden object scenarios this time around weren't great. A few times items didn't really look like what they were supposed to be. All the other puzzles in the game were fine and varied.\n\nThe part I liked best about this game were the room investigations, where you find a group of clues around the room and then put them in order. They're all super easy, but it's a neat way to unravel the story when playing as a detective.","January 28","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is more of the same, with some additional features added.\n\nThere are still the hidden object games of course - but you can swap these out for some Mahjong games. Also, the detective scenes now have an added section where you need to sort the clues in the correct order.\n\nBoth of these changes don't add much, but the variety is nice.\n\nAlso, the story is much better in this game compared to the first 9 Clues.\n\nDespite these improvements there are still a couple of issues. Firstly, there is still a little bit of back tracking between scenes to find the item you need to progress. Also, there is still no option to increase the game resolution - which is why windowed mode is preferable to fullscreen as it looks better.\n\nI was able to complete this game in just over 4 hours, depending on other's speed of play it should last between 3 to 6 hours.\n\nI would recommend this game a bit more than the previous one, and if available in a sale then all the better.","March 9","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as the same detective person from the first game as you try and figure out the mysteries of Limousine Asylum, namely who keeps killing people. Along the way, you'll meet such people like the Joker, Freddy Krueger, and Gordon Freeman (and you even get to use his famous crowbar!)\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid. The puzzles are difficult without being tedious or agonizing, and there's very little backtracking, so you know you won't have to travel far afield in order to solve any puzzle. Some of the non-HOG puzzles are the usual staples -- the '2 left, 3 right' rotation light-up-everything puzzle, the 'match up different colored wires' puzzle, the 'guide different laser beams to their respective goals without crossing the beams' puzzle, the 'slide a bunch of different symbols along a track with limited free space until you get all of them into their proper area' puzzle, among a few others, but that's not really a bad thing.\n\nLike most Artifex Mundi games, this game has its fair share of awesome animals. There's a parrot, and a crazy cat man (who's basically an honorary animal). There's also a sinister crow that moonlights as a spider, and a guy named Crow, but he doesn't dress up like any animals and he dies in the first five minutes anyway so he doesn't count.\n\nThis game uses some weird Uncanny Valley-ish facial animations for everybody. Since this game is set in a mental asylum and the main character frequently hallucinates, though, it fits in quite well with everything else.\n\nAll in all, The Ward is an awesome game, and lives up to the original in every way (save for the lack of nude Voldemort running around). I really can't wait for 9 Clues 3! :D:","July 30, 2015","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
