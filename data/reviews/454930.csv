You're supposed to find a way to escape by activating the beacon. No surprise there, the achievement tells you that. However, getting anything done in the game is kind of a joke.\n\nYou walk around in the snow, with the ever present crunch crucnh of your boots as you plod along, hoping that the below zero temperatures will end your suffering. Unfortunately, they don't. While other people have obviously died, you are invincible. However, don't get stuck in a pit, because though you can survive long falls, and look inside wolves brains, you cannot jump or climb to save your life. Not that your life is in any danger, only one wolf seems able to kill you.\n\nStory: Non-existent.\n\nSounds: Crunch crunch is what you'll hear most of the time. Unless the random wanna be creepy music kicks in suddenly... and then you'll still hear the crunch crunch but at a subdued volume. Wolves are totally silent. Walking up one set of wooden stairs, reveals that you're half a thief. One foot makes no noise and the other makes tons of noise. Mom always said, not to replace your limbs with stranger's body parts. Storms instantly kick in and instantly cease. There is no rise or fall in volume level.\n\nGraphics: I have no idea what is going on here. While you're walking around, your arm sticks out.... The game is made up of square shapes for the most part, that sometimes overlap causing weird issues as the devs didn't bother to shorten them so they wouldn't stick through each other. While the SNOW is okay.... pretty much just really bad for everything else.\n\nGameplay: What gameplay? Try putting something heavy on your up arrow or w key and walking away then come back in a bit, you might have found a building. You cannot jump, though the config tool clearly shows a jump setting. You cannot crouch, so some items are impossible to retrieve. You have no cross hair option, so you have no idea if you're pointing at what you want and it just doesn't respond, or if you just can't interact with it. The controls themsevles are just a joke. There is nothing to tell you what they are, except the config tool at the beginning and even then, it doesn't cover everything. I have no idea how to make a fire either, though apparently T is the key for that. I'm not sure how I managed to fire my gun off, because I seemed to press buttons that didn't do antyhing before, but then suddenly I could shoot once I'd pressed H to get my rifle out. I have zero ideas how to select any other item in the inventory.\n\nI've met 3 wolves. Only one apparently has teeth. Though the others jump at me, obviously they just want to lick my face while smiling very big because they are so adorable. You can see through their heads if you get close enough and face them. There is no map or anything. I could go on and on and on, but what's the point? In this case, it's just a really bad game and nothing works.\n\nOh, one other thing, if you go to settings in the menu, you can essentially choose graphic quality. Your choices are Standard, something else that sounds appropriate and Height.... wtf? I know they mean, High, but seriously?\n\nOverall: 2/10 - At least it runs? Seriously, stay the hell away from this game. Don't even get it for free. Though it's advertised as Early Access, this is not even ready to be in that stage of development. This game needs a lot of work, and the dev is basically silent on the forums. Congratulations, people paid for your game and you stopped talking to them... that or you're just sitting there counting funds.\n\nDo Not Get This Game.","May 29","false","4.3"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","27","31","3","1"

Another cheap Unity Asset exploration game playing in a snowy enviroment. At least all achievements are working so far. But the controls are horrible. No jump. No crouch. You can just walk WASD, other functions are hidden without any hint, like to equip weapon=h, to make a campfire=t (but you'll need somehow the right amount of wooden logs) or TAB for inventory (but from which you cannot choose anything). So you are lost and the dev has just given later a rudimentary image file as a map. But still confusing. Because you spawn everytime on different places. No compass, no coordinates, nothing. If you are lucky you spawn at the small shed, collect all 5 fuel canisters, don't find the one deadly wolf of 3 wolves in-game and climbed up the lighthouse to start the generator. Then you are blessed. But what is that? You cannot climb up the last ladder. After half a hour you figure out a small white dialog (on white cloudy sky) lightup the lighthouse. Then finally comes the helicopter and end music.

This wolf followed me to the first house I found, I picked up a bottle of water then went to leave the building, the wolf was glitching in the air in front of the door and now I am stuck in this building. This is the reason I only have about 12 minutes played in this game.\n\nOther things I noticed:\n\nRepetitive annoying snow crunching sound persists even if you're in a building or on a road that has no snow on it\nI can open what I think is the inventory with tab but I have to press escape then to use the mouse, but then I can't do anything with items\nIs right click punch, push? If you hold right click then left click it extends the arm a little further. Not sure what either of these actually do\nIf you use the mouse you must hit escape after each time you click because the mouse disappears\nIn my 12 minutes I found a wolf that attempted to attack then was followed into a building I found and got stuck in\nI would strongly discourage anyone purchasing this game in the current state it is in. If it is completely overhauled I could see it being a cool adventure/exploration game but I wouldn't even consider it the skeleton of that in its current state.","April 16","false","0.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

You just pick up items you can't use. You collect log and fuel and can't have a fire, you have a sweater you cannot wear, you get food and water that can't be used and a bunch of other equally useless junk. The only two things that can be used are the flashlight that offers nothing whatsoever but you can hold it and the rifle which can be used to kill a wolf. Only one wolf, the first one you encounter. There are actually two wolves in the game but the second one won't even interact. And the one that does interact just barks at you but can't attack because nothing can kill you in that game. So you can kill a defenseless animal that is no threat and walk around in a terribly made icy place. Until you hit the invisible walls that is. Two out of three achievements are impossible and the game crashed the first two times I attempted launching it plus it's hard to even exit the game with the way the menu kinda works. Oh and you'd think a game looking so simple with a small map and nothing to do would be light, right? Wrong! It takes way more processing power than it should be taking. The whole game is a cruel joke to whoever buys it. It's still early access so I was going to give it a pity thumb up without even trying it before official release but then I saw the comments and thought "come on, how bad can it be?" and the anwer is "very very bad". I got it for free and got 3 cards out of it but still regret actually trying to play it. Having an accidental pet wolf is not worth the hussle. I'll change this review to a positive one if somehow the game is fixed and we can actually do something but I'm pretty sure it's beyond salvation. Devs don't rush to release something, not even in early access when it's so underdeveloped. All that gets is negative reviews.\n\nTl;dr:\nGame sucks.

It is a known fact there are plenty of older titles still wasting away on the store page with no activity while others try tooth and nail to prolong their stay in the status despite no real progress. It is a terrible realization when you think of all the potential developers that could be helped with the aid of Early Access that are stained with the stigma the last couple of years have built with abandoned products. One reason this happens is due to a title being released into Early Access too soon and Under Zero is a clear example of it.\n\nUnity has become a dangerous warning light when  Early Access come to mind and it seemed to be an accurate one. Visually the game is nothing special with the snowy landscape populated by rectangular shapes and some none boxy trees. You spawn next to a lighthouse that is somewhat difficult to climb due to the boxy shapes of the stairs overlapping each other. A few squarish buildings exist outside as well with some items, but they are also poorly designed with the potential of getting stuck. Invisible walls outline the boundary of the region which is inhabited by some decent looking wolves, but they clip into themselves, constantly chase you without hurting you or just stand there looking at you. One of the wolves followed me and managed to trap me inside a building (I could not walk through or past it). The design choices and layout feel as if it was all done in a afternoon without any fine rendering.\n\nMusic was non-existent for the first half of my initial and secondary play through with the load clumping of your footsteps making up the entirety of the soundtrack. There is a flashlight and a gun, but the gun lacks a basic design. Other items exist, but have no purpose (cherry soda for example). Settings for the game also seem off putting and confusing with the graphical setting for high spelled Height (at least I think high is what it is suppose to represent). The cursor disappears when you open the menu in-game unless you hit the ESC key while the character model still has the ability to look around. To even say this game lacks content is being overly generous: there is no content. It might have achievements (almost all are bugged) and trading cards, but these are not selling points.\n\nFor a game with no content and very low tier graphics, it sure has some performance issues. The game managed to crash on me a couple of times and the loading screen froze when I tried entering the game from the main menu. I already mentioned the fact you can be trapped by a wolf in the buildings, but the glitchy nature of the wolf needs addressing,again. The AI is non-existent as well, just endless chasing or standing. This really is the bare-basic concept of a game I have seen on Early Access, which is the worst thing you could say.\n\nAny program can be founded on good intentions, but it doesn't mean those intentions will protect it from games that slip through the cracks. I am told often you cannot judge a game by what it is, but instead from what it will become. It is that mindset that creates the problems Early Access has right now and those issues will not stop unless people start taking responsibility. I am not saying the developer for Under Zero is in the wrong here by releasing the game in this state, but it is up to the developer to reflect on how the game functions at the moment and act on it. It takes a great person to know when something is not worth the price of admission and work toward making something that is before selling it. Under Zero shouldn't be in Early Access in the state it is in, especially at the price it is asking. I really hope it can prove me wrong in my assumptions of what category it will end up in down the line, but very few games have so far.\n\nPros\n\n- None\n\nCons\n\n- No Content\n- Crashes and Loading Screen Freezes\n- Graphical glitches\n- Game breaking errors (wolf and floor boards trapping in building)\n- Music and sound issues\n- Settings\n- No Gameplay\n- No Purpose","April 27","false","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Within the first second of playing the game you can tell it's just another Unity Asset flip. The people who make these type of games shouldn't even call themselves "Developers". Typically Unity Asset flip games are just built using no effort whatsoever, they just pay 20 bucks to use premade models and code available on the unity store for use in the unity engine. It takes zero effort to plug and play these games into existence. They usually have no decent control schemes, absent developers, and very low prices. These prices may not sound like much, but a lot of people on steam just love spending money on cheap things to play, no matter how bad they are. The thing that sucks about that though is that due to the low low price of the game, and the mass amounts of people who have 99 cents to burn, these people actually make a crapton of money. For doing absolutely nothing.\n\nIf you were to play it I guarantee you too would be asking yourself "how the hell did this get on steam". Well, the answer is the steam community groups that offer similar games like this one for free and ask for greenlight votes in return. To better explain that, these 'developers' work alongside groups like Cubic Bundle and other no-effort steam groups to offer free copies of the games and in return ask for greenlight votes and whatnot for their next 'game'. It's all a big sham on both ends of the spectrum, they get to pump out more games, make more money, pay off the groups, while we get stuck with absolute garbage flooding steam, and people buying it up. It sucks that steam is allowing this kind of behavior, but sadly I don't think any of this will fix itself unless steam enforces and patrols greenlight themselves.\n\nThe game itself is horrible as well, just read the other reviews. There is no combat, or anything really implemented in it. You can jump and lift your arm up. No controls are listed in-game, the developers literally only made an announcement with them in it. There's no responses from the developers in the games discussion forums, and I'm glad that I got it for free just to write about it. It's literally just an empty shell of a game, and anyone interested in buying it should really look somewhere else. We shouldn't support this type of behavior on steam. Start going on greenlight and downing the garbage before all of the upvotes from people looking to get 'free games' makes it all seep up through the sewer grates and makes it into our store.","June 5","false","0.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You can't get rid of them by trying to run away so they will follow you around forever glitching out like crazy.\n4. The only thing in the game that made me go "ok that's cool" was the "blizzard" which ended quickly and suddenly giving you that jaring effect.\n5. The most annoying thing is the sound quality, My god is it ever been so bad.

I will be honest, this game has potential.\nI played around 20 minutes but I got frustrated because there was no point (in this version) in surviving, I ran from a wolf for 3 minutes when I stopped I realized I didn't took damage. Kappa, nice scare though xD\n\nThis game is missing improvement on the basic controls, the menu needs to be fixed, the controls too and adding a save game button would be nice.\n\nI know how hard is developing a game, because I tried to develop one witha friend and we gave up doing it. Try improving the gameplay and playability and then the graphics (my opinion tho).\n\nWell..

Also, once you meet the wolve, you can't kill it, and it WILL get you stuck.\n\nThis game has a lack of graphics (8-bit games are better), lack of controls (no crouch/no jump), lack of direction (where to go?!). The point is also way too unclear. What do I do, where do I go? This game, on a rating: 1/10. The 1 is for the effort, which you actually shouldn't deserve.\n\nIf this game is created by new creators get this off steam, upload it to kickstarter and try to get it better.
