The popular HOG developer re-mastered and re-released the original version of the title to fit widescreens, and despite a bit of dated gameplay, at least by HOG standards, holds up really well.\n\nOur story begins with a detective waking after a terrible storm has devastated Maple Creek.  With a bout of limited amnesia that prevents her from remembering anything about the case she'd been working on, and only bits and pieces of clues that have been scattered to the wind, she must now piece together why she is there, what happened to the town, and how to save the residents from a diabolical manipulation that has spanned generations.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=423967244\nAlthough the plot isn't completely original and is filled with plenty of clichés, it's not your standard "mother looking for missing daughter" or "bride searching for kidnapped fiancée" tale that we get way too often in these games.  I love the fact that the main character is removed from the story outside of the events that happen as a result of her investigation.  I also enjoyed the darker aspects - the ritual sacrifices, obsession and revenge, all given that HOG gloss, of course, but it's more engrossing storytelling than most other hidden object adventures.\n\nOriginally released in 2011, Ghosts was ahead of its time.  As part of the adventure-lite gameplay, you gather evidence and clues that must be linked together in order to make deductions on the case and further the storyline.  This game mechanic does a excellent job of placing you in the shoes of a detective, and in some ways is far more effective at conveying the role than many other less casual mystery games.  Utilizing your skills in deduction like an old fashioned private eye adds a bit of character in a genre that is altogether too static.\n\nThat said, there are a LOT of hidden object scenes in the game.  I would often go through spans where I was literally playing one scene after another.  This may prove unenjoyable for those who prefer a little more adventure in their HOGs.  The scenes themselves can be pretty difficult too; a few of the items were rather deceptively, and frustratingly, hidden.  Oftentimes I would need to take a break from staring at the screen to refresh my eyes and take another look with a new perspective later on. As for the puzzles, most of them I had seen before, none of which were too difficult or time-consuming. A few even had slight changes that were quite refreshing (a slide puzzle that didn't make me want to break my keyboard, who'd have thought?).  If I had to choose, a few more puzzles instead of hidden object scenes would have been nice, but the uneven ratio of HOSs to puzzles did not diminish my enjoyment of the game at all.\n\nAnother aspect some may find bothersome is the lack of a map with quick travel. There is a lot of backtracking involved in the game and it may prove tiring for players who are used to using the map to move around more quickly; even I found the amount of backtracking to be a tad much, and I'm generally fine with it in most games.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=431873222\nArtwork and presentation is where the game really shines.  Everything from the heavily damaged hotel to the countryside cottages and forest trails are beautifully painted and detailed.  My favorite areas are definitely the forest trails with the warm fall colors of the autumn trees contrasting against the hazy blue night sky, giving off a lonely and secluded feel to the atmosphere that is a bit eerie yet peaceful at the same time.  This is all accompanied by a beautifully haunting piano-based soundtrack that's been one of my very favorites ever since I first played the game four years ago.  I simply cannot get enough of it. And while the cut-scenes have animations that are somewhat rudimentary, they lend a bit of cinematic flare to the storytelling.  Even the voice acting is rather good, and I've found AM's voice actors to be quite grating in the past.  There's only one voice that I felt was really out of place, but I think that might have been a stylistic choice.\n\nA side note, I strongly recommend playing the bonus chapter.  Even though you won't miss out on anything important to the main plot if you don't, there's some interesting history behind Maple Creek and the game's villain that helps flesh out the overall story.\n\nDespite some dated elements (an overabundance of hidden object scenes, no map travel), Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek is a classic of the genre that deserves a spot in every HOG enthusiast's library.  Unless you absolutely cannot stand playing through more than a handful of hidden object scenes, make sure you grab this one. On sale or not, it's worth every penny.\n\nBottom Line: A classic of the hidden object genre that needs to be in every HOGGamer's library.","April 25, 2015","true","9.3"," 89 of 93 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","89","93","3","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rubyeyepics/recommended/284750/","rubyeyepics","rubyeye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rubyeyepics/","15 products in account","To most gamers, Hidden Object Adventure Games are usually associated with words like “cheap” and “casual”. Not something a “real” gamer would waste their time on.  Unfortunately, those people would be missing out on some of the most beautiful, thought provoking, and narratively engaging games the industry has to offer. Developer Artifex Mundi have established themselves as the most recognized creators in this genre, with each successive title adding some new game mechanic or cleverly designed puzzle never seen before.  The template from which they have continually built their success arguably began with the critically acclaimed Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek.\n\nDue to fan interest, this 2011 title recently saw its release on the Steam service, in the wake of its sequel, The Mists of Ravenwood. As the first in the Enigmatis series, the game does not share many of the new convenient mechanics or additional features as its sequel and other current titles. For instance, The Ghosts of Maple Creek only offers 2 difficulty modes, there are no special in-game achievements to uncover, and hidden object puzzles don’t provide a substitute mini-game you can play in case you just can’t seem to find that one elusive object (usually tucked away behind some obscure “thing” you don’t recognize).  One particular cypher puzzle requires you to activate a number sequence found on a clue you pieced together.  If you don’t have a particularly good memory, you have to keep going back to your evidence screen.  Later games rectified this by automatically placing the code next to you on the puzzle board.\n\n\nAs a Murder Mystery, you travel to different locations uncovering clues to help you solve the case.  However, in this game you quite literally have to travel through Maple Creek from one location to another, because the ability to instantly relocate via your map was not added until later games. This might seem frustrating at first, until you notice how various locations you revisit activate additional hidden puzzles.  This kind of design tries to emulate the chaotic process a real crime-solver goes through, even if the narrative seems linear.\n\nThe story of Maple Creek itself could be viewed like an episode of "Murder She Wrote", with you playing the part of a very young Angela Lansbury, with some supernatural elements thrown in (because that’s always cool).  Even today, Enigmatis still displays some of the most striking environmental artwork of any HOPA game.  The visages of a storm ridden town are punctuated by incredibly subtle foliage, lightning and wind animations.  Given its age, character animations are (forgivingly) amateurish with their marionette-like facial emotes and terrible lip-flaps.  Additionally, the cinematic cut-scenes were not re-rendered at higher resolution for full-screen monitors, and subsequently show heavy pixelation, most likely due to upscaling.  Despite this, you remain engrossed with the story and intent on revealing the town’s secrets.\n\n\nBy its own merits, Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek is a great game for someone looking to try their hand at Hidden Object Adventures and for those who enjoyed The Mists of Ravenwood. Even long time players of Artifex Mundi games should take a stroll through Maple Creek, and see where it all began.","December 17, 2014","true","6.8"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","34","34","0","0"

The action kicks off right from the beginning and doesn't let up until the end credits start to roll.\n\nA savage storm reeks havoc on the town of Maple Creek. Skies are dark, and Autumn leaves fall on untread streets. You are seemingly alone, hurt, and have no memory of what you are doing there. But you feel as though it was something important before... before...\n\nThis title is fully immersive and one of the darkest themed entries in the creator's considerable arsenal. It's also one of their best works, as it's so smarty done. The hidden objects are beautifully placed and cleverly concealed. The puzzles are well done and take a bit of a back seat in comparsion to the aforementioned. The method of detection and/or investigative model that runs throughout the game is believable and not overdone. The quality in terms of story telling is truly spot on. There are quite a bit of layers, twists and turns, psychological and horrifying moments which made it a very deep tale. The sound and visuals, are what I've come to expect by these fine developers, as setting the standard in this genre. There are no hicups and the game runs beautifully.\n\nA very satisfying game to be sure! It leaves you wanting more because it's that damn good. And thankfully, you get more when the story is continued in Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood.

I was convinced to have reviewed Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek, that I was making big eyes when I saw that, no, I didn't.\n\nI reinstalled the game and replayed it. I wasn't going to use my memory for this one.\n\nEnigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek is the first Enigmatis and is developped by Artifex themselves. In it, you wake up in a town, without any recent memories. You just know that you were there to solve a disappearance. But the more you're learning about Maple Creek, the more you'll understand that the reverend is behind something monstruous.\n\nThe story is well-written as usual and is using a feature used rarely in the genre: amnesia about the case, meaning that you'll investigate everything again, though there are now more obstacles: Maple Creek got some damage due to a storm, the residents are going to the church, with a bell that doesn't end to ring, your own car has an accident and now, Hamilton, a missing detective, is showing himself.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty quite the standard one: find items, use them to reveal new paths or puzzles, clear hidden objects scenes, etc.. However, I can tell that the game is an old one: indeed, you have a lot of hidden objects scenes, which you're often visiting (though previous items found aren't put back, which is nice) and with a lot of items in them. Some objects are hard to find, as they can be mistaken for an element in the background. Puzzles, however, are easy to do.\n\nThere is a specific feature: you have a case board, where you'll pin clues, which will lead to new questions. It's a nice way to focus on the case, instead of reading a diary and trying to find solutions in the pages of it.\n\nHowever, there is a large problem for the navigation: indeed, some arrows are close to each other (like the balcony on your hotel room) meaning that some misclickings will happen: I wanted to go back to my room from the balcony but because I was going too fast, I wasn't pointing on the right area and I ended up to the garden. Also, the map isn't interactive at all: you can't use it for fast travel.\n\nThe graphics are very correct, like with any Artifex Mundi's game, and are sticking to the story in itself: don't expect any sun, as you're doing everything in one night, in a deserted town, with some exploring in the forest and with some damage due to a storm.\n\nAs usual, the soundtrack is very good.\n\nAs it's a special edition, you'll end up with a bonus chapter, with Hamilton's first contact with Maple Creek 30 years before the plot of the main story.\n\nEnigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek is as usual a very good title for playing casual adventures, with an important presence of hidden objects scenes as it was released first during a period where the genre was aiming towards its actual version. While you don't need it to understand the sequel, I recommend to begin by Maple Creek, to really have a better connection with people you'll meet in Ravenwood.","April 4","true","7.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

As in all hidden object games the navigation does get to me for 2 reasons: First, it’s not always apparent where you need to go, I found myself using hints to point me in the right direction more than once. Also, these games make you back track quite often. You may have to travel the length of the map to grab a key, then to the other end to use it.

The game starts with the detective having temporary short-term memory loss and as she retraces her steps in her investigation she recovers her memories of the previous events.  Her investigation becomes a suspenseful murder mystery that borders on horror with supernatural elements.\n\nDisclaimer:  I really do not like horror of any kind and this for me borders on it.  Seriously, I gasped out loud and quite literally nearly jumped out of my chair at the major jump scare and that alone set me on edge for the rest of the game.  And I was extremely glad I was playing during the day.\n\nGameplay: Engaging and suspenseful as the detective retraces her already completed investigation (she does not remember yet) and tries to find the missing girl.  Now if one takes into account that in a real investigation there is a lot of back and forth movement, retracing of steps, and re-visiting of locations then one should not get too annoyed the game does the same thing.  As new evidence is revealed, locations are re-visited.  Unfortunately this game lacks a fast travel map. As the investigation unfolds from a missing person case it becomes a mystery, a very dark and sinister one.\n\nOne of the most unique elements of the game is the "evidence wall".  As clues/evidence are collected (and recollected) it is put on the "evidence wall" (which can be accessed at any time from the main play screen).  Between the notebook and "evidence wall" the player gets the "feel" of a "real" investigation.  As the investigation continues the player gets involved in a murder mystery.  (Too many spoilers if I say more.)  I highly recommend reading the notebook, too, so much information in such a little space.\n\nSince this is a Hidden Object game all I have to say about the HO finds is: "jerks".  There are three types of "jerk" find objects by my definition.\n1) One is an find clue that can be many things.  For example: Bow.  Bow on a gift package, bow in the hair, more obcure bow tie, bow as in bow and arrow, or the bow of a boat.  The Ravenhearst HO games by Big Fish Games (found on steam) are full of those.\n2) The second "jerk" object is one so hard to find, so well hidden, it is nearly impossible to find. This game is full of those.  Even though every hidden object scene is played three times each time with different objects (and fortunately the last group is not re-added) there is at least one object that makes me, at least, say, "jerks".  (After over a 100 HO games I had to consult a guide to find some.)  An example is the clue: crumbled paper.  Generally that brings to mind a wadded up ball of paper, in one particular scene, it was a wrinkled up flat sheet of paper fit nicely against the light colored floor with the edges covered up.  "Jerks"\n3) The third type of "jerk" find object is also in this game.  Though not as prevalent as the second type.  The third "jerk" object is a deliberate mislead.  For example calling a top hat a cylinder, or a horse saddle a seat.  Yes, a top hat is a cylinder, as a saddle is a seat, but cylinder and seat is not what comes to mind first or even tenth.  "Jerks"\nHowever, once the player realizes "they" are doing that, one adjusts and moves on.  At least I do.\n\nOne of the things I was amazed about was the actual length of the game.  It is quite long.  It plays as a quite logical progression of an investigation.  Everything is ordered, and as new evidence is pieced together the player wants to revisit a location to look for more clues or evidence.  I am fairly sure the game also does not reveal future evidence/clues/needed objects until the necessary prerequisites are meet, keeping the game fresh, and the player engaged.\n\nOverall a great game to play, despite "them" being "jerks" in find objects arena.  It is a long, involved, slightly convoluted missing person case turning into a murder mystery.  OH YES cannot forget the "to be continued" tag at the end.\n\nJust a note of trivia:  Yes, Vermont does look like that (I live in Massachusetts) especially in the autumn and hoardes of people drive along designated scenic roads or hike through the mountains just to admire the turning and turned leaves. (It is even possible to drive through sleepy little towns like Maple Creek, some that even claim to be haunted.)  Yes, those are real mountain names too in the Appalachain Mountians.  The information given about the wildlife is even accurate.  I was quite surprised by all that actually since many games call moths butterflies or vice versa.\n\nOh yes, one last thing -  This is the same town Museum Director Sarah Black (Nightmares from the Deep) mentioned was such a wonderful place to visit (in the second game while looking at a photo).  No wonder that woman attracts nautical ghosts.  LOL","September 7, 2015","true","10.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

However late game has really weird logic (I have a saw but I cannot cut a rope ladder because I need a KNIFE) and really bad voice acting from the guy who voices Richard Hamilton. What makes it worse is that the bonus campaing (after you beat the main story) is just Richard Hamilton, ugh! The gameplay is just walking around and solving puzzles which is nice. HOWEVER, I encountered a game breaking bug at the part where you fix a pipe! Only way to remove it is to start a new game and hope it does not happen again! Which sucks as it seems a bit random.

I was very tempted to hit the hint button many times where I've never really felt that when playing any other Artifax Mundi game so far. If it wasn't for the achievement to finish all HO puzzles without hitting the hint button I probably would have.\n\nSome of the names also make you think. For a very simple example, "arrow". Hmmm, I can't find an archery arrow, maybe I should be looking for the shape instead.\n\nCons:\n\nThere are three or four objects that it seems have part of the hotspot for clicking it missing. I found this to be a negligable issue. If you clicked on it in a typical spot it will react appropriately.\n\nYes, the male detective's voice acting is pretty bad, but I could personally get past that pretty easily.\n\nFor some reason I couldn't type my name in the new player box so had to go with the default "Player", "Player1", "Player2" etcetera naming scheme which I found to be a very minor issue since the only time I see it is when I'm switching players (which I never do).\n\nDepends how you see it:\n\nThere are a few objects with odd names a negative reviewer here mentioned like skein for a ball of yarn, but what I thought while I was playing is that this will help me to expand my vocabulary. So you could see this as a positive or a negative.\n\nFinally:\n\nI played this on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 without any real issues.","December 28, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","I have to admit, I enjoy part two a lot more than this one. It's obvious that this is an early game of Artifex Mundi, as it lacks a lot of what makes the other games more enjoyable than this.\n\nFirstly is the lack of teleporting accross the map. Things are spaced out so far away from each other, that it gets tedious to backtrack accross the whole map. Roads doesn't overlap, so you have to go through about 7-10 scenes to get to one area.\n\nI find that the hidden object scenes rely a lot on masking things by bad lightning and having way too many objects on one screen. My eyes got tired from just trying to identify many of the objects. A good hidden scene doesn't require over fifty items on one single screen.\n\nThe story is quite meh in this one, especially compared to part two. I cared a lot more about the characters in part two, here you barely talk to anyone, so it becomes quite an anonymous save.\n\nStill, it isn't a terrible game. Still gives about 3-4 hours of entertainment.

Also, I find the achievement system way too easy, I literally got every single achievement during my first playthrough and while I don't really have any problems with this, I think that the achievements should encourage at least an extra playthrough, which again, is another issue which along with the previous one was fixed in the sequel.\n\nAll in all: It's another great game from Artifex Mundi, being the third game from them which I have played, my favorite one is still Enigmatis 2.

And boy, am I glad I did. Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek sure is a treat for those players who love a good mystery, and hidden object game.\n\n=Complete Review=\n\n=The Story: 3/5= It's pretty intriguing. I'd rather not give spoilers to the main story elements, as that would ruin the mystery, but I'll give you the gist of it: It puts you in the role of a detective, researching a missing person's case, and a strange town with a dark history behind it. But just as you were about to solve the case, something terrible happens, resulting in you losing your memory of it.\n\nWhich leaves you having to pick up the pieces where you left off, however weathered and worn they are from the storm that struck. You must find the terrible secret of the quaint little town, and save those that are left before it's too late.\n\n=The User Interface: 4/5=  Now this part is pretty nice. HOGs typically have to give their own little HUD dynamics aside from story and aesthetic to keep a player interested. And with this one? They definitely kept me interested. There's a journal which writes down your findings, and gives insight in to what the character thinks is going on. There's also a map function (Which will be neigh useless if you're playing expert mode), which will let you know if there's sections you've still got some searching to do.\n\nBut most importantly, is the investigations screen. As you go through the game, you'll pick up pieces of evidence. In the investigations screen, it's your job to find out which pieces of evidence correspond to different pieces of the investigation. Doing this allows the player character to draw conclusions to what the next steps in the investigation will be.\n\n=The Gameplay: 4/5= The hidden object scenes are quite good in number, and also don't suffer from too much of a unecessary bloat of objects as I've seen in other games in the genre, where each scene looks like a screenshot off of "Hoarders". A good portion of the items look like they would logically be in that scene, albeit still looking like a whirlwind blew through the area. Granted, the setting makes it make sense.\n\nThe puzzles are also each unique, and there are no repeat puzzles at all, which is definitely a breath of fresh air. The game can be pretty difficult to start, but that makes it all the more fun. And for those who like a extra challenge, there's also the expert mode available.\n\n=The Graphics: 3/5= Now, it's all too often that I've played a HOG game, and the scenes were just lackluster. Images that looked as though they were grabbed off of Google images, and slapped overtop of a background. This fortunately, is not the case for this game. A vast majority of the objects you must find fit nicely in to their respective screens, and are hard to tell if it's part of the backdrop or a actual item you can click.\n\nThe art for the backgrounds is well done, as is the character art. Character design is pretty good, and doesn't look too bad... Well, so long as no one starts talking. As, there's a bit of a problem with the fact that back when they made this game, the artist didn't know how to make a character look like they were speaking. This means the character is stiff, but their mouth moves... And, the mouth drops -significantly- in quality when it moves. Nothing major, just something that bugs me.\n\n=The Music: 3/5=  It's very pleasing to listen to, and definitely help set the ambience for the game. There aren't too many tracks to my knowledge, but they do their job well, and are well done. The tracks may get boring when you're stuck listening to the same ones for the hours you play, but that's to be expected. The music for this game isn't intended for the purpose of being a earwig, it's intended to set a tone for the game, and it does just that.\n\n=The Atmosphere: 4/5= I have to say, the atmosphere on this is good. It's a pretty dark game, but it doesn't try to shove the dark tones down your throat, which is nice, and keeps true to it being more a mystery than a darker-and-edgier game.\n\nNot to say that the game doesn't have it's dark moments, as it certainly does. In fact, there's a few, maybe three to four jumpscares in it. But nothing overly bad so as to label it a 'horror' game. But for those who are looking for a light-hearted HOG game, this is certainly not for them.\n\n=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=\n\nPros\n- An engaging plot, involving a missing persons case sprawling out in to a far bigger case.\n- A great UI, far better than most HOGs i've seen.\n- Pretty decent difficulty puzzles.\n- Plenty of hidden object scenes.\n- It has ACHIEVEMENTS!\n- A bonus chapter to give insight in to the past of one of the characters!\n\nNeutral\n- Jumpscares. Granted the jumpscares are ones that make sense, so it's not too bad.\n\nCons\n- The characters look weird when they're talking, due to their mouthes dropping significantly in quality as they talk.\n- The starting sequence's dialogue is a bit cliche, but things get better over time in the game.\n\n=The Conclusion: 8/10= All in all, I have to say that this was definitely a very pleasing HOG game for me, and I would definitely recommend this for Hidden Object Game fans both old and new. And if the rest of Artifex Mundi's games are as nice and well-polished as this, then it's likely I have plenty more positive reviews ahead of me to write.\n\nThank you very much for taking your time to read my review~.","June 23, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(I won't go further to avoid spoilers).\nThe problem of this two titles is that they are strictly linked between them and on Steam they have been released in opposite order (first the second chapter and just recently the first one).\nA really bad thing for the fans of this genre and this software house that seen the fun of unveil the mystery took away.\n\nOther than this "little" problem, what made my decision go toward the "no" is:\n\n- Too few puzzles.\n- Those ones are too easy making the already short game even shorter.\n- A really bad translation (at least in Italian) leads you to the mistake and to use the Hint in the hidden object sessions.\n- The story, the setting and the characters are only sketched and made with the obvious purpouse to push the gamer to buy the second chapter, making the game not so addictive.\n\nIf you still want to try it I would suggest to wait until it will end in some bundle.\n\n***\n\nRispetto ad altri titoli sempre editi dalla Artifex Mundi, questo gioco presenta varie carenze che mi fanno propendere per il pollice verso; ma andiamo con ordine e partiamo dall'inizio.\n\nEnigmatis: The Ghost of Maple Creek è un'avventura grafica punta e clicca hidden object.\nIl vostro compito, in veste di Detective, è quello di trovare una ragazza recentemente scomparsa e svelare il mistero che si cela dietro Maple Creek.\n\nPer quelli di voi che hanno già giocato il capitolo seguente, Enigmatis: The Mists of Ravenwood, si presenta un piccolo quanto peculiare problema: sapete già cosa succede. (Non entro nel dettaglio per evitare ulteriori spoiler).\nIl problema è che questi due titoli risultano essere legati fra loro, e su Steam sono stati rilasciati in ordine inverso (è stato pubblicato prima il secondo capitolo e solo recentemente il primo).\nBrutta storia per gli appassionati come me di questo genere e di questa casa editrice, che si vedono portare via il gusto dell'arrivare fino in fondo per svelare il mistero.\n\nAl di là di questo "piccolo" intoppo, ciò che fa oscillare l'ago della bilancia verso il "no" è:\n\n- La presenza di pochi enigmi\n- La facilità dei suddetti, con il risultato di rendere poco longeva una già breve storia\n- L'approssimativa traduzione che ti spinge a commettere errori ed eventualmente ad usare l'aiuto nelle scene hidden object (un esempio su tutti la parola Pipe tradotta come tubo e non come pipa)\n- L'evidente abozzo di storia, personaggi e ambientazione fatto apposta per spingerti a comprare il secondo capitolo rendono il gioco poco coinvolgente\n\nSe proprio siete convinti di volerlo provare, posso solo suggerirvi di aspettare che finisca in qualche bundle.","January 10, 2015","false","7.7"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

The targeting space for clicking on objects during the hidden object portion of the game are very harsh, meaning it is very easy to miss the object sometimes,  I found that there are times when I found that puzzles did not activate or activated improperly during the game, but It honestly did not affect my impression of the game.

For one, while the HOG portions of the game are good for the most part, 1-2 of them have items are INSANELY difficult to find unless you jack your monitor's brightness levels to insane (I'm looking at you "Gloves"!).  The other half of the game, the point-and-click portion, isn't bad.  Most of the items and their uses are pretty, only got stumped 1 or 2 times.\n\nI didn't expect much from the narrative, and in that regard I hit the nail on the head.  Stilted dialogue, mediocre voice-acting, and a well-worn storyline were to be expected, but what can you expect? it's a HOG.

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.\n\nThat's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.\n\nThey do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.\n\nMy recommendation, because of the "if you've played one you've played them all" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games.","August 12, 2015","false","7.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game starts very near the end – with you running through a huge storm, fleeing from some unknown danger and losing your memory in the process. As the storm subsides, you find yourself on the outskirts of Maple Creek. Lost, alone, and with no recollection of what you were doing...\n\nEnigmatis is a small, casual game, to be played in a few hours. Personally, I completed it in a little less than 4 hours.

The production values, true to the Artfex Mundi brand, are strong, with well-rendered art, good atmospheric music, and acceptable voice acting.\n\nIn the main game, you play as a detective with plot-amnesia who must retrace her steps to uncover the generic horror tropes overtaking the town. There is also a bonus mission that takes place thirty years in the past, and shows a bit more background for an earlier crime case. The story is not the most original, but it is solid.\nAs the first installment in the Enigmatis series, it leaves a plot hook open for the sequel, but the ending feels like a clean and natural stopping point.\n\nThe adventure puzzles are completely intuitive. As long as you examine everything you can, you will have no trouble figuring out what to do next, or determining which item is needed for each solution. If you are ever stuck. there is a hint button in both regular and expert mode that will give you a subtle nudge in the right direction. Additionally, in regular mode your map will show an exclamation point at locations with an available action or puzzle.\n\nThe mini-games are mostly genre-standard puzzles like jigsaws, tile-swapping, tile-sliding, and logic brain-teasers, but there were also a couple of new and surprising challenges such as the code puzzle in the bonus mission. I found the games to be enjoyable diversions, and each game either unlocked a new area to explore, uncovered a new item, or provided your character with more information on the case.\n\nAs a crime drama, some puzzles require you to find and examine evidence in order to figure out the solution (usually involving paying close attention to the photographs you collect). There is also an ongoing "evidence wall" mechanic that allows you to combine clues and make deductions, thereby advancing the plot.\n\nThe hidden object screens (HOSs) were plentiful and challenging. They were of the "incongruent items haphazardly shoved into too small of a space" variety, with the macguffin being that a tornado had ransacked the town and caused widespread destruction and debris (while mysteriously leaving all of the cruets, light bulbs, and wine bottles intact).\nThere were a few times when it was hard to distinguish where an item ended and the background began, but for the most part the items were delineated enough to figure out what was what.\nMy main nitpicky concern with these puzzles is actually the choice of words that are used for labeling. The average American is not going to know that a cylinder is another word for top hat, a cockade means a symbolic ribbon knot, sticking plaster is a band-aid, and an aspergillum is a type of liturgical tool. The complexity of a HOS should come from the cleverness of how items are arranged, not from word confusion. (Although I cannot deny that my vocabulary has greatly expanded since discovering HOGs, I think using more internationally-understood synonyms like "bandage" or "cap badge" would be more accessible to a larger audience.)\nOver the course of the game you revisit each HOS 2-3 times, but the puzzles are adaptive; items you have previously searched for stay cleared, and new plot-related items are added. You never look for the same item twice.\n\nOne other thing that bugged me about the game, and that is a common grievance for most HOGs, is the amount of backtracking involved. The map does not have a quick jump option, so you will spend most of your time running back and forth from one end of the game to the other.\n\nThere are 11 achievements to earn, and I was able to get them all in one complete playthrough.\n\nOverall, this is a perfectly fine HOG with a sound plot, respectable puzzles, a good challenge level, and AM-level production values. If you like the horror-mystery genre and cheap scares, and aren't afraid of backtracking or of tricky terminology, then you will absolutely enjoy this game. If you just like HOGs in general and are looking for a new one to try, this one will meet your expectations of an industry-standard game. I give it a 7/10.","May 3, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere tends to be great, the voice acting isn't bad, and the story, if thin and transparent, is at least interesting. The problem is that the actual puzzle/hidden object gameplay, while solid, is just so flawed. The puzzles tend to be of the frustrating "keep starting over until you hit upon the exact sequence" variety - expected of an Artifex Mundi title, but still inviting many Skip-button presses - and the hidden object portions are a mixed bag. Incredibly, if you replay them from the Extras menu, one of the HO areas doesn't even include one of the objects you're supposed to find (the "horns" in the Chapel), making it literally impossible to get one of the achievements unless you go through them all perfectly when you play the initial campaign. Still, this game lands at the upper end of the genre, so if you can get it on sale it's still worth it.","January 22, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A great hidden object game, with a good variety of puzzles. The visuals as usual were really good and the same with sound. But what really sealed it for me was the story in this one. You play as a Detective looking for a missing person, with the clues leading to the mysterious Maple Creek. The story was surprisingly engaging and really kept me hooked the whole way through. There are some scares in the game, so if you're sensitive to "boo moments" be aware of that. But mostly you just get an eerie feel like in Twin Peaks, the face of the town is normal, but at the same time something is very wrong you just can't put your finger on it. I really recommend this both as a puzzle game, but at the same time I have to recommend it for the story. A good experience, and it lasted longer than most hidden object games. 8.4/10","March 19","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the story holds up pretty well and is interesting enough, this game really likes to send you back and forth between the same places a dozen times for single actions/items. The puzzles are alright, not very hard to solve- but difficult enough to keep you busy. This HOG has hidden object scenes where a lot of objects that you need to find aren't actually so much objects as they are symbols. Some objects are so obscure that they are annoyingly hard to find and some item descriptions aren't very clear on what you're actually looking for.\n\nThis game has an open ending, so unless you can/want to play the sequel this will have an unsatisfying ending.\n\nPros:\n*Decent storytelling\n*Voice acting is, for the most part, alright\n*Wide variety of locations\n\n\nCons:\n*Be prepared to walk between scenes, A LOT\n*Vague item descriptions\n*The game music is looped, but not perfectly- this means sometimes the music will abruptly stop before picking up again","August 21, 2015","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played it through to completion, including the bonus chapter.\n\nThis is not one of the better HOG from AM, I have enjoyed others far more. The plot is faintly creepy, missing girls demonic happenings, but that you expect in a HOG game to be honest. My main bug bear is that it's clunky. You have to manually retrace steps when you go to a different location which if that involves more than three steps (which is does a lot) you find yourself just skipping through lots of areas and it takes time.\n\nThe other issue is that the HOG are not the most helpful, in several there are more than one item that looks like the one you are searching for, or that the game is asking you to look for a cylinder and it's a hat. I was not impressed with that.\n\nHowever having played it through and then started on the bonus chapter (which is pretty quick) I would say yes. I started it and I felt sad, I engaged with the main character because I knew what happened next, and not to spoil but at the end I genuinely thought Oh yes we can do it.\n\nWait until it's on special, but give it a chance if only for the back story.\n","January 10","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Fun" is the ultimate benchmark for gaming, right?\n\nBut I give the recommendation with a few reservations:\n1. The voice acting is distractingly bad.\n2. The game relies too heavily on hidden object games.\n3. The game occasionally forces players to make inconceivable mental leaps to uncover the next clue. At least three times, we encountered a situation where there was simply no way to deduce the next move with the information provided by the game and had to abuse the hint system. Wait until you need the glass shard and you'll see what I mean.\n4. The story is relatively straightforward.","December 24, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
