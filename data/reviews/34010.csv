It's serviceable. Ok. Nothing at all fantastic. Reminds me a bit of Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker but actually marginally fun. But that's all just filler. My recommendation is to level stealth and pistols because they're absurdly overpowered and you can get through the game very quickly with them.\n\nThe real gameplay is the dialogue system and your interaction with characters. It's really something else. Every dialogue choice is timed and you have to have you options picked before the other character finishes speaking. There are no awkward pauses between lines and it all flows like good dialogue in a film. That might sound like you don't have control or you won't be able to react fast enough but that is not true. Your options are presented in a succinct but clear way. Usually they are just provided as a single-word description of your overall tone that allows you to quickly process your choices and decide how you want to respond. Sometimes your choices don't have obvious consequences and how the player character acts may catch you off-guard, but those situations are very rare.\n\nBut as important as your breath of choices in these encounters with characters are the consequences of them. While the game follows a somewhat fixed revenge story your relationship with each character will change your experience of that story hugely. There is a multi-layer conspiracy for you to uncover and if you do not play your cards right there will be parts of it and roles played by characters that you won't even realise you missed. Everyone has secrets and your relationship with them will affect what you learn about them.\n\nAnd that is not to say you should buddy up with everyone. Having characters hate you can be to your advantage. A poor relationship with one character may actually endear you to someone they dislike. Making them angry may cause them to make poor decisions that benefit you.\n\nThere's a huge depth to the story and it really does react to everything you do. Characters will reference your past decisions and attitudes and it will shape the details of the story you find yourself in. Your choices matter. Your relationships matter. That is what Alpha Protocol is all about.","November 25, 2013","true","30.0"," 330 of 353 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","330","353","0","5"

I'm not a fan of wordiness, so here's the basic rundown, pluses and minuses and stuff.\n+ brilliant stealth system. People notice gunshots (but not silenced ones), dead bodies, themselves being shot... loads of stuff\n+ skill customization is wonderful. By end-game of my stealth build I could walk into a room invisible, kill 5 people and walk out without anyone seeing me. Leeroy Jenkins run: kick in the door, empty the clip, everyone's dead before the alarm's raised.\n+ boss fights were pretty good. They all had features to make them unique, and it was fun to fight all of them except non-spiked Brayko\n+ dossiers were super useful, both as flavor-text and in-game. I loved pausing before the end to read all the stuff I'd learned about everyone\n+ cutscenes were well-done. Most were skippable (BRILLIANT) and I loved Mike's various responses to things\n+ special mention for letting me Punch Marburg as a dialog option\n+ also: "refuse" "kiss my ♥♥♥" "♥♥♥♥ off" is the best set of options I've ever encountered.\n+ There were so many things I could do. The devs coded in a lot of secrets and stuff\n- dialog choices could've been more descriptive. I wasn't expecting Mike to insult someone when I pressed Suave.\n- I wish Sis got more involvement in the game\n- there were an unfortunate amount of glitches, such as Mike trying to hold an Assault Rifle like an SMG, or slowly creeping up a wall\n* Positive or negative: the Chain Shot's final upgrade is incredibly overpowered. This would be completely negative, but it allowed me to destroy forced aggro fights (bosses) and continue on my merry, crouch-walking way.\n* Some of the glitches were hilarious. I managed to stick a guard through a wall, and he wouldn't stop vibrating.\n* Security minigames. I loved the Digital Keypad, was neutral on the Lockpicking, and despised Hacking, because of mouse sensitivity.\n* The characters could emote really well! ...could be a little higher-rez, but it was originally for consoles, so whatever.\n\nOverall, wonderful game! I'd easily give this a 9/10 on a standard scale, and wish there was a sequel in the making.","December 21, 2014","true","43.4"," 158 of 169 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","158","169","14","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/intelagent747/recommended/34010/","intelagent747","Oska","http://steamcommunity.com/id/intelagent747/","233 products in account","I'll start off by saying this game was an unexpected gem. Alpha Protocol is one of the best RPGs I have every played. The premise of the game is original, the dialogue is superb, and the story kept me interested. I felt that the characters were quite easy to get attached to after a few dialogues. There is one major flaw this game has, and that is the combat and stealth systems.\n\nCombat and stealth, or just interacting with enemies in general, is extremely clunky in this game. At times it is frustratingly bad (for example, shooting enemies from <20 ft away and missing with half the magazine), but in my opinion the excellent dialogue, story telling, and decision making all make up for it. As other reviewers have said, another notable aspect of this game is that the decisions you make in this game actually change the way the story unfolds, unlike most games where they only change the ending. I think this gives the game more than a little additional replay value.\n\nOther notes: the graphics are excellent compared to other games released around the same time. The sounds are of high quality. The voice acting is great, in my opinion. The level design is rather simple, but it works. The AI are pretty stupid, but that can be a pro or con depending on how you look at it.\n\n\nIf you are looking for a game that is rich in story and is addictive, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a combat oriented game with developed combat mechanics, you may want to try something else. I have to take 1 off for the crappy gameplay, but this game still gets a 9/10 from me.","October 31, 2014","true","21.3"," 109 of 113 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","109","113","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/34010/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","I usually make the main conclusion of the game in the first sentence. But Alpha Protocol is so suave, that it needs personal and quite thorough preparation to make an appropriate statement.\n\nThis game comes from the Obsidian studio, which is known for taking already acknowledged action-RPG systems, and then remaking them into much deeper, truthful RPG. It scares many old fans of those previous games, but undoubtedly earns some new admirers from those who can see farther than one step ahead. It was with Neverwinter Nights 2, Fallout New Vegas, Dungeon Siege III...\n\nAlpha Protocol was the first game released by Obsidian which was not a part of a big franchise. It was made with limited resources, powerful publisher (who overhyped the project, but made it un-cool), and on the engine of Mass Effect. While limited resources were not a problem to make an outstanding game, other two biases its fall in the release.\n\nPeople were expecting another Mass Effect, in cloak-and-dagger setting. But Alpha Protocol had much less pathos and shooting, than in the beloved and iconized sci-fi world, and much more responsibility for every action, than everybody was expecting. So for some time Alpha Protocol became a pariah in the world of the Mass Effect fanboys, who kept a majority in the gaming trends and patterns.\n\nI admire Mass Effect for huge and rich on details sci-fi universe. I enjoyed playing ME games. But even more I am enjoying some pen-and-paper games based on ME universe, but using different mechanics. GURPS is good, Savage Worlds - even better. I’m telling you, that mechanics in the ME games is far from desirable for the immerse RPG play.\n\nHowever guys from the Obsidian took it and turned into a quite decent and even bright thing. They added a timer to dialogs (field agents supposed to think fast) and they added perks, events and consequences to almost every line we are speaking and every turn we are making in the game process.\n\nWhile Alpha Protocol is relatively short, it is so hard and intense in terms of character development, that many players just failed with good choices there, made a weak set of skills and were forced to leave the game unsatisfied. Of course, they all made thumbs down reviews, and that drowned the game on the market. Only now, after 5 years after release, the tide is finally turning. The numbers of players who managed to played it like it was supposed to is growing, so the Metascore is slightly raising better. You can see current state of minds just by look for combination of Phil Owen+Alpha Protocol (see commentary). Although I’m not totally agreed with that fella point of view, well, yeah, generally, Alpha Protocol IS one of the greatest RPG of the given time.\n\nIt is a great RPG – if played right. And how are you supposed to do that? When making choices in that game, just make it like a responsible, adult man, who really can play in the cloak-and-dagger games. As always, there are two main approaches, one silent, other is assault, and as a third option, you can try to mingle and twist (sometimes speaking saves much more bullets than stealth). But please! Please, do think beforehand doing something! Even when you have to think very fast, you still Need to Think, and not just picking lines and turns occasionally.\n\nSummarizing:\n\nAlpha Protocol is one of the best current-gen RPG I’ve played, I’ve paid for it twice, and I don’t think it was wasted. Quite opposite, it is one of those rare titles in my book, which totally worth the money.\n\nAs of gameplay, you got a skill tree and dynamics from Mass Effect, but greatly enhanced towards wagering a given role of a field agent of US secret service. You hack computers, breaking locks and skulls, you mastering pistol and sniper rifle, but, the most significant, you collecting info on your opponents, and that info, used at the right time, is your strongest feature.\n\nAs of bugs, so commonly commemorated as a game’s main fault… I must make a statement that I didn’t see any significant and game-breaking flaw by all 5 years I’ve known that game. I’ve played it from its release, with quite a humble hardware, on the 4 different PC systems, and everything was working smoothly. Always! Well, AI of the opponents sometimes was performing some questionable tricks, but that’s not a bugs pattern.\n\nOverall mark is 9/10, and I’d really like to see some more stuff like this. From Obsidian, or from some other inspired and gifted people – that’s irrelevant.","September 25, 2015","true","152.8"," 147 of 165 people (89%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","89","147","165","13","19"

The game has a modern spy movie setting ala James Bond/Mission Impossible. There are dossiers to read through, webs of secrets to uncover, and enough cloak and daggery to make you question who’s side you really are on and who is playing who, typical spy stuff.\n\nHOW IS THIS AN RPG?:\nThis type of action RPG game has a single hero, third person camera. You will earn level ups and have dozens of skills to choose from and have different weapons and gear to upgrade. Depending on how you approach some missions you will have access to side quests within your current mission that could potentially benefit you afterwards in areas such as the black market for example.\n\nIS THIS A SANDBOX RPG?:\nThe game is not a free roamer and is fairly straight forward to keep the story moving along, it is broken up into the main hubs of Saudi-Arabia, Rome, Moscow and Taipei. However the order of what areas you decide to visit are entirely up to you.\n\nEXTENDED REPLAY VALUE!:\nCompleted the game as the sneaky, non-lethal, silenced weapons, computer hacker, suave, smooth talker type? Why not try playing as the shoot first ask questions later, shotgun toting, explosives expert, confrontational, hard headed type? Or a mixture of both or something completely different. The game has multiple dialogue choices and event outcomes depending on what type of play style you go with. You will definitely get your money’s worth from Alpha Protocol if you decide to do multiple play throughs.\n\nAdmittedly most of my time spent on Alpha Protocol was on the PS3 and I basically did a speed run for nostalgia’s sake on the PC/Steam version. If this is your first time going through Alpha Protocol you are realistically looking at around 20+ hours give or take per go through.\n\nIt’s too bad SEGA didn’t commission a sequel to Alpha Protocol due to poor initial sales showings, but that shouldn’t deter you from experiencing this gem of a game, very underrated.","February 17, 2014","true","14.4"," 82 of 87 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","82","87","0","0"

The stealth mechanics are flawless.  The skill tree is detailed without being cumbersome and I don’t need to learn how to use a pistol before I can shoot a shotgun (that’s right Mass Effect, callin’ you out.)\n\nThe story is better than average and they’re not afraid to call the bad guys out.  The Saudis, Russians and Chinese are key antagonists (sure that helped international sales.)  The evil corporation trying to start a global war is a little silly (evil corporations don’t start wars, they sell virtual trading cards.)\n\nEnemies react logically to seeing or hearing you, rather than letting you have a running gun fight through the intergalactic U.N. headquarters without anyone batting an eye (burn two! ME), although they are a little quick to get tired of looking for you after they find the dead body of one of their buds.  The boss fights are challenging without the bosses being overpowerd into super (or Metal Gear Solid) villains.  The fight with the Russian drug lord is classic.\n\nIn conclusion (that makes me sound smart,) if you like TPS/RPGs it’s a must own and it’s 5 bucks less than some other TPS/RGP (needs some Aloe Vera for those sick burns Mass Effect?)","November 25, 2013","true","61.7"," 166 of 220 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","166","220","3","14"

In it, you play as a recent recruit to Alpha Protocol, a secret intelligence agency of the United States. You carry through a series of missions, some of which can be played in any order, in order to drive the story of what happened to cause an airline to be shot-down to its conclusion.\n\nThe primary thrust of Alpha Protocol's novelty is its choice mechanism. In many conversations, there will be multiple options available to the player (typically suave, aggressive, and professional). Different characters will react differently to you depending on what you use, and the player builds a reputation over time. This leads into gameplay perks, new initial reactions from characters which previously haven't been met, and many other branching storyline options. Furthermore, what order you choose to do missions can provide additional intel which can unlock FURTHER branchings in missions, optional objectives, and may other items.\n\nThe game is not without fault - depending upon what sort of focus you choose to give your character's skills, some boss fights can prove to be very difficult, and this is where the polish could have been most beneficial. That being said, it's hardly enough of a flaw to remove a recommendation for this game - it's absolutely worth the asking price.

From what I was able to experience, the game was a lot of fun, and I was very excited to try it on the PC. I completed it in ~17 hours, but be advised – my character was pretty broken, so I think you can easily extend your playtime to 20+ hours. I was very satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like stealth-based (or not) espionage action, third-person RPG gameplay (like the Mass Effect series), lots of choices and potential consequences, and a fluid storyline, then you will really enjoy this game. I would have loved for this title to be picked up for a sequel, as it has massive appeal and all the right gaming elements.\n\nThe aesthetics are pretty good – on maximum settings the amount of detail in the characters and background is high. You can customize Agent Thorton’s appearance using a small pool of options, even deciding whether he should wear civilian clothing or armor on each mission. The countless cutscenes seamlessly integrate dialogue/action-trees (using a wheel of options, similar to those seen in the Dragon Age and Mass Effect games), and the special effects are well-done. The music and sounds are great, adding to the intensity of each mission and making you feel like an actual spy in a high-stakes situation – in some levels the music matched the scenery so well I would pump up the volume to immerse myself even more. The story is well-written and engaging – something I especially like is how, depending on the mission order you select (you can pick missions from 3 countries), the story and gameplay experience will change accordingly. For example, you can complete all of the available missions in Rome, or you can do a few, finish some missions in Taipei, then continue the Rome mission-line. Differences in mission order will affect things like available resources (intel, handlers, etc), possible interactions/choices, and character dialogue.\n\nThe controls are fairly typical of a third-person shooter and easy to familiarize yourself with. There is a (partially) skip-able tutorial segment that is very helpful at teaching you all of the gameplay elements. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with third-person espionage (or shooter, depending on your preferred playstyle) games. The most difficult part of the game will probably be boss fights, since you can easily stealth (or kill) your way through a majority of the missions. In-game achievements and perks are a plenty, and you will constantly receive nice bonuses like an experience gain for picking 10 locks. These bonuses will keep you strong enough to survive most missions.\n\nGameplay is very fun and consists of you moving through a mission area, attempting to complete a variety of goals like “destroy an objective” or “obtain information.” Along the way, you will have to stealth (or kill) your way past different enemies and cameras. Your actions during each mission (and during dialogue scenes) will influence your relationship with any accomplices, who may each be a potential handler in your missions. Depending on your relationships, handlers will provide different bonuses. An interesting component that I really liked is how handlers will provide bonuses even if they dislike or hate you – encouraging you to really play how you want to. For example, one handler will give you +10 endurance (health), and +15 if she really likes you; on the flip-side, she will grant you a 5% reduced cooldown to your abilities if she dislikes you, and a 10% reduction if she hates you. Allies are more likely to help or forgive you if they like you, and enemies who you frustrate may make more mistakes. Each individual responds to your dialogue differently – for example, some characters may prefer a professional agent, while others like a laid-back, funny one.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun and will bring you many hours of enjoyment if you are interested in any of these genres. Even if you do not like espionage (or action), you can play on an easier difficulty and just enjoy the story, cutscenes, and dialogue/action options.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","July 6, 2015","true","12.9"," 80 of 97 people (82%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","82","80","97","21","0"

While the concept seems original the execution could have been better, in short this is an Obsidian game, so it has all the trademarks of that developer, and they are: Great story with interesting characters, a very innovative dialogue system, good Rpg mechanics and a lot of decisions to make that affect your story in a hard way.\nBut as all the Obsidian games there are a lot of problems concerning gameplay. It has a stealth system that is very rough around the edges making it hard to go through a mission without being detected, a bad camera (which can be fixed for most of the time if you have a controller), a very basic level design and some bugs. Graphically i found the game to be inconsistent, while some characters are very well modeled some textures of the levels seem outdated.\nWith all the problems i still say that this one was one of the most original games i ever played, if you are looking for an different type of RPG to play give this one a go and you can buy it cheap nowadays.","October 9, 2014","true","12.9"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

Seriously, take a second:\nHave you ever heard of this game before?\nSEGA and Obisidian Entertainment?\nEspionage RPG?\nIt was mentionated on Rock, Paper, Shotgun?\nYeah. I guessed that.\nWith this intruduction, let's game to the game itself:\n\nGraphics: Pretty good. Facial expressions and overall quality of the game's scenario is pretty good to look at. It doesn't try to be the most beautiful game ever at the same time that it tries to don't look awful. Since they are a little dated, you don't need a powerful machine.\n\nGameplay: Overall presentation to gameplay tatics and mechanics are self-explanatory and how YOU will use them is pretty much up for the player. The game let's it quite clear: If you fail, the failure is your own fault, not the game's fault. If i can say one bad thing about the gameplay is the key biding: The Space Bar is, at the same time, the button used to run and to go on cover. No, really, i'm ♥♥♥♥ing serious. Now imagine this situation: You need to go stealth because you're on low health, but then, suddenly, your characters run and now everybody is just going to f*** you up. It's quite frustating to say the least (But at least the death animation is so funny that i can't get frustated when i die).\nStealth system and hacking/lockpicking/etc overall works great and in a good amount of difficult. You WILL need to be careful in this game to not die. Dying is easy even for the hardcore stealth game fans (I'm playing on Hard and believe me: It's gets REALLY hard).\nMultiple pathways and overall level desing helps a lot the player and are a good touch in a game that works like this one. Same goes for the RPG system. It's quite balanced and the upgrades are self explanatory and really helpfull at many situations. So, save your AP (Experience Points) and get's what suits you better. Because this game is going to put you at your maximum.\nThis game also have boss fights and, man oh man, they WILL REALLY PUT YOU TO THE MAXIMUM. You will have to be twice as careful when fighting bosses and they have a relative amount of HP (Depending on your difficult. I'm on Hard, so you guess). If you want a comparation for instance: Imagine Deus Ex: HR. Pretty much THAT.I have to say this: This is a game that isn't made for casual gamers. And i really mean it when i say that they try really hard to make this clear.\n\nSounds: Voice actting is okay, nothing special. Soundtrack of the game is quite good and always does a good job at putting you in the mood of the mission/warning you when something is going on (Like being detected).\n\nStory: Many people liked it because of the beliavable characters and the construction of relationship through the game (Mostly because of the multiple dialogue choises). It's not really something new, but it does a good job at letting the player wanting for more and more, and keeping going through missions.\n\nOverall, you may not know Alpha Protocol™, but he exists. And is a good game for what it is, and pretty inovative too. I have to say that this is the first action/stealth RPG that i've ever played (I think) and it did a pretty good job at trying to start this new kind of genre. It's a shame that it din't really made a lot of sucess and the sells weren't good enough for a sequel.\nBut hey, it's still purchasable on Steam. Give it a try, you will find a good challenge with this game.\n\nPS: On Steam i will have just some minutes, but i've played it for 3-5 hours in offline mode because my internet just felt down at the time. Damn good job sycing my play time, uh , Steam? GG WP.","February 23, 2014","true","0.2"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/syclonix/recommended/34010/","syclonix","Syclonix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/syclonix/","489 products in account","The story is gripping and the way that it branches really gives the player the power of choices that matter. You really feel like the decisions you make have an impact on the game world and that there are consequences, both positive and negative, for the things you do and say. Some people may not like the dialog system, but I think its absolutely genius! Limiting the time you have to choose dialog responses makes you have to think on your feet and pay close attention to detail. Not to mention, it allows for great replayability of the game. The characters are also really well constructed, each with their own personality, likes and dislikes, that you have to find out to successfully navigate conversations. Voice acting is pretty good too.\n\nAnother large aspect of the game is the RPG element: choosing your skills, specializations, weapon loadout and customizations. Although the interface could use some work, it isn't the most cumbersome of console-ported interfaces. That said, I think the mechanics are well done. The skill tree is reminiscent of Mass Effect 2 except you have more individual skills to choose from which is nice. I've read that the skills can be unbalanced and lead to "power-leveling", but I've chosen to ignore reading what particular skills those are because I like finding out for myself. I'm going to defend the game here and say that unbalanced skills in an RPG is perfectly acceptable; Of course not every decision you make is going to be the right one and that is the beauty of having choices--having consequences to those choices.\n\nThe weapons customization is also slick and adds a good bit of depth to gameplay since you can customize your weapon mods to suit your play style. For example adding a silencer may decrease damage but gives you the advantage of stealth.\n\nI also like the experience/achievements system which rewards you differently based on your approaches to situations in the game. I never felt like I was missing out by not making a particular choice, because the game would reward me either way, but the rewards would differ.\n\nNow for the bad parts: Enemy AI is lacking. For example, anytime you sprint, guards have the uncanny ability to hone in on your location. Also, this isn't Splinter Cell: Enemy bodies disappear almost instantly and guards don't really get suspicious when you kill their friends as long as they don't directly see you doing it (or hear you). Also, the alarm system is kind of broken. The game works on a checkpoint system so even if you trigger the alarm in one checkpoint, there are no negative consequences for the following checkpoint area. This means the game is very forgiving when it comes to stealth. Trigger the alarm? No problem, just bust out your assault rifle and kill everybody in the area then continue to the next checkpoint.\n\nThe other large annoyance is the save system. The game uses checkpoints for saves and overrides each checkpoint save when you reach a new one. This can be frustrating when you want to go back in time, only to find your last manual save was 2 days ago because your checkpoints were overwritten. Now when I first found out there was no ability to quick save, I thought it was a stupid design decision. But now, I see that it falls inline with the rest of the game's design philosophy: You're choices matter and there are consequences to your actions. Allowing you to quick save whenever you want takes away from the gravity of your actions since you can redo them infinitely without consequence. Overall if I could change it, I would keep the checkpoint system, but have it save each checkpoint separately.\n\nThat said, I think the save system and the poor AI are excusable, given the very engrossing story and the very well executed branching and dialog system. That's not to say that the action and actual gameplay are not fun in their own right, just that the former elements steal the show. I'm sad to hear Alpha Protocol received such poor reception from the press and initial users, but I hope others will give this diamond in the rough a chance. And just hopefully, Obsidian will be given the chance to do a sequel.","November 2, 2014","true","16.8"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/34010/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Alpha Protocol is 3rd person stealth shooter with RPG elements. You play a new recruit to a secret spy organization, and travel around the world fighting terrorist plots and other threats. The game is very open in that you get choices on where to travel next and how to act, which can have drastic effects on how exactly events unfold in each particular area.\n\nAlpha Protocol allows the player to choose their approach to being a spy, according to one of three archetypes: James Bond, Jack Bauer, and Jason Bourne. Your decisions and dialogue options reflect how those particular agents would respond to any given situation, and the story unfolds in reaction to that decision. I have played through this game before both on console and on PC (non Steam), so I have witness just how drastically different your experience can be throughout the storyline. It's a game that holds up on repeat playthroughs because of this variation.\n\nAlpha Protocol both benefits and is harmed by having Obsidian as the developer. The story is one of Obsidian's finest, with the dialogue and voice acting as some of the high points. However, Obsidian is not known for developing stealth shooting games, so the gunplay does suffer as a result. Alpha Protocol also has it's fair share of bugs, which we've all come to expect from the studio.\n\nThe gameplay is not a strong point of this title. You will have to put experience points in to weapons to actually be able to hit your enemies, which can be frustrating at times. You'd expect a secret agent to be able to at least hit a target 10 feet away reliably. The good news is that you don't really need any weapon besides your pistol, so you can put points in that while freeing up more for other abilities.\n\nI really cannot stress enough how enjoyable the story and writing is in Alpha Protocol. You will meet a variety of interesting characters, and your choices within the game feel like they have a real effect on the overall story. That is pretty rare, since a lot of titles just seem to give you the illusion of choice. While the gunplay is not polished, it's enjoyable enough to keep you going until the next bit of story. The abilities work to give your playstyle a bit of flavor, so not everyone has to fight their enemies the exact same way.\n\nI give my full recommendation to Alpha Protocol. You get the sense that you are playing through a genuine spy movie, and you get to decide what type of spy your character is going to be. This game has become a bit of a cult classic recently, and it really deserves that attention. It did not get a stellar reception upon its release, with most reviews focused on the bugs and mediocre gunplay. Many of those bugs have been patched since release, and the real star of this game is the story.\n\nGrade: B+","June 30, 2014","true","2.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

While the shooting isn't amazing, the RPG elements and story are what pulls you in. I'm not a big fan of stories in RPGs, but this game pulls you in, because it tailors itself to your choices in conversations. Characters remember what you say, and what you say can not only come back to haunt you, but affect who becomes a friend or you later on. Not just that, but you can execute characters, but be prepared to face the consequences when their allies come for you.\n\nThe graphics are great, but there is pop in every so often, the characters are believable. No one is a laughable stereotype and the dialog is fully voiced. You'll find dead serious characters, flirty ones, low key people and over the top ones. There's something here for everyone character wise. Since the cut scenes require you to make a timed choice, it kept me engaged more than other RPGs that I'd just skip cut scenes and dialog.\n\nThe bulk of the game is an over the shoulder shooter, which has pitfalls such as coming around a corner with the camera to the right of the character, the enemies can't see you, but you can only see wall. Combat is simple, left stick moves, right stick moves the camera, hold one trigger to aim, another trigger to fire, You have one bumper for a special ability and another bumper for equipment such as grenades, health kits, EMPs, flash bangs, radio bombs, sound makers to attract guards. There's a button for cover, action and running. You'll have a button for melee, a quick switch weapon, since the game only lets you carry 2 at a time. While you can't pick up weapons from downed enemies, but you select and customize your weapons before the mission. You have your choice of pistols, shotguns, SMGs, and assault rifles. Several types of pistols, shotguns, SMGs, rifles and so on. All of the different types aren't really upgrades so much as side grades. You might sacrifice damage for reloading, accuracy or recoil. Then you can really tweak things with scopes, mussels and so on.\n\nYou can buy clothes, armor, plates, gloves and they all have different stats. Sacrificing stealth for damage, endurance for upgrade slots. I didn't find myself clamoring for armors and weapons. On top of that, you have a lot of useful perks in the game that you get to buy with AP from leveling up. When you start out the game, you pick a basic class with default stats and perks. Things like stealth, martial arts (hand to hand), toughness (damage you can take), shotgun proficiency, pistol proficiency, and so on. The perks are nice, but can sometimes make the game too easy. Everything from more damage and accuracy to usable skills such as chain shooting a pistol, slowing time and being able to knock down enemies from a 'critical' hit with a shotgun.\n\nBetween missions when you're buying weapons, armor and equipment, you can also buy intel and read emails from the cast of characters. Some have extra intel, unlock new things from the black market, other emails give you a chance to reply, simply to improve your standing with characters. The safehouse hubs are really nice and help with the immersion. You don't just pick missions, weapons and check emails you walk around the places, checking out little details and trophies like a glass eye from an enemy. They're big enough to be fun, but small enough to not get overwhelming.\n\nOnce you complete the first operation, the game will open up to your choice of different locales. Each locale has a slew of different missions to chose from so you're not always pigeon holed into one mission. Each mission has a 'handler,' each has a perk that will help you on a mission. Sometimes you can vaguely select who you're paired with. Some handlers will grow to hate you if when you start killing or shooting civilians or soldiers you're aligned with.\n\nWhile the cover of cover based shooting is okay, other games do it better. You can roll out of cover, unstick yourself from cover, but you can't vault over cover or pull  enemies over the cover. The only times that you can vault over something is when a floating icon marks it. You can drop down off a ledge if its marked with an icon. The whole icon to do this or that makes the game feel very stiff and rigid when other games make it more free flowing. The game has regenerating armor, but not regenerating health. It is a nice compromise, and while you can get shot a few times on normal difficulty and live, any more than a few bullets will kill you pretty quick.\n\nEnemies will pace around areas and when they notice you they'll shoot, which will alert others and not just that, but they will trigger alarms to call others. It is a nice system and you can stealth kill or disable them. You can go through the game not killing 99% of the enemies. There is even a perk with stealth that will let you see arrows through walls with the direction all enemies are facing.\n\nThe enemy AI is okay, but its not out for blood most of the time. The basic enemies can do most anything. They'll try to flank you, some of them will throw grenades to get you away from cover. The game makes good use of the enemy AI by having open areas with ladders so you can flank the enemies and they can flank you. If you can do things like climb ladders and use zip lines, so can they. It makes for an even playing field. Enemies will reload just as you do and then its a safe moment to take them out either through melee or shooting them. When you brawl with an enemy, they'll guard, so you'll have to time your strikes.\n\nThe maps and AI do a good job to make things interesting and not just a straight forward hallway shooting spree. You'll be able to stealth around them in most cases if not gloriously zip line into them. You will also see different factions shooting on one another, which is always interesting, you can intervene in one way or the other if not just slip by unnoticed. The maps also allow for exploration and you're rewarded with finding parts, weapons, cash, intel and other things.\n\nThere are a few types of mini games in Alpha Protocol, such as a simple wire hacking game where you need to select wires in a specific order. You'll see numbers attached to wires and the wires are all mixed together for you to select which one is attached to the number you're on. There's a lock picking mini game that has you moving tumblers up or down based on how hard you're pulling the trigger, then you pull the other trigger to freeze the tumbler for success. Finally, there is a computer hacking mini game that has you placing two lines of code amongst an entire word find. If time expires, the word find will shuffle and you'll need to find where the two lines match. If you fail these mini games so many times, it sets off an alarm, alerting enemies. It is a good punishment for failure, but a lot of the time, the enemies are already dead.\n\nTo many the game takes 20+ hours to complete, but I manage to breeze through it twice on normal at 12 hours each and it was worth the replay a few years later. I explored all areas, the one thing that I didn't do was read all of the emails, maybe that's where the extra 8 hours comes in. The endings were completely different on both playthroughs, but again your alliances lead to things and you have ultimate control over what happens no matter what twists or turns happen.\n\nIn all, its not a perfect game, but I can deal with it with a story that wraps itself around you. Everyone should play it once for the dirt cheap price. I bought it for $2.

A surprisingly good game with a dialoge tree and choice system that actually dramatically changes the story. It may, in fact, be the most dynamic choice system I have ever seen in a game before. The story is your typical espionage story, but still very enjoyable. The stealth and shooting mechanics are both pretty well done and a wide variety of ways to complete a mission. This game may also have the distincion of the most OP pistol in a game ever. The first Halo has nothing on Alpha Protocol's pistol when the right perks are equiped, meaning you can finish any boss in a matter of seconds. Overall, this overlooked game definitely deserves more attention as it really is a very unique.","April 8, 2014","true","13.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/34010/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","The Good:\n\n* Alpha Protocol is a unique 3rd-person-action/RPG hybrid. Truthfully, though, it caters more to the "twitch" side of stealth than the "methodical" side. Keep this in mind if you like your Stealth games slow or medium-paced.\n\n* Alpha Protocol laid the groundwork for some of the games that you are playing right now. It is the reason current-gen iterations of Deus Ex, Borderlands, and Fallout exist in their current form. And, because of this groundwork, AP has similarities to all three of these series, but it is unfortunately a worse game.\n\n* It is widely-reported that the game has a number of game-breaking bugs. This may have been true upon release, but is NOT true now. I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs.\n\n* The method of gameplay caters to the players' choice: it can be played multiple ways: run-n-gun, stealth, etc. However, playing with stealth is quite difficult compared to games like Metal Gear, Splinter Cell, or even Oblivion. This difficulty leads to many more twitchy fire fights than you would typically desire in a stealth game. And it's not a "good" difficulty. It really feels cheap or unfair when the enemy detects me while I am in full camo in the dark, crouched and not moving.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Most levels are essentially hallways, with only one or two alternative routes that can be used.\n\n* Some animations are a bit stiff. For example, the open scene features your avatar's bicep and forearm occupying the same space at the same time. Enemies will also "slide" into cover at times, and the normal guard's walking pace is way too low for the length of his stride.\n\n* Character animations are incomplete. Most games feature some sort of "turning" animation as your avatar changes direction. Turning is automatic in Alpha Protocol: your character is facing one direction and suddenly faces another direction.\n\n* The computer hacking feature is definitely the dated relic of a game developed for a console. Rather than allowing a click and drag interface using the mouse, the player must move two "passwords" across the screen using the keyboard for one and the mouse with the other. Although I have done a poor job of describing it, believe me that the interface feels dirty and and the controls are alarmingly poorly-designed.\n\n* UI Features, such as the item selection menu, are a little unintuitive. They are confusing but are not hard to get used to.\n\n* Pausing while in the middle of a conversation is really inconsistent. Sometimes the game allows you to pause, other times it doesn't. This is especially frustrating because the game allows you to choose what to say, and if you step away from your computer to give the baby a bottle, you may come back to a conversation headed in the completely wrong direction, essentially ruining your game up to that last checkpoint.\n\n* On one mission I was instructed several times to use dust storms to hide my approach. There were no dust storms. On another mission I was told the sound of trains would disguise the noise of my bullets. The trains: they did nothing.\n\n* Bugs encountered: (1) after dying, I loaded my last checkpoint and the game crashed. (2) On one mission, I found an invsible wall in the middle of a hallway, got my foot stuck in a rock, and found a health dispenser floating in mid-air. (3) It is impossible to do a stealth takedown on an enemy near a door, you will simply knock the door down instead of killing the enemy.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* Alpha Protocol's method of encouraging the player to be stealthy works by making the combat mechanics horrible. One example of this is that in order to shoot accurately, you have to wait 4 or 5 seconds between each shot. Deliberately making your game worse to encourage a particular playstyle is a horrible idea, why did Obsidian think that would help their game?\n\n* Playing the game 100%, or even "somewhat fully," requires lots of extra (boring) dialogue. Even worse, and the reason why I don't think this game will be remembered, is that the game "features" hours of reading extra dossiers to find clues.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n* Alpha Protocol is neither solid nor decent, but a game that you may enjoy if you are a fan of Bioware or Bethesda games. The game is an interesting combination of stealth, gunplay, and mind-numbingly boring conversations and reading segments. I only recommend picking up this game if you are interested in game design so that you can see how pacing, genre-hybrids, and player agency became such important concepts in newer games.  Alpha Protocol experimented with these methods and was successful in some ways and a complete failure in others.","May 4, 2014","false","9.1"," 65 of 105 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","65","105","3","6"

The stealth and action are mediocre but the real core of the gameplay is in manipulating people through your actions. You are given about 5 seconds to make all your choices, be they flirting with a journalist on an airplane or deciding whether someone lives or dies and the game responds wonderfully to each one.\n\nDo you extort the arms dealer or arrest him? Do you smash a bottle over your contact's head when he wastes your time or play it cool to get on his good side? Do you bluff your way past the guards or sneak in through the roof? Extorting the arms dealer will get you some cash and a reluctant mole in the area while arresting him will provide you a nice bonus and reduce arms smuggling in the area, the enemy will have worse equipment but you might have a harder time getting gear for yourself. Assaulting your contact might result in him phoning up a friend at the place you're trying to sneak into, resulting in better security. Bluffing past the guards may be frowned upon by a more professional handler you chose while a more aggressive or sly one would have approved.\n\nYou can play Alpha Protocol half a dozen times (ignore my playtime) and still find plenty of new things in every playthrough, I   found an entirely new mission in one playthrough that exposed a new side to two characters I had written off before, at another point I antagonized a character so much that they attacked me and left. I can think of few games that even come close to AP's reactivity, characters will call you out for anything from wearing full combat gear in public to leaving a trail of bodies in your wake.\n\nIf you enjoy RPGs then Alpha Protocol definitely deserves a try.","January 4, 2015","true","4.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

Do I equip myself with casual clothing for this mission? Should I respond with a snarky or professional comment? Do I sneak past or kill this guard?)\nAlpha Protocol also boasts a strong amount of replayability purely to discover the various ways in which conversations and characters actions are altered by the player's choices.\nHowever the game is not as polished when it comes to the actual missions and the combat in those, I feel there's a lack of depth in the stealth, bodies disappear almost immediately, enemies patrol almost like robots and for some reason bashing open locked doors immediately triggers an alarm, even if said door is just a rickety wooden one not visibly connected to anything.\nThe combat is functional, but not fantastical, assault rifles and SMGs feel neglected compared to the awe-stopping power of a shotgun and the critical-hit-with-blindfire pistol method.\nBossfights can be either annoying or terrible, depending on if you built your character around combat or stealth (and tech) respectively, this is simply due to the player being forced into combat even if the rest of the mission had been successfully approached with complete silence.\nOverall I'd very much recommend it if you enjoy choice & consequence, character interactions and generally being a special ops man who may or may not shoot gun a lot, just remember to put at least some points into one type of firearm.","November 27, 2013","true","63.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 7\nAlpha Protocol\nPurchase Date: 9/24/2011\n\nI picked up Alpha Protocol years ago in a good sale, but it's taken me this long to finally getting around to playing it.  Alpha Protocol seems to be one of those really unappreciated games that never reached the popularity of other games from Obsidian Entertainment, so I was never in a big hurry to pick this one up.\n\nI liked the way the game starts without any grand cutscenes to set things up.  Instead I find myself controlling my character right away, with no context as to what is going on.  I'm used to a lot of these role playing games having a slow start while you get some huge exposition dump setting up the game.  Instead I'm busy trying to escape from a building where I am seemingly a prisoner.\n\nWhich of course brings up the other big difference with this game, is that you are playing a government agent.  There have been countless fantasy based role playing games, and more recently a lot of sci-fi based games, so this makes for a refreshing change.\n\nThe game quickly reveals that not all is as it seems, and I find I am in a training facility, which in turn leads to the tutorial portion of the game.  The tutorial does a good job covering the basics of combat and gunplay, along with stealth elements.  The game also provides an opportunity to customize the look of your character, at least to an extent.  It's not like some role playing games where you can completely customize your character and gender.  Here. the character is a specific agent named Michael Thornton, and the customization options are cosmetic.  I put on a beret and some aviator sunglasses before moving on in the tutorial.\n\nAs part of the tutorial, the game introduces three minigames.  One involves picking a lock, which I found to be pretty easy (too easy really).  The next involves disabling an alarm, which brings up a circuit board where you have to follow lines arranged in a maze-like fashion to figure out which pins to clip.  This was my favorite minigame, as it felt like just the right level of difficulty.  The last minigame I saw came when I was hacking a computer.  You are presented with a sea of text, which I assume represents computer code, and you have to match a series of letters and numbers in the text.  So it's kind of like a word hunt except the board is constantly changing letters, except for the static text you are looking for.  For me it was really hard to spot.\n\nDuring the tutorial I found myself interacting with other agents, which brings up another major part of Alpha Protocols gameplay.  Conversation is a big part of most role playing games, and this is no exception.  Each conversation will provide a choice of several responses, which are in the form of attitude options such as 'aggressive', or 'suave', or 'professional'.  These choices drive the conversation and can influence your relationship with the other party for better or worse.  The game makes it pretty clear that this conversation mechanic will be important when you are out in the field.\n\nI didn't progress that far in the game before my hour was up.  Once I got through through the tutorial, I was hit with the exposition dump to setup the first mission, and then it was off to Saudi Arabia.\n\nFrom what I saw, this game looks pretty promising, and I'm definitely looking forward to spending more time in it.\n\nOverall Recommendation:  Keep","June 17, 2015","true","1.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised as i entered its world of espionage and from the beginning, it shows you that your decisions have weight. They actually matter, unlike in other games that promise that your decisions have outcomes, this one delivers. You can be a really suave spy, a really aggressive 'roided up spy or a professional killer spy or even a combination of the three. You can make people hate you or like you. Both of those have corresponding consequences/rewards. Makes for interesting conversation choices throughout the story.\n\nThe graphics of this game are okay in my opinion. It hasn't aged that badly actually.\nThe combat mechanics aren't as bad as i was expecting but there are exploits that players would discover.\nFor instance, melee attacks are OP as well as pistols. In my playthrough, i never needed to use my rifle or any other gun for that matter.\nWhy? Chain Shooting. The Chain Shooting skill for the pistol makes for quick and deadly executions. (think today's Splinter Cell: Conviction/Hitman: Absolution's Execution/Instict kills.)\nI found stealthing the whole map to be an enjoyable experience as the enemies barely have time to react to you punching their lights out.\nThe story is well told and your decisions have an impact on how the game tells it to you. I can't say much about it without spoiling so you'll have to play it.\n\nThis game is well worth the full retail price, but if you're on the fence or just don't wanna spend a lot, you can wait for a sale so that you can pick it up and enjoy some espionage.\n\n\n\nI want a sequel to this game so bad.\nBut sadly, Beta Protocol is still in Alpha.","September 29, 2014","true","14.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

It turned out to be a flawed genius.\n\nThere are a lot of faults with this game. Broken gameplay mechanics, PS2-era graphics, inconsistent frame-rates and an uninspired beginning. But if one can look past its many shortcomings, this game turns out to be an absolute gem. A global espionage-RPG in the true sense.\n\nTo start things off, you first pick your character's class: Soldier (firearms), Field Agent (stealth), Tech Specialists (hacking) or Freelancer (a combination of skills of the player's choice). Each class determines how well you perform a specific task in the field.\n\nWith regards to gameplay, I'm sure the devs were targeting a realistic approach to combat. For instance, you have to aim at a target for few seconds to let the reticule converge. Thus, ensuring that every gunfight turned out to be a challenge. The melee system comprised of martial arts which allowed you to knockout enemies either stealthily or engage them head-on. All character abilities were upgradeable with sufficient experience points (XP).\n\nHacking was one of the highlights of the game. There was a unique system in place each for hacking computers, opening locks or bypassing keypads and alarms. Many people found the hacking system frustrating but I think it was fairly straight-forward. Challenging, yes, but very rewarding in the end.\n\nThe graphics were rubbish, plain and simple. Character animations were clunky, anti-aliasing horrible, lighting awful, movements jerky and texture loading very slow. These were some of the biggest down-sides of an otherwise fantastic game. Level designs were very good though with plenty of alternative routes to complete objectives.\n\nThe plot is where this game really shines. The story is gripping and opens up once you're done with the Saudi missions. And it hurtles you head-first into a global conspiracy mess. Allies (and enemies) are made along the way and your treatment of them has future implications in the form of gaining intel, weapons, money (if allies) or facing problems and hurdles (if enemies). Reading their dossier in advance helps you choose favourable options during dialogue sequences. Characters are interesting and unlike many other RPG games, dialogue never feels bland.\n\nAlpha Protocol needs a sequel to set its problems right. It requires perseverance and patience to overlook its many problems and bear with its frustrating nature but underneath all that, this game is a true gem.

If yes, Welcome to Alpha Protocol or "<instert_movie_title_here> : The Game ."\nAlpha Protocol, is an cover-based RPG shooter(yeah sounds weird but that how it plays for me at least) in which decision matters. Game got decent replay value but thats if you overcome the little performance setbacks(that I only read about) .\n\nStory\n\nOne thing that grab me was the story or to be more precise, the way the story is being told. You start the game with a tutorial missions and once you complete them, you gonna be send on the field. But before that you gonna be send to forward in time during an interrogation in which you gonna hear something like "overview" of your past actions and this happens for most part of the game . After the interrogation you are send on the field where the game actually starts.\nWithout spoiling much( aka wont say nothing about start and end of the game) can freely say that most of the game happens in 3 cities : Rome,Moscow and Taipei . Each of the cities got its own main "questline" but you can unlock side quests if you buy intel from the black market. But have in mind ... once you leave the city you cant go back so you may try to complete it all.\nIn terms of actual plot ... well its pretty generic : you are betrayed, you go rogue, you have to oppose a big corporation before it start a war. During the journey you will meet different characters that may or may not help you .\n\nDialogue\n\nGame offers decision making that often counts on your response during little chit chat and less about the action you take. But you have to be a fast thinker when comes to picking a response because the game doesnt want to break immersion. But no worries since you can response in 3 ways: professional, offensive and suave. You have to take in mind that different characters respond differently to your answers so you must be quite a talker if you want to profit with your tongue. And by profit I mean getting some bonus intel or perks . Hell, you may even skip half a mission if you know the right guy!\n\nMissions\n\nThe game isn’t a straight line of mission after mission. Instead you are given a safehouse(hub) from which you buy and equip gear, obtain intel and start missions. You still have main missions but by doing side missions may unlock different ways to complete missions or simple perks. Now some missions are available only for some “period of time”  so you have to pick well what mission to do and when.\nSkills\n\nWhile you play you will gather experience points which will give you ability points that will help you upgrade your skills : Stealth , 4 weapons(Pistol, SMG , Shotgun and Assault Rifles) , Sabotage , Technical Aptitude , Toughness and Martial Arts . Now you cant max them all so you have to pick the best that suits your style. To help you out with this, the game offers you to pick 1 class out of 3... or make your own class if you pick the option Freelancer.\nWhile upgrading your skills you will "learn" some abilities to help you out in emergencies. Though some abilities like "Shadow Operative" makes the game feel more fantasy than realistic which is a shame. But overall game gives options for different styles though at some times its punishing and makes no sense.\n\nEquipment\n\nWhat is gonna be a RPG game without gear,huh? Well the gear options in here is quite limited but still add some sort of depth ... maybe . Before every mission you can check your gear and gear up the way you want it with gadgets and such.\nYou can carry 2 weapons at once and you can customize them a bit. You can change their barrel,scope, magazine and grip. Once you are done with it its time to pick your suit. Suit can be equiped with up to 4 different modifications that can help you out. Last but not least you got your gadgets wheel which you can fill with grenades, mines, EMP, first aid and some others that I never used.  Once geared up its time to head to the battlefield .\nAnd always be sure that you have enough ammo to start the mission without problems.\n\nCombat and Shooting\n\nAs said, combat is mainly cover-based shooter style but you can do stealth takedowns and as far as I remember one boss fight ended up with kiting a lot .\nNow the shooting is a bit different than most games because you need to "focus" aka wait for your crosshair to get smaller and brighter before you make your shot. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off players quite fast in early games when you dont have any upgrades in your weapon of choice skill. There arent that many big fire fights to make it a "rage-quit" material. Overall it need some time to get used to it .\n\nHacking\n\nNow time for the most annoying part of the game for most players. The mini games for hacking,picklocking and switching off alarms.\nNow switching off alarms is fairly easy : you need to press the right switches in maze-like scheme.\nPicklocking is also fairly easy: put in line the switches .\nHacking ... oh lord ... the hacking ... I wonder how many people actually quit the game because of it .\nCheck this image : http://abload.de/img/ap7dbuso.jpg or a video to see what I'm talking about.

An RPG that's NOT high fantasy, sci-fi, or some JRPG hybrid. You have choices but there are no blatant "right" vs "wrong" picks like other games. The plot is reactive and you might not even encounter major NPCs at all between one play and another. The plot isn't idiotic. The characters are all unique, and in true Black Isle/Obsidian form, the dialogue is spot-on.\n\nBut this isn't Mass Effect 2. The gameplay mechanics are rough around the edges. The stealth systems work but don't feel fully realized. Enemies can spot bodies, but bodies vanish after a few seconds. Later you get the ability to turn invisible and walk right up to people to KO them yet remain undetected. Gunplay isn't quite a "shooter" under the hood. The UI for activating abilities/gadgets/ammo types is kind of clunky. But the rest of the game's good enough that you accept it.\n\nAlpha Protocol was a financial DISASTER. Nobody bought it.

Enemy or ally, both can work to your favor. Also interesting is the ability to choose a background that further affects conversations and gives your extra points in different categories.

Shooting things! Missions. And a whole barrel of fun.\n\nPros\n\nGraphics are great, and good for 2010 too when this game first came out\nGood voice acting\nYou can make your own adventure/define your character's personality\nStoryline hooks you\n\nCons\n\nWould like to scroll through weapons rather than go into a menu\nAiming weapons isn't perfect\nNo option to reread the tutorial (I got 15min stuck on hacking at one point :p)\n\nGameplay\nOriginally an Xbox 360 game, this action RPG takes you straight into the world of spies and espionage (after selecting the type of agent you want to be), and you wake up in a lab, spending the “tutorial” of the game breaking out. It helps to use your common sense factor as well as the game mechanics of rolling around shuffle sneaking with a funny walk and hitting people. And possibly shooting everyone too. I didn't make my character too sneaky. And I think I set off the alarm by failing to pick the lock. I also accidentally shot someone when figuring how to sneak and be aware, so instead of being covert and suitably spy like, I ended up just shooting everything. ♥♥♥♥♥es got nothing. Who needs stealth? Ha!\nNot that I'm defining my playstyle or anything. Let me just make my character look incognito by giving him big black glasses and a beret. No one will suspect anything.\n\nThe storyline balances well with the action given, it's enjoyable to follow, from your orientation/induction teaching you the different weapons and methods of succeeding, to the life challenging missions upsetting criminal organisations around the globe. It's pretty much like a James Bond movie in game form. The voice acting is good.\n\nI like how I can have the options to be sarcastic, professional, indifferent or defiant, so I can create my own personality within the game.The music is appropiately slueth like, giving the feel you're sneaking around against the clock. It helps to set the mood.\n\nThe types of puzzles in this game vary, though most of them centre around time limits. For example you need to pick a lock in a certain amount of time, or clip circuits in order, or hack a computer by finding the embedded code on a screen of randomly generating numbers – though that took me quite a few tries to figure out since the instruction wasn't so clear.\n\nThe graphics are good, the environments are well defined and it's visually easy to follow your progress through a mission, along with promptings when you reach the right spot. It's high end Xbox 360 graphics so you can expect some prettiness.\n\nThe Ai mechanics focus on brute force, deceit/sneaking and picking and choosing targets, and explosions. I used sound generators to lure people into traps ... then punched them out myself.\nThere will be points where you can't get away with the reckless playing, because the alarm system will pull everything in the vicinity to take you down. It's a shame you can't scroll through to find the weapon of your choice, you need to go into a menu and select them. For me I have to press G in order to start looking in the menu. I would prefer it being more fast paced by being able to quickly scroll through weapons.\n\nOverall Verdict\nRecommended. It could even be worth more, so I'm happy to get it for the price I got it at. You can choose to be stealthy or not. You have the option to play it out how you want. And that for me makes it fun.\n\n\nWant to read more of my reviews?

The first thing to notice is that the sensitivity\nin the aim mechanic is just insane, if not annoying to the point of unplayable.\nThe game would benefit from a field of view slider, or the ability to scroll\nout as well.\n\nThe story centers around a top secret governmental program created\nto  do the governments dirty work, so at the same time giving them plausible\ndeniability if anything should go wrong.  It is a modern James Bond game,\nwithout the corny puns.  The choices you make effect how the environment\nshapes around you.  The result of your choices change the context of the game,making you feel like what you do matters.\n\nThe character build comes with many different options for what you can\nchoose as a specialization, as well as active and passive abilities.  This\nadds to the games replay-ability.  In addition, the weapons come with a large\nvariety of customization options.  The guns feel good, and convey the right\nweight and power that you want to have in a shooter game.  You can play the game in the style you want, whether it be melee, ranged, or stealth; the game doesn't punish you for playing how you want but rewards you for it.\n\nThe game also offers the option for technical minigames; you are for\nthe most part not forced to lock pick or hack to get to certain areas; you could, for example, use a grenade to force your way past.  The difficulty of the minigames increases as you level up, but they offer variations so that it's not repetitive and boring.  The only issue I had was with the computer hacking  minigame, in which again the extreme mouse sensitivity leads to not completing the hack within the time limit, which then activates alarms, and can then lead to pulling you out of the stealth mode you had successfully completed until that moment.\n\nThe combat is done very effectively.  You can charge in to attack your\nenemies, but be aware that the enemy will respond to your tactics, and employ methods to try and counter your approach.  The stealth element was very satisfying, as you can actually ghost through a level if you choose. The enemies level in difficulty, adding to the suspense and requiring that you choose how to level your character carefully, or follow the preselected level design paths for you. As well as making you think more about how you are going to approach any situation.\n\nThe level design is done very well.  Despite the fact that it is linear,\neach zone looks different, and every mission adds variety in enemies and aesthetic, making the linear aspect a non-issue.\n\nThe game interacts with you; your choices make a difference.  You can\ncreate the character you want to create, and play the way you want to play.  This game has been enjoyable to play; I never felt that my time was wasted.  This is an easy game to recommend.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to\nwatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","December 15, 2014","true","55.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

It's like the game designers realized you'd get bored with the game, so they gave you an option to just skip most of it.  They also gave you a pistol, which at high levels can one-shot kill almost any enemy in the game, if you wanted to skip the bulk of combat as well.\n\nThere are at least two easy ways to play the game 'right,' and I found one unfortuante way to play the game 'wrong.'  While the pistol can kill anything, the shotgun can barely kill the starting enemies.  Leveling it up doesn't make it materially better.  If you chose a shotgun build, you've chosen wrong, and the game will punish you for it.\n\nThe one interesting aspect of the game is also one of its most frustrating.  Conversations have real consequences and are hard to reset and replay.  It encourages you to research your conversation targets well, like you're supposed to, and to accept convesation mistakes if you make them.  But it's too easy to make mistakes.  The game doesn't tell you what you're character is going to say, it just says something like, "suave."  Now "suave" might be cool and seductive when talking to one character, but creepy and stalker-ish when talking to another.  You don't know until you click the button what ridiculous crap is going to come out of your mouth.  So I never really felt like my conversation choices were "my choices."  It was just a question of whether I pushed the 'right' button, or the 'wrong' one, based on what the online wiki said.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingjamesm/recommended/34010/","kingjamesm","King James","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingjamesm/","193 products in account","When I heard about Alpha Protocol, I had two thoughts. One was that an espionage action-RPG was one of the best ideas for a video game I'd heard. Alpha Protocol delivers on that. The story is a pretty damned good espionage potboiler. It could almost be a lost installment of the Bourne series. That the story is pretty damned good isn't all that surprising given it's an Obsidian production. These are the people who did KotOR II and Fallout: New Vegas. True to form, expect outstanding writing, difficult choices in terms of what the "right" thing to do is, witty dialogue and bold characterization.\n\nOf course, Obsidian has another, less positive reputation, and that's for delivering unfinished, buggy games with as much cut content as what's actually in the game. Unlike KotOR II and New Vegas, there's no real modding community that I could find dedicated to restoring cut content (if, indeed, it was even accessible). Reading about Alpha Protocol I braced for the game to bug out frequently and to have plot holes I could drive a Mack truck through due to cut content. Honestly? I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe I'm just unperceptive, but after one minor bug in the early going and one crash to desktop, the game played smoothly. There was one instance where the game triggered a flag that I had done something that I hadn't, which got brought up in the story as a plot point a few times later on. And...that's it. For Obsidian, that's shockingly solid. And as mentioned above, the story was satisfying. I'm sure there were things that were cut, but for what it's worth the story didn't have the trainwreck feel of the end of the (pre-restoration) KotOR II.\n\nThe gameplay is fun. One way to think of the game is to think of it as an espionage Mass Effect. Another way, one I think is an even better comparison, is that it is more of a spiritual ancestor of Deus Ex: Human Revolution than the previous Deus Ex games were. There's definitely no "right" way to play the game and build your character though you can make the game much harder if you generalize OR specialize too much. Playing a stealth-oriented character is tough in the early going but once you start to unlock higher powers it's almost game-breaking...except against the mostly-unskippable boss fights. Also similar to Human Revolution, if you've only been focusing on non-offensive powers, the boss battles can be ball-bustingly hard.\n\nI've heard Alpha Protocol talked about as a "flawed gem", which is pretyt much how ALL Obsidian games are regarded. On the bell curve of what Obsidian games are usually like, I found Alpha Protocol to have a stable build, a complete story and good if not MGS great levels of stealth-action gameplay. If you like action RPGs and want to play in a fresh and different setting, you'd do well by this in my opinion.","October 24, 2015","true","11.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The C&C is on par with the original Deus Ex (and arguably better although it benefits from a decade of tech advance) in that the ramifications of decisions made at one point won't manifest until much later and the results are more than just cosmetic/cutscene oriented.  Unfortunately the combat is weak, level design is sub-par, and stealth is poorly implemented.

There is a big, overarching story, involving lots of characters and factions, and throughout, your decisions and dialogue choices allow you to ally with some of them, which then can affect outcomes of future missions.\n\nThere are a lot of dialogue choices given, most of them determine your tone, such as aggressive or professional. I wasn't too keen on the idea of being given a short time limit on deciding what to say, but I got used to it eventually. Most options are quite straight-forward, but some can be a bit confusing, and at times cause the main character to say something you weren't expecting him to say.\n\nThe game has a nice non-linear approach. Once you complete all missions in the first country (Saudi Arabia), you get a choice of 3 more locations (Moscow, Rome, Taipei), which you can do in any order of preference and even go backwards and forwards between them at any time, since each one contains several missions and subplots of their own. Allies you make in one can then help you out in missions in another, which is really great.\n\nWhat was a bit confusing was how I could even gain rep with the antagonists. It seemed kind of pointless, considering nothing much came of it aside from them simply having a grudging respect towards you and you being considered as 'Friends' by the game despite unloading full clips into one another and calling each other names.\n\nThe combat aspect had some good moments and some bad moments. Gun fights in general were really fun and akin to what you'd see in the movies. The hit boxes are great and you can shoot through small gaps and in between ladders. At times gun fights got a bit repetitive, since some missions are very action-packed, and you just wish they'd end already. The stealth seemed kind of bad. I am usually not so good at stealth in games, but in this game I didn't even have a sporting chance, because enemies would often spot me from the other end of the map, ring an alarm, start a massive gun fight, and repeatedly throw grenades at me as though they were playing a game of catch. So after first couple of missions I gave up on stealth altogether and simply went guns blazing. Lastly, I really hated most of the boss fights. I think they are the worst aspect of the game by far. Most of them were simply enemies with overblown amount of health and minions spawning left and right. I think alternate ways of dealing with these bosses would've been nice.\n\nYou get to level up your character abilities as you make progress, allowing him to specialise in different types of combat, and you get to customize what gear he takes to missions. It's really detailed, all up to even customizing the add-ons on each weapon.\n\nThe game often presents moral choices and dilemmas. Most times they create nice tension and are done well. A few can be annoying, because the game essentially doesn't let you win, no matter how much dossier intel you collect, no matter how much you prepare, no matter how many allies you have to support you - if the game wants to screw you over, you will get screwed over one way or another. It even pulled the whole 'save the damsell or focus on the mission' not once but twice. It's not a huge drawback, but it can put off some players who want to be able to get the best possible outcome by playing their cards right, and if the game lacks that option, they will be disappointed.\n\nOverall this game is worth playing for all fans of RPGs. I am surprised it's been so overlooked.\n(As a side note, for some reason Steam could not detect my playtime for this game on most sittings, so it shows a much smaller playtime than it actually was).","June 14, 2015","true","4.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","4"

Infact this plot is so good that this is enough for me to give it a positive review, but unfortunately that is all what is good in this game.\n\nAlpha protocol is a 3rd person stealth action game, similar to Deus ex Human revolution. And here is a HUGE, gigantic BUT's.\n-but level design is very uninspired and pretty liniar.\n-but very similar enemies with poor ai, boss battles very easy, and difference is gigantic health pool of bosses.\n-but weapons variety is poor, and new guns are mostly a re-skin with a better stats.\n-talents are good but not very useful\n-but animations on characters are very bad\n\nAwful gameplay, poor man's Deus Ex Human Revolution or Gears of War (if you play it like 3rd Person Shooter). I wish there was less of combat overall, but combat is 80% of the game...\n\nDecide yourself. I liked plot A LOT, game has the good amount of replayability but all else about this game seems clunky and unfinished.\n\nThis game is perfect if you want to become a spy. You can roleplay a stubborn patriot, James Bond, stealthy assassin, the worst guy ever, basically any spy stereotype you can think of.\n\nEdit: it took me 10+h to finish it, sometimes steam not detecting it's launched because it initiates internal launcher before you can start the game.","March 9","true","4.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The execution of the entire game could've been a bit better, but what's there is fun. It actually manages to do something new and different in the RPG genre so for that, I applaud it. The game itself could've benefited with some better control schemes, because when you need to be really stealthy, you still move way to fast. And killing bosses can be a ♥♥♥♥♥. There are multiple solutions to finishing a quest (stealth, action, diplomacy) and with the experience gained you can upgrade your character. Nothing you haven't really seen before. Add multiple endings to that and a good story, and you've got yourself a great, fun game. Don't listen to the critics, try it yourself.\n\n[Rating: 88/100]","June 12, 2011","true","17.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

During the game you will solve a global missile crisis, expose traitors and do all that good spy stuff we know and love. The story behind the game is well done, with no plot holes I could find and believable, if slightly caricatured, characters. It will take you through several different missions in an order of your choice, with each mission influencing the other ones and demanding meaningful choices that not only warrant, but leave you encouraged for several playthroughs.\n\nGameplay is varied and easily customized to your liking; in fact, this is one of the very few games where both stealth and going in guns blazing is a valid choice in all situations, though some might favour one thing over the other. Combat is not your standard Third Person Shooter - Mike actually has to aim his weapons, which constantly affords you the choice of going for precise, slow shots or spraying and hoping for the best. This choice is by no means obvious; while precise shots are generally preferable, one kind of weapon (the SMGs) actually rewards spray and pray behaviour.\nTo me, the really interesting part was the dialogue system. Talking to people becomes a far more engaging experience than in other titles simply due to the fact that you are timed and the game actually progresses while you speak. Have a skill on cooldown? Keep the terrorist talking until you're good and ready to take him down. Filled to the brim with adrenaline and fuming at the mouth? Cut his speech short before you come down and your buff runs out. Not only that, but most of the conversations actually feel realistic and have a strong impact on the world around you. If you tell someone off, this will be represented in your later communications, and he might be more hesitant to help you or just not mention information, preferring not to go the extra mile for the idiot that insulted him. Ths makes the game world seem very alive and helps the characters become more than just cutouts with a "press button, get quest" mechanism.\nNot only do you have a choice in the way you fight and the way you talk, you also have an rpg-like levelling system to shape Michael the way you want him to be. Not only are placing skill points and unlocking abilities, the world also changes you. Depending on your actions and the things that happen, you gain perks that can influence everything from hitpoints to skill cooldowns to equipment prices.\n\nAll in all I heartily recommend you pick up the game if you like spy thrillers and/or third person RPGs/shooters. This game has an awesome storyline and interesting customization options that easily rival games like Mass Effect. However, you should know that more than a few people have reported bugs, some of them game breaking, and while I personally have never encountered any be aware that you may have to fiddle a bit to make everything run smoothly.","December 2, 2013","true","22.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JAYTeA/recommended/34010/","JAYTeA","Tremors Van Zant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JAYTeA/","645 products in account","While not a bad game per se, Alpha Protocol attempts to be too many things at once and manages to be mediocre at all of them. It wants to be an action-RPG like Mass Effect with dialogue branchs and a reputation system, but the depth of conversation seems to be superficial. Choosing to be polite or a jackass illicits different reactions for the first sentence, but proceeds to give you the same information after the reaction. It feels hamfisted and doesn't carry as much weight as it could have.\n\nAP also tries to mimic stealth games like Splinter Cell, but the detection system feels arbitrary. Sometimes getting spotted feels completely random; you may have been perfectly sneaky, in the shadows and out of sight, only to have an enemy spot you from afar anyways. I've seen worse stealth implementations by far, but not from titles that are supposed to be this caliber.\n\nThe action also feels a bit dull too. For an agent who is supposed to be highly trained, the protagonist can't aim to save his life. I've spent enough time with guns to know that all the guns in this game will hit point of aim at any of the distances you will find in AP. Shooting basically feels like its a punishment for not sneaking properly, and sneaking is such a gamble that the two combined get aggravating.\n\nAlso, most of the characters are boring, and a few of them could have been lumped into one person for all I care.\n\nAnyways, if you're looking for some stealth gameplay, an immersive RPG, or a good third person shooter I'd suggest looking for a game that does only what you're looking for and not Alpha Protocol. This game isn't bad, but it's hard to recommend because it's so mediocre. I could only recommend this if you want to pretend to be James Bond and none of the Bond games out there appeal to you.","February 24, 2014","false","28.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","0"

Normally I would love this game. I *should* love this game. But I can't. It's like getting drunk. At first, it's fun. Then, you regret it and swear to never do it again. Rinse, repeat.\n\nThe spy-theme is cool, and I love the idea of this RPG. Storywise there are no complaints from me. Graphics are a bit outdated by now, but I can live with that. Sound, music and voice acting is really good.\n\nOverall, this could really be enjoyable. As the main character, you get the sense of being in the middle of a spy movie. It is immersing. You can customize the skill tree of your character. Straight-up shooter? Tech wiz? Silent but deadly? All this is possible. And it allows you to approach situations in different ways. Mostly. Sometimes.\n\nExcept where it doesn't. Then the game flushes sneaking or tech wizardry down the toilet, and you hopefully have maxed out one of the weapon skills when waves of enemies are thrown at you. Oh, you did not? Prepare to die, Mr. Thorton. Seriously, Deus Ex has shown years before this game how it is done properly.\n\nAnd the boss fights. Impossible for me to win. I can accept a challenge. I can accept a tough game. But this is ludicrous. I simply followed the game and wanted to complete my first city, Moscow. There is no indication in the game that the particular mission could be too hard. So you sneak through the compound, face the boss. And then you die. Again. And again. And again. And then you give up, forget the last hour that you sank into the game for nothing, and follow a different path (mostly because I googled how to win this fight - turns out you should do a few missions elsewhere first). Where you also encounter another boss. Same story. I died, again. And again.\n\nSave points do not help. Sometimes they are too far apart (e.g.: that one triad attack mission), so you have to repeat almost an entire level. 15 minutes of playtime, wiped away. Over and over again. Hey, Obsidian, I know the game is targeted for consoles. Get your act together on the PC. Let me save anywhere I want. It's not the 90s anymore. Challenge me with smart gameplay, not technical limitations.\n\nSpeaking of which: navigating the levels can be tricky. Mike does not always go where I want him to go. The camera sometimes turns suddenly by 180deg, and sometime the main character does as well. Very annoying when you started aiming for the bad guys. Moving around, taking cover, getting out of cover... not as fluent as it could be - as demonstrated by other games from the same year.\n\nThing is: would I read this review, I would think that I could live with all that. And sometime I can. Then the game shines, and it's fun, and it's challenging. I enjoy it for a few minutes. And then the hammer falls, and I curse under my breath.\n\nThere are very few games that literally enrage me. This is one of them. To vent, I can either smash something - or write a review. My things around me appreciate me writing this. I really want to love this game. I want to play it again. Maybe I will in the future, when I forgot how horrible and angry I felt when I played it last.\n\nOr maybe I simply made all the wrong choices and leveled all the wrong skills and gave all the wrong answers. I still don't think a game should punish me for that, but, well...\n\nSummary:\n+ I love the spy theme\n+ interesting characters\n+ decent story\n+ this game makes you emotional...\n- ...unfortunately, this emotion is "hate"\n- clunky controls\n- friggin' save points\n- horrible balance\n- animation of Mike sneaking is... umm... funny?\n- Deus Ex did it better, years ago\n- for me, cheating by changing the config files was the only way to salvage some fun\n\nRecommendation:\nget it when the price is really cheap (and I mean *really* cheap), or you really want a challenge...","May 20, 2015","false","40.3"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","15","25","2","3"

It's a fairly decent representative of stealth genre, not Splinter Cell and like level, but still, much better than action part. Overall, traditional TPS\Stealth part is present so that you weren't collapsing in awe before the second part of part of the game. Just invest in stealth to deal with mooks and in pistols to deal with bosses.\n\nNow, that second part. When the protagonist is not busy beating up some mooks, on scene comes the talking and reading part of the game. Alpha Protocol features about 20 organisations (titular Alpha Protocol, Al-Samad terrorist group, CIA, NSA, Chinese mafiosos, you got the idea) to interact with and nearly 30 characters. Everyone has his secrets, agendas, loyalities (well, your tech instructor doesn't since his "secret" is revealed in the first hour in the game without any effort from your side). And unlike many other games where you refer to some as "that guy, who is characterised by X", Alpha Protocol will make you remember everyone. You're guaranteed to pity Sis, respect Albatross and genuinly hate Marburg. Bonus points for not using cliches for the most time (Shaheed, Hong Shi and President Sung are notable exceptions) I've never seen such an image of a Russian mob leader (Konstantin Brayko, for those who decided to play) before.\n\nAnother amazing thing about this game is complexity of it's plot. After I finished the game for the third time, trying to play differently each time, I decided to check some forums to read opinions\help with problems. I had a major WTF reaction when I saw people discussing event and possibilities and lore details I didn't even suspect to exist. For example, one of the bossfights ends with the boss running away to give you a second chance to beat him\convince him to join your side in the finale. However, If you collect all the pieces of his file, earn his hatred towards you and generally act like a smartass while talking to him, you can mock him, hitting all his weak points, reminding him of his past, which leads to him being so enraged with you that he forgets about his safety just to get a chance to kill you, thus allowing you to kill him. Another example, near the end of the game you have a talk with a pretty asian woman who you were building relationship with for the whole game (that's mostly optional). After talking with her for a couple of minutes you are presented with the following options: continue talking (comes in different flavours) or have sex with her. Guess, which one is more popular... However, if you continue to talk to her, she gives a lot of very interesting information which may affect the endgame if you will choose to use said information.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this game to everyone, who is capable of finding joy in interesting story. Just don't let the boring beginning in Saudi Arabia to make you lose interest in this masterpiece.","July 6, 2014","true","12.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Rather than just being the same old Mikey all the time, you can change your angle of approaching different people, by sometimes pis**** them off with the aggressive style often associated to Jack Bauer or you can just keep them doing favors for you because of the suave style of James Bond you chose to use. Maybe aggressive and suave styles will not always work and you want to keep yourself in the line of duty by being a professional like Jason Bourne. The thing is, you need to learn to adapt yourself to the ever changing environment.\n\nWhen it comes to the action, you can choose to upgrade your skills to match those of Rambo's or put all your efforts on sneaking, depending on which one is more to your liking as a gaming style. Knowing your enemy by simply collecting all the available intel on him/her, gives you a huge advantage if you two decide to pick up a fight. Of course, it's not once or twice you can avoid being beaten up by a giant boxer if you choose the correct phrases. Just be sure to create good relations with the people you meet, and you will find yourself being helped by different organisations if the price is right.\n\nNow, I beat Alpha Protocol twice on PS3 system soon after the game was released, and decided to buy it also for my laptop because of the glorious moments I had with it while playing it on PS3 years ago. To this date I have played this game through six times on my laptop, once with every background, and not until now can I say I know just about every twist this game has to offer.\n\nDo I need to say anything more? Alpha Protocol has offered me good gaming experiences and memories in the form of a modern espionage RPG. If you are a gamer who dares to look beneath the surface of this highly underrated piece of art, I have no doubt you find yourself being comfortable with it.

This game is my favorite Spy game to date of writing this review (3/29/2016). It has it's flaws but at it's core is an amazing game. Look beyond its obvious faults and Alpha Protocol isn’t frustratingly bad, but frustratingly good; that is, if you care to look that hard.\n\nPositive:+ An astounding variety of ethical decisions that affect how the story unfolds\n+ A wide range of believable, fun characters; characters that you just have to love (and hate)\n+ Great FPS with a plethora of guns to choose from with attachments\n+ Government thriller story that allows you to pick which route you want to go\n+ Romantic options\n+ Multiple endings\n+ Excellent execution of FPS/RPG with fun minigames (hacking/lock-picking)\n+ Character creation allows for different types of playstyles\n\nNegatives:- Game designed for console that causes a lot of bugs for PC port (listed below)\n- AI is bad, sometimes it reminds me of old school Goldeneye\n- Crosshair/Accuracy, bullets just seem to randomly miss no matter where the crosshair is placed\n- No Sniper Rifle as a choice of guns to upgrade, although placed in game in missions\n- Bugs, overall a terrible PC port\n- No Achievements\n- No Steam trading cards\n\nFails of computer port:- Hacking is extremely tedious sometimes moving the mouse to get to the correct location\n- Mouse sensitivity is terrible, hard to adjust for multiple weapons (IE: moving then using sniper rifle)\n- Camera movement was bad, I ended up getting used to it though\n- Graphics could be better, designed for consoles\n- No hotkeys/gadgets for skills because it was designed with limited buttons of a controller\n- Bugs again\n\nGood Game: 7/10, could be a 10/10 GOTY if they fixed their computer port issues (or made a game specifically for the PC)\n\nGood game that's a MUST BUY during a sale. I think it's even worth full price ($14.99 at the time of writing this). It is a rare game that I might actually replay. I am the type of person who can only watch a movie once, same with games. Alpha Protocol might break the trend when I replay it. This was one of those games I just couldn't stop playing.\n\nIt needs a sequel to get everything right and designed for PC.\n\nSome screenshots of the game (some may contain spoilers, didn't go through them):\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/ImpalaPUA/screenshots/?appid=34010","March 29","true","23.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Whenever bioware gibber incoherently about branching stories, Alpha Protocol is what they are trying to describe. It's a real tragety this game never got the attention it deserves because the way you can play through it and find a new way or outcome to everything you do is amazing.\n\nSega had Obsidian make the game and then sat on it for months and then refused to pay for bug testing and patching. Obsidian did what they could and it shows, but there are a few parts to the game that would have benefitted from a bit more polish. Some skills are massively overpowered and some aren't really worth even looking at. (Pistols and stealth let me break the game in half. Boss fights ended in literally two or three seconds because Thornton gained the power to stop time and put nine rounds into someones face at will) but beyond that there is something special here.\n\nThe characters and how they all interact are where the game really shines though, enemies can become friends, friends can become enemies, both might be either and you've just been listening to the wrong person, ♥♥♥♥ this person off or suck up to that person, it all brings benefits and has an actual effect on both the game (you get perks) and the plot. Take handler A on this mission and avoid a fight as he distracts the police with a fake radio alert elsewhere (I think, been awhile since I did that one) or take handler B. and get ready to fight the police only for him to level the trainstation by driving a train equipped with an anti aircraft flak cannon through and blasting everyone in tiny bits of meat.

It plays and feels like Mass Effect but with a spy setting. You play agent Mike Thorton who is recruited to a secret spy agency called Alpha Protocol and you find youself embroiled in a plot to kick off a new cold war which you need to stop. The strenghs of this game are in it's RPG elements. You can conversate with other characters via a dialogue sytem similar to Mass Effect and Dragons Age 2. Depending on what you say to a character can influence their opinion of you, which in turn can affect what they're willing to tell you. Get friendly enough with a character and they might help you later on in the game via intel or providing support on missions. The choices you make also have an impact later on in the game, for example going all gung-ho ona mission lead to more enemies in the next mission as security is increased.\n\nThe combat sections of the game is what lets it down. You can use various weapons which can be upgraded in your mission,as well as abilites you unlock as the game progresses. The combat does get repetetive after a while though an interesting mechanic is the ability to acquire intel before a mission which gives you advantages like reducing enemy numbers or a sniper rifle drop.\n\nAnother interesting feature is the intel you can collect on factions and individual characters. Instead of being useless filler information, this intel can be useful in giving you hints in how to get a character to like you in a conversation or the tactics they use in a fight should you need to fight them.\n\nThe Good:\n- interaction with other characters is this games main strength as well as the many ways and options you have in dealing with other characters and in missions.\n-levelling system is pretty good with each point gained in a skill conferring you a bonus of some sort.\n-Weapons and body armor customization is pretty good and varied\n-the intel feature is pretty good and is actually of use instead of being just filler\n\nThe Bad:\n- combat isn't great and gets repetitive\n-game is pretty buggy at times.(i found my character was getting stuck in the ground every now and again)\n\nOverall this game is pretty good if a bit flawed. Worth picking up if you enjoy action-rpgs like Mass Effect and Dragons Age. 7/10","September 12, 2014","true","18.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, the combat kind of sucks (it's servicable, but is entirely consolized and a bit wonky at times), but the real reason to play this game is the dialogue system. It's rare enough for video games to get something as mundane as people talking right so when it does happen it's a bit of a revelation. Dialogue options not only give you bonuses and pay off in real ways that affect the plot, but they are also timed--so rather than allowing you to sit and mull over what your character should say you need to make snap judgements and live with the consequences of your decisions. The result is that talking to people becomes a form of combat all its own--something which is, admittedly, much more exciting than the more literal forms of combat the game throws at you, but which is revolutionary enough on its own to make the game worth playing. Plus the plot/dialogue are well written enough to mostly rise above their hodge-podge of spy tropes and cliches.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nahtel/recommended/34010/","Nahtel","Nahtel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nahtel/","39 products in account","Alpha Protocol is a 3rd person RPG game made by Obsidian Entertainment. You play as Michael Thorton, an agent with a top secret branch of the CIA.\n\nI can not speak highly enough about this game. Yes it does have some issues which I will get to in a bit but overal this game is amazing and very much worth your time if you are interested in the RPG genre. Lets start off with the pro's for this game.\n\nGameplay: You have 3 options for how to play the game right out of the gate. You can play as either a complete stealth style never being noticed by anyone. A middle of the road style where you use stealth to take out your enemys. Also an FPS style in which you go in guns blazing with no regard for stealth at all. This alone opens up many hours of replayability and is something I personally have not seen very often.\n\nCustomization: Just about everything about your character, except general looks, can be customized. Your weapons, what gear you take with you, and your armor or lack there of are all fully customizable giving you a plethora of options for each misson you go on.\n\nDialogue: The dialogue system is top notch giving you multiple options for how you want to respond, some of which are very entertaining. This also leads into a reputation and romance system that is very well developed for characters that actually make you care about them on some level.\n\nImpact: This is probably the most important part, at least for me. The decisions you make in game, who you talk to, how you handle each situation, all matter a great deal in this game. Your choices have consequences and you have to carefully consider what you want to say, how to say it, and what to do at any given moment.\n\nNow  lets touch on the negatives for this game, and yes, sadly there are a few.\n\nAI: The enemies in Alpha Protocol are not the best out there. The can be rather predictable at times and glitch out. That being said it is not game breaking in any way and personally it didn't bother me all that much.\n\nCombat: Alpha Protocol is first and foremost a console game. It was ported over to the PC and as such has a combat system that at times can feel clunky and drive you nuts. Once you get used to it though you can get through the game just fine.\n\nHacking: There really is no other way to say it, the hacking minigame in Alpha Protocol is absolutly terrible. It really could have used an overhaul but it sadly never came.\n\nBugs: There are a few other bugs in the game some of which can be quite annoying but I personally never experienced anything to dramatic or game  breaking.\n\nGraphics: This was a console game that is pretty old at this point and was ported over to the PC. The graphics are not top tier yet at the same time I have seen a LOT worse out there.\n\nTLDR: Alpha Protocol  is a great game very much worth the asking price and even more so if you can get it on sale. 7/10","May 17","true","57.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

The game most people know is good, but never played. Alpha Protocol can definitively be put in that category for a lot of people.\n\nFor the others, who actually played it, ask them what is the best spy game they played, and a lot of them will probably mention Alpha Protocol. Alpha Protocol is a lot less known than franchises suchs as MGS or Splinter Cell, which spawned multiple games, but it does a lot of things rights all while maintining a pretty realist setting.\n\nYou see, Alpha Protocol isn't just your random stealth game. In its story telling and character developpement, it's a lot closer to a RPG. The story follows the main protagonist as he gets recruited into an secret agency working for the US goverment. After training and a few missions, for some reasons I won't explain, he is forced to go rogue, and work on unraveling the conspiracy which put him in that situation all while avoiding being hunted by his former colleagues. On the way he will meet numerous allies and ennemies, and take part in a lot operations in various countries until the thrilling conclusion of the story.\n\nBut you see, even if I wasn't willingly leaving the details of the story vague, Alpha Protocol is a game where your decisions really matters. Who you will befriend, the ennemies you make, who gets to live or die, is all up to you via the decisions of your character. Dialogues often leave you a limited time to answer when you are talked to. So you need to respond in a pretty quick and instinctive manner. While some people may complain it's a bad idea, especially without a way to savescum easyly, I personnally find it gives the story a more organic feel. It does help the whole cast of character is really well done. Most of them have some pretty complex stories behind them, and their own psychology. Psychology, as such, is important when dealing with others. You need to understand the kind of person you're talking to and act accordingly. The character of Frank Heck, in particular, has become a fan favorite.\nThe game has multiple endings, some being pretty amazing, like joining forces with the "bad" guy(s), and even betraying them just afterward to take over. Something which isn't seen pretty often in games.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the stealth as well as the gunplay is pretty solid. And it's an other strength of the game, really. While you can go around relying on stealth on most mission(not all mind you), and/or diplomacy, you can also take a more direct approach, or being a tech wizard relying on gadgets to get the work done, there is even a hand to hand combat specialist path, depending on how you wish to build your character. Out of stat gains via missions completed, you  also get rewarded with passive bonus depending of your playstyle and your choices. Taking a lot of damage will grant you extra resistance, using a weapon a lot will make you better with it, going non lethal will make you better with non lethal weapons, etc etc. The good thing with such a system is, no matter how you play, you will get something out of it to suit your general playstyle, which is pretty good and clever.\nThe only flaw I could find is the fact some weapons were a bit poorly balanced, to the point the best guns are actually the pistols, and everything else is kinda bad(which is mostly due to one pistol skill being really brutal).\n\nSome things are done via minigames, such as lockpicking, hacking and rewiring. A lot of people don't like the hacking minigame, but personnally I never had any problem with it.\n\nOverall, if you want a spy game with a good setting, a really good story, interesting characters and enjoyable gameplay, you can't go wrong with this game. Chances are, seeing it's getting old now, you will get it for a low price, even more during a sale, so by all means, get that game. You won't regret it.","May 27","true","29.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's also one of the few games I've seen where having a low reputation with some people can actually work in your favor, if you prefer not to cater to everyone. The combat is fun and as for the character you have a lot of different skills to develop how you like; you can focus more on stealth or go hand to hand, or choose from pistols, SMGs, shotguns, or assault rifles. There are diffferent types of each weapon class with different stats and the same goes for armor; plus, all of the above can be customized with a variety of parts you can buy to improve the weapon or armor abilities further. If you played and liked Mass Effect and/or Deus Ex, you would probably enjoy this too.","February 22, 2014","true","10.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Considering Alpha Protocol as one considers most AAA-titles reveals a failed experiment: a reactive plot with inconsistent characters, gunplay that doesn’t quite land, unbalanced skill-trees that result in a clear hierarchy of character builds, and a floundering finale. These properties are, in some ways, Obsidian’s hallmark: since KOTOR2 and NWN2 the studio (my personal favourite working studio) has been plagued with releasing inconsistent products. In some ways, Alpha Protocol is the worst offender: there are some marring bugs that were never fixed which can lead to very flawed plays. Despite the above mentioned issues—even the slightly bland story and inconsistent characters—I’ve played through Alpha Protocol three times and enjoyed each pass.\n\nObsidian remind me of a quote from Tony Kushner (American dramatist most famous for Angels in America): Kushner distinguishes between two types of artists, “the ones who ask small questions but give great answers and the ones who ask huge questions and often, as a consequence of the ambitiousness of their questioning, fail to give good answers”. Kushner holds that both are necessary, and I agree with him; Obsidian and their works should be treated as the second category. They ask huge questions about RPG design, and though they fail, the questions themselves are both a merit and a necessity.\nAlpha Protocol questions the very foundations of RPGs: it is not science fiction or fantasy, it has a branching plot in which the player is almost fifth business instead of universal saviour, and there is no party. Spies, turncoats, flashbacks take you on a global adventure that feels, ultimately, small: this isn’t fate of the galaxy (KOTOR) or fate of the Great Wheel (NWN2) stuff. We have a relatively localized plot that, while slightly bland and riddled with some forgettable characters, unfolds organically and persuasively. Everything feels like it happens for a reason, and you never question your character’s role in it; the game is quite good at being reactive (or at least appearing so, and illusion is everything) and that’s the whole goal.\n\nAnd on the merit of its questions, I think Alpha Protocol is an important game. It asks: does an RPG need a party? (no); can it deal with slightly smaller stakes? (yes); can it play like an action game instead of an excel simulator? (yes), etc. I would never absolve Alpha Protocol of its bugs or failures—one particular bug causes all enemies on a map to disappear, which can make some areas of the game unforgivably bland, until you figure out that it’s a bug you can correct by shutting down and reloading, which is still unacceptable—but regardless I recommend the game as a glimpse of what RPGs could be like. And, honestly, the bugs aren’t that bad; if you’ve made your way through STALKER, you’ve played far worse on that front.\n","March 6, 2014","true","38.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This game is the sequel that DEUS EX deserved, never mind that Invisible War nonsense...\nMost importantly remember that this is an RPG and not a shooter. This means that blazing gun battles are not well presented, but it also means that ALL of your decisions, and a LOT of your casual throwaway comments have an impact. Not just in a "character X was killed, we'll replace them with generic NPC in this mission" way, but in an actual "You didn't back me up when I was arguing with a contact, so now you'll never get to know about a side mission and potential comrade in a future chapter" way. This leads to me giving it the best possible praise for any RPG:\nPLAY THIS GAME! THEN REPLAY IT IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY! THEN AGAIN!\nAnd yes, some of the mini-games can be frustrating, but there are tools for defeating those.\nJust like Deus Ex, there are multiple solutions to any problem. Trying to raid your former boss for files that can  solve your final case? Why not show some professional courtesy and slip in and out completely unseen, without setting off any alarms. Or just give them a little nap? Or show them what happens to people who fire you and spread them suckas over the walls with your shotgun?\nPersonally I stormed through an "Elite" force's base taking down every armed guard with my hand-to-hand, just to send a message.\n\nFinally, I'm not saying that Alpha Protocol is the game version of Burn Notice, but if you made a game of Burn Notice, it'd look a lot like Alpha Protocol.","December 6, 2012","true","24.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is fun. It can also be frustrating.\n\nWhat is fun? Why is it fun?\n\nYou're a super secret spy sent by America to open a can of whoop ♥♥♥ on terrorists and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nYou got guns. They're customizable and ♥♥♥♥. You choose which kinds of guns you want to use on which kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nBut hey, if you don't like guns, you can put skill points into martial arts and karate chop those mother ♥♥♥♥ers instead.\n\nYou see this game seems like an action game. It is. But it is also an rpg. You have multiple differerent skills that you can put points into when you level up. So you can choose what type of bad ♥♥♥ super secret agent you want to be. Want to run around the whole time shooting ♥♥♥♥ers in the face with a shotgun? Whatever man do what you want. But a little side note, the combat mechanics isn't exactly straightforward. In this sense it's more like an rpg. When you shoot a guy, the game calculates hit percentages and crits and ♥♥♥♥ like that. So when you line up your scoped pistol to the face of a guy three feet away from you who miraculously hasn't seen you yet, point it straight between that ♥♥♥♥ing dudes eyes, you pull the trigger...then somehow find out you missed and the dude has just stopped being blind long enough to riddle your ♥♥♥ with bullets. Yeah well, that's the game telling you to go ♥♥♥♥ yourself. So just keep that in mind.\n\nBut really the best part of the game is talking to people. Through your super spy social skills, you can choose things like whether or not you want to kill a guy. Or if you want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously you choose how you want to behave or make important story decisions through dialogue. Also if you're super suave (or not) you could ♥♥♥♥ most of the chicks in this game. I myself ♥♥♥♥ed two chicks, however I probably could have had sex with another one, but I turned her down because I didn't think it was fair to the others. I'll check that out in my next playthough though.\n\nWith that all being said, this game can be a fun game. However, the frustrating part comes into play with this games glitches. I've probably replayed levels over and over more than I should have because of these glitches. Sometimes after dying and starting at a checkpoint, it seems that every guard decides to just get up and ♥♥♥♥ing leave, with me running around not knowing what to do because every single guard decided to go on a lunch break. There are other random glitches that you will undoubtedly encounter during your time as America's super awesome spy.\n\nBut I must say that however glitchy this game can be, it is not as bad as I was lead to believe before I bought it. Is this game fun? Yes. Is it frustrating? Yes. Is it more frustrating than fun? No. Is it worth 15 bucks? Maybe, but definitely worth 10 bucks. So I recommend you buying this game on sale at 10 bucks or under. Now excuse me while I replay this game and try to have sex with all three chicks.","March 5, 2015","true","94.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","4","5","5","0"

Possibly the best thing about the game that at best is a flawed gem, there's no doubt that it is a gem, so long as you're willing to look past just how flawed it is.\n\nMake no mistake, the whole game feels clunky, almost as if it was designed after all its characters, plot and the flow-chart-requiring choice system was implemented. It features that bizarre aspect of playing better the further in you get as you put points into your RPG'd character. That said, it does feel like catering to every aspect of a spy-in-fiction available, from sauvé Bond-esque conversationalist, cool-gadget user and pistol-preferring gentleman, to the Bourne "beat the crap outta them!" specialist in martial arts. It's just a shame that while you're developing these, or even your own character idea, that you must suffer the wonky gameplay in the mean time; shooting, some stealth sections and particularly the boss fights are all rough around the edges, but work just enough to be passable.\n\nAgain, the emphasis is on everything else. There are some fantastic characters that are incredibly well developed and will no doubt linger with you for some time after playing. Dialogue and the story are clever and whilst the over-arching plot might be a bit been-there-done-that, it never takes center-stage and thus never feels like it's letting the side down. The reason you should want to play the game is for every conversation you have which is directed by the need to read into non-playable-characters, both from the dialogue you're having with them that second and in collected information along the way, so that by the end you can try and manipulate the situation to your want.\n\nIt's a slog to suffer through, but come the conclusion I felt incredibly satisfied that it was all worth it for an experience I've not enjoyed in any other game. My advice would to be turn up the radio and push on through.\n\n*Played with a 360 controller as keyboard and mouse controls felt sub-par.","January 18, 2014","true","12.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The only difference between this game and mass effect is that your response is timed. Pressing X usually gives a charming/sarcastic response, Y for more agrressive and angry, and B for Profoessional and calm.\n\nMeh:\n* Has various "mini-games" such as picking locks and hacking. They do get repititve and they feel unrewarding to do.\n* There is ingame cash in which you could pay for weapons, upgrades, armors, and missions intel. However, since combat is bad (I will get to that) then having tons of guns doesn't really help.\n* Character is customizable but the customization are kind of limited.\n\nThe negatives:\n- Combat is very annoying especially when starting off the game. It takes from early Ghost Recon games where you have to stand still and aim at your target until the cursor circle gets smaller. This is not suitable for this game at all especially when you are caught with too many guards and they are close to you. It also make boss fights frustrating.\n- A.I. with stealth is very very basic. If a guard get the sight of you, alert mode starts right away. This gets very annoying because sometimes they can see you even when you are behind a wall or a cover. Unlike games like Tenchu or MGS, the guard has no "Hmmm?" window. If he sees you expect swarm of guards coming at you.\n- The game is not clear on the benefit of killing humans or knock them out since bodies simply disappear after 10 seconds. True that killing humans might trigger some conversations with NPCs later on, but this has no noticeable gameplay factor at all.\n- Camera is a bit annoying and feels a bit stiff. Reminds you of some PS2 titles.\n- Movement is not as fluid sometimes. For example, when you reload, the character stops moving.\n- Stealth moves are very limited. For example, you can only jump on certain locations and others you can't. You can never move above any obstacle.\n\n\nHow good is the story?\nThe story did not really get me interested. It is very similar to Splinter Cell games. Voice acting is good. Didn't like most of the writing. Romance is very very very awkward and tasteless.\n\n\nOverall\nThe idea behind the game got potential. At first instance, it seems like it can be a Mass Effect meets Metal Gear. However the game is simply not up to expectations and much of its elements are outdated.","May 20","false","18.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Choosing dialog options has never been more exciting but once you choose nothing comes out of it long term, a character might pop in later and say "I'll help you because you helped me" but you'll never find out what they actually do, or see anything of any significance come out of it. I saved one character at the beginning, so he popped up before the final mission to "help". But your character asks "I need you to broadcast something..." and the scene fades to black. You never find out what he actually does, what he broadcasts or why... The game's ending is not affected by your choices up to that point as far as I could tell, and the actual resolution of the game's conflict is left to 3 paragraphs of endgame text.\n\nI played through because I heard positive things about the dialog and story choices. Those may have been the best parts of the game, but they do not make up for the most horrible gameplay i've experienced in a game in years. Shooting in an RPG is hard to do correctly, but even the original Mass Effect did a better job with it.

That is: Hiding, waiting for enemies to have their backs turned, then kill them without being detected. That is pretty cool. But the feel of the rest of the gameplay just didn't do it for me. Combat kind of blows. It's just not FLUID at all and the amount of control feels like I'm prodding a pregnant cow. For everything it can offer, I would rather be playing a Batman Arkham game when said and done. If you're looking for a Stealth game, do not buy this game, go buy Arkham Asylum.\n\n"But...COMBAT?!" Yes, you can customize your character to be more run-and-gun...but it just wasn't polished enough to really make it feasable alternative. Shooting with that silenced pistol was really cool though. Expect to take a long ♥♥♥ time trying to get unreasonably lucky on some hard bosses.\n\n\nAS AN ESPIONAGE GAME\nThere is hacks, gadgets, electronic sautering, lockpicking... yes. They are nice little minigames to make you feel espionagey. But by the end of the game, you want to stick a lockpick up your ♥♥♥ if ONE more of these just gives you money (money is used to buy better gear...but you really don't NEED better gear). Nothing that is actually mission-changing at ALL. The integration of these into the actual missions were below expectation, but it was a good effort especially as sometimes it would give you some story.\n\n\nAS AN RPG\nThis is where Alpha Protocal helps to outshine it's not-as-good-as-Batman stealth gameplay. This I went IN not expecting to like the story, but it was actually pretty cool. The protagonist is way more likable than expected. Not the most AMAZING story, but still pretty OK!\nLike MASS EFFECT, you get to CHOOSE how you want conversations to go. You can indicate the mood throughout the conversation. Very cool. A LOT like Mass Effect, but with it's own little twist! Kind of felt like a cheaper version of it.\nYou can Romance women you've kept close near the end, but don't expect anything dramatic...could be a horribly animated kiss, then a "Mission Completed". Not close to even Bioware romances.\nBut, the transitions are kind of cheesy, almost immersion breaking to an already semi-bland story. The things/coroprations that are "mysterious" in the story, are uninteresting, and I really couldn't care less about learning about them.\n\nThe story is run on semi-tracks. Kind of like Mass Effect...linear...but you get to choose your linearism to some degree. Emphasis on SOME degree. Little freedom, but what it is is very appreciated. Go to Saudi Arabia base. Then to Taiwan, Rome, Moscow (those 3 in any order). Then final mission. The safehouse feature was very cool, but honestly I couldn't help feeling like implementation of overall RPG elements was an EXTREMELY poor effort.\n\n"What about the SKILLS?!" To put bluntly, choosing your class isn't really important. It's not really a necessary feature even (you choose whatever skills you want anyway)... the skills aren't very diverse and your choice in them don't really change your gameplay in an already linear game. If you choose anything but spy...you're going to have a ♥♥♥♥♥ier time because combat is not feasably enough implemented to go run-and-gunning.\nDon't expect Mass Effect skill options/progression...and DEFINITELY don't expect Skyrim status on this. Very basic, not worth getting worked up over.\n\nREPLAYABILITY??\nIt's OK...but not really unless you have a strong desire to watch this a second time. Like Mass Effect, the story is pretty much the same, but with different outcomes in the middle if you choose a different dialogue option. But it's importance is severely lessened in Alpha Protocal. I have no interest to replay the story again for another 10 years. Like I said above, class/skill variety is way too lacking to expect replaying just for that as well.\n\nCONLCUSION\nLook at other games like this closely before buying. There are a lot of similarities Alpha Protocal shares with other games, but is absolutely sub-par compared to them. ♥♥♥♥, I'm always optimistic & thumbs up in reviews, but I just CAN'T be with this game. It's just OK. The story was pretty cool, but it is just another game touched by Obsidian. Alpha Protocal = don't worry about it","June 7, 2014","false","15.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

Furthermore, the game engine really never feels as though it's completely up to the task of pulling off all of what a game like this should offer. For as much freedom as the character-building and combat offer, the game engine really places some unfortunate restrictions on you at times. Level traversal is very linear, and you're too often restricted to one very questionable path through areas.\n\nThat said, this game is freaking AWESOME. The combat is really satisfying, and the level of freedom that you have in making or breaking relationships with your various contacts is nothing short of intriguing. I daresay that the game reminds me of Deadly Premonition in terms of its ambition in that it takes some interesting approaches to certain game elements, but all of it would be so much more satisfying in a more competently-build game.\n\nStill, I can't recommend this game enough.

Furthermore, the game engine really never feels as though it's completely up to the task of pulling off all of what a game like this should offer. For as much freedom as the character-building and combat offer, the game engine really places some unfortunate restrictions on you at times. Level traversal is very linear, and you're too often restricted to one very questionable path through areas.\n\nThat said, this game is freaking AWESOME. The combat is really satisfying, and the level of freedom that you have in making or breaking relationships with your various contacts is nothing short of intriguing. I daresay that the game reminds me of Deadly Premonition in terms of its ambition in that it takes some interesting approaches to certain game elements, but all of it would be so much more satisfying in a more competently-build game.\n\nStill, I can't recommend this game enough.

Your decisions actually do matter, though the dialogue choices in a Mass Effect style dialogue wheel can be very cryptic at times. Also the character development system is alot like Deus Ex 1, though this game does have some forced combat sections which are kinda lame. But for the most part you actually can take multiple approaches towards completing your objectives. Hooray.\n\nOkay, that pretty much covers it.\n\nSo basically it's a weaker, but newer, Deus Ex 1 in the more boring setting of modern day spy thriller rather than cyberpunk dystopia. But Deus Ex 1 was awesome, so this game being not terribly far from that would make this pretty good. So I guess that's a "yes" from me.\n\nBwee.","June 18, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The RPG side is not well fleshed out but it still has a nice sense of fulfilment to it. The discussion tree is vast with so many choices to go through, I suspect this game can be different every time through up to 4 maybe 5 playthrough’s (if you can stick it out that long).\n\nThe characters and story are great and very well fleshed out. I loved finding out things about everyone I met and the world in general around the action seemed deep and rich as well. As for the combat it was alright, for an RPG it was fantastic, for an action game it was average at best. The Ai is either amazing or so stupid it ignores being shot. I found little use for the gadgets but I loved using some of the skills.\n\nAs for progression when you gain enough XP you level up and in doing so can add to a number of espionage/weapon skills. You will probably want to specialise in one weapon, doing more than that means you can fill out the full skill tree. Side note: pistol is OP.\n\nIf this game is on sale you should pick it up, not recommended at full price unless you love the concept, too many glitches to really justify though.\n\nHave fun ^_^","August 3, 2014","true","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In order to define its genre I'd say it's an action-RPG. You level up throughout the game which allows you to select from various perks. I, personally, went with pistols as weapon specialisation along with stealth which made my gameplay a lot of fun - I have to admit, though, combat is not exactly refined and the boss battle did not leave much room for stealth which was a disappointment.\n\nAlpha Protocol offers you choices during the dialogues. As opposed to Mass Effect there's no indication whether or not your choices are good (no Paragon and Renegade approach) and interestingly conversations are timed so you need to pick an answer rather quickly. Making the bad decisions can have dire consequences at the end of the game which has some surprises in store for you.\n\nWhile somewhat mediocre, Alpha Protocol has its exciting moments and those in favour of the genre should pick this up. I believe its metascore of 72/100 is not really justified.","January 7, 2014","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's simply awful; animations are terrible, enemy AI is either ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or omniscient, the mini-games scale poorly to the point of being nearly completely broken; fortunately once you learn how to exploit it it is incredibly easy.\n\nThe gameplay however is the flawed part.\n\nThe plot, however, is simply amazing. I'm not referring simply to the story. It's how it plays out that is simply amazing. When most games claim that actions have consequences they usually mean that you merely get to choose some buttons at the end and a pat on the back because you killed few or no people.\n\nWith Alpha Protocol this is not the case. Everything you do changes everything around you. Every single gameplay can be different merely because of how you chose to react to certain people. And the NPCs react to who you are to the point of some being able to figure you out because of your past actions and reputation.\n\nThis even reflects itself in the gameplay where there are perks related to your play style but also how you roleplay. Basically it's possible to be (somewhat) uniquely rewarded for all possible play styles. Are you a pacifist? Kill everyone? Mix and match? Are you nice to people? Irreverent? Random? You'll be rewarded.\n\nThat's why it's a masterpiece. Play it twice and you'll start to see it. From then on you'll start seeing how every little detail is a part of something bigger and a single playthrough is not enough to experience the entire plot or even the full extent of possibilities within the game itself.\n\nThis of couse only applies to people who actually like games with a plot. If you're the run & gun type to whom games are merely "violence porn" and you zone out if someone doesn't get shabbed every 45 seconds then don't even buy this since it'll just be fodder for you to "write" a terrible review.\n\nI blame SEGA for rushing this.","December 26, 2015","true","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The perk system is cool, and the skills system is decent. And the story (just done first few missions) is spy-ish.\n\nI liked the buy the intel, the dossiers, and the reading it entails (makes it feel more grounded in espionage than just first person shooting). The graphics are good (including the character details when talking, etc). I liked the mini-games (which simulate hacking, lockpicking and eletronic lock bypassing) which are based on observation puzzles against a clock.\n\nYou will be disappointed by the animations which are a bit stiff but not bad. The controls (because of a possible poor console port) seem a tiny bit sluggish. You will become a little bit annoyed at the hacking mini-game because of the wildly poor mouse response to it.\n\nAnd finally, you might become ANGERED by the too frequent (for me at least) crash glitch which occurs against walls and corners, especially when stealthing which you will want to do a lot because, y'know you are a spy.\nSo when your character jams permanently into an invisible wall-terrain join, just seconds before the checkpoint for the nth time, you will WANT to SMASH your pc screen. DON'T. Just turn off the game. and come back to it later.

This is an RPG game, not a purely action game, so you need to level up and work on advancing your skills and customizing your character.  If you expect traditional action gameplay, you'll be disappointed.  But as an RPG, it's a lot of fun, and the espionage settting is a fun change of pace from the usual sword-and-board Tolkien cut-and-pasted drivel that most game makers seem to think we want in our role playing games.\n\nThe game is very ambitious, though you do have to be tolerant of some of relatively rough production values.  OK, very rough production values.  I guess that's why most people hate the game.  But if you are the kind of player who wants a game where your decisions really do impact the gameplay, the story, and the future missions, this is a great game because it delivers in that department.  Mass Effect has more polish, and better gameplay, but really, at the end of the day, all your decisions do is change a few seconds worth of cut scene at the end.   The Telltale Walking Dead games love to tease you with the choice between saving one character or another.  But then, no matter who you save, they end up dying a few minutes later.  Your decisions simply don't matter in most games.  But in Alpha Protocol, the story can change dramatically from one playthrough to the next in a way that most games still can't compete with.\n\nAnd, sadly, it's still one of the only non-sci-fi, non-fantasy RPGs out there.","December 30, 2015","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you can enjoy Gothic 1/2 despite the graphics and clumsy combat/movement and get yourself immersed into it after just a few hours then i'm pretty sure you will enjoy this game. If not, you might want to find your happiness elsewhere.\n\nThe game is all about choices and consequences. There is no good or bad, it's all about how you see ethic, you are the spy and you investigate the whole game depending on your own morality. But everything have repercussion, how you interrogate someone, how you work, what you undertake, who you trust... and this is what makes the game feels so good, so right, so IMMERSIVE.\nThis is why you forget rpg intended mechanics where you need to level your skill to be able to land a shot properly or be totally invisible making the game a cakewalk. In fact i kinda liked this aspect of the game too and never understood people ranting about it. What annoyed me the most the first time i played Alpha Protocol were the boss battles. It felt so "out of place", so "unrealistic", even gamebreaking when playing only with stealth and no good weapons, but then i found a way to finish and i couldn't wait to see what else the game has to offer.\n\nThat's why i like it so much and would recommend you to buy it.","May 7, 2015","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The stealth mechanics are better than the shooting, but Splinter Cell this is not.

Having finally played it, I can't think why.\n\nThis is a game in the spirit of Deus Ex, and for the most part, it pulls it off.\n- no fundamentally different / unique aproaches to mission (you can sneak, go in guns blazing or mix & match)\n- no adventure-style missions, where you just walk around in your civvies and talk to people, maybe solve a puzzle or two. There are a few talking-only missions (and one exception from the rule).\n+ dialogue, reputation and dossier system works really well, even though you only get a few choices at each juncture.\n+ lots of meaningful choices, some with more impact, some with less, some more obvious, others less so. The story tree must be enormous, yet the game never gives you a line that doesn't fit what you did three missions back. This thing is really well written.\n+ replayability looking good, though I've only done one run.\n+ console roots are unmistakable, but it works fine on Windows.\n\nIt's not Deus Ex (not sure if one can surpass that), and it's not Human Revolution either (didn't have the budget), but it isn't Invisible War either.

It's simply awful; animations are terrible, enemy AI is either ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or omniscient, the mini-games scale poorly to the point of being nearly completely broken; fortunately once you learn how to exploit it it is incredibly easy.\n\nThe gameplay however is the flawed part.\n\nThe plot, however, is simply amazing. I'm not referring simply to the story. It's how it plays out that is simply amazing. When most games claim that actions have consequences they usually mean that you merely get to choose some buttons at the end and a pat on the back because you killed few or no people.\n\nWith Alpha Protocol this is not the case. Everything you do changes everything around you. Every single gameplay can be different merely because of how you chose to react to certain people. And the NPCs react to who you are to the point of some being able to figure you out because of your past actions and reputation.\n\nThis even reflects itself in the gameplay where there are perks related to your play style but also how you roleplay. Basically it's possible to be (somewhat) uniquely rewarded for all possible play styles. Are you a pacifist? Kill everyone? Mix and match? Are you nice to people? Irreverent? Random? You'll be rewarded.\n\nThat's why it's a masterpiece. Play it twice and you'll start to see it. From then on you'll start seeing how every little detail is a part of something bigger and a single playthrough is not enough to experience the entire plot or even the full extent of possibilities within the game itself.\n\nThis of couse only applies to people who actually like games with a plot. If you're the run & gun type to whom games are merely "violence porn" and you zone out if someone doesn't get shabbed every 45 seconds then don't even buy this since it'll just be fodder for you to "write" a terrible review.\n\nI blame SEGA for rushing this.","December 26, 2015","true","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The RPG side is not well fleshed out but it still has a nice sense of fulfilment to it. The discussion tree is vast with so many choices to go through, I suspect this game can be different every time through up to 4 maybe 5 playthrough’s (if you can stick it out that long).\n\nThe characters and story are great and very well fleshed out. I loved finding out things about everyone I met and the world in general around the action seemed deep and rich as well. As for the combat it was alright, for an RPG it was fantastic, for an action game it was average at best. The Ai is either amazing or so stupid it ignores being shot. I found little use for the gadgets but I loved using some of the skills.\n\nAs for progression when you gain enough XP you level up and in doing so can add to a number of espionage/weapon skills. You will probably want to specialise in one weapon, doing more than that means you can fill out the full skill tree. Side note: pistol is OP.\n\nIf this game is on sale you should pick it up, not recommended at full price unless you love the concept, too many glitches to really justify though.\n\nHave fun ^_^","August 3, 2014","true","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Once I leveled up a bit, and learned how to exploit the game mechanics the game clicked for me. Maxed out stealth and got the 5 shot multishot for pistols. Once I did that I could just focus on enjoying the story and stealth through about 90% of the game.\n\nThe best part of the game, and the part I am giving a positive review for, is the story/dialogue/writing.

A lot of choices, a lot of characters, a cool (if kinda campy) espionage story, what's not to like???\n\nThe way they handle choices is very brilliant. It's up to you whether you want to be a suave spy a la James bond or cold combat pragmatist a la Jason Bourne who punch the hell out of anyone dare to deter you from your objective. Choices matter. Some characters may like you, some may hate you. But what I like it isn't about good or bad choices. All choices have its own advantages and disadvantages. By threatening some informant you may get discount on weapons but he will alert the local government, blackmailing a local triad boss may get you a large sums of money but you lost his support, etc. There're also a lot of small details, such as dialog change based on where you start your mission first. Love this small care to details.\n\nThere are also a lot of characters, some of them become your handler (your mission intel guy) and give you passive bonus, such as lowering the chance for your enemy to detect you or increasing your endurance. Sadly most of the time you'll be guided by Mina (your default handler) with few option to change handler in several missions. The problem with a lot of character is most of the character aren't really fleshed out. Some of them are really interesting but their story end up abruptly without closure about who's this guy really is or who the hell they work for, etc. Such a shame, really.\n\nAnd the story!!! Hell yeah it's your typical espionage story, about deception, betrayal, and controversial topic. What's make this game special is the way the story handled. A lot of your choices will affect the story. The story is immensely branching, many of your choices will create a completely different way the even unfolds and how the game will end. It's up to you whether you want to play a game about revenge, about patriotic spirit, or maybe you can gain something from all the conflicts? Who knows, eh? So what are you waiting for???

It's just a shame few do it well. And out of those few that manage it, Alpha Protocol stands tall as the prime example. The gameplay may be archaic at best and broken at worst but it crafts an excellent techno-thriller with a well thought out world and invites you to spin it how you want. Whereas an average game would give you a bonus if you made someone your friend, Alpha Protocol may reward you by angering someone so much that their hatred of you clouds their judgement. Whereas a normal game makes you choose a side, Alpha Protocol invites you to play multiple sides, playing them off against each other leaving the remaining allies ripe for a final, easy betrayal.\n\nIf you like games that let you truly get involved in their storylines and don't ever make you think how 'this choice would actually work in a video game', play this.

Every other RPG you've played where "choices matter!" and "you shape the story!"? Complete bunk compared to this. There are SO MANY things you can manipulate that it is entirely possible to end the game with the entire main cast dead or every single one of them alive. If you enjoy good writing (the game was developed by Obsidian who have created some of the greatest RPGs in the business), semi-cheesy spy fiction and interesting characters you will fall in love with this game.\n\nNow for the bad parts:\n\nThe start of the game is pretty slow and fairly linear. After completing the tutorial and the first "hub" the game opens up hugely in both options of where to go and the impact of your choices. Many reviewers never got past this first area and therefore never got to experience the 'real game', leading to a lot of fairly negative reviews.\n\nA lot of people dislike the gunplay and combat. Personally I found it solid and enjoyable, if not particularly special. However, the build balance is slightly out of whack - the pistol's Chain Shot (similar to Mark and Execute systems found in other games) is way better than any other weapon's special ability. However if you just embrace the cheese you can run a Martial Arts/Stealth build that leads to you, about halfway through the game, being able to turn invisible and punch every single person in the room in the throat, which is wonderful fun. Be aware that some bosses are really really hard to melee though, so pure martial arts builds might suffer.\n\n\n\nDespite these and some other minor niggles, however, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

Your relationship with various characters effects how they respond to you down the line and changes the color of the story being told. For once, there are no wrong options in a mechanical sense, either; every path leads to unique, sensible mechanical benefit through an elaborate "perk" system. You are genuinely rewarded for making your own way through the game, as well as for playing it more than once.\n\nThere's a catch. This is one of the buggiest games I've played. The minigames are frustrating, the action wavers from slick to stuttering, and an untold number of glitches really put a damper on all the great level design and RPG systems at work. I still recommend it for the dialog and the chance to see a branching narrative done right. It also innovates on the guns-and-conversations genre with it's conversation system: as in Mass Effect you select the tone of your response rather than the exact wording, but here you only have a short amount of time to pick your response. This keeps the tension up, makes it feel more dynamic, and reduces analysis paralysis.\n\nHighly recommended if you can stomach the lack of polish.

I'm going to try and assert what this game is trying to be, followed by what it actually is.\n\nAlpha Protocol is advertised as espionage game with RPG elements, this may give potential buyers the idea that the level of sneaking involved is reminiscent to that of the elder Splinter Cell series, but unfortunately this is far from true. The mechanics in Alpha Protocol limit you to basic climbing, basic hand-to-hand combat and you should expect that most sneaking will consist of simply taking cover behind objects to break the line of sight, which is rather disappointing. However, the RPG elements in Alpha Protocol are nifty and interesting, they can greatly influence the game and the modifications you make will definitely be an asset to your personal skills and gameplay.\n\nLastly, spy thrillers usually involve conspiracies or dirty gritty stories, and Alpha Protocol does this in a somewhat decent way. Don't get me wrong there, the story is pretty interesting and involves the player traveling to diverse locations and meeting different people, but the presentation of the story is lacking.\n\nWith that in mind, my last important note and a lot of the justified criticism for this game can be mentioned shortly and firmly: this game should not have been released yet. Alpha Protocol is very buggy, feels unpolished and in overall these things killed what would have been a great experience. My verdict: only buy this if it's on sale, a price tag of  €5,- would be as far as I'd go.

The order in which you play missions, the choices you make in the game, how you speak to people...all of it has a major or minor effect in how the story and missions play out. There is no right or wrong answer, there is no good or evil, there is only your choices and the consequences that follow.\n\n+ Character creation is identical to the first Mass Effect. As you level up you gain points to spend in a variety of categories. As you spend points in any particular category you gain passive and active abilities. You could play stealthy, guns blazing, maybe some close quarter combat, the game gives you plenty of options in how to develop your character\n\n+ The game provides a lot of different perks depending on how you play. Pick enough locks and you will get a bonus to your lock picking skills. Get enough headshots and you gain a perk in accuracy etc. Almost everything you do in the game has some sort of perk associated with it.\n\n+ Lots of items/weapons/armor/upgrades to further customize your character\n\n+ Multiple endings depending on the choices you make.\n\n+ Level design is solid, giving you multiple ways of completing certain objectives. My biggest gripe however is that the levels are a little too linear for my tastes. For a game that is all about choices I would have liked some more levels that are open ended.\n\n+ The story and dialogue is well written and doesn't take itself too seriously given the subject matter. Obsidian wasn't afraid to have a lot of interesting characters either.\n\n+ Surprisingly, on a technical level the graphics are very well done. Textures and characters are well detailed.\n\nThe Average\n\n\nThe AI can be very impressive at times. The enemies hide behind cover, duck and weave, try to flank you at times and in general act the way they are suppose to. This only highlights when enemies act completely stupid, running in the same spot, getting stuck behind cover, and in general seem to prefer being dead than alive.\n\nVery noticeable texture load in when customizing your look or selecting weapons and armor. Some texture pop in when a level loads.\n\nCertain bosses are very difficult to complete depending on what skills you invested in.\n\nThe game can be easily 'broken' if you invest in certain skills\n\nThe Bad\n\n- The crouching animation is one of the worst animations I've seen in gaming\n\n- There is an overall lack of polish in the game especially regarding the cover based shooting.\n\n- The game can be especially frustrating in the beginning when you have very low skills and killing enemies is difficult.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI have completed this game many times on the xbox360 and looking at this game strictly from a RPG perspective  I think Alpha Protocol is one of the best RPG's around. One of the reasons why the game did so poorly is that most people were expecting a third person shooter with RPG elements like Mass Effect, instead Alpha Protocol is a full blown RPG that happens to be a third person shooter. As long as you realize this you will have a great time.","June 29, 2015","true","21.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well, more like save face for America, but close enough.\n\nI'd go into praise about the gameplay here, but unfortunately Deus Ex: HR did almost everything this game did but better.  The stealth is wonky as ♥♥♥♥ (the developers probably realised this and literally made one of the skills make you go invisible the first time you are spotted) the combat trees are unbalanced, and worst of all there's level scaling, at the start of the game, people die when they are killed, and near the end russian gangsters are tanking headshots like they've been crocodil addicts their entire lives.\n\nI briefing mentioned the protagonist's mental deffecientcies earlier, the dialogue system is sort of similar to mass effect, instead of picking what you are going to say, you instead pick an 'approach' such as being suave, joking, aggressive, etc. However, you don't know HOW WELL or how MUCH Micheal is going to go.  Cutting to the chase, Michael is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible at jokes, and is extremely violent and sadistic when given the chance.  To make things worse, being successful against certain NPCS tends to just mean picking one approach and staying with it instead of responding appropriately in a fluid converstational matter.  Of course, since it's an obsidian game, it's filled with a few glitches and probably missing 20% content.\n\nAll these terrible things being said about the game, it's definitely worth your time, there's some great scenes, and a couple of interesting characters, and some decent customization for your very own secret agent.","October 15, 2013","true",""," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The plot and the approach to storytelling are amazing, the characters are really interesting; the dialog system is something similar to the one we've seen in Mass Effect, but it is more complex: there are no simply paragon/renegade/something_useless options, you have to find the dialog tactic for each of NPC you meet in this game.

If not for those early reviews I have no doubt this game would be rated at least 80-85 on metacritic. The main problem is that the developers tried to put everything into the game, so it doesnt nessesarily excell at any of them.\n\nWith that said, the game is very unique because of this as well. You're able to build social connections in the game, customize your armor and weapons, and go about missions however you like. You'll see the results and effects of how many people you kill or how many people see you once the mission is over. You even get a little terminal in the game that you can use for emailing other characters.\n\nOverall it's a really good game, but it may take a bit to get used to the very strange shooting mechanics.

Alpha Protocol suffers from perhaps two things only - the admittedly horrible combat system, and the "average" quality of the AI. Most video games boast "average" intelligence; this title is no different, and although that wouldn't make much of a difference in the long run, a game which focuses on stealth mechanics should most definitely have decent AI. Now, what Alpha Protocol DOES deliver is in fact an incredibly mature, well-thought, and gritty story interspersed with above average scripts (some good, some bad); memorable characters, locations, interactions, story pathing, and a decent upgrade system. What makes this game essentially worthwhile though, is the character networking, the scripting. Relationships matter, and the dialogue flows like a good spy thriller. The relationships one makes in the game directly influences the end game conclusion, and it's a most satisfying experience indeed.\n\nI would recommend Alpha Protocol for both newcomers and the avid afficionado of the genre alike.","February 6, 2014","true","21.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This can occasionally hide the intent of a choice in a way that reminded me of Mass Effect's conversation system.  However, you have limited time to respond in Alpha Protocol, which means you have to think on your feet during what's normally a passive situation.\n\nAlpha Protocol presents a dynamic story in a way I don't remember seeing elsewhere.  Some games claim to provide branching storylines but this one genuinely varies impressively, which can lead to truly satisfying end results as you see the outcome of your choices.  You can become allies with one faction or turn them into enemies, trust someone or be completely suspicious of them, etc., depending on your mood.\n\nThe combat's a bit unbalanced and some skill trees break the game.  Still, I don't remember too many situations that were completely frustrating (but it's been a while since I played it).  I played in a somewhat stealthy way and the most annoying part was one particular boss, who seemed very unbalanced for my given player build (you'll know which one when you run into him!).  I was able to take him down eventually with some Brave Sir Robin-esque kiting.\n\nSome reviews mention how buggy the game was.  I didn't hit any of these bugs, for what that's worth.  Your experience may be different if you're unlucky, I suppose.\n\nIf you're into RPGs with a bit of action then this is worth a go as it has interesting ideas and you can really affect the story in big ways.  Plus, it's an Obsidian game.  Did I mention that already?","December 3, 2014","true","22.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're a fan of games where your actions and choices have consequences, this game is for you.  Some of the decisions you make really do feel like some of the decisions people in inteliigence would actually make.  The decision points are never A = good B = bad and you don't really know how your decisions will completely effect the storyline.  The conversations in the game are also well done and feel very natural.  There is, unforunately one glaring problem, and that is that the combat is pretty awful.  Shooting is not skill based at all, and is reliant on how you level up your skills.  Also the inventory suffers horribly from consolization, and you are unable to map equipment to hotkeys, rather relying on a radial wheel (like you would use on a console).

The dossier system actually ties back into the game and the options you're given rather than being extra lore reading. And the sheer amount of reactivity to your choices and the consequences that can result put Mass Effect to shame, causing genuinely different endings based on how you play - sometimes drastically different.

Shooting is not skill based at all, and is reliant on how you level up your skills.

If you ever played Deus Ex and liked it, this is the game for you. If you didn't, you may very well still like it for a number of reasons..

If you like a short, but actionfilled story that adapts to the way you play the game, this is the game for you. If you like charging in, guns blazin' and shooting everything with assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs or whatever, this is the game for you. This game has SO many options on how to play, act, etc., that a lot of people enjoys some aspect of it.\nPersonally I loved it, because everything you do, every choice you make, every answer you give, and every question you ask, have an impact on the storyline, which makes it a large web of events, tangling together, to create an epic feeling, forcing you to think on your feet, and actually pay attention to what happens around you, and the information you're given.","December 3, 2010","true","75.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As I said, it's packed to the brim with quality dialogue choices and trees that would make Mass Effect 3 weep. Shepard? Nah son, give me Steven Heck any day.\n\nA+ quality Obsidian title.

Also the hacking takes some getting used to, but it works well enough if you skill properly.\n\nAt time of writing, this game has dropped to a ridiculous price of $2.

Some of the controls are funky (hacking is rather annoying and feels like it was clearly designed for 2 joysticks) and the story is fairly cliche but in usual Obsidian fashion the characters are very well put together and I easily found myself sucked in despite ARPG/Shooters not being my thing. Some of the design reminds me of Deus Ex, you almost always have the option of stealth or combat and both are viable.

Globe-trotting, stealth missions, lethal or non-lethal methodologies - it's a good example of a good game being lambasted unfairly by the general public.\n\nThe dialogue and choice system are top-notch and can vastly change the playthrough from one game to the next. Most comparable to the dialogue system in Mass Effect, how you treat others can have serious ramifications long down the road; choices made when conversing with one character may completely alter the conversation you have with another several chapters later.

You have a secondary health that recharges, so it you hide somewhere, it gives you a good chance of survival.\n\nSIUMMARISING, Its a subtle cross between hitman tactics and dues ex story line, but is not as good as either of those games.

The combat/stealth (Yes, a main selling point) leaves a lot to be desired, but as for the rest of the game, it couldn't be more spot on. It plays somewhat like Mass Effect, but I thought the story was much, much nicer, and the choices you make in this game actually impact the route that the rest of the game takes, instead of just giving you a different ending depending on X% of nice paths chosen vs X% of evil paths chosen.\n\nI'd say this game could go for $40-45. $60 would be a bit much, seeing as the combat/stealth portion is quite flawed, but I'd agree with up to $45. And guess what? It's only $15. You're getting an absolute steal here. (Note: I have multiple playthroughs of this, but for some reason time tracking didn't start until the end of my last playthrough.

Your play experience depends a lot on what skills you level and what gear you buy; playing as a frontal-assault combat monster is very different from playing a more stealth or gadget-based character.\nAlmost everything you do has an impact on how the game unfolds; which missions you undertake at what time, how you treat characters, and how you deal with various situations, all change how things play out.\n\nThe only real negative I can think of, is that I've found that the controls can be a little jerky at some points when using a mouse.  However, this can be corrected by tweaking the mouse sensitivity or by using a game controller.\n\nAlpha Protocol is a great game and a real treat for anyone interested in a character driven action rpg.","March 20, 2015","true","63.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It makes Fallout look like a dingleberry on Metacritic scores. It turns your Mass Effect into Mass Defect. No other game exists like "Alpha Protocol", no game can exist like this game.\n\nLet me start with the story: You're a new recruit, brought onto the team to take out a major threat. That's it. Fine details don't matter.\n\nThe gameplay? Have you ever had a McFlurry? Ever stuffed one down your pants? It's that exciting. The gameplay has animations, created from the hands of gods. Smooth Kung-Fu fighting, to Stopping Time and killing enemies with locked targets.\n\nRPG elements? Oh man it's got em. Dialogue choices are no joke, and really effect the tree of possible outcomes. You're also timed, so drop that blunt and focus breh! It's amazing to see how you can be suave, professional, or a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

If you like the Espionage theme, give the game a shot. It has its problems, and could use WAY more polish, but through that, it's a really great game. The story can take many different turns based off your choices, and the game is also designed for replayability. I haven't beaten Fallout: New Vegas or Mass Effect 3.

It is an RPG, not a shooter by any stretch. And what an RPG. Obsidian continue to impress with the story lines. No binary good/bad system is in the game, something which shows this game to be beyond anything before. Many will think of Mass Effect while playing, and to an extent they are right.

Stealth mechanics leave a little to be desired. Fairly limited movement (jumping, dropping) is only available at certain spots. Camera can get sporadaic at random times but not often enough to be a problem. Story is realistic at the beginning but become slightly cliched and silly at the end.  Gun mechanics are fun and innovative reminding me of a fresh take on the deus ex mechanic of steadying the shot.

The story is fun.  James Bond the RPG in a nutshell.  Nothing wrong with the premise.  Interesting characters and locations.  Stealth mechanics are ok and the dialog options is some of the best in any game and thats including dialog wheels in Bioware games.  Its Obsidian so good dialog is what you can expect.\n\nIt falls apart when you actually have to do combat.  Gunplay is iffy at best and while melee is fine you rarely get a chance to do it without running across a room to do it and thats rediculous.  The part that truly brings this game down is the bosses.  OMG the worst bosses in any game ever.  Hell I would argue this game didn't need bosses.  Its a game about being a spy gaining intel and learning who the bad guy is.  Forced boss fights with normal people who take a gazillion shots is bad enough but they are insanely hard for no reason.  90% of the boss fights I died like 10 times before I was able to beat them and i feel it was mostly luck that did it for me.  I regret putting this game on normal because it was damn near impossible.  In fact the first time I tried the game it was impossible.  One boss fight was simply unbeatable from how I leveled Michael and that is just stupid!  Level up right or you will never finish the game.  Put points into stealth to make every mission easy and max out pistol because the pistol becomes your best friend.  Put in a lot of points to a second gun as well.  Assault Rifle served me well.   This is not advice this is required to actually get through the game.  Without stealth most missions will drive you nuts with the combat.  Without pistols at high level bosses will destroy you.  Even then put the game on easy.\n\nI had fun with this game but I also got angry with it too often to count.  I just wish I put it on easy because there's nothing to prove in giving yourself an anuerysm for those damn boss fights.","May 26, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A game with a lot of great ideas, great 'vision' yet suffered with a troubled development that result in a lack of focus, polish, and technicality. It's one of those 'could've been significantly a lot better"  game. Every aspects of this game is well thought of but all of them comes out half-baked and leave out a lot of room for improvement. It feels more like a "prototype" or some sort. And this game is surely one of those games that I REALLY wanted to see to be remastered / reimagined, or at least the ideas should be re-created. Though the chance is close to zero,\n\nStory (9.5/10)\n\nThe main story theme of Alpha Protocol iis actually nothing special nor original, though the story of a rogue secret-organization agent story always catch my attenttion and certainly one of the more intriguing plot point. But what make Alpha Protocol stands out is the delivery of this story. The twist, the intel / dossier, flow, and pace is decent, though again.. due to the development.. there's some.. "cringe-worthy" moment, that moment when it feel rushed or generally feels that there are something missing. But, anyway, it's still a great one. The strong point is the choice and consequences system, it's not black, it's not white. It's gray. It proves Obsidian's great attenttion of story and  character interaction (which later is more realized in FO: NV) , because I feel like that this is what makes me keep going, despite all its mechanic flaws. Yet again, and again.. troubled development.. it has dated direction and story presentation.\n\nGameplay (7/10)\n\nThe RPG mechanic blends nicely with the gameplay, the safehouse system with E-mail, intels, black market, armor and weapon customization  adds a little chunk of immersion. Gunplay is good, it has a big potential of nicely balanced stealth and action. Yes, "potential". It has solid gameplay, OK.. the control is clunky and annoying sometimes, cameera placement is a bit odd, but the real problem is those telepathy-equipped A.I:\n> Try to beat down a guard in the entrance.\n> Alert all guards in the mansion\nAnd it's annoying unpredictable behavior, I mean sometimes I feel like the guards has eagle vision or something, but at times they don't even realize their friend is tranquilized just in front of them. Also you can literally use hand to hand combat to wipe out an entire "elite" guard, well..atleast until the last few missions.\n\nNow, if you use focused on stealth skills and equipment you can walk your way out like a ghost, with ease, like..a ghost, without much planning and analyzing.\n\nSound (7/10)\n\nNothing worth noting, certainly not bad. Voice acting, soundtrack, sound effects are "good enough" for me.\n\nGraphic (7/10)\n\nIt's a really "basic" UE3 graphic, no stunning modification / addition,stiff animation, but at least the level deign is pretty good, albeit feels a bit "archaic", small  and it looks somewhat more linear than it actually is. In other words, dated but still nice to look at.\n\nEnjoyment (8.5/10)\n\nDespite all the technical flaw lack of polish, and , dated in almost every aspect, what truly holds this game together is the brilliant narrative and the implementation of many great ideas in this game, though it comes out half baked and lacking focus. Alpha Protocol feels like a prototype than a full-fledged game, well in a way, I guess it is. It could've been a lot better, it could've been expanded, it could've been a bigger, more immersive, more complex game if it has better development and production value. It was an interesting and exciting experience for sure. And Alpha Protocol is one of those game that I'm eager to see it re-created in any form through remaster, sequel, or re-created ideas, from some kind of 'prototype', 'half finished' game to a full fledged, high-production value game, because surely this game has a ton of intriguing ideas.\n\n","July 1, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played this game for 80 hours now, and I can say that there's cutscenes I have seen in LPs that I haven't even played before.\n\nGameplayHonestly, this isn't the best combat I've ever seen. You can play with stealth, or just shoot everything in the face. You start off with 4 classes to choose from which have perk points already in some predetermined places, but you can mix them up. A 5th option, Recruit, has you starting with no perk points at all, making the game a lot harder. Completing the Recruit option will unlock Veteran for future playthroughs, who has perks from previous experience.\nYou can carry two weapons with you at a time, ranging from an assault rifle, a shotgun, an smg and a pistol. They can be upgraded and you can even buy more of them in the safehouse.\nThe safehouse serves as a hub for you inbetween missions, allowing you to read your emails (which sometimes contain funding or other useful information), watch TV about 'recent affairs', or check the black market. On the black market you can buy things ranging from a map of the complex to intelligence on a person.\nYou can build up intel on people or groups, and knowing it can sometimes give you an extra option in conversations. They also give you a certain damage bonus against some of the bosses.\n\nStorySPOILERS:\nThe story begins with you, Mike Thorton, waking up in a secret government facility. You break out, only to find that it was a test of your abilities. You are sent off to Saudi Arabia, to recover stolen Halbech missiles. A terrorist group has stolen them, and they used them to blow up a civillian plane earlier. There will be sequences where you are sat in a room talking to a man about what you have just done. The idea is that the missions happened months ago, and you're being interrogated now. You will learn in Saudi that the missiles were never stolen, they were given freely by Halbech. With the help of an agent, Mina, who is still operating in the AP facility, you escape, and quickly realise that Halbech are attempting to spark a war, so that they can ramp up production and earn more money. Off the data you take with you you find that there are three major Halbech locations. They are Rome, Taipei and Moscow. You can visit them in any order, but the game will change considerably based on which one you go to. After collecting information on Halbech, you have to return to the AP base to finish it all. Based on if you romanced anyone or you were good friends with them and they survived, they will join you on a final boatride into the sunset.\n\nVerdictThe story is extremely well written and has a very high replayability, only being dragged down by the combat. For that, I'll give it an 7/10","January 4, 2015","true","83.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just wish I put it on easy because there's nothing to prove in giving yourself an anuerysm for those damn boss fights.","May 26, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is not a perfect game though. Boring and hard-to-figure-out in the beggining, but nicely developed thoughout the story.\n\nThe game is divided into chapter, which one comprises of a series of missions to investigate an international security issue. Well done. The safehouse concept was very well implemented in which you can buy/sell weapons, gadgets, and key intel to unlock additional side missions (investigations) related to chapter's story mission.\n\nAfter completing the first chapter, you can choose from 5 professional styles which of them with unique abilities and gadgets. I can relate spy, soldier, engineer, etc.  I chose spy...it is a stealth game, guys. But fell free to choose a different one to go assaulting everywhere. Also, there are a wide variety of weapons to fit with your choosen professional style. That would allow game replayability. As you progress you gather experience points that will lead to characther's level up and upgrade points to allow you improving certain abilities at your choice.\n\nLevel design are very nice. Again, this game have its isues, but it gathers the best elements of stealth action games: Hitman, Splinter Cell, Batman, Deus EX, you can recall other games in every element of this game as you play it. It is not purely linear, because by using the safehouses, you can return to certain areas to collect items, hacking computers, find money caches, collect ammo, etc. THAT IS GREAT.\n\nAs a RPG, dialog system is a bit different from other similar games. Here, you may choose your reply tone rather than the response phrase itself. Options varies from sarcastic, professional, ironic, flirtatious...Oh yes, there are romance options you can decide about. You also can reply to emails to disclose sensitive information, flirt, threat and compliment someone else in your mailing list. Here your decisions matter and will affect the game ending.\n\nWeapon wheel are difficult to browse at the beggning but I got used to. There are lethal and non lethal takedowns that are cool.  It resembles the Krav Maga martial art. Mini games are not that cool, some of them are tough, but you can buy certain upgrades to help you out. There are abilities you can upgrade with its cooldown time that can be reduced with level up points.\n\nThe weakiest part were the Boss battles that should be much better. Without spoilling, there are certain upgrades and gadgets that will make your life way too easy fighting bosses. But overall, it is enjoayble and worth playing.  It is worth playing with moderate expectations.\n\nRECOMMENDED.","May 28","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot is very reminiscent of James Bond and other rouge spy movies.\n\nThe story is actually pretty intriguing and decently written, involving different factions of spies, mercenaries, terrorists and secret police; taking you to places such as Moscow, Rome and Taipei.  Its interaction mechanics with NPCs during cut-scenes is the highlight of this game.  It allows you to chose different dialog choices that influences the story and character relationships. The cast of characters is colorful and they are all very interesting. Each NPC has a unique and different personality and a huge part/theme of the game is manipulating people to get what you want, that means acting aggressive, professional or suave depending on the person. Your relationships and interactions can also influence the way a mission plays out, whether or not you’ll receive back up, determining who are going to be fighting, and what items on the black market you can purchase. The game also emphasizes dossiers and gathering intel, which gives passive combat bonuses to specific factions and helps you learn about a character’s background so that you can learn how you’re supposed to talk to them if you want them to like you. Missions offer multiple paths, approaches and options. You can also bang MOST of the chicks in one play through, if you play your cards right (this is, hands down, the best part).\n\nCombat and controls can feel clunky, it seems like they wanted to make weapon specialization and stats like accuracy, stability and recoil matter in a third person shooter, so it forces you to ‘focus’ your cross hair on your target before you can shoot or else your shots will be all over the place.  This can make early game very annoying because your shots won’t focus fast enough, and any kind of long ranged combat becomes a pain.  The game forces boss fights, there is no stealth solution, you have to straight up fight them so it's highly reccomended that you pump up the stats in at least one weapon (fun fact pistol is over power). Regardless of the boss fights, playing stealth is generally over power, it rewards you with more stuff than a straight up commando/aggressive play, and it trivializes a lot of missions. There are 2 hacking mini-games, a word search and clicking tangled wires in a specific order. They get repetitive fast and are not really fun. The game can also be glitchy at times; there have been times when I’ve been spotted and never should have been (through a wall), times where I’ve gotten stuck in walls and had to die or reload my save, and the game had crashed on me 4 times throughout my play through.\n\nI’d recommend it if you like the talking parts of the Dues Ex and Mass Effect or just enjoy a good story driven game.

The setting is lacking any particularly fantastical elements, and the characters are arguably not especially memorable, but the intrigue is well presented, and subtly woven.\n\nThe game's dialogue system is superb, reminiscent of Mass Effect, but with the addition of a timer, forcing you to make decisions on the spot and stick by them.

Don't expect to notice massive consequences for your choices, but repeated playthroughs show an excptional number of subtle, appreciated differences.\n\nGameplay is ambitiously diverse.  Certainly, as a whole, it controls somewhat awkwardly, as the game does not master any of its elements entirely, but it offers many options competently enough.

You’d have to deal with the par combat, missions and maybe a rough early game.","November 8, 2014","true","21.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If your looking for a game thats straight action shooter, you should do Borderlands or even Modern warfare before looking at this game. The hacking/lockpicking minigames are hard at first but midway through the game you get a good feel for it and can get through it easily. Although the controls for the game could be a lot better, there isn't much you can do about it.\n\nThe Story has some good Dialogue and you control the way Mike(your character) behaves during the conversations(Like Mass effect) you have and choose different ways to do things. Replayability is High as there are a lot of different ways you can handle things. Boss Battles are cool, some are challenging but it all depends on how you play. you can be stealthy or go guns blazing\n\nI'd give this game 7.5/10. Buy it if you see it on SALE.","November 27, 2010","true","22.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Don't let any of those trolls get you down on the negative aspects because if you are a fan of any spy in the history of literature then you will love this. This made me watch Bond, Mission Impossible, 24 and Taken again just for reference. The first playthrough I wanted to get a feel for it so I went with the Mission Impossible route, some jokes, some professionalism, making friends with poeple you come accross for info. Then I played full bond, just a pistol, no armor, stealth, suave and of course if you are a Roger Moore fan, the corny and suggestive jokes. Then I played as Jack Bauer, agressive, confrontational, but knows when to kill and not to kill. Then I played full on Taken and opened up a can of Liam Neeson on my enemies which turned it into less of a spy movie and more into a Rambo like movie where anyone who got in my way or was a potential threat....they were dealt with. So if you are a big fan of either one here is the playstyle to follow.\n\nEthan Hunt: Mixuture of everything including armor and weapons, little to no suave but plenty of jokes and yet maintain seriousness and mostly stealth\n\n007: You can be as aggressive as Brosnan and Craig or as snarky and funny as Moore, to the cockyness of Connery and if you feel the need to throw in some Dalton gun play go for it. However everyone besides Dalton does not wear any kind of armor so be warned.\n\nJack Bauer: Again little to no armor but damn aggressive and up front, you basically carves through anyone he wishes yet spares those he has has to. This would be the hard gameplay.\n\nLiam Neeson: This would be the INSANE game style, no armor, just a pistol, wits and of course you eliminate EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE. Which makes everyone mad but hey its Neeson we are talking about here.\n\nThen you have others:\n\nThe strong quiet types like Steven Seagal to Rambo and the Commando Arnold (which is a specialization option)\n\nSo which ever spy you want to emulate go for it. I prefer Bond and word to the wise, download a track or two from the movies, really sets the RPG mood.","February 22, 2015","true","43.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/34010/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Obsidian is one of the few developers who have earned my trust enough for me to be willing to buy their games without hesitating. I can't think of a game by them that ever disappointed me, but I can think of plenty that became some of my favorites, and Alpha Protocol is one of them.\n\nIn terms of the core gameplay, the game is only slightly above average. It's framed as a stealth game, but there are plenty of character options to let you play as loud or quiet as you want, or even dump all your points into Martial Arts and become a kung fu spy if you want. The AI can be a bit finnicky sometimes, and the camera mouse controls sometimes have issues, but for the most part it's functional, and fun to play. The real distinguishing factor of the game is in the dialogue, and other choices. An average playthrough may only last 10 to 15 hours or so, but it has enough replayability to easily make it worth playing several times. Everything from the order you take on missions in to the people you ally with likely has an effect on future events, and there are enough ways that events can play out differently to continue to surprise you even after 3 or 4 playthroughs. The game features a full Bond-like cast of memorable characters, each of whom have their own likes and dislikes that can influence your results throughout the game. It really puts up the illusion that this is a real world of espionage, and it's easy to find yourself invested in the character and story because of it.\n\nThe one place where the game does falter is the dialogue interface itself. The game uses a Mass Effect-style one-word-choice system, where most dialogue choices fall into three categories - Suave, Aggressive, and Professional. It's not as simplistic as it may seem, and it is somewhat necessary to shorten the lines since unlike other similar games Alpha Protocol is fairly aggressive with its timed dialogues and often may not even give you more time than it takes for a character to finish their sentence to make a decision, but it does occasionally end with you misreading the prompt's intention and leading to the main character saying something you didn't want. This ties in with the fact that the main character's voice actor isn't all that great at times, and he doesn't do a very good job of actually sounding particularly suave when you pick those options. Alpha Protocol is the one game where I don't completely hate the use of the dialogue wheel, but I still wouldn't mind it being gone.\n\nIf you're into Bond movies or just spy fiction in general, Alpha Protocol is a pretty easy pick. Almost every Obsidian game has their faults due to both publishers rushing them and Obsidian themselves not being that great at managing their time, but like most of their games the faults aren't enough to bring down what ends up being another really great RPG to add to their list.","March 27","true","31.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

If strictly estimated on the gameplay, you can not overlook the serious problems of balance in terms of character development (there are combinations that literally break the game in the later stages), while the stealth sessions and the AI ​​deficit are to be reviewed completely.

To be honest though, all the two have in common are the graphic engine, the 3rd person view and the fact, that you as a player get to choose the direction of your ingame conversations. Still, the comparison can be made in order to help people decide, if this game might be for them, or not.\n\nWhile Mass Effect is a lot more RPG (especially the first game) as it lets you wander around, talk to npcs and aquire quests, Alpha Protocol is a bit more linear in its storytelling, since only the order in which you complete your missions and the order of your missionhubs can be determined by the player.\n\nThe missions itself are pretty action-oriented, even though you might want to take a stealthy approach from time to time in order to take out a few enemies without being noticed or to move into a more favorable position for your assault. It is possible to put lots of talent points into being 'stealthy' and playing almost exclusively like this, but it has to be said that the game is by no means a Splinter Cell and some direct confrontation especially during the last stages of the game is unavoidable.\n\nMission locations are quite diversified, while the level design itself is very linear. During your missions you'll receive radio support by your 'handler', who updates you with the latest mission relevant information. In addition, you'll frequently encounter locked doors and password protected computers, which you'll be able to open or hack by beating one of the increasingly difficult mini-games.\n\nThe graphics are decent, I especially liked the facial textures of the characters and the depth of field effects. The voice-acting is great, the writing is excellent, as it often offers you funny witty responses in dialogues and also features your expected conspiracy theories and the like.\n\nAnother note on the subject of dialogue choices in this game: unlike Mass Effect, where you get to choose the exact response you want to give and have unlimited time in deciding on which one it is going to be, you can only choose the general tone and direction of your answer in Alpha Protocol, while at the same time being forced to make this decision within a few seconds. Responses include 'professional', 'threatening', 'suave', 'flirtatious' or a certain subject you want to touch upon. While initially this system felt irritating, once you get used to it, it feels rather dynamic and natural, since there are no pauses during dialogues and you are forced to make decisions on the fly.\n\nDecisions in this game have a real impact on the main plot aswell, as often you'll have to make meaningful choices between making allies or enemies, life and death or something of similar weight. Characters react differently to your approach during conversations, and since the game keeps track of your standing with each character, I often find myself reading up on a character's personal files before talking to them in order to get a better understanding of what said npc might react most positively to.\n\nSo what can you expect from this game? Solid, but not spectacular 3rd person shooter gameplay in a spy setting with some stealth elemtents and gadgets, engaging cutscenes and conversations with meaningful decisionmaking wrapped in a rather complex storyline.\n\nLess depth than Mass Effect, less playtime and less production value - but by no means a bad game. The only thing the game really lacks because of this are the big, breathtaking moments. Nonetheless, Alpha Protocol has some pretty memorable scenes (including hook-ups, you perv!) and I am quite satisfied with my first playthrough.\n\nEspecially if you like the spy-setting, want something tight and less drawn out and prefer a more action-oriented approach to the genre, Alpha Protocol is a must-have.","January 7, 2014","true","12.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Oh god, I was so wrong and I ain't even complaining about it. AP is a TPS-RPG hybrid like Mass Effect series but unlike ME it takes place in today's world. It leaves us to take control of a spy and go on missions all across the world. If I told anything about the story I'd probably spoil something unintentionall so I'll just leave pros and cons\n\nPros:\n-Dialogue system is pretty nice and gives you a few seconds to make your choice, makes it more realistic IMO\n-The game lets you decide entirely how you're gonna play it. You can be a stealth assassin and catch people unaware, go Rambo against an army, run to people and punch them to death etc etc\n-Weapon/armor variety and upgrades are nice and enables you to custimize your weapons/armor to suit your playstyle\n-Can be finished multiple times to see all parts of story(long playability time)\n-Great story filled with betrayals, treasons, revenge, love and lots of interesting stuff\n-Things like lockpicking and bypassing stays enjoyable through your playthtrough\n-Watching the news and hearing whatever you've done on the broadcast is a fun detail, and also everything you do on a mission effects the(close or far) future ones\n\nCons:\n-Hacking. Honestly it is so stressing and tiring that I found myself wishing it didn't exist. It was fun in the first 2-3 time but having it as the most frequent minigame and making it harder and harder just killed the magic.\n-Camera can be a bit messy sometimes.\n-Some people say they encountered many bugs on internet but throughout my playththrough I only faced literally 2 bugs\n-Sometimes guns require too much accuracy(stat). Eventhough you point your gun to the other person's head and wait for it to be in critical state it may not even leave a scratch on them\n-AI can screw hard during combats\n-Skills make the game too easy(trying to play it without skills is fun though but challanging)\n\nThat's all I can say, I guess. I think this game is criminally underrated and even though I got it from a bundle, I'd happily pay the original price to play it.\n\nP.S: I reccomend playing the game as stealth assassin as it is more fun and AI is much better during the stealth times","July 9, 2014","true","16.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure the gameplay isn't particularly great, and if you're not careful when you level up you can make some decisions with your character that make the rest of the game rather difficult, but all the drawbacks fall to the wayside when you get to the story and the character interactions.\n\nThis game builds on the Bioware approach to storytelling and character development. Your choices aren't clearly Good/Bad/Funny/Jerk/Farewell. The choices you make will affect the storyline rather decently and sometimes you just won't get the full picture of the plot unless you go through it multiple times.\n","December 6, 2013","true","33.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Still, the comparison can be made in order to help people decide, if this game might be for them, or not.\n\nWhile Mass Effect is a lot more RPG (especially the first game) as it lets you wander around, talk to npcs and aquire quests, Alpha Protocol is a bit more linear in its storytelling, since only the order in which you complete your missions and the order of your missionhubs can be determined by the player.\n\nThe missions itself are pretty action-oriented, even though you might want to take a stealthy approach from time to time in order to take out a few enemies without being noticed or to move into a more favorable position for your assault. It is possible to put lots of talent points into being 'stealthy' and playing almost exclusively like this, but it has to be said that the game is by no means a Splinter Cell and some direct confrontation especially during the last stages of the game is unavoidable.\n\nMission locations are quite diversified, while the level design itself is very linear. During your missions you'll receive radio support by your 'handler', who updates you with the latest mission relevant information. In addition, you'll frequently encounter locked doors and password protected computers, which you'll be able to open or hack by beating one of the increasingly difficult mini-games.\n\nThe graphics are decent, I especially liked the facial textures of the characters and the depth of field effects. The voice-acting is great, the writing is excellent, as it often offers you funny witty responses in dialogues and also features your expected conspiracy theories and the like.\n\nAnother note on the subject of dialogue choices in this game: unlike Mass Effect, where you get to choose the exact response you want to give and have unlimited time in deciding on which one it is going to be, you can only choose the general tone and direction of your answer in Alpha Protocol, while at the same time being forced to make this decision within a few seconds. Responses include 'professional', 'threatening', 'suave', 'flirtatious' or a certain subject you want to touch upon. While initially this system felt irritating, once you get used to it, it feels rather dynamic and natural, since there are no pauses during dialogues and you are forced to make decisions on the fly.\n\nDecisions in this game have a real impact on the main plot aswell, as often you'll have to make meaningful choices between making allies or enemies, life and death or something of similar weight. Characters react differently to your approach during conversations, and since the game keeps track of your standing with each character, I often find myself reading up on a character's personal files before talking to them in order to get a better understanding of what said npc might react most positively to.\n\nSo what can you expect from this game? Solid, but not spectacular 3rd person shooter gameplay in a spy setting with some stealth elemtents and gadgets, engaging cutscenes and conversations with meaningful decisionmaking wrapped in a rather complex storyline.\n\nLess depth than Mass Effect, less playtime and less production value - but by no means a bad game. The only thing the game really lacks because of this are the big, breathtaking moments. Nonetheless, Alpha Protocol has some pretty memorable scenes (including hook-ups, you perv!) and I am quite satisfied with my first playthrough.\n\nEspecially if you like the spy-setting, want something tight and less drawn out and prefer a more action-oriented approach to the genre, Alpha Protocol is a must-have.","January 7, 2014","true","12.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It seems as if there was a lot of potential regarding what they wanted to do, but I don't think it was done well.\n\nGraphics\nYes, the game is from 2010, so keep that in mind. However, I think that, even for 2010, the graphics aren't that good. Character editing (glasses, hat, hair) looks terrible, same for the movement in combat etc.\n\nGameplay\nI usually LIKE stealth games, but this one, I didn't. I am not sure whether it's just a higher difficulty or badly done game mechanics. Trying to sneak up on an enemy to take him out often ends up in frustration, as he notices you. However, it feels like the mechanics are just clunky, it's not some overly high AI or bad playing... I have played several stealth games and usually do ok, but here, I tried to sneak up on an enemy, and sometimes, the silent takedown works, sometimes he suddenly alerts everyone around him.\n\nAI\nTerrible. On one hand, the second the alarm is raised, they know EXACTLY where you are and shoot at you, which I find HIGHLY unrealistic. I wouldn't mind if they had a general idea quickly and then search for you there, but the second an alarm is raised, it's like they have a hive intelligence and know where you are.\nAt the same time, I have seen some moonwalking, and you can just run towards them and take them down with melee\n\nCombat\nTerrible as well. If there are two obstacles, and you aim between them and aim PERFECTLY at the head of an enemy, you won't hit him. Let me get this straight - two obstacles, you aim between them (yes, there is room between them), and you won't hit him.\nEven when in range, and the dot in your targeting circle is aligned with someones head, you often miss. Having to shoot someone in the head (they wear a mask, or sometimes just a bandana, apparently these items generate a bullet proof forcefield) isn't exactly that realistic either.\n\nMinigames\nThere is lockpicking, disabling alarms and hacking. The first two are... ok. The first one is even fun sometimes (balancing the cylinders of the lock, then releasing your lockpick, with a time limit). The second one is ok. The third one is horrible. Not going into details, the other commenters have commented on how terrible that one is many times.\n\nCharacters\nI didn't like the whole intro, the conversations, the character design. Apart from simply looking odd, I just didn't care for any character, and I didn't like the main character either, who looks like a mix between Shepherd from Mass Effect and some kind of cyborg.\n\nOverall\nSo much potential. I'd have liked to explore the game more and find all the things that those who liked the game praised... the decision-making, the email conversations or whatever.\nHowever, the intro went on for too long and didn't grab me at all, and the two missions I tried were simply not fun at all. It's not the very outdated (even for a 2010-game!) look, it's the clunky mechanics, bad AI, horrible sneaking mechanics (MGS V and even Sniper Elite 2 and 3 do this SO much better), bad animation, horrible combat/aiming and the minigames.\n\nIt's sad, because I was looking forward to trying this, I was very much willing to give it a chance, but I have no interest at all to continue after these two missions.\nIf you can get it on sale (I got it for like 3 or 4 bucks), maybe try it out, but unfortunately, I simply can't recommend it.","January 11","false","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordje/recommended/34010/","bordje","Bordje |-/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordje/","350 products in account","TLDR VERDICTOverall, I can’t really objectively recommend Alpha Protocol. It has a wonderful premise that works well in some places, but ultimately fails in a lot more. If you value story over gameplay and you’re in the mood for a good espionage story, then buy this game on sale and breeze through it on easy to avoid frustration. If you’re looking for a good overall stealth action experience, then you won’t really find one here. Here’s hoping Obsidian actually get the time and resources to try a game like this again with a lot more polish.\n\nFULL REVIEW BELOW\n“The only thing I can say for sure, Mike, this business will change you.” – Yancy Westridge\n\nMike Thorton is the newest recruit in for the top secret US government agency known as Alpha Protocol. His first assignment for the agency seems to be stopping a standard terrorist plot, which rapidly evolves into a globe-trotting conspiracy hunt.\n\nThis review is written from the perspective of a fan of stealth action games with an emphasis on multiple approaches. Also a fan of story driven RPGs.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND DESIGNAlpha Protocol’s gameplay is not its best asset. The level designs are largely linear stealth action arenas that don’t offer a lot of room for natural exploration or experimentation. There sometimes are hidden rooms that offer loot or alternate routes, but they are few and far between. If you want accurate expectations, you need to dismiss the notion that Alpha Protocol can be played as a pure stealth game from start to finish. Despite the tagline “the espionage RPG”, there are missions clearly designed for stealth, combat and mixtures of the two. If you try to employ combat in a stealth section or stealth in a combat section you’re just going to get frustrated. The problem is that game doesn’t exactly make clear what’s coming, requiring the player to employ some forethought, versatility and adaptability. It sounds neat, but can get frustrating when you show up in full combat gear to a stealth mission or vice versa.\n\nThe combat and stealth mechanics are a mixed bag. It employs are variation on Deus Ex 1s gunplay, where you basically can’t aim at all until you put enough points into that guns skill. It’s sounds cool, but at the end you basically end up with these horribly over-powered cooldown based weapon abilities that can 1 or 2 shot bosses. The bosses are another negative point for the game. A few of them can be beaten with stealth, but most of them are bullet sponges that you have to take on directly. It reminds me of a similar frustration I had in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, where you would manage your inventory and skills for one playstyle, only to run into a boss that demands another. These inconsistent difficulty spikes are irritatingly prevalent throughout the whole game. Sometimes it seems like the AI has a field of view of 45 degrees in front of them and sometimes it’s like they have eyes on the backs of their heads. The obstacles that enemies can and can’t see through are also inconsistent. The combat AI is smart enough, taking cover and using grenades etc. The stealth AI is less so. They like to stick to predictable paths, can’t hear anything and bodies can’t be moved so they hardly ever spot them.\n\nThe character progression system is very Mass Effect 1-esque. There are skills that are weapon based and the rest help with other aspects of the game (stealth, hacking etc.). Points can award you with passive abilities and active abilities. The progression starts pretty steady, but as mentioned before, by the end if you specialised correctly you can run around invisible, one shotting everything. Not an exaggeration.\n\nSTORY AND NARRATIVEThe story and the way Alpha Protocol handles conversations is easily my favourite aspect of it. The conversation options are timed and almost always boil down to 3 responses. You can be a James Bond style suave guy; an Agent 47 professional guy; or just an all-out aggressive ♥♥♥♥♥♥-nozzle. Different characters will respond to different tones accordingly and this can affect how much they like or dislike you. You can use this to your advantage, making your handlers and potential assets like you for information and perks and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off enemies to make them easier to beat. The game provides loads of dossiers with two distinct categories: individuals and organisations. Organisation dossiers are pretty straight forward, and are mostly used to give you a rundown of opposition tactics. Individual dossiers are more interesting, as you can exploit the information in them to find out what sort of responses people would like/dislike and times use secret facts in a conversation which have varying special results. For example, you can actually use dossier information in conversations to make two bosses turn on each other later making the fight a breeze. Of course, these options only appear if you actually read the dossiers, which feels pretty damn cool for a spy game.\n\nThe story itself is structured pretty similarly to your standard Deus Ex game. You have a straightforward prologue that introduces you to the world and then spans into a globetrotting conspiracy hunt. The game does a good job of conveying the feeling of unravelling the plot as you progress, discovering (or even predicting) plot twists as they are thrown at you. There are plenty of choices in the game that are all very morally ambiguous and open-ended in true Obsidian fashion. The factions you side with and ♥♥♥♥ off can have fairly significant effects on the rest of the game both during gameplay and in the story. You can try to be good or evil, but most choices boil down to picking between two awful things, which is great.\n\nThe actual voice acting in this game is surprisingly not half bad for the most part. This is surprising, considering the rough patches the rest of the game has. Aside from a few specific moments, the voice acting holds up for the most part.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEAlpha Protocol is a rough looking game, even for its time (2010). The character models and animations are pretty terrible, texture work is very mediocre, and relying on lighting and shadow effects to stay hidden will almost always backfire. The animations in general are pretty laughable. This especially stands out when patrolling enemies freak out for a second when changing direction. The martial arts moves look pretty janky as well. A very average looking game, not dated enough to deter me, but not exactly anything to marvel at either.\n\nPerformance-wise, Alpha Protocol is an Obsidian game. What this usually means, is there are a lot of bugs, cut content and a few performance hitches. Alpha Protocol is not a stranger to any of these issues. As mentioned before, the AI is horribly inconsistent, a lot of missions like to bug out when reloading checkpoints (which are designed terribly, no manual saves), and you get punished for breaking stealth or rules of engagement when you know you didn’t. The bugs and technical problems combined with the poor gameplay mechanics make a very frustrating pile of game to get through the gems for the story content, which is a damn shame because those gems can be brilliant at times.","December 9, 2015","false","19.0"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","20","41","0","2"

I'd heard it was pretty poor, but since it was cheap I decided to give it a go due to it's interesting spy espionage theme.\n\nBasically everything is just badly executed. Stealth is too easy due to the braindead AI who will sit and stare at you for about 10 seconds before walking off. Combat is just boring because of it's generic structure and fairly odd aiming system. You can basically get around most of the areas with the standard grunt enemy through bugs and glitches - I know I did. Then you go up against a boss. These are pretty unfair and the only way you'll win is by hiding behind cover, slowly picking off each of the boss's goons and then shooting the boss in the face for about 20 minutes until their stupidly large health bar is empty.\n\nThe only thing this game really has going for it is it's storytelling, with all that choices and branching stuff, ya know what I mean? It was alright I guess, but since all the characters are cardboard cutouts of generic spy movie stereotypes I found it hard to be invested in the story at all.\n\nSo yeah, don't bother with this game, unless you're willing to devote some time into it. Personally, I couldn't be bothered to play more than 4 hours because it just had too many floors for my taste.

Uninspired and cumbersome design, annoying glitches and characters that range from the dull to downright offensive make this game a chore to play. The fact that players need to keep their reticules perfectly still for several agonizing seconds to gain accuracy while the opponents bob and weave through cover is frustrating. The decision to force players to specialize and force them into cookie cutter situations anyway is pants-crappingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥, because it forces the player to completely respec their stealth specialist into an assault trooper every time a boss rolls around. Sticky cover ruins the gunfights. The writing suggests a mind-numbingly simple view of world politics where the question whether the ends justify the means doesn't even come up. The illusion of choice basically comes down to what kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you want to be. The plot doesn't connect to any sense of impact or urgency, because characters run a gamut of paperthin stereotypes. Women in particular seem to have little depth, with boosting the male player's ego as their main function. A comparison with old school Bond movies is apt, except that Alpha Protocol seems to take itself more seriously. maybe it's that AP takes place in a realistic setting, but I can't shake the thought that protagonist Mike Thornton is a sociopath no matter how you play him. I tried to play him as a decent human being but the game just doesn't allow that. Some of the dialogue options are openly misogynistic, despite being labeled 'joking'. If that is how the writers think, then that's ♥♥♥♥ed up.

I was never actually able to complete the game due to a crash that I could never get past in one of the levels. For what it is, I guess it's alright. The shooting is average, the RPG elements are uninspired, the level design is bland and feels like a cookie cutter example of what a default stealth shooter should look like. Nothing is extraordinary and a lot is broken. At this point, just skip this game. It's was outdated practically the day after it came out... and it has not aged well since.","July 27, 2014","false","6.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It feels like a Mass Effect 2 with better controls, more content and more interaction possibilities. At the beginning, that is.\n\nAs soon as you get into your HQ and start doing missions, the game becomes extremely boring because its very repetitive.\n\nHere a summary of the first two hours:\nArrive in HQ, look around and explore the rooms in your HQ, buy stuff for your inventory/gear, go into a mission in mid east, kill bad guys, return to HQ, buy stuff for your inventory, go into mission in mid east, kill bad guys, return to HQ, ...\n\nand so on.\nAfter two hours I was fed up with the game, and uninstalled it.\n\nThe teammates seemed rather dull and boring, I didnt feel any obligation or interest to listen to the stuff they wanted to tell me, so I just tl;dr´d 75% of the conversations as soon as I noticed that it was going to be a boring dialogue.\n\nThe many ways to kill or not kill and move or sneak around the maps are there, but not necessary nor effective. There hasnt been a single scenario where sneaking around the whole map and silently killing enemies would have been as efficient as just going full Rambo-mode on them.\n\nThe weapons feel weird. Extremely inaccurate even when you crouch and aim down the sights. So I mostly took them out with stationed MGs.\n\nOverall... meh. Its kind of okay, but it gets boring very quickly.","September 24, 2014","false","2.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Turning off the Vsync in the game might help it.... but the mouse sensitivity doesn't help for squat when using your mouse between aiming a weapon and moving the camera.

I took down a guard with martial arts moves while he was standing on the other side through a glass window/wall... and no the glass didn't break after doing this...

But the controls are so broken and the combat mechanics so terrible that I simply could not.\n\nThe story is compelling, the game's concept is interesting, but the execution falls flat.\n\nThe hacking mini-game, the mastering of which is critical to the game, is nearly impossible to do with the keyboard and mouse combo; fortunately this game does support gamepads as clearly this game was designed for consoles and the PC port was a sloppy after thought.\n\nEvery now and then I look for mods for this game, something to un-♥♥♥♥ the gameplay, but I have yet to find anything that fixes the gameplay. Which is a damn shame: the first mission really drew me in to this game's story, but Alpha Protocol's broken game mechanics pushed me right back out.","November 27, 2014","false","11.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It is horribly, mind blowingly generic. The generic, boring blandness of this game is just outstanding. It washed over me like the tidal wave crashing down on Patrick Swayze at the end of Point Break. It is like a copy of Splinter Cell Conviction, if of course you took every single last tiny detail about that game that made it so great including sound, gameplay, and graphics, and flushed it all down the toilet, then you have this game. I was shaking my head at how bad it is the entire time I was playing it. A worthless ♥♥♥♥ing waste of anyones time. And I mean anyone. I hope anyone involved with making this game ♥♥♥♥ing dies.\n\nThe stealth part of the game, if you can even call it that, just sucks nuts. The worst thing about this game is how horribly, mind bogglingly inaccurate all weapons are. I seriously wonder what the ♥♥♥♥ they were thinking when they did this. Pistols = luck. Assault rifles = horrible. And shotguns = I can be right in front of a guy not more than 4ft away, aiming directly into his upper torso with the shotgun, and where any other shotgun, game or real life, would blow a hole right through him, 95% of the pellets miss him. It's as bad if not worse than the shotgun in Doom 3. You might be able to increase accuracy with obtained mods and skills as the game progresses but it's too bad this game just generally sucks so bad and is such a overall ♥♥♥♥♥♥ poorly made game that you won't want to. One of the worst games I've ever played. The level design is horrible: incredibly linear and you go from one box shaped room or area to the next box shaped one while killing incompetant enemies with the most innaccurate weapons ever put in a game. The graphics are really bad and the levels all use the same God awful boring colors.\n\nYou want a game like this that is actually fun? Play Binary Domain instead. Or any Splinter Cell game for that matter. You know what, thumb wrestling is more fun than this garbage.\n\nYet another game that completely sucks in general terms but I get all downvotes because people think, for whatever ♥♥♥♥ed up reasoning, that it has any redeeming qualities, in which it actually has exactly zero. If you like this game I feel bad for how easily impressible you are and your taste in games must be incredibly bad. 3/10","June 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I progressed through the first level, and I can't even get this to remotely be playable now at all, especially in this map of the desert.  i turn and face the wall again, and the camera moves normally, then the same movement of the mouse that BARELY turns the camera, all of a sudden rockets so fast, that I try to aim at an enemy, and I keep zooming passed him from one side to the other, while barely moving the mouse at all. for me (and many others I read also) this makes this game absolutely unplayable. how said.  I truly wantyed to play this one, especially with the stealth. I love stealth type games. so if you buy this game anyways, and get the above described problem, don't say I didn't warn you. However there are others., who claim this game works fine for them, so.. it's a risk you will have to weigh yourselves. for me this game is broken as a result of unplayable camera control.. terribly bad","May 15, 2015","false","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game says you can solve problems with any number of different approaches, from Stealth, to gadet use, to open combat. However, in reality the game is obviously meant to be a stealth game. If you try playing it like a shooter (running around, using cover, shotgunning it up) you can beat the game, but you will fail a ton of secondary objectives. Almost every mission the game is telling you to sneak around and not be seen, so why are shotguns, uzis, and assault rifles available to the player when the game really, really wants you to use a silenced pistol (or fists I suppose)?\n\nAll-in-all a mediocre game with very little room for customization and character building.

So far the game is pretty stellar. They wont be winning any awards for graphics but everything else is great. Dont get me wrong though the graphics are still nice. The story has kept my attention, I like the combat and little gadgets. Also another thing is that if you are spotted by the enemy, it wont result in a failed mission. So I would say the game is forgiving on normal. Plus I only paid like 2 dollars but would not feel ripped off if I had paid full price.

There’s a lot of different secret agencies making their moves in the background, and it might be difficult to wrap your head around at first, especially since certain crucial info is only unlocked through different decisions along the way.\nBUT, the plot also adapts really well to the decisions you make along the way, and your play style. It feels like your actions carry weight, and the plot develops accordingly. While the final level plays the same, your character might have an entirely different motivation, and the final boss might be entirely different people. It adds to the replayabitliy, and I think the game truly shines only on the second play through.\n\nOverall, I recommend Alpha Protocol.

This game botches both of those things, along with having annoying characters and stiff controls.\n\nAfter I got to the game hub I started with doing the espionage training, which went alright except for me getting detected by one of the guards. I tried again and happened to do the exact same mistake, and I ended up with the same score of 88 points. The next time I wanted to rush it more, but got detected by the first camera, so I decided to leg it to the end to quickly restart. I fisticuffed both guards after each of them had raised the alarm, and I got spotted by each and every camera, but even so I ended up with a score of 133. [b1]F-cking. What.[/b1] So apparently [b1]stealth[/b1] doesn't matter in the [b1]stealth[/b1] evaluation mission.\n\nI then tried the extra credit course for espionage which involved me backtracking to the start of the game. It went swimmingly up until I got back to the last room of the assignment, where the guards had been redeployed 30 seconds after me emptying the room. I wasn't expecting the game to be a ♥♥♥♥ like that and my carelessness had the guard spot my right thigh for half a second before opening fire and immediately sounding the alarm. I tried to flank him through a sideroom, but he was already shooting at me the moment I opened the door, and I was gunned to death.\n\nSo the stealth's absolute ♥♥♥♥.\nThe camera is stiff.\nI chose to play with a gamepad, but you get two speeds: brisk walking pace and a slight run/fast jog which also feels stiff.\nThe character animations are really stiff and unnatural, I am almost assuming that they didn't use mocap for it.\nThe gunplay also feels extremely stiffEvery aspect of the gameplay controls like ♥♥♥♥, and I don't even mind the Mako in Mass Effect.\n\nI really like Obsidian though; Fallout New Vegas is one of my favourite games ever, and I can overlook the technical flaws and re-use of assets just because the world, story and dialogue is so good, but this game loses points for that as well with the main character probably being the most annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in videogaming history. Every line of dialogue is just so annoying that I started choosing the "professional" dialogue option as often as I could, but even with that he goes off with annoying quips. He is like a mix between the suave and charming James Bond but with the delivery and attitude of an entitled arrogant tosser who just begs to get his teeth kicked in just with his smug grin.\nSpeaking of the dialogue, the dialogue wheel is even worse than the one in Fallout 4, since since that game is atleast a bit more clear if you're going to say something ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or not.\nOriginally posted by Yahtzee: The dialogue system gives you about one second to pick a conversational attitude that is summed up in one word, and it's often hard to decipher. You might be talking to a sexy lady, for e.g., when suddenly an option comes up reading, say, "Trousers." And there's no way of knowing if this means the poncemaster general will change the conversation to the subject of trousers or draw attention to a specific pair of trousers sneaking up behind them or whatever. So you select it out of panic, whereupon El Ponco promptly pulls his trousers down and slaps his bum while mooing like a lost calf, spoiling your reputation with the character somewhat.  Yahtzee's review  feels damn pretty spot-on from as far as I've played, even though he often speaks in hyperbole for comedic effect.\n\nBut then again, I barely got started in the game, so maybe it gets good once you get in to it, but I really can't see the appeal except for the RPG elements, which seem alright so far.\nI am glad that I bought this on sale, because otherwise I'd be itching for a refund of this. Maybe I'll give it a shot some other time, but I don't find that very likely.","December 30, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I tried to look past the flaws that this game had, but I honestly couldn't. The best thing I can say about Alpha Protocol is that it at least tried to be something different, but even if you try to do something different, it doesn't mean that it will always be good.\n\nAlpha Protocol has a unique concept, an espionage RPG. I was surprised to see that this sort of idea, hadn't been done that often in gaming and that is one thing that I respect this game for doing. The main problem with this however is that in my opinion, Alpha Protocol doesn't really use any of the unique ideas it brings to the table that well and the basic stuff that are required to make a good game (like gameplay, playability and graphics) aren't really focused on as they put most of their thought, time and care into trying to implement these ideas to try and live up to it's name "an espionage RPG."\n\nOne of the biggest problems Alpha Protocol has is in it's gameplay. Nearly everything in the gameplay falls flat. While the training section at the beginning of the game, does show off some great ideas for an espionage RPG like sneaking mechanics, combat and gadgets, I didn't feel like I was having any fun playing this or doing any of these ideas for gameplay because in the end, that's what I was thinking they were, just some ideas. I felt like these ideas were only half executed. The ideas are there, but they just stopped after that. Sneaking is basically useless because the AI is really bad. Gun combat feels restricted an the sensitivity never feels right no matter what you set it to. Melee combat, while it's better than gun combat, feels slippery for the majority of the time, but at least it was more controllable than the gun Gadgets are basically useless in combat because you can't really tell where they'll land. There's no targeting ridicule for them so you just need to predict where they'll land.\n\nGraphics are for the most part good however there are several flaws with them. There is quite a lot of slow loading textures from time to time and the longer I played, the more frequently these occurred. There is also a bit of pop in going on quite a bit. Apart from that there isn't much to say about the graphics. They're decent but they could have gotten more polish before release like the rest of the game.\n\nThe sound seemed to repeatedly cutting out randomly for some reason throughout my play time as well. However, this didn't affect my overall feeling towards the game in any way and I easily ignored it as it wasn't too big of a deal.\n\nIn this review, it might come off like I hate Alpha Protocol and even though that's true, there's still some good ideas that are put into Alpha Protocol, which might have been good if they developed these ideas further. The stuff that is common to see and expect in an RPG is present in Alpha Protocol but these things we have seen done a bunch of times are exactly that. Alpha Protocol does nothing to change the styles that are common in RPGs except for the dialogue options, which is one of the best I've seen.\n\nOverall, Alpha Protocol is buggy and generic. It barely does anything to stand out from the crowd and when it tries to do this, it usually falls flat. However, it still uses some ideas which I hope to see in RPGs in a future and if the developers of this game were to make a sequel, maybe tweaking the game a bit, I would definitely buy the sequel to see if these ideas are developed more.\n\nPros\n+ Some good ideas\n+ Great concept\n+ Good mechanics\n+ OK graphics\n\nCons\n- Underdeveloped ideas\n- Terrible AI\n- Restricted/slippery combat\n- Slow loading textures\n\nFinal verdict: 3/10\n\nSteam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","April 22","false","7.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alison/recommended/34010/","alison","alison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alison/","147 products in account","I bought this game expecting a tense spy drama like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy or The Americans. After spending 10 minutes preparing the perfect disguise for my initial mission, the arms dealer's henchmen immediately read me as American and opened fire. So much for spying. Well, perhaps i could at least sneak? Nope. Aside from the janky controls and flaky stealth mechanics, the game repeatedly forces you into frontal assaults anyway. The most appalling part, for me, is when it proudly sums up all your kills at the end of the mission, and awards you perks for them, which really drives home just how messed up the story is. Running around killing (or even "just" disabling) hundreds of foreign nationals without any rules of engagement made me feel a lot more like a terrorist than an operative.\n\nAnd it's a shame because there is some good dialog in there. The story is in the vein of Nikita, conspiracy on top of conspiracy, and it is fun to choose alliances and watch the drama unfold. Just fun enough for me to complete the game. But the boss battles, the waves of enemies, the woefully linear levels... At some points in the game you have to make life or death decisions, but i just didn't care because the majority of the game is built around you killing people with no consequence at all. If there had been more dialog, undercover missions, an open world to explore, any opportunity to downshift and become invested in the places i visited, then the poor decisions i made may have had some emotional resonance. Instead i was sent straight on to the next mission with more faceless bad guys and superhuman bosses to kill. Hard to recommend unless you are really craving a spy fix and are willing to put up with a lot of mindless shooting.","March 21, 2015","false","24.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","5","12","3","0"

What's the point of encouraging stealth approach while the gunner can see you through the cover and pull the alarm?\n\n-The game has checkpoints while it also allows you to save/load at anytime during a mission. However when I reloaded the checkpoint in the Bug the Airfield mission, all the enemies in the area disappeared. This bug is helpful for me to explore the area, but it completely ruins the fun of the game. However those issues are not that severe in the later missions.\n\nAlso, sometimes you can't climb ladders or get behind the cover unless you adjust your camera position or simply "try again". Such problems are quite devastating if you want to go for a stealth approach.\n\nBesides the technical issues, Alpha Protocol is full of dialogues and text if you like narrative elements in a game.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to a friend, because the bugs are ruining the gameplay experience.

And the sad thing is, it looked great. Realistic stealth takedowns and being able to choose your response type, building or ruining relationships and having positive or negative consequences for either and customization. This game looked like gold. And people said it was gold minus a few bugs.\n\nBut that's just it. I went into mission one ready for a great experience and I'm already being seen from literally across the map and alarms are raised without any trace of me doing anything. I wouldn't mind messing up and being seen, but humans don't have x-ray vision. Another problem is your character has to stand up every single time he switches cover, so it makes the mechanic completely useless and what with AI being able to be God already without being near them, you will be seen. This game was released in 2010. It's been 5 years and still these bugs are there? Alright Sega. There's my hard earned 3 dollars for you. I didn't expect to see current or next gen games from Sega this broken. That really disappoints. If the bugs were fixed it'd be perfect. But Sega clearly didn't care about this title.

It controls worse than The Last of Us (origonal)\n\nIts so frustrating to be spoted so easily and have to resort to using such a crap gunplay system. The mechanic where you have to hold the cursor over the target for 4 or 5 seconds to get a shot on them is downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe dialouge is so dry and boring that I found myself daydreaming while I was talking to someone. It also suffers from the, "Lets give the player dialouge options but force them to pick in 3 seconds and only give them a vauge one word descriptor of what the player character is going to respond with." virus. Theres a reputation system with each character and you are told that it doesnt matter if they end up liking or hating you as you get different outcomes and "there isnt a right way." This pisses me off however, because you have no idea what the outcomes will be so you might as well just let the dialouge try auto finish. One could argue that you are supposed to roleplay but I would respond with, "How?" How the ♥♥♥♥ am i supposed to roleplay when the options for most dialouge trees are "Professional", "Suave", or "Angry?"\n\nThe game very much feels like a lazy console port. You have to individually equip skills to use them (instead of using the 100 keys on my keyboard) and the menus are frustratingly designed.\n\nThe computer hacking with mouse and keyboard is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible and I cant figure out how this game was released like that. You have a computer screen full of a word search grid where all the letters are changing. You have 2 codes on the right and left that you have to find in the word search and match up. You controll the left code with wasd and space to confirm and the right with the mouse (moveing left with the mouse will move it left ect.) and left clicking to confirm. I wanted to shoot myself in the ♥♥♥♥ trying to use this system.\n\nTo top it off, I died in the first mission and clicked to reload my last checkpoint and the game crashed. -.-\n\nIm told this laid the groundwork for games like mass effect and i just cant see how. I doubt I will be revisiting this game in the future as I have roughly 200 more games untouched in my library and a few of them have to be good.","February 21, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The random difficulty spikes, the average story, and the absolute worst set of hacking mini-games ever created all made this game mostly an unpleasant experience.\n\nThere were some fun characters (and I got my dude to bang the 3 hot chicks in the story so thats fun) and an occasional fun level or two, but for the most part, this game was absolute bullcrap.\n\nThere is a boss level in the final level that I finally gave up on because I experienced 3 seperate glitches that made me restart each time.

I didn't know they developed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, I didn't know they made Fallout: New Vegas, and I didn't know they created the Neverwinter Nights series. Heck, it wasn't until my second playthrough of Alpha Protcol almost half a year later that I discovered how much I really, really like this game.\n\nObsidian Entertainment is best known for being the developer other developers hand their franchises to when they hit a creative rut. Bioware handed them Knights of the Old Republic, and Bethesda handed them Fallout. In both cases, Obsidian took those franchises and surpassed the original games.\n\nAlpha Protocol, while technically released after Fallout: New Vegas, could be seen as Obsidian's first original IP since Neverwinter Nights, and boy is it an ambitious one. Alpha Protocol is an action-y/stealth-y/gadget-y/spy-y with aspirations to being everything that Mass Effect promised to be. It plays like a movie, emphasizes player choice, and offers a diverse number of playstyles.\n\nIt comes within micrometers of being one of my favorite games. It's so close to being perfect that I can almost smell it. With some tweaking, the stealth could be great, the shooting fun, and the storyline fascinating. Unfortunately, small things muck up the gameplay. Stealth is hampered by the lack of attention the boss battles pay to it, alongside inconsistent NPC fields of view. The story is... well, while it's very nicely presented, it tends to be an incomprehensible mess.\n\nI didn't have much of an idea what was going on until my second playthrough.\n\nBut despite the flaws, Alpha Protocol is very, very good. For all its flaws, it's an ambitious game, and it earns an easy recommendation from me.","May 31, 2013","true","38.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4hud/recommended/34010/","4hud","|$m0k!n|-4HUD-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4hud/","102 products in account","I don't recommend playing this clunky mess of a game without quite a bit of tolerance.\n\nObsidian used to make remarkably well written fully fleshed out dialogue options with a lot of branching options and you had all the time in the world to consider and enjoy them. In AP you only get one word, that is only a type or mood of response, that represents an entire tree of dialogue that just play out by itself and you only get three seconds to decide and on picking that choice the design is quite unresponsive. You can highlight a response, thinking it's all good, but you need to click on the text inside to enable it.. Clunky. How can you assume that there is any roleplay in conversation if you have no idea, what you are saying? It's just a gamble then and gamling is not roleplaying. The most annoying part in this regards is that game autosaves AFTER each conversation.\n\nThe game has a bit of replay value, because of the non-sensical dialogue system of course and in different ways of playing it with focus on different guns (i.e. different combat strategies) and skills, but unfortunately the more you play it the more it falls apart and reveals the inconsistencies. You can master the game and break it.\n\nThe game itself doesn't play on the same conditions as the player. There are lots of scripts and triggers to ruin your gameplay like enemies that alert everybody to your presense in a split second before they pass out. I can't prime a grenade and when I throw it there is always a delay before it explodes that pretty much makes them useless to me in combat, but when an enemy lop a grenade my way it explodes almost instantly. It's also quite rare that I actually manage to complete a throw, because it will bounce off or against walls that I didn't notice.\n\nFor a game with the title Espionage RPG there is a remarkable lack of espionage and barely any RPG. You can't spy on anyone, you can't select your own targets, nothing happens unless the game serves it all on a platter for you. You can only request information if it's for sale, not because you want to check up on somebody. There should have been an option to request data on anyone you want to check out, but there isn't. There is no spying. Calling this game RPG at all, that's really far fetched. It's much more of Action Adventure with skill-progression than anything else.\n\nI had a lot of mouse issues with this game, because in menus it moved in one way, which was okay and in combat another way which was also okay, but a third way in Sniper mode, which was extremely sensitive and a fourth way in minigames, where the cursor moved in completely erratic patterns, which made it impossible for me to use the Sniper at all and made me fail pretty much every minigame.. I had to fiddle around with ini files to lessen the pain, but I couldn't remove it.\n\nThe main character is in a bit of the same vein as Shepard in Mass Effect i.e. boring and forgettable, but there are a few colourful characters that adds all the fun and sexiness of the game.. Take those (two) away and the game would have a been a total disaster.\n\nIt happened on numerous occassions that enemies respawned in my face and just stared blankly at me..\n\nIt was a bit entertaining, but it's very much a - Been there, done that - kind of game.\n","November 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

You can pretty much spend your skill points on speed and martial arts, run towards armed enemies and just kick them in the face until they die, no sneaking required.\n\nActually, you find it extremely difficult to do anything except running towards enemies and kick them on the face because it's so ill designed.

Alpha Protocol boxes with the greater spy-espionage games by entering itself into the genre with its elements. The potential is there, but I couldn't recommend it because of the fact the gameplay itself is unrefined. The graphics are beautiful, as well as the controls. The story line is your typical run-of-the-mill type which everybody can basically predict. There will be a lot of places where you get stuck if you don't memorize basically the whole layout of the game, which will easily aggrivate even the most seasoned of espionage veterans to a hightened extent. Your movements and timing have to be very intricate, as if you're playing a deep game of chess. Having to reload your checkpoints and redo whole sections of the game over and over again because you missed one tiny detail gets menotonous and dull very quickly.\n\nAs I previously stated, the game has serious potential, but in my eyes, it's unfinished at best.\n\nIf you're a hardcore espionage veteran, then I could recommend this game to you. If not, then I'd stay on the tracks of Syphon Filter or games such as.

You don't need them at all.\n\n-Graphics aren't too bad, but there were some graphic busd, like you could see through a wall, or the light of the other room gets trough the wall, and stuff like that.\n\n-AI is crappy, once there was a firefight, and an enemy guy was just standing next to me like: -Hey there What'ya Doin'?\n\n-There were some good ideas, but why the hell did they made such a bad aiming system?! Even if you target the guy and get a "RED CRITICAL CROSS THINGY" mostly you can't hit them, and if the enemy comes like: -"SURPRISE MODAFAKA" You don1t have a chance to fight back, because if you don't aim, then you won't hit anything, and to shoot the target, you need to fire like 100 bullets with aiming, OR you can wait like 5-10 seconds to target the enemy, and get that "RED CRITICAL CROSS THINGY", but you can't because you're dead!\n\n-Story is...  BULLSH*T! !!!!SPOILER!!!!  First mission you need to "get out" of a base, first you won't get out, Second you kill like a lot of people, and then they say this was normal come you work for us... And F*CK Those guys you killed i don't give a damn...\n\n-Friend system? RLY?  If you interact with people you can choose what to say. And even if you say something like F*CK YOU! , they will only be angry with you, but i don't see why this would be bad for me...\n\n-QUICK TIME EVENTS!  The only good thing... is when you don't need to do theese. Theese quick time events are hard, and if you miss something, then you loose time and if you fail then you do them again.

It does have Mass Effect esque moments scattared about though.  Anyway, this game has good ideas, but the gameplay is a complete joke.

Cover is slightly more useful than in Mass Effect 1, but mainly because you are much more killable. Magnetic cover is sloppy and will leave you exposed, solution: better master a firearm skill, especially for the boss fights which frequently take place in arenas\n- As is often paraphrased from TS Eliot, "Good writers borrow, great writers steal." In this game, the designers borrow rather than steal; the same can be said for the programmers and writers. The game is obviously "heavily inspired" by Mass Effect (skill tree configuration, combat style, dialogue wheel, even specific skills) and Army of Two (mission selection, lack of hub, ragdoll-style slapstick combat, comical enemies, PMC-based military-industrial-complex story). These games are the only reason this one exists at all. The engine is licensed and the game progression is sterile and controlled and yet still has bugs. This is par for the course for Obsidian, though: they have made their careers out of making sequels and derivative IPs of "discount" quality.\n\nI got the game for $2.99. I would rate it at about $5. Until that's its price, I can't recommend it.","May 18, 2015","false","13.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuaveM/recommended/34010/","SuaveM","Suave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuaveM/","344 products in account","In almost every aspect attributable to a videogame, Alpha Protocol fails to impress. The graphics are ugly, the artstyle is generic, the gunplay is tripe and the AI borderline schizophrenic.\nIt is a testament, then, to Obisdian's writing staff that this game is merely mediocre.\n\nThe game has a solid RPG heritage and this shows, with the RPG elements arguably being the game's only true strength. There are some solid choice and consequences here and the leveling system is basic, but functional (operating on a hybrid of perks and number-based attribute upgrades). The story the game weaves between flashbacks is not in itself ground-breaking nor is it free from a number of tried and tested spy clichés, but the influence the game allows you to have on the story is commendable. There's no TW2-tier decision here, but characters will reflect on how you played a level and this will result in other characters reacting accordingly. For example, playing steathily throughout will mean characters that respect stealthy-operators are more likely to respect you and your methods, perhaps resulting in an allegiance several levels later. These are relatively minor touches, but they permeate the game's writing, with the game itself having a number of different endings depending on who you allied with and how friendly you were with them.\n\nThe gunplay is heavily influenced by the RPG mechanics of old, with the reticule taking some time to focus on weapons you are not trained for. However, even when your character is maxed out on a weapon's skill, the gunplay fails to feel anything better than floaty and ill-equipped. I ended up playing as a sneaky spy in an effort to avoid the gunplay.\nStealth in this game is hampered by the AI. It's laughably stupid in some cases and borderline psychic in others. The game gets around this in later levels by allowing your character to become invisible (with no in-game reasoning as to why) but this quickly becomes over-powered as your pour more points into stealth.\n\nTo be sure, I found Alpha Protocol a deeply unsatisfying experience, but I found myself constantly wanting to like it as I progressed, there's a distinct lack of good RPGs set in the spy mythos. This is a game that was clearly crafted with a small budget and unlike other budget games (such as DMC1) which inspire a certain cheap charm to them, you can't help but lament the lost potential with Alpha Protocol.","December 21, 2013","false","18.3"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","1"

I'm a completionist type player, and if you aren't a completionist then this review won't be any use to you.\n\nLet me start with the hacking...  the tutorial at the beginning of the game is useless, and it took me several tries over the years to eventually get past it.  I'd try and then get annoyed then stop playing, then I picked up the game up again and give it another try, and so on.  Use google and read the endless amount of people who hate the hacking as much as I do.  One guy says look for the string that doesn't move, which does work! I can get the right string set, however I can't activate the left string EVER even when I find it because for some stupid reason the  key that the instructions on the bottom to set it doesn't work.  Each string uses a different key to set it the string for left and right.\n\nNow after endless reading on what others have tried to make the hacking simpler, with the string hacks and some even say avoid hacking and move on.

However if you are a completionist type player who's aim is to earn as much exp as possible to develop the character to the max this is going to be an irritating feeling of leaving things undone!\n\nAlso if you are a completionist aiming to get the most exp pts per mission/dialog etc the checkpoints are going to be an irritation as well.  For instance if you accidentally chose the wrong thing in dialog and lost a reputation point with someone too bad.  This happened to me during a dialog and my phone rang and well let's just say the game forces you to be chained to your chair and disregard what goes on in real life.  If this doesn't bother you, then no worries.. however I like the feeling of physical freedom.  When the dialog gets screwed up because I am addressing something in real life like answering the phone, it's like I'm being punished.  To me it's a design flaw in the game, and the devs didn't take any consideration to real life when the game is on.  True you could reload a checkpoint, yay you get to do the section all over again.. kinda like punishment. IMO there should not be a checkpoint save systems in this type of game, with dialog choices.\n\nI play with a keyboard and mouse and I read on the forums that this game isn't too friendly with them.  Maybe that's my problem with the hacking, who knows?  I know the mouse and keyboard work fine with combat movement, and the combat is kinda ABC 123/no brainer.\n\nI bought this game when it first came out over 3 years ago and then tried it again over 3 years later and I am still having issues.  I don't want to give it a thumbs down, but I feel I have to as not to confuse people because of the irritating features of the game.  The story  development I think I would like if I ever was able to play the game long enough to experience it.

Not gonna spoil anything so you should try yourself and see. I failed to see any interesting twists though, everything was pretty much obvious from get go as the game plays "in the past".\n\nThe production value is rather low. Aside from the things like weak graphics and controls, there are some very annoying stuff too. For example: If you take the "wrong" door out of two options, you might advance and the door you took just permanently closes behind you, giving you no chance to explore/finish side objectives.\n\nI really would not bother. In this time and age there are so many good, affordable options out there that deserve to be seen more than alpha protocol.

The story follows a more realistic route than most other games in the genre, which can be refreshing.\n\nHowever, Alpha Protocol's graphics and animations appear dull and wooden, trailing behind even its 2010 peers.  Control is poor with both the controller and keyboard/mouse, though this is partly because of the biggest flaw: gameplay.  The gameplay is absolutely atrocious in every aspect.  The minigames irritate at first but later become so frustrating that bypass gadgets are a godsend.  The gunplay is poor; our 'elite' agent takes seconds to hit a still, unaware target.  The choices are misrepresented: 'suave' can be cheeky or it can be arrogant jerk, whatever the developer decided at the time.\n\nOverall, Alpha Protocol is a mediocre port of a mediocre game.\n\n6/10","November 1, 2014","false","8.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

I bought it for 2 dollars on sale and I played almost straight through it.  It is a VERY customizable spy rpg and it is pretty fun.  I know I didn't sneak around at all because that's not really my style so I just upgraded my characters ♥♥♥-kicking capabilities until he was able to rambo entire rooms full of enemies with only his fists.  That route takes some definite precise combo timing but is very fun.  If you play you will probably want to use either shotguns or your fists as CQ and AR or SMG as medium to long range.  The pistols are not very useful, sadly.\n\nDetractors from the experience are minor mostly.  The one thing I hated the most is the fact that you cannot jump at all, presumably to make the game easier to code, since you can only jump or do action man things when a symbol marks the area as an action man thing place and the game will run through a scripted action sequence. 1 ft high debris = insurmountable mtn :/","November 10, 2011","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is somewhat lacking, if you find yourself having trouble invest all skill points in to pistol and get a silencer for it.

Alpha Protocol is one of those things.\n\nAlpha Protocol holds your interest  from start to finish. It is one of the few RPGs where your choices ACTUALLY matter, as your decision greatly influence the storyline. The same can be said for Alpha Protocol's skill point system. During the first mission the  protagonist is pretty much useless - he couldn't hit the side of a barn, even if he was standing a foot away from said barn with an assault rifle. But as you allot your skillpoints, you become a god in the proficiencies.\n\nBottom line: If you like espionage themes, rpgs, and a very individualized gaming experience - Alpha Protocol will not disappoint.","July 8, 2011","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
