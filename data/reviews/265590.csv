"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killer_for_money/recommended/265590/","killer_for_money","Skankles <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killer_for_money/","80 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat is there to say about The Red Solstice...\nIt's an early access, kickstarter game, birthed from Starcraft and Warcraft mods, NOTD or Night Of The Dead. It's a top down, action based, strategy, horror, survival game, where you control a single soldier, in a group of 1-8 players fighting against waves of monstrous AI controlled enemies. It's being built by a small team in Croatia who are working diligently towards their project over the past few years. A month or so ago, the game's “early access” beta release was made public and was met with mixed reviews. The game was extremely buggy, crashing frequently, lacked content and was poorly balanced. Over the past month of playing some of these issues have been fixed, making it a reasonably playable game. That being said, this game is far from perfect and still needs a lot of work.\n\nAs of the time of this review, some-to-most of the bugs have been smoothed out. It's been a long and tedious road of waiting out the fixes, but the game seems to crash much less frequently lately. Though the developer was quoted in saying “the net-code is perfect,” disconnects and crashes still happen from time to time, often at teeth grinding moments. These crashes come at a loss of precious experience, which following many 'balancing changes' has become more difficult to accumulate.\n\nThe game balancing has been getting tweaked every week to make it increasingly difficult for the average player. Without a solid team, with each player having individually invested over 100+ hours, the chance of survival is very low. The learning curve in the game is already steep, developing 'run away skills' and learning from tactical errors (death), it's hard to not believe that the developers want this game to be as difficult as possible. As of official patch 1.94 the news release title is “Now Dying Has Just Become Even More Fun,” which though it sounds like an oxymoron, describes the way the developers want the game to be played. The difficulty rankings have four stages from an easy mode for new players and the soldier mode for everyone else, to bleeding edge veteran and unplayable hard mode. (The last patch raised the difficulty on soldier, so I can't say just how reasonable the veteran mode is.) Other small tweaks have also been continuously implemented such as making followers too slow to keep up when the heat of battle is on, preventing anyone but leadership characters from using several key items, upgrading health and damage of enemies while decreasing damage output of players, and many others. These tweaks gear the player towards a singular path of gameplay that the development team have in mind, which begins to limit feasible gameplay options.\n\nThe amount of content in the game so far is extremely limited, but with a lot of potential. So far there is no single-player mode outside of a Tutorial, so the majority of gameplay is multi-player focused. There are other game options that are not available at this time, like single player and mission mode, but there is little information about them and they are far from being released. This being said, there are only two game modes available right now on two maps: defend the bunker, and survival mode. There are options to add lengthy primary and miniature secondary missions, fast mode that speeds up waves, nightmare mode that brings in bosses every round and others. Each of which change the game mechanics slightly and offer potentially greater rewards per option choice. There are also a hand full of characters including a grunt like assault class, a sniper marksman, medic, demolition and others. They are all unique and have their own perks and uses, though some of the perks are broken, missing, or just completely useless. Many players will kick you out of their game lobbies if they find that your build isn't what they want, or you might find yourself being ridiculed in game for a small mistake made, whether you knew what you were doing was wrong or not. This mentality of “my house, my rules” has created a small player base, and has limited game type availability.\n\nI really do mean the player base is small. Following many patches that made the game more difficult and the amount of frustrating and game-breaking bugs, the majority of the player base have either moved on or decided that they will wait for the game to come closer towards a fully realized project. What is left has been described as an unruly class system of elite veteran players who stuck out the storm and are worn around the edges, and newer players who the elites seem to clash with. This isn't to say that a new player can't find supportive team mates, but there is a lot of discrimination, misinformation, poor sports and 'know-it-all' types that start verbal confrontations on both forums and in-game. It's a mixed bag of chips, but nothing that an experienced game-player wouldn't expect. This being said, because the community is so small at 60-150 players online at a time, be ready to run into the same people over and over again. That obnoxious guy that you fought with in the forums will inevitably end up in one of your games, and he has explosives in his inventory, so be aware!\n\nThough this game lacks much needed fluidity and polish, I personally enjoy the game. I've put in over 200 hours at the time of this review and plan on putting in more. I can't say that I will dedicate as much time though, as the game's content has run dry for me and I find myself at times fearing retribution from the developers from writing a disagreeing statement in the Steam forums and for this sour review. As a new player, online guides are available, and there are helpful players but I wouldn't bother putting in the time if you don't already know all of the frustrations of what an early access game with an disgruntled community is. I would love to recommend this game to my friends and get them engaged. It would be great to bring in new players and breathe some new life into this game. It would be great... but I can't do that. Not at 20 dollars. Not with the community as angry as it is at the questionable changes being made. Not with the lack of content. This game has promise, let's wait and see what happens.\n\nEDIT:\n\nDue to some of the comments left here, RESPECTFULLY, please don't comment here if you intend to start a flame war, slander me, or if you haven't fully read the review and have nothing constructive to say. This is a review from the perspective of myself and the people that I play with. This review was carefully written and I stand by everything I've put in the review.

I was vaguely familiar with the Blizzard mod (Night of the Dead) that it was based on but haven't really played anything like it since. That's because there hasn't been anything like it since! The Red Solstice is a hard as balls co-op survival game that is perfect for Steamworks and I was happy to help Ironward launch it on Early Access and grow the community as the game headed toward a full release.\n\nNow the game is out of Early Access and is better than ever.

You still played it, because it was fun. The learning curve is nothing to laugh about, and it is not exactly the noobfriendliest of communities, especially some of the first players sometimes lack the nerves to deal with new players.\nOnce you get into it though, you will have an awesome experience. Highly tactical, once you get off "Soldier"-difficulty, relies 100% on each teammate.\n\nBy now the game has several different maps, playable on 4 difficulties and a handful of different modes that change up the experience like the "Red Storm" mode where you are weak when outside of buildings, but stronger inside, or swarm and fast modes that increase the pressure on your squad. All with 8 different classes, completely customizable with different weapons and abilities, that have to be utilized harmoniously to win.\n\nProtip: Get a mic. Theres a central TRS teamspeak server, that anyone in the game lobby can give you, and coordinating an 8 man team is just so much easier with voice. Learning the game and getting taught will be 10 times faster if you go on ts with one or two of your squadmates.\n\nThe best way to get into it would be to grab a few freinds, put it on easy, and just jump into it. You will die. A LOT. but thats fine, and you will have fun getting to know all the different abilities and weapons before getting on with the pros who might be more interested in winning than teaching.\n\nSadly, this game has a very small player base, so don't expect to play 8 man games 24/7. There are high times each day, where there are usually 2-4 different games going on, but expect to do some waiting in lobby for members. However, this means that you get to know people very quickly, and if you are somewhat nice and don't harass people, you will be welcomed in the community.","September 13, 2015","true","150.7"," 68 of 81 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","68","81","2","0"

If you're happy to be a follower and support the team it doesn't get too complicated but if you want to master any particular character it can become a much more rewarding experience albeit frustrating at times.  My main concern is there will always be players who will put unnecessary pressure/blame when things go pair shaped - ignore these bullies and just play for enjoyment.\n\nThe more I play the more I enjoy the team work necessary to survive, each character has a roll and must contribute to the team.  Once you master one character and find a good setup (yet to really do as I'm not a perfectionist) just swap and start experimenting with another character as you can definitely put in plenty of hours levelling up each character and get a different experience with each.","July 12, 2015","true","357.6"," 67 of 82 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","67","82","7","0"

Here is the link just in case anyone might find it useful since much of it still applies to the early access test:\n\nhttp://www.deathbybeta.com/2014/04/09/the-red-solstice-alpha-hands-on/\n\nWhat was great about the game then is still great now, and things will improve over time during the early access test.  TRS is a challenging co-op game that pulls no punches.  You will die a lot, and it can be frustrating.  But, at the same time, it can extremely satisfying when your team pulls off a successful run.  Not for the faint of heart or easily frustrated, but highly recommended if you like hectic co-op isometric tactical shooters.\n\nIn addition, there is a lot of tactical depth to the game that isn't apparent at first glance.  Having eight classes, each with their own skills, means that team composition can vary widely and be tailored to the strategy.  Faster marines for highly mobile teams and scouting, or slow but heavily armed marines for hunkering down.  Each class shares a global XP rank that benefits all classes, but then has its own XP rank for just that class.  This means that specializing can really pay off in the long run.\n\nIn game there is a large number of items that can be found and used (mines, turrets, medical supplies, ammo, tac-nukes, and so on), and proper use of these can also greatly affect the tactics.\n\nAll in all, a very exciting nail-biting game.  The early access build is not without some glitches, and it is missing a lot of content, SO KEEP THAT IN MIND before purcahsing the game right now.  Nonetheless I am very much enjoying the game just as much as I did during the alpha.","July 9, 2014","true","23.8"," 68 of 89 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","68","89","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ieatsouls/recommended/265590/","ieatsouls","Fail Tank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ieatsouls/","413 products in account","I feel bad writing this review, because even with a thumbs up, I feel like I'll be cutting the game off at the knees. But better you know the truth, I guess.\n\nFirst off, the game is based on a WC3 custom map called Night of the Dead. You are space marines prancing around a Mars colony full of zombies. You select a suit (read: class), a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, 4 suit components (read: skill...not trees. Paths, maybe? 5 sequential, mostly passive abilities), up to 3 powerups (which add some bonuses at the cost of other penalties), and you go off to try and survive a ~1 hour long match. You find items and accomplish objectives which will strengthen your team, while endless waves of zombies try to murder you to death. The customization isn't that deep, but you'll find plenty to tinker with if you're the fiddy sort. I enjoy it greatly.\n\nSingleplayer exists, but it's not the focus. You control 4 marines and run around doing the same kind of stuff. It's fun. Probably not full price fun, but fun nonetheless.\n\nMultiplayer is the real heart of the game. In order to stand any chance, each player must possess basic tactical acumen and practice it for the entirety of the hour. Further, you have to possess some expertise in your class and use the right abilities at the right times, and understand the flow and structure of the game. Put simply, you are going to lose. You're going to lose a lot. It's a very hard game. Some vets will come and say "oh, no, it's not hard, just git gud". Well, fair enough, but the game has a very steep learning curve. It's simple to play, very difficult to master. That's a good thing, I think. But still, expect to lose a crap ton.\n\nThere is a meta-progression, where you increase in rank (which unlocks stuff, and gives some very minor bonuses) and suit rank (gives very minor bonuses to a particular class when you play it), and medals (also small, but welcome bonuses to individual suits). It starts off fast, but becomes extraordinarily grindy to max. But that's OKAY. When I say very minor bonuses, I mean it. The game is much like Left 4 Dead, or Vermintide in that the game is almost entirely about good teamwork, and somewhat about individual skill, and very little about raw stats or xp. About 70% of winning is teamwork, 20% is individual competence, 9% is having enough xp to play the classes you need, and 1% is xp-rewarded stat bonuses. On top of all that, you can prestige (yes, lose one full 0 to max xp amount) in order to get even more tiny bonuses. That said, unless you're a total no-lifer, don't expect to max anything here.\n\nNow let's talk about the community. In order to accomplish anything, you will need to bring friends or make friends. I was able to take my little gaming collective of 3 into the game and we died a bunch, but we were able to improve considerably and also not hate or ruin the game for each other. That's pretty ideal. If you can't bring your own friends, you'll probably need to find a few veterans on the forums. The community is incredibly small, and if you just join a public game, you will get 5 minutes in, and then die, and everyone else will die, and everyone will swear a lot and blame each other. You will swear that nobody else in the world but you knows how to play the game better than a chimpanzee with a congenital learning disability. You will rage that it will take you 9650 games to reach the next rank if you keep dying on wave 2. You will go out into the darkness, and there will be a great wailing and gnashing of teeth. Sometimes, you'll sit in the lobby and there won't be enough people to form one lousy game.\n\nYeah. You need to either bring your own community to this game, or else ingratiate yourself to the crusty old veterans who've solved this puzzle ages ago.\n\nBut overall, I recommend this game as everything about it is a labor of love. They adapted Night of the Dead from Warcraft 3 to bring the game to its fullest potential, to introduce it to new people, many of whom don't even own Warcraft 3. It's certainly not for the money, given the sad state of the community. And the players work on it out of passion too. I see more and higher quality guides for Red Solstice than I see for most AA games these days. The people who make and play this game obviously care about it a lot. There is some talk about how to strengthen the community, but the fact of the matter is, in my opinion, you just can't. It's a niche game, it's a difficult game, it has virtually no marketing, and the story is the narrative version of a toupee. 99% of gamers would take one look at it and turn right around. Red Solstice is a hidden co-op gem, on the same level as AI War. It's a very rare taste. It'll never be very popular, and that's fine, because it doesn't need to be. It's just fun. I like it a lot.\n\nOne last note: expect to do a lot of research. Many of the deeper mechanics are buried within documentation that exists only on the forum, or one guy's steam guide, and some haven't been written down at all.","November 18, 2015","true","96.8"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","31","33","2","0"

And each with its own unique style of play, strenght an weaknesses.\nThe game has big replayability, randomized missions, locations, monster spawns, bosses, everything to make every single dollar spent on it worth it. Even 1000h+ veterans still get surprised by what the game can show. And constant updates and support from the devs keep the game balanced and fresh.\nSeriously what are you waiting to buy this game?\n\nMy review on Early access:\nThis Game is wonderful, I've been part of the community Since Late Notd 2 And then Notd: Spec Ops. The makers of this game worked their asses off during lots of years and they deserved this final result. A true co-op survival game with good tactics and randomization. Threats that will require skill and cooperation of your teammates so you can survive. It's also possible to play alone if you're feeling pro, and the game allows you to have some bonus as you play, it's really rewarding to see your characters getting new modules and getting better stats. It's also awesome to kill big bosses or help your team to do it, and the best part is to evac with your team knowing you did your job properly, and trust me it wont be by evacing before you get to see some nasty awesome monsters.\n\nIts on early access and the game depends on people playing but really, if you're active you'll always find games and help people find games aswell. The more people that have the game, the more activity it will have, so get it! Be part of this growing community!","July 9, 2015","true","357.5"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","28","37","0","0"

If you're looking for that kind of experience, and like challenging games, then this game is for you.  They are reportedly working on a single player mode, but cooperative-multiplayer is where the heart of this game is.\n\nThe game IS challenging.  If you are playing at the correct difficulty for your team, you will lose more often then you will win.\n\nEven though it's early access, the game is very playable.  They've had some buggy patches but they tend to fix them pretty quick.  The devs are on a fast-release cycle and they listen to the community as to what is and isn't working, what's fun and isn't fun, and they participate in the forums.\n\nNow that the game is more stable, the dev's have been focusing on adding more content (maps, bosses, missions, skills, etc) which is keeping the game fresh and challenging.\n\nIf you can get this game on sale, or money isn't a big deal,  I'd definitely recommend the early access version.  If you are on a tight budget, you may want to wait for release.  I have ~500hours on record so far for a $20 game.  So I'm very happy with the value I'm getting.","December 31, 2014","true","055.3"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","27","36","2","0"

It would be better and necessary planning your course of action ahead, trusting your teammates, coordinating with them, and sharing supplies you find along the road.\n\nSounds a bit familiar? Yes! If you love NotD(SO/Aftermath) on WC3 or Undead Assault 3 on SC2, then this is definitely the game for you (finally), and with tons of enhancements you will find in game, love the well-made soundtracks for example.\n\nWell, if you haven't heard or (unfortunately) hate those games due to the moderate learning curve before, then you should better not miss TRS this time. There is a brand new Single Player mode for everyone to enjoy, meanwhile, you will be familiar with the gameplay, which is challenging and worth playing.\n\nFor multiplayer games, it's the meaning of this game, charming and fascinating, especially cooperating with some experienced players (eg. Diode, eL gRingo, Yegor, quzexe12... too many superb players, have no luck yet to play with you all sorry).\nAlso you can just start a Survival game which is some sort of multiplayer but just you landing with 3 bots under your command, which is a highly efficient way to master the map you’re playing with at this moment.\n\nAnyway, it's a style of easy to learn, challenging to master co-op game, yet eventually skilled players will have the feeling of satisfaction from the heart.

Meaning that this is a highly team based overhead style game where classes actually seem to matter with a sickening amount of fine tuning options available to each of the eight classes.\n\nUp to eight players are allowed in a game, though there are specific limitations on how many instances of each class allowed typically either 4, (Assault) 2, (Heavy Support, Medics, etc) or only 1 (Hellfires, Terminators, Etc.) Though as there isn't a infinite ammunition system and a toss mag reload (Meaning anything left in the magazine when reloaded is "Tossed" or simply lost.) ammunition can quickly become sparse.\n\nThe voice acting in the single player game is terrible and it feels, clunky especially in the beggining levels, so I spent most of my time on multiplayer scenarios.\n\nUpon which comes my biggest lament with the game. Characters are allowed two weapons, a primary weapon and a secondary. Of the secondary weapons available there is a handgun or pistol. For whatever reason this uses primary weapon ammunition regardless of if it happens to be napalm, full metal jacket, or hollowpoint. Which renders it's overall effectiveness somewhat questionable compared to a grenade launcher, Rocket launcher, or even shotgun which use their own ammunition pool and have vast room clearing capacities compared to a pistol.\n\nGranted, a Hellfire can replenish their GAR (Gauss Assault Rifle) from a fuel barrel in this so maybe the point is moot...\n\nIf one enjoyes wave/endless monsters trying to claw their jibblies while trying to complete objectives in a story-esque fashion and all the chaos involved with it, especially with up to eight friends... then your likely going to sink much more time into this than you had origionally planned. The mechanics of the game are good (With the occasional wall where explosives may pass through) the only failing point so far is to make a truly engaging story singleplayer. Having a bad voice acter (Think like a B movie commando that can no where near sell it or a solid snake impersonator) whom the player is FORCED to listen to quickly ruins any immersion and saps the will to continue.\n\nMy reccomendation is to play it how it seems to be meant to. As multiplayer. Grab your guns, and your comrades, and never stop firing, otherwise your going to be picking claws out of your backside.\n","July 11, 2015","true","38.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The Red Solstice offers intense, cooperative teamplay with up to 8 players at once. The game provides several large maps with randomized mission pools and initial spawn locations that all take place in a (now) very hostile Mars colony; there's a huge amount of replayability. Players are offered an array of different marine classes to complete missions with--ranging from heavy weapons and armor, medics, squad support and demolition specializations--each class type has a very distinct play style and role. Higher difficulties in-game absolutely stress teamwork and good communication (more so than I've seen in almost any other game), along with requiring a healthy range of different marine classes.\n\nThe intensity, atmosphere and sound design of the game create an unforgiving environment that only a marine of the future would deserve. A simple mistake can take a great game session from "winning" to KIA in the blink of an eye--this is something I don't see often in other games--and The Red Solstice does it beautifully. The game's mechanics, threats and nuances have a moderate learning curve--death can be quick and sometimes mysterious--fighting through the heavy challenges is a huge chunk of fun in itself, but the accomplishment of fighting through a mission sequence to victory with your team or friends is a very rewarding feeling.\n\nIf you're familiar with the older Warcraft3 / Starcraft custom maps (Night of the Dead / Undead Assault) or you enjoy games like Alien Swarm, Fallout Tactics or any of the other isometric/tactical classics--I would highly, highly, highly recommend checking out The Red Solstice!","May 6","true","354.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

Lots to learn as this is no cakewalk.  I am recommending that people who enjoy some RTS strategy objective-based gaming in a sci-fi environment should grab this.  They just implemented a solo version in it as well to help you learn your classes.  But the major focus seems to be around co-op play.  As you gain experience and rank up, you can increase your weapon functionality and become a better soldier.  Im sure there are better reviews than this so keep reading other posts.

And here it is.\n\nTRS combines the looks and feel of Starcraft, blends in some DOTA-like micro control but has the players act cooperatively against waves of zombies and alien monsters a bit like Left For Dead.\nHowever, this blend of threats and mission makes you realize quickly that you need to know your way around before succeeding. By the setting and enemy waves alone, the game is substantially more difficult to master than many of today's games. The difficulty adds to the addictive character of the game - lots of replayability.\n\nThe developers continuously keep on improving the game and gameplay. Additionally, they are always open for your suggestions and eager to receive your crash reports. There is a close connection between game community and  developers.\n\nRTS is multiplayer focussed and purely cooperative so be on the lookout for a decent team / squad. At the moment the RTS community is rather small so at times it might be frustrating not to find enough players for your match. This is the only drawback I see and it might become resolved soon once there is a bigger community.","March 15","true","156.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

My search started way back when Alien Swarm was still a thing, but every game I tried lacked something, you know? Well, I for one am glad to have found this game! I've clocked in over 200 hours of game play and I don't think I have play a game for that many hours besides WOW. Defiantly spend your money on this title ladies and gents. I haven't seen a game do this genre justice in a very long time\n\nI came for alien shooter genre, but I stayed for in depth game play mechanics. This game has got it all for sure. Inventory management, intense team work, tactical over shooting, mutant monsters, an over-run colony, nukes, drop ships, flame throwers, knives, sharp sticks...you get the picture. I could go own and list all the features, but that would be better served by playing The Red Solstice (TRS).\n\nSo here are a few important things to know about TRS. TRS is freaking HARD! It doesn't do a whole lot of hand holding and rarely pulls it punches. If you make a stupid play or think this game is a solo Rambo action game, the monsters will feast on your stupid corpse, and more importantly, they'll eat your friends while they are still alive. How do I not be stupid you ask? Well learning how to play the game better that's how. And how you do that is by dying...A LOT. Get use to the game over screen because you will see it ever day you play. Don't get discouraged though, it's part of the learning experience. Even death you still serve, um, I mean you gain XP for rank and speicalist XP for your class that your playing. The more waves and missions you complete the more XP you gain. And of course you'll get better at the game  and you'll no longer do silly things like trying to figure out how to use a satchel charge in the middle of a huge wave of monster while your whole team is in the blast radius (yes I was that dumb once).\n\nEnough of my rambling.

Scratches that powerarmor marines vs the Xenos itch, feels very WH40kish which is IMO a good thing. I don't usually write reviews for games but this one is deserving of a positive review. It's kind of rough around the edges but it's still the most fun Ive had with coop in a looong time.\n\nWord of warning though, the game is insanely hard and the multiplayer is a whole different ballgame to the singleplayer campaign and also where the game shines the brightest. Unfortunately there are not very many people playing the game online and this is also it's biggest drawback. Sometimes it takes a while to find a decent game lobby and for it to fill up with people, but thats a good time to ask questions of the more experienced players and to think about builds of which there seem be quite a few combinations.\n\n8/10","March 7","true","26.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Playing as a squad of marines desperately trying to push back the stem of undead/mutants that are threatening man kind on mars, players will have to work together or perish alone. That said, the game is extremely hard, with many retries required to win a game. A single mistake or bad decision can be the difference between success and a squad wipe.\n\nIn the current state, the game is quite buggy, crashes often (once every couple of games), desync causes many issues. The playerbase is plagued with elitist people (including myself, I must admit), and new players can easily find themselves lost in the steep learning curve and bashed by the more experienced. But if people are willing to stick with it, they may end up enjoying it.\n\nMy best advice, do not be afraid of asking questions, people would rather help you than scorn you if you atleast ask before doing something. Newbies are treated as something to be cared about, even if they tend to do some stupid stuff.\n\nThe developers are friendly, they respond to questions and bug reports, and interact with the playerbase. In time, the game should hopefully be bug free and play like a dream, we can hope at least.\n\nFor early access, this is definitely a game with promise, and even in its current state, an excellent game in my opinion.","February 4, 2015","true","415.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

TRS is a different kind of game, that goes unsaid, if you are not into working with a team via a Chat client (Teamspeak, mumble, etc) you may see some real let downs come gameplay time. Like any other stragety game knowing what the game plan is for your team is important and without a solid communication system you will see teams in public lobbies fall before wave 10.\nGood news is that there is a teamspeak server dedicated to TRS (ts.game-com.de) and as a new player to the game I can say my experience went from crappy, to excellent the moment I signed on there and began playing with people. Not only do you learn a lot from more experienced players (Veterans) but you get to learn a lot of things you wouldn't find out by playing in random lobbies with random people.\n\n"But Dagnome, there is a in game chat"\nTrue, but like most games with built in VOIP it isn't very good or used at all.\n\nTo sum up, if you are looking for a great team game to play with your friends then TRS will hit that sweet tooth, it can be frustrating because on teammate can screw up the whole game, but it can also be very rewarding like the time me (Medic) and an assault survived together after our team was slaughtered and evaced to safety (http://www.twitch.tv/dagnom/v/7696891).","July 17, 2015","true","114.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

They plan to have a single player campaign but it is not playable yet.  I have to say that generally I do not like co-op shoot em up games but this has me hooked.  Co-op is where it is at.  In RS you play one marine in a squad, you pick the powersuit you want, which offers different powers and abilities, then you go kick butt.  There are serious strategy elements and team work is critical to success.  So much fun.\n\nPros: The most engaged player community I have ever seen.  Very responsive developers.  For early access, this game is polished and feels like it could be on the market already.  You get to play a space marine!  Replayability is huge as bosses and scenarios change even if you play the same map repeatedly.\n\nCons: It is early access, so there are still balancing issues that are being worked out, but not many.  There are a few bugs here and here but nothing game breaking.  The player community is small but seems to be growing.  This game does have a learning curve, but most people help out new players which is nice.  If you dont use team speak or communicate much it might be hard to fully enjoy a co-op game.  If you don't have an issue communicating then that isnt really a con.  Also, AdAstra is always hitting basic lockers but what can you do right?  I am just kidding on that last one.\n\nI have been following this game for months now and its evolution from its early days on steam has been profound.  I love playing it currently and I cant wait to see what it looks like when they finally are ready for market.

Or die trying."\nWell, get ready to die. A lot.\n\nThe planet Earth has been decimated and part of the human race is trying to survive on Mars.\nAfter a storm called "The Red Solstice", the Tharsis colony has lost communication with the other humanc olonies of Mars. A squad of marines is sent to find out what happened to the colony.\n\nThe Red Solstice is a top-down, tactical, squad based survival shooter video game with RPG elements.\nThere are three game modes: Single-player (Campaing), Survival and Multiplayer.\n\nOn Single-player (Campaing) you control a squad of 4 marines through 10 missions. The first two missions serve as a tutorial, teaching you the basic controls and how to play.\nThere are 4 difficulty levels.\nAt the beginning of each mission you can choose the class of your marine, his primary and secondary weapon and up to 4 skills. However, you start with the Assault class only. The other classes and weapons will be unlocked as you progress on single-player missions.\nThe game has a good variety of enemies and weapons.\nWhile playing solo you can use the Tactical Mode, where you press a button and the game runs 90% slower so you can issue orders/change the strategy/change the players position.\nIn the beginning it's important to focus in one or two skills. Don't try to keep all of the skills at the same level.\nAlso, it's important to have a balanced squad of various classes.\nAnd get ready to die. It's possible to revive a dead squad member, but if all of them die, you'll have to restart from the last checkpoint.\n\nThe Survival mode it's like the multiplayer mode, but you play with bots, just like in single-player.\nThere are random missions and events, 6 different maps, you can also level up and unlock new classes and abilities.\n\nIn the Multiplayer mode you can play co-op with up to 8 players, in random missions and events, 6 different maps, you can also level up and unlock new classes and abilities.\nCurrently there are few people playing this mode, so it may be hard to find someone to play with.\n\nRating:\n9/10\n\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com]","May 30","true","2.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You're out in an urban area, which is full of zombies and other creatures that thirst for your blood. You only have your squad and your skills, and you have to learn the ropes all along. Ammo's running out, people get poisoned and wounded, and enemies become stronger wave after wave. Perfect!\n\n..It doesn't really matter how many times your squad gets terminated in the game. What actually matters is your experience behind that. Failure is the foundation of success. Soon you learn to use barricades to block enemy routes. You get to count your shots carefully, and to help out your fellow teammates who are out of mags. Wave after wave, you learn more tactics and, ultimately, achieve the goal.\n\nReally looking forward to play it, big thanks to devs!

Its still in EA and has bugs and optimumisation issues etc but the overall platform is stable enough for several hour sessions with no real game breakers.\n\nGameplay is similar to DoW2 Last Stand and other games of this ilk. Players control their own characters and pick the abilities for themselves but are reliant upon the whole team (upto 8player co-op comp stomp)  trying to achieve a series of objectives while surving progessively stronger waves of enemy.\n\nThere are several game option variants currently playable with more under development including the single player which hasn't yet been implemented.\n\nControls require some familiarity but are acceptable, chat is text based at the moment but co-ordination is improved by waypoints, markers and map pings available to the 2 leaders chosen before the match. A basic objective compass is in effect throughout for everyone.\n\nWhen you die in match you remain a spectator with full access to the map and text to continue participating and there a re several methods of getting back into the match but nothing so simple as a "quick" pick me up by a team mate.\nThe game won't hold your hand and is definietly challanging enough to retain interest.\n\nSummary: "Just one more match" type of fun.","July 20, 2014","true","187.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

In it, you and up to 7 other Marines battle your way through a rather relentless horde of aliens, moving around a large map to try and complete various objectives before ultimately being overrun and forced to evacuate, or making a courageous last stand.\n\nThough there are a couple performance issues (namely clicks and keypresses not always registering when there is a full roster of players) the game is the only I've seen lately that delivers such an in-depth and tactical approach to multiplayer class-based combat. Every class is vastlly different from the others, but no single role is mandatory to a successful squad. Within certain parameters (Elysium Corp won't let you take 8 medics) the squad design is very adaptable, as is each class based on your playstyle.\n\nTactically, the game pretty rapidly snuffs out heroes who stay away from the cluster too long, but is not unrewarding to a team that can cowardinate an effective division of tasks. Leaders of the squad can issue orders, and set waypoints for the team to follow. Rather than just relying on good communication, your team can physically see where you want them to move to.\n\nI have yet to see a game that is so rewarding to good communication and planning. It is brutally hard, and the developer holds no punches, but if you can gather a strong group of quick thinkers and loyal marines, you might just save Mars Colony.\n\nThe impecable sounds, the unrivaled gameplay, and the immense tactical immersion earn this game a 10 out of 10 from Reaper\n\nEDIT: Out of Early Access for a while.

However, I've come to find the game is much more than (and far from) that.\n\nThe Red Solstice at it's core is an involved 8-Player cooperative, top-down shooter. It feels similar to Alien Swarm in some respects, but the actual difficulty is higher, the missions are more involved and classes/skills you can chose to play as are much more elaborate. A full multiplayer mission session is generally about an hour long. Multiplayer aside, there is also a Single Player module to the game that offers a more involved story line which is directly related to the multiplayer experience--The single player missions can also be a great way to learn about the game's mechanics without making massive, lethal explosive faux pas' in multiplayer... ;D\n\nThe game can be very difficult, but this is what drew me in. My friends and I all bought this together, each time pushing further and further into the storyline missions after each retry. We all got very familiar with the "Game Over" screen, but eventually figuring out how to play the different types of marine classes and working together as a team was a very rewarding experience.\n\nI have no qualms with the game in it's current state--there are on occasion bugs that will appear with new updates, but the devs are active and in good communication with the playerbase. The community is rather small, but there are often games forming together at an unofficial teamspeak most players use. Using the Steam discussion groups is a great way to find players to play with or learn from as well.\n\nCya' on Mars marine!","May 6","true","131.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A comfortable couch zone for the typical sci-fi nerd like me with no big suprises.\n\nIt has a solid singleplayer experience where you can get a grasp of the core game mechanics, the different classes, weapons, perks and the inventory managment.\nAlso only in the singleplayer part you can activate a tactical "bullet time" where you can control all of your 3 squad members in detail.\nThe game is intended to be pretty hard and unforgiving, so even on the lowest diffuculty you can expect a hard time even as a seasoned gamer.\n\nWhere it shines most in my opinion is the multiplayer part though.\nThe mainly played mission mode ties story wise in the singleplayer campaign with different outcomes and procedual generated objectives and different bossfights.\nWhile playing you are under constant pressure from the enemy and you have to be on the move the whole time while looting and managing different important rescources like ammo, medkits and explosives for roughly 45 minutes if u dont die before that.\nThat experience (especially while playing with a good group of 8 ppl) is a BLAST.\nThere are also plenty of other modes to mix up your experience once a while like a defense mode or KotH.\n\nI really recommend the game for people that are looking for a very tactical approach on a top-down shooter that recquires tons of teamplay with a very tough difficulty.\n\n\n\nThe only two downsides for me are:\n\nIt takes plenty of time to "learn the ropes" due to the lack of a good tutorial. You are pretty much required to ask other players for good class setups and fitting playstyles. It took my about a dozen times with some random teammates to see the victory screen the first time.\n\nThe second one is no fault of the game and the reason for me to write that review: The Red Solstice has a pretty low player base and you can be sitting in the lobby for 15 minutes untill you find a game. I hope the playerbase grows stronger over time.\nThe upside of that is a very nice and patient playerbase though.","January 25","true","63.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Poor graphics optimization made the game nearly unplayable, with frame rates regularly reaching intolerable lows.\n\nFast forward to today, and things have greatly improved. The game is a satisfying blend of RTS and action, and it really does perfectly capture that sort of panicky scoot-and-shoot flavor of sci-fi horror films in a way that other more visible/mainstream games haven't. Team-work is essential, but not forced.\n\nCurrently the game is facing a major problem, though. In order to complete a scenario (that is, not die while frantically holing up in a building/deathtrap as ammo supplies dwindle) and complete objectives, you really do need a team of 6-8 players. And, sadly, the game is dying. Which is a real shame because it's fun and has greatly improved since its early mis-steps.\n\nIf this goes on sale for anything 15.00 or lower, consider buying this game. It really is a unique and action-packed romp. It is in need of some more polishing which, if the player base doesn't completely dry up, will no doubt come along.","May 23, 2015","true","24.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's still incredibly hard, but that just makes winning even sweeter once you finally manage to do it. At only 20 bucks, I'd definitely reccommend this game. Unfortunately, I don't have any actual friends to play this with, so I'm left having to find pubs, but when I last played, there seemed to still be a pretty decent player base, and I only encountered one or two really trolly players. There seems to have been a clear movement towards discouraging people from going all Platoon on each other, which I personally really appreciate.\n\n9/10\n___________________________________\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI can't wait to see the finished product this game turns into; I've really enjoyed myself in the missions available so far.\n\nWhile there isn't a lot of story or maps, yet, this game shows incredible promise. It's got a bit of a learning curve at first, and the difficulty continues to ramp up pretty consistently, but if you enjoyed Dawn of War, I think this may be a game for you. You only get control of one character, but the customization is pretty decent. The game could definitely benefit from added weapons or some kind of weapon-mod system, but there's a pretty good variety so far.\n\nAll in all, I'd give the game about a 7/10 right now, if it were completed. Taking into consideration it's an early access game, I'd have to ammend that score to a 9/10. With a few improvments/additions, I'd be too busy playing this game to even write this review.","July 17, 2014","true","43.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

No? How about Starcraft 1 custom maps? No? ... then darn I'll have to explain if not I've probably already sold it to you.\n\nif you've never heard of SWAT:Aftermath or never played those Starcraft1 custom maps you might've missed out. However this is reminiscent of a future more developed version of that.(with greater technology of course!) Where you get to play as certain classes with certain skills and attributes utilizing different weapons and strategies you go around a huge map exploration-wide with buildings you can enter and exit along with power systems that can be activated or simply go looting around and making sure you destroy "radiation" blobs around the map or activating radar sensors and setting up fort for an oncoming onslaught upon your squad and simply surviving until rescue or you're overrun and slaughtered. There are of course other game modes like mission mode completing a series of missions storyline based or just task based. Another mode would be bunker mode which is defending a fort area. Survival is simply try to do the main missions in time, get out alive within 15 waves, brutally hard and requires quite a bit of coordination.\n\nAnd by squad I mean you and your friends. This game is thrilling with friends and co-op is abundant. What's better is your classes can level up there's equipment to unlock, and multiple difficulties and game modes being developed. The graphics are nice and I can't wait for further updates.\n\nThere is no single player campaign quite yet due to it being in development, however multiplayer and the prologue mission is available and there's quite a bit to do already.\n\nEnemies range anywhere from parasites to gargantuan behemoths the size of a building.\n\nThis is written during the game's alpha.","July 17, 2014","true","17.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The Red Solstice .. apart from the really not great lobby and the 'we shall disconnect and crash the game - also for fun please redo the tutorial level before you're allowed to play multiplayer' problem, this is hard to fault.\n\nThink of space marines in any the following flavours: Warhammer/AVP/StarCraft and you'll be close to the kind of trooper feel the game has. You play one character and gain XP in 3 areas. The first is your XP (your account XP maybe) which gives you greater access to classes, weapons and perks as you progress. The second is your class XP - thus if you play medic alot you will unlock class specific 'powers'. The third is in-game XP - you start at the same basic level each new match and level within that match in a fashion similar to Dota or LoL etc. At the end of the match you lose that progression, but hey it's all good.\n\nWithin the match there are items to be found. You only have 6 inventory slots so choose well and ammo is in short supply so it pays to grab it when you can and share with your team.\n\nVisually the game owes a lot to the Diablo 2 / Titans Quest / Warhammer view and it does look great, plus there is a lot of screen you cannot see due to poor lighting. Within buildings there are consoles which activate lights and flares which can be fired or dropped to help further. Also there are ad hoc sentry gun positions you can activate and within bunker mode, the option to deploy 'reinforcement' sentry turrets periodically.\n\nthink i have done all i can to describe this game - noe go watch a youtube video on it","July 17, 2014","true","62.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Not exactly an easy learning curve, and I was very close to going for a refund a couple times during the first mission.  Tutorial wasn't bad, but didn't cover many things that would have been pretty helpful as a newbie, things that I had to discover on my own.  Now, having done that I'm greatly enjoying it and would probably rate it an 8 out of 10 at this point. Still, having been a computer gamer for many years, I've learned that one doesn't really know the true 'staying power' of any game until you've played it for a week or two.\n\nI would encourage anyone who gets frustrated in the early going to keep at it. You absolutely need to use the Tactical Mode a LOT to keep yourself alive.  In Tactical mode you can gain true control over your team, so, for example, you can give direct orders for 3 of your team to cover the one who's deploying satchels or resonators instead of relying on autoaim to protect you.  You can manuever much more effectively, and you also get a more personal feeling about each of your teammates when you're controlling them directly.\n\nOne key thing (at least for me) that I didn't figure out until my third attempt at the first mission is that the GDD device not only points you to nearby monster spawn sites, it also points you to nearby resonators, which you must have to destroy the spawn sites. Without a resonator when you need it, the spawn sites will just continually churn out mobs, and the more functioning spawn sites, the more mobs until eventually you die a horrid, screaming death.\n\nSo use the GDD to find the resonators and you'll find survival isn't really impossible.\n\nGood luck, and if this has the kind of staying power I think it will, my only complaint may be that there aren't enough single player missions to keep me happy, so I'll hope for some DLC in the not too distant future.\n","September 23, 2015","true","19.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

This game only really works with a keyboard and mouse, a controller really isn't needed for the style of the game (and i'm not sure if it even supports one currently), so keep that in mind if you're thinking you could have twin stick shooter style controls, this is mainly due to the interface.","January 4, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

As a friend of this genre, and a huge fan of NOTD. This is the game, also nice that the devs play with us, its mostly stable. Patches seem to be rolling in atleast once a week. Starting a game takes a bit patience, like 15minutes or so. Extremely challenging even for high rank players. hard difficulty is already totally insane. And there is Nightmare difficulty after that.\n\nIts starter friendly in every way, until you hit Rank8. There is some bugs and undeveloped systems, but not any gamebreakers. Mostly you get used to them and stop noticing them. 80% of the players i have played with are helpful and friendly. Learning not to die, playing as a team, micromanage your every move is the key to victory.\n\nThere is two methods you can play and switch any time. Automove (or follow) + autofire, will cause you sometimes miss, reducing total DPS, but your instincts and reactions are sharp as a bot, Then there is manual mode. Swapping primary to secondary weapon you run 25% faster, switching from autofire mode to burstfire will enable you move fast between high damage shots. and Manually aiming your gun completely will give you +40% damage, but its up to your own instincts to react to targets approaching you.\n\nAll the classes provide very good variety, if you got bored in one class you will find completely diffirent playstyle from another class. I love the RPG system. There are weapons & class specific skills to unlock for the first 50hours of the game (and its still a very, very long way to maximum rank). Playing a certain class gives statistical bonus to that class via Specialization rank. There is three diffirent maps you can play, and every game you can choose from 7 diffirent game modes ( popular are "Fast Mode" and "Bunker Mode"). I would give 2 recommendations to this game if I could.","January 10, 2015","true","131.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

The corpses of the team sent here before us were strewn all over the area. I could already tell, this was going to be a long mission.\n\nIf it’s not demons plaguing your usual trip to the Red Planet, then it must be aliens. Welcome to The Red Solstice, a Steam Early Access title developed by Ironward and published by Nkidu Games, Inc. The Red Solstice is a tactical top-down action shooter with an emphasis on teamwork and survival. The general story revolves around you and your team of space marines exploring what remains of human civilization on Mars after a massive storm (named the “Red Solstice”) has nearly wiped out all power and communications on the planet. At the same time, a large collection of alien lifeforms have emerged seeking to kill everything they see. Graphically, it seemed okay. The art design depicted a very dark and gritty sci-fi world, which I liked. What annoyed me slightly was just dark some of the levels were, though. At times, it became slightly difficult to see where exactly I was going. On another note, the various types of aliens you fight looked pretty cool. My main concern though, lies once again in the controls, namely, the camera.\n\nIn Red Solstice, the camera has a bad habit of not following your player at all, meaning you have to not only constantly direct your character on where to go, but you also need to manage keeping the camera on them at all times. Combine that with the fact that you and your allies will be getting attacked constantly by enemies, and things can get hectic pretty quickly. To make matters worse, the camera isn’t locked to the application’s window. So, if you happen to be playing in windowed mode (like I was), and your cursor happens to drift outside of the game for a second or two by accident, the camera will end up showing you what’s going on about five miles to your left instead of what’s currently gnawing your kneecaps off.\n\nMultiplayer has some interesting class choices, ranging from your standard assault troopers with machine guns, to people who go around wielding flamethrowers, looking to make a quick barbeque dinner out of their enemies. It also seems to contain its own separate campaign missions, which is pretty cool.\n\nAt the time of writing, there are seven available game modes. Hardcore Mode spawns boss monsters randomly with each wave, and you gain a bit more XP with each kill. The Primary and Secondary Missions modes are the story missions for multiplayer. Fast Mode makes all of the enemies significantly faster, though slightly weaker. Red Storm mode reduces your armor over time, and you’re noticeably slower when not inside buildings. You also take more damage from bullets while inside buildings. You do get a nice chunk of extra XP for your trouble, though. With Swarm mode, you get a bit of zombie apocalypse thrown in with your alien infestation, as there are a LOT more zombies. Thankfully, they’re also slightly weaker than normal. Finally, there is the currently being worked on “Bunker” mode, where players must protect some sort of object known as the Orbital Beacon. There are two other modes, but they are currently greyed out, so I assume they’re not ready yet. For the sake of trying to explain what they might be, I’m just going to go off of what they’re described as in-game. “Random Waves” mode features “completely randomized waves based on pre-defined types of wave groups,” and “Point Capture” mode involves the players capturing a series of points inside the map by defending the points from oncoming waves of enemies.\n\nThere is also a nice levelling system implemented, with there being a maximum of 25 achievable ranks, complete with unlockable weapons and perks. As you gain higher ranks, the stats of your character also increase over time. Weapons are pretty standard as well for a sci-fi game. Machine guns, energy pulse rifles, flamethrowers, shotguns, grenade launchers. Nothing too out of the ordinary. You can also add small, but balanced power-ups to your characters fully customizable load-out, which allow you to do things like reload your weapon faster, make your armor stronger, or do more damage. On top of everything, the game also seems to hold future promises of a singleplayer campaign, which I think could be pretty interesting.\n\nAs for the sound, much like the graphics, there isn’t much to say. Guns go bang, aliens screech and growl. It’s all pretty standard stuff. The voice acting was also pretty average. One very minor complaint here, adjusting the volume levels in the settings seemed a little weird. You don’t actually hear any changes you make until AFTER you’ve saved and left the menu.\n\nPersonally, I found this game to be a little too run-of-the-mill for me. It’s by no means a bad game, but right now there really isn’t anything to it that makes it stand out from anything else to me. But, if this looks like a game you would be interested in, then by all means check it out. The Red Solstice is currently available for purchase on Steam for $19.99.\n\nhttp://wtbfun.com/the-red-solstice-an-early-look/","October 15, 2014","true","2.7"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","0"

You are part of a squad of marines have to complete missions and protect each other from alien hordes. There are different classes with their own perks and unlocks as you play through the game. However, it doesn't quite work at the moment. The objectives are not clear and a lot of players tend to play bunker, which seems to involve staying in one place and killing endless swarms of aliens. When you do get into fighting the inventory is difficult to navigate and it is not clear what the stuff does. The shooting seems to just involve selecting auto aim and reloading when needed.

So far I have been very pleasantly surprised about every aspect of the game.\n\nGraphics-wise it isn't the best, but it doesn't look so bad that it is unplayable. It isn't anything like modded Skyrim, but it has it's charms. There is in-game physics, though it doesn't affect gameplay. If your marine walks across something that should be "kickable" it will move. Kind of impressive in my own opinion.\n\nGameplay is where this game shines. It seems fairly straightforward at first, but I think it combines the best micro of a MOBA with the frantic pace of Left 4 Dead. There are times at the end of a game where you are running away in a panic as you are being pursued by far too many enemies to fight, but if you are smart and quick you may be able to pull off a victory. In addition the customization offered in character selection is surprisingly in depth. There are 8 distinct classes, plenty of weapons, different selectable abilities for each class, and small modifiers that make feeling your own particular play style out a necessity. Guides may offer a helpful nudge towards success, but ultimately you can play pretty much any way you want and still be successful, as long as you work well with your team.\n\nFinally the community. There aren't that many people online as of right now (July 14, 2015). One would think this might create a barrier to playing, but everyone seems super friendly and helpful. There are games starting up every 30 seconds or so, and while you may not have that many to choose from right now you shouldn't have any problems with a pickup game. In addition the dev team is very active with the community. My second night playing multiplayer I saw a game titled "dev game" or something like that. I hopped in not expecting much, but the damn main developer of the game was the host. He was consistently asking players if they were having any problems with a recent patch, and seemed to really care about making a game that was good, not just a game that will make a profit.\n\nAll in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone on Steam. Not just because it is fun, but because the people involved with it actually give a damn about making games. If you care about the PC gaming industry, this is the type of game you need to support.\n\n9.9/10 There is always room for improvement.","July 14, 2015","true","18.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have only played the MP mode, and the game shows a lot of replayability, intensity, and teamwork moments. In MP, you control a single marine (usually) as you complete random missions with teammates.\n\nThe point of the game is to complete as many missions and objectives as possible and then call for EVAC - before getting overrun. There can be up to 8 players in a single game, and each player can select the type of suit (class) and equipment they are taking on the mission. Classes range from Marksman, which is a sniper type of role, to Medics, Demolitions, Flamethrower, etc. The classes are varied, and have different upgrades which allows them to fulfill different roles.\n\nAnd that is what the game is all about - cooperation! As time goes on the enemy gets stronger and more numerous, supplies will run low, and people will start to die. Every moment becomes a tactical decision, and the smallest misstep can spell doom.  The enemy AI is not particularly clever, which is important because funnelling enemies into explosive death traps becomes very important, specially when you are facing one of the game's bosses.\n\nDeath is painful, because there is no respawns - except for new players. If you are not a new player (determined by some threshold of character XP), then you stay dead until a medic can revive you or a special mission ("Reinforcements") is completed by the team. (This mission becomes available about halfway through the game, and its availability by no means guarantees that you will be able to complete it!)\n\nThe graphics and sounds are mediocre at best, functional at least. The music is slightly better. They will not turn you away from the game, but the game wont win any awards for any of these.\n\nPlaying with friends is where its at - the game has a lot to explore, and that means a lot of death and discovery as you come to grips with the game. The game does have built in voice, and there is also a public TeamSpeak server which sees a lot of action. The community is friendly overall, and it is tight knight as is common with communities that form around hidden gems like this game.\n\nThere seems to be a good amount of replayability - first because the game is HARD, second because of how missions are randomized. There are I think 6 maps total, but everyone is still playing the first (and easiest!) of these. I actually thought at first that there was only one map and that it was randomly generated. And this is because the maps are very large, and there is so much going on, that it took a few days before I realized map is not random.\n\nI got the game 48 hours ago and have not been able to stop playing it. It is a real nail-biting experience, the cooperative aspects works really well, and the community is there to support it and help it grow.\n\n\nAll we need is you now!","July 15, 2015","true","27.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

After all, The Red Solstice is based off of games like Night of the Dead and Undead Assault II, which are some notable maps/mods for another game called Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne -- a title I've sunk more than 8 years of my time into.\n\nWith such a "veteran's perspective" on the genre, does The Red Solstice live up to the hype? In my opinion, yes, it actually does. The developers have succeeded in making an enjoyable game that stays faithful to the source material that inspired it, while doing plenty to make it stand out from the crowd. Let me just give you a short and sweet rundown on some of the core features that interested me:\n\n-----\n\n1.) A light system. Whether it be due to the titular storm that is the game's namesake, or simply that your mission takes place at night, every playable map in the game is cast in darkness, broken by streetlights, burning flares left by your team, fires from ignited fuel barrels, and interior lights that you have to reactivate by finding their central power stations in different buildings. If you are shooting at a target in dim or no light, you are penalized with a substantial chance for your bullet to miss and be wasted. If firing on enemies in bright light, like the brilliant radiance of a Flare Gun item, you can expect near-100% accuracy (if you're standing still and shooting).\n\nAnd sometimes? Sometimes, by random event or by a failed mission, the lights in your sector will go dark. That makes it a damn inconvenient time to have to fight off a wave of mutants threatening to chew your face off, because the lights emitted by your suit only extend a few meters in a circle around you. If the light isn't enough to make out enemies approaching you, all you will see in the shadows is rapidly-moving shapes, accentuated by guttural roars from the beasts who can track you like a lantern in a coal mine. Without adequate light, your ammo efficiency, accuracy, and overall combat effectiveness will drop like a lead brick.\n\n2.) A leader/officer system. At the start of the game, you get to designate a maximum of 2 players (from an 8-player squad) to be Leaders. These players get access to special key commands that let them set waypoints and routes for the team, which show up as bright yellow lines on the minimap that are easily followed. Leaders are also the only ones who can access certain game-changing items and features, like the Safety Zone, which is a beacon that calls down fresh ammo and supplies, as well as a sustained orbital artillery barrage in a circle around the beacon while leaving the beacon itself (and, hopefully, you) untouched. Thus, you won't have to worry about some trolling player activating a full-charge Safety Zone without the rest of their team, or running ahead and turning it on and getting the team killed by artillery.\n\n3.) Throwable explosive barrels. No, I am not kidding. Each player has the ability to right-click fuel or toxic material barrels, have their marine/character pick them up, and then hurl them about twenty meters wherever you left-click the mouse. This is AMAZING for area denial, as chucking a few barrels into a narrow corridor can wipe out hordes of zombies with the damage-over-time fire patches or toxin clouds they leave when they explode. Doing this does cost you 30 armor points (you start with ~100 but can get more), though, so you should make sure your shots count.\n\nNOTE:  There is a flamethrower-using class in this game that gets an ability which lets him use fuel and toxin barrels to provide ammo for his weapon. Not only that, it juices his flamer to where it now leaves the same clouds the exploding barrels do. xD\n\n4.) Dismountable turrets. Sentry turrets exist around the map, which you can either spend time activating one-by-one or, if you're lucky, find a central terminal that'll turn them all on. Once active you can "disarm" them (with the right tools/skills), turning them into a dismounted turret that you can then place virtually anywhere on the ground you please. So not only do you get to save turrets in a bad spot from certain destruction, you also get to use them to build your own defensive positions! ^^\n\n5.) A nice, streamlined explosives system. A good percentage of the items you'll find throughout a given game will be satchel charges, incendiaries, claymore mines, plasma bombs, and directional primer charges. In case you don't know what the latter is, it's a "leap bomb" that scatters a shotgun-like cone-shaped blast of high explosives in whatever direction it's pointed, which is helpfully indicated by red lines so you don't blow your team up by accident. Very lethal to tight groups charging down a narrow hallway.\n\nAnyway, the system. Many explosives in this game are external-source-only, which means you have to supply an initial explosion (like a grenade or rocket) to set them off. Some are radio-detonated, like satchel charges or the aforementioned directional primer charges, and need only a quick double-tap of the "G" key (by default) to set off. You can disarm most explosives at will if you need to move them or just don't want them anymore, as long as you have the right tools or skills available (the Demolitions class is the best at this). Since you really need the firepower of high explosives to have any real hope of surviving the late-game waves of tough enemies (I nearly got overrun even after dropping a tactical nuke on half a wave), it's really nice to have a system that demands so little micromanagement. You don't have to click the bomb or anything like you might in some other games.\n\n-----\n\nThe Red Solstice does have its own fair share of issues, like some wireframe-y animations on certain enemies when they attack, and poor or outright inaccurate documentation on weapons and abilities, but nothing that really turns me off or makes it so that it's chafing to play the game. I mean, I come from Warcraft 3, and that game is old as dirt by comparison to today's titles, so a few little things like that actually endear me to the game even more. The Red Solstice has a pretty respectable soundtrack, too, with solid themes all the way from the main menu to the combat suit selection screen to the final, desperate run for the evacuation dropship while the area is crawling with monsters at the end of the mission.\n\nAll in all? Yes, I think The Red Solstice might just be a winner. If you like fast-paced, run-and-gun squad-based gameplay, or want to feel like you're Space Marines from Warhammer 40k fighting off a Tyranid infestation, this will find a welcome home on your shelf.\n\nI give The Red Solstice a solid 8.5/10! The reason it's not higher is because the documentation for the game really is that bad -- they neglect to mention that the Precise Fire skill passively increases your movement speed, NOT your health regeneration, for example. I'm trying to fix that by editing the unofficial Red Solstice wiki, but in-game, you just kinda have to play for a while to figure this stuff out. Still, recommended!","January 8","true","79.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In mp you only control one character while giving simple follow/stay commands to rescued AI marines.\n\nIn single-player you utilize bullet-time pause to fully control squads.  You'll decide which characters to bring with you on a mission, outfit them, and level them.  The degree of replayability is high, since each character levels separetely, while belonging to one of eight classes.  You're encouraged to attempt missions with different class combos, which will completely change your tactics and playstyle - this keeps things fresh.\n\nTwo characters of the same class can be built differently by altering their stats, powerups, abilities and gear (all of which you find as loot during missions).  I have one assault character built as a speedy, evasive, melee expert, used for hit-run bombing alien spawn tunnels.  I have another specializing in grenade AOE support, and another as a pseudo-sniper marksman who holds the mid-line.\n\nSP feels a lot like Dawn of War 2's campaigns during realtime, but the slo-mo pause gives it a tactical X-com feel. You'll also get overrun and die easily even on normal difficulty, just like classic X-com.\n\nEven though you only control one character in MP, things are even hairier than they are in SP, since there's no pause. The easiest "recruit" difficulty will slaughter many players.  I just finished my first "recruit" difficulty multiplayer mission at 27h (though much of it was spent in single-player).\n\nI'm having a blast with it.","September 23, 2015","true","63.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Do I recommend it? **ck yeah!\n\nFirst things first, I still consider myself as a noob at this because I very rarely (if at all) play comparable games.\n\nTo me, the game was very overwhelming at first (in a bad way). I was confused by the fairly complex game mechanic and the very stiff learning curve. I didn't know what to do and when I learned what I had to do, I didn't know how.\n\nOn the one hand that might be because of my lack of experience with games like this and on the other hand because of the lack of a decent tutorial (which is an issue the devs want to work on). There is a small one but it does only explain the very basics. Further more you need a capable team.\n\nBut if you keep playing despite of that, you'll start enjoying this game a lot. You rank up in total and additionally with each class. Promotions in any of those two ranks unlock new gear, components (skills) and passive bonuses (Even if you do not win the map or finish all missions... or get to the emergency evac). I played only medic so far and didn't reached the highest rank with it yet, and there are about 8 classes to rank up with, so that keeps you motivated for a while if you are into stuff like that.\n\nOnce you learned about controls, enemies, missions, gear, friendly fire and classes you will become usefull for your team, which is great. It is fun to see your own progress and reaching higher waves and more difficult goals while getting better. And even if don't make it, you still made progress, because you earned xp and unlocked new stuff, which will make it easer the next time.\n\nOn the downside we have the fact of TRS being in early access, which means you will run into bugs every now and then. So far I didn't had any that were too troubling, nothing that can't be fixt or made me stop playing. The community is yet small. You may not always find regional game lobbies but I was always able to find some games in the global lobby. Also does the game not offer that much for graphic enthusiasts.\n\nBut as I said, I do recommend the game. After I got the hang of it I started to enjoy the helping, covering and healing, sharing of ammunition, in short: the teamwork.\n\nAnd despite of that, who is going to stop the horrors of mars, if not YOU(!)?\n\nI'm doing my part!

Do I recommend it? **ck yeah!\n\nFirst things first, I still consider myself as a noob at this because I very rarely (if at all) play comparable games.\n\nTo me, the game was very overwhelming at first (in a bad way). I was confused by the fairly complex game mechanic and the very stiff learning curve. I didn't know what to do and when I learned what I had to do, I didn't know how.\n\nOn the one hand that might be because of my lack of experience with games like this and on the other hand because of the lack of a decent tutorial (which is an issue the devs want to work on). There is a small one but it does only explain the very basics. Further more you need a capable team.\n\nBut if you keep playing despite of that, you'll start enjoying this game a lot. You rank up in total and additionally with each class. Promotions in any of those two ranks unlock new gear, components (skills) and passive bonuses (Even if you do not win the map or finish all missions... or get to the emergency evac). I played only medic so far and didn't reached the highest rank with it yet, and there are about 8 classes to rank up with, so that keeps you motivated for a while if you are into stuff like that.\n\nOnce you learned about controls, enemies, missions, gear, friendly fire and classes you will become usefull for your team, which is great. It is fun to see your own progress and reaching higher waves and more difficult goals while getting better. And even if don't make it, you still made progress, because you earned xp and unlocked new stuff, which will make it easer the next time.\n\nOn the downside we have the fact of TRS being in early access, which means you will run into bugs every now and then. So far I didn't had any that were too troubling, nothing that can't be fixt or made me stop playing. The community is yet small. You may not always find regional game lobbies but I was always able to find some games in the global lobby. Also does the game not offer that much for graphic enthusiasts.\n\nBut as I said, I do recommend the game. After I got the hang of it I started to enjoy the helping, covering and healing, sharing of ammunition, in short: the teamwork.\n\nAnd despite of that, who is going to stop the horrors of mars, if not YOU(!)?\n\nI'm doing my part! What about YOU? You wanna live forever?!","August 1, 2014","true","51.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Then I bought it on a sale..\n\nAnd after like half an hour of playing I realized that I have found something I have been looking for for many years.\nRemember Alien Swarm, Alien Breed, etc.? Ever felt like it would be nice to just shoot monsters in a sci-fi NON FPS setting? Have some co-op fun with friends or strangers?\n\nWell this is the answer.\n\nI have not played the spiritual predecessors. But man! It took me hours of playing and some reading to find out that this game is brilliant. A big map with lots of different enemies, loot, skills, character customization, quests, mini quests.. and all put together in a fitting frame. And at last it is challenging enough to keep you playing.\n\nDid I mention optional bots, followers, side quests, different game modes?\nTBH I expected less than half that it offers, and I could have settled for even less. I am still kinda surprised.\n\nDid I mention bosses? Or legendary item drops?\nPoint is that there is everything you ever wanted or found out for a game like this. And a lot more.\nDid I mention they are just testing to add a new weapon for more cutomization? And that there are more maps than I care to try. I didn't even expect to play on more than one since it is like a sandbox frame, the replayability is already there with that one single map.\nThere is only one downside.. not too many people. I manage to get full groups going in a few mins but still. Good thing it is fun to play with 2-3 ppl as well;) [Did I mention co-op Bots?]\n\nIt is the very best there is in the genre. If you are into this kind of game so much to ♥♥♥♥ yourself to read my review than you really should do yourself the favor and buy it.\nDid I mention that the community is strangely enough pretty good, and the learning curve is very rewarding even if you die a few times early in the game first?\n\n10/10 Have not seen anything near as good as this game since C64 that is comparable in terms of gameplay.","October 20, 2015","true","221.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

First of all, I don't recall playing a 8 players CO-OP in a long long time, so seeing a game that can accommodate a large group of friends together is almost an instant win.\n\nThis game reminds me to Starcraft, well basically you control some Marines, but the top-view camera really does a good job to bring Starcraft memories to my head. NO just that!! after a few minutes you will be immerse in a mix of Shadowgrounds/Aliens/Alien Swarm/Warhammer 4K... really really interesting.\nThe game require a lot of teamwork, since is really easy to get lost in the map and overrun by aliens, but the addition to marines classes helps a lot to maintain the troops alive.\n\nControls are something that you need to get use to it, but is not anything from the other world, so in a few games you will be able to control your marine movements and shoot without any issues.\nAlso there are perks and auto-aim that you can use, but everything comes with a cost, because you may need to sacrifice something in order to get that bonus. For example if you use Auto-aim for a few, during that time the character will move 20% slower. This is a really interesting aspect in the game, and make the customization of your character, before every mission, critical.\n\nI would recommend this game to anybody who loves games like Alien Swarm and enjoy tactical games.\n\nKAZ verdict:  7 out of 10","July 11, 2014","true","3.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

A serious example of making sure not to judge a book (game) by its cover (presentation)\nThe voice over during the beginning cutscene is atrocious and immediately puts the players expectations low\nThe complex user interface and menus are also off putting and require putting time into the tutorial to fully understand\nWhile the tactics keep the gameplay varied, the actual gunplay can get repetitive though this can be said of most shooters\nThat said, if you aren’t a fan of shooters this won’t change your mind or opinion\n\nCan you play it while the children are awake?\n\nThere is quite a lot of gun and other weapon-based violence. There, at least in my time with the game, is no profanity. I’d say it would be fine for children 8+, but that of course can vary depending on the child.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nThis is primarily a multiplayer game, so completing it is not an option. I did, however, put numerous hours into it.\n\nRedlight or Greenlight?\n\nThis game is currently at a greenlight.\n\nThe content that is currently offered is well worth the asking price of $19.99. In fact, the amount of content is beyond most shooters that currently available as completed titles. I will say that I was interested in this game due to the RPG and progression elements, but I am typically not a fan of shooters. The last statement of the cons rings true for me as this game did not change my poor opinion of shooters.

Personally I really enjoy this game when playing with a group of serious players on the hardest difficulty.\n\nIs this game for you?\nTo really enjoy this game, you need to be a team player. When you start playing, you need to listen to more experienced people and learn from them. This is not a game for you to run around trying to be a hero, you will die, and get people killed.\n\nThis game does have lots of little tips and tricks you learn that are the difference between clutching a victory on Soldier difficulty (2/4) and breezing a a win on Aetriden difficulty(4/4). The people running around in circles on autofire are the ones doomed to soldier forever, then they get made at the game for requiring they actually learn something to win.\n\nThe game is somewhat repetative, there are 6 maps, ranging in difficultly and layout, with more planned as free content expansions, none of this paid dlc stuff. There are two primary storylines that can spawn, and a dozen or so secondary missions that spawn randomly through out each play through, certain secondaries are locked until your are in a group that is higher rank as they are more difficult, such as the Eye of the Storm mission. However the replayability comes from this random element, as well as trying to beat the game's current most difficult map, Military sector on Aetriden difficulty, which has currently only been beaten once!\n\nSome people complain about the 'toxic' community on this game, well I believe I am one of those 'toxic' players apparently, because I require people in my games to be on teamspeak. The reason for this is simple, I play higher difficulty games and there is no time to type everything I need to tell you through out the game. Winning Veteran+ difficulty is extremely unlikely when not on teamspeak because not being able to hear the leaders instructions leads to small mistakes, which lead to deaths. As for the moderation of TS, I've seen 1 ban in the last 2 months, and that was someone trying to be disruptive and harassing the community.\n\nThe game has a few problems, desync is an issue sometimes, there are some other glitches too, however the developers are highly active within the community, to the point one is online on teamspeak almost every day listening to feedback, and if anyone is having any issues. Some bugs were creating in recent patches, and fixed almost immediately. Others have been around longer but are much more complicated issues that are hard to fix without breaking everything around it, or are inconsistent and difficult to replicate and pinpoint.\n\nAll in all, I'd give TRS an 8/10 as it stands right now, and that's trying to be highly critical of it. Most games I see coming out would be lucky to reach 6+. However, this game is not worth you buying it if you don't want to invest time and effort into learning it and getting good, you'll just end up out of pocket, upset and writing a bad review here or being an actual toxic player within the community. If you are willing to invest into this game however, endless hours of sweat, tears and laughter await you, just beware the levi in the bush!","August 6, 2015","true","246.6"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

You start by choosing one of eight customizable classes, and then their loadout, including their primary and secondary weapon, the ammunition type they fire, up to four active/passive abilities, and 3 perks. As you rank up, the amount of each of these interchangable things you can use increases. Once your set, you can join a match with your customized soldier, and drop with up to 8 squad mates.\n\nThe combat is fairly  simple. You move with right mouse click, and select targets and fire with the left. You can also allow your soldier to snap shot at targets automatically(aimbot) at the expense of accuracy. Your weapons use ammunition quickly, and unless you manage it carefully, you'll find yourself unarmed halfway through a match. Due to this, you have to scourage the environment for supplies, which you'll often find inside buildings, or on corpses. Once you find something, you can equip it into one of 6 item slots. The things you can find vary wildly, but they generally consist of explosives, medical supplies, ammunition, passive weapon upgrades, barricades, etc.\n\nThroughout this whole ordeal, you and your entire squad are trying to survive waves upon waves of hideous creatures trying to eat you, all the while trying to complete randomized objectives. At first glance this may seem fairly tame, but the enemy types vary wildly, from zombies, to giant bat demons, and they come from the darkness as the maps take place at night. To make matters worse, most often apply negative status effects to your soldiers. From bleeding wounds, bone fractures, and crippling toxins, you'll soon find yourself ravaged and left to die if you're not careful about patching yourself up and staying togethor with your teamates.\n\nAs for game modes, the title currently has a tutorial, and online play with up to 8 player coop.\n\nThe game is brutally difficult, even on the easier difficulties, but if you give it a shot, you'll find its highly addicting.\n\n","July 11, 2014","true","25.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

This is essenentially a squad based RTS game where you follow the story of Tyler  Hunt and some other marines to discover what happened to a colony on Mars. The story itself isn't what drew me in to really like this game though. I haven't even finished the story yet because I have been having such a good time just playing the multiplayer with the stellar community.\n\nNow I'v played the multiplayer for about 50 hours at this point and that is primarily playing as only one of seven classes available. In multiplayer you and 7 other members of your team work to complete missions and fight off hordes of monsters as you travel across a large map discovering what happened to Tyler Hunt and finding valuable loot to make you or your team stronger. Each multiplayer mission lasts about 40-50 minutes assuming your squad doesn't all die earlier in the mission.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you are looking for a co-op squad based RTS experience because the multiplayer is where this game really shines.","July 28, 2015","true","624.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I understand this game takes place in the future, so if im going to see things that are not in my line of sight atleast use a digi blue/red/green/yellow/white holo.\n\nCouple of things new players need to know\n\n1. movement is a right click firing is a left click\nsolution to this left handed playstyle, use your left hand you will make less errors less miss clicks (THERE IS NO OPTION TO CHANGE MOUSE CONTROLS IN THE SETTINGS), and will feel more intutive. Logic for this advise, well; movement is life and life is required (hunkering down isnt always an option). Shooting HELPS keep you alive. So play to what feels more intutive.\n\n2. mission 1 is a drawn out basic tutorial, it needs a crash course tutoral covering all of the controls before mission 1, SO THAT fine tuning of "how to use practiclly" becomes the focus.\n\nStill needs better rendering for graphics.\n\nWOULD I recommend this game after all that....

At first glance this may seem fairly tame, but the enemy types vary wildly, from zombies, to giant bat demons, and they come from the darkness as the maps take place at night. To make matters worse, most often apply negative status effects to your soldiers. From bleeding wounds, bone fractures, and crippling toxins, you'll soon find yourself ravaged and left to die if you're not careful about patching yourself up and staying togethor with your teamates.\n\nAs for game modes, the title currently has a tutorial, and online play with up to 8 player coop.\n\nThe game is brutally difficult, even on the easier difficulties, but if you give it a shot, you'll find its highly addicting.\n\n","July 11, 2014","true","25.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

If you're familiar with a little Blizzard mod called 'Night of the Dead' then you're instantly know this games style and genre.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=067Aviu67mU\n\nBasically it's a rock-hard 8 player co-op survival game set in the distant future. It's not a game for the faint-hearted as you will die a lot. I've never played NoTD so this was all new to me. It felt like an isometric Killing Floor, and we all know how awesome Killing Floor is!

The game has a top down perspective with a rotatable camera, and is played via hot keys and issuing move and shoot commands via the mouse.  It plays akin to some custom games from war 3, and is reminiscent in how it feels playing to some of the old action games of the past like gauntlet and the like.  This game is hyper focused on team work, while certain classes and loadouts can get by soloing for a bit, everyone ends up having to group for surival.  Managing your ammo, explosives, CDs, and working as a team are the keys to this game.  Failing at any of those means death.\n\nGame truly shines in multiplayer but the singleplayer isn't bad and helps you get used to the game via its tactical mode that lets your slow everything down.  Multiplayer of course doesn't use that though.\n\nThere are of course some negatives, the voice acting work in this game is really really bad, thankfully there isn't much of it.  There are also some poor ability descriptions leading to easy misunderstanding of how some things function.  There are also a few bugs (currently) that while not game breaking can be a slight annoyance.\n\nStill though I would reccomend picking this game up, its not an expensive game, and its certainly worth the cost for the hours you will get out of it.","July 16, 2015","true","85.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It pits you and up to 7 other Human controlled marines against hordes of the monstrosities created by the STROL virus. To survive and complete your objective you must work with your teamates,scavenging materials, making plans for the hectic closing moments of a match, and dispatching the various dangers you will encounter during your stay at Tharsis colony. A Typical match of The Red Solstice can last around an hour, so do not expect the typical drop in drop out style multiplayer that many games today utilize. keep this in mind when you put aside time to play the game.\n\nI would like to mention that this game is hard, and can be incredibly brutal at times. Excpect to die quite often as a new player, so don't feel put off by it, it happens to everyone. Despite the difficulty, failure still nets class and account experience for you rendering even a loss into meaningful progress of both in game XP as well as real life player skill. To help alleviate the difficulty for newcomers, a certain ammount of free automatic respawns are granted to players below a certain rank. Additionally, players seeking assistance can ask both the developers and the community for advice as this game has some of the most active devs and most helpful community members of any game I have ever played. The community has also prepared a variety of guides that cover almost every aspect of the game with an incredible ammount of detail, I highly recommend new players look over these.\n\nIn conclusion, The Red Solstice is a very unique, and very fun game. It offers a large ammount of replayabillity in the multiplayer modes and a good ammount of content aimed at those who prefer single player activities. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone willing to give it the modicum of patience required to learn its particular nuances.","July 16, 2015","true","128.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

It's a top down against all odds genre. Think Alien Swarm with RPG mechanics thrown into it. You get some pretty interesting "Weapons and class's to choose from"And the skills seem to have a designed sense of purpose not like alot of other games where you mash the keyboard when hell breaks lose and somehow you survive.\n\nThis game isnt that game you need to choose your kit wisely, and you also need to get familiar with the levels, tactics and your class what limitations are in place for each class and weapon to have a successful outcome.\n\nThe game is has a learning curve, but once you pick up the basics it keeps you locked in for a many hours. You do however want to be aware that since this game doesn't seem to have a huge following yet it is recommended you have friends play with you or buy the game as to be honest you can spend a bit of time waiting for matches.\n\nBut if you're like me and you have some note worthy friends who enjoy dying often then yes this game is for you.\n\nIs it worth 20$ i'd have to yes they update often and they developers stay true to the concept and are constantly balancing and tweaking various game mechanics to keep the game fun. Also they have some pretty interesting holiday events like SANTACLAWS?.","October 21, 2015","true","41.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Communication is the key to survival in this game using skype or teamspeak whatever you can, or if you have a leader that actually can lead the entire group by giving directions and having the team listen. Hopefully a public voice chat of some kind is included in the future.\nThe game offers at the moment one map with 2 different mode, the story mode with objectives and missions which are all randomized content where you'll want to complete as much as possible surviving on just one life  before you the timer which is about an hour hits 0 and your group gets overrun, also included is bunker mode where you'll defend a beacon and if it gets destroyed its game over however you can respawn every 30 seconds. The game also has 8 classes at the moment with a leveling system to unlock each one. Also each class has different abilities, skills, and weapons that you will want to use to your advantage. (as a group we've yet to beat the game yet lol but we are working on it)\n\nWhen starting up, players are introduced with a prologue  tutorial that teaches the player to the nice and clean interface along with how to use your abilities, levleing up, and your bread and butter skills which is flare, running, and autoaim. Very easy to learn if you have any hands on Rts at all.\nThere are plenty of destructable objects in the environments with plenty of stuff to loot, generators to turn on and enemies to gun down. The game also has friendly fire with certain skills and explosives  so be careful where you call those napalm strikes or blowing up certain things because you might accidently shoot your teamate down. You'll be required to work together with those skills and passives to work on turning on radar, disabling enemy artillery from insurgents, or killing boss infecteds while conserving ammo by looting and exploring  and doing your best to use all items to your advantage from mines to rockets, to even turrets you can turn on or place\n\nOther than that the bugs we discovered so far are not game breaking and the game plays pretty fun and solid for the time being. I found the game very exciting with a group of friends over teamspeak where we were trying to learn it and died to such dumb little things but this game is hard, REAL HARD even with the difficulty at easy so prepare yourself! We picked up plenty of pugs and had fun\n\n+ Massive hands on by the dev, Great interaction between dev and community\n+ This game isn't easy, I LOVE IT, prepare to get owned.\n+ Decent voice acting to give you the immersion and story of whats going on.\n+ Nicely done tutorial to introduce new players\n+ The gameplay is very fun especially when you have the right group\n+ A decent array of weapons and skills during set up phase (Need some polishing)\n+ Graphics is quite decent\n+  sound and music when you do hear it, gets you pumped for some of the action at the right time.\n+ A decent array of abilities for the classes that you can put points in during battle or reinvest.\n\n\n- Friendly Fire can be a dangerous thing, especially if someone goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and wants to wipe the entire group out lol. A rep system would be nice.\n- Not really game breaking bugs but just wanted to put it here they exist so game needs a bit polish\n- Needs some polishing on class skills and balance.\n- A nice tune during the game so that it isnt completely silent the entire game, not too loud though lol\n- More maps!, Other planets, underground facilities and open areas. Can't wait to see what you guys come up with\n- Public mic communication would be nice!\n- Some type of drop in the game system so others can join while game is in session perhaps?\n\n*Gameplay Videos - working on it*\n\n*Video review - Reserved till full game is released","July 11, 2014","true","3.9"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","0"

Overall, TRS is a solid top down tactical survial shooting game.\n\nDue to the "tactical" element and a steep learning curve, the best gaming experience you get from this game is the fruition of the ability to cooperate, adapt, follow and understand the "order" of the team leader (experienced vet).\n\nTRS is quiet unforgiving for rookies, so the willingness to learn and stick with the game is a necessity. In order to prevent the unfair random-kicking in multiplayer mode and the risk of losing game due to the lack of knowledge on game's mechanic, I wholeheartedly recommend everyone (intent to play---casually playing----intent to be a pro):\n\n-Try the single player mode (for the tutorial mainly). It has a pretty good storyline.\n\n-Read those "Everything" guides by Bonzai101, Valore and Grizzly. (You're gonna be surprised by the amount of knowledge you may learn/miss out). Check out those in-depths about classes and game mechanics (leadership).\n\n-Get TeamSpeak (an app similar to RaidCall). "Why", you asked? Well, the best way to learn a game is by playing it. And it's good to have somebody with experience to explain/help through the preparation and ingame if you decide to skip reading the guides. Mic is not required, vet only need you to listen and understand.\nThe code to the TRS community server is: ts.com-game.de\n\n+ Inevitably, there are good and bad players. Some will assist you, some just downright ignore or troll you to oblivion; but the majority of the player base will help you with welcome arms.\n\n-One last thing, invite your friend or introduce it to somebody closed to you. The biggest problem with TRS right now is lack of player. The community is too small at the moment.\n\nWell, That's all I have to say. I mostly play as Heavy Support, never get around to learn being a leader, cuz i enjoy being a slow-♥♥♥ supportive follower using a minigun to slow ♥♥♥♥ down and let people do the rest. And I'm still pretty "new"to the game, despite 100+ hrs clock-in.","December 8, 2015","true","131.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However if you have some patience and do get to jump into a game, you will play with some really great people.

We need only the red line, just to make it smooth.Why i have to hover right over the mob and only hit that 1 mob...so complicated. even if my bullet travels  the right way it wil not hit the mob unless the red dot is on him...FAIL design.\n\n\n-Who was the ♥♥♥♥♥♥/pyromaniac who suggested/designed the game around explosions to deal with high threat...this mechanic kills the purpose of basic general fun,tactics and classes in the game, guns/classes are underpowered etc...boring game and i heavily dislike explosions.I never play demo in any game its not my "class", I only like to fire up buildings, but not mobs and bosses its just not fun...instakilling a bigthreat less than 1 sec with stacked bombs... as main mechanic and forced even.\neven in singleplayer they did this,srly whats the point of classes in this game\nThis mechanic become worse in mp when i play with noobs, game forces veterans to play as "demo",collect explosives, or nuke down,otherwise u wont succed...\n\n---RED STORM: where is the storm guys..., its trademark basicly, even story speaks about it, but its not in the SP campaign lol, and in MP nobody plays it\nRed storm should be default and not a optional/disabled feature in MP.\nRed storm is fun and the way how this game should be played, balance/design the game around it\n\n-MP is waste of time without premade team, i cant even grind xp with randoms\nthere is a reason why coop games are 2-4 palyer coop, here we struggle with 8...\n\n-Unoptimized game,fps issues (visuals are outdated even)\n\n-nerfing the pistol was bad move\n\n-Add reconnect feature for mp pls\n\n-Readiness-remove this\n\n-mp with randoms is waste of time, u need premades, they even nerfed "easy xp" gain for short runs,pathetic\n\n-Stat gain by levels and unlocking: this just kills the game, not to mention how grindy/farm heavy this game is\ni hate it.This game is not mmo why u do this, its not a good idea to increase playtime/content by this, it cause opposite/negative effect.\nPairing this with a long and hard learning curve the game is absurd.when i already learn how to play etc.. i still need to grind and unlock things- i just want to play the game, not farm...\n\n\nSingleplayer:\nits basicly a long tutorial , but later on game picks up the "way" of true campaign feel.\n-cant control units in realtime, only the main marine is controlable in realtime, even if the main dies\n+Mission 7 and 10. Yes, this kind of gameplay what we need more, good job here\n-unskippable cutscenes-annoying\n-my team doesnt attack when they hold posiotion with F3-lolz\n-too much rely on slow motion/tactical mode\n+i like the story\n\noverall i like it, its brutal game, but its not that great now+heavily relies on playerbase\n\ni have 12 friends who has this game, but noone plays it since 2014 july/august, game either not for longterm or something went bad in early acces development...","July 20, 2014","false","217.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","3"

When I died it was due to friendly fire (are you kidding me) and I had to sit the entire rest of the round out until everyone else wiped. This game absolutely is geared towards gamers that are big into long, technical campaigns and that is totally cool it has it's place I just don't think it's for everyone.\n\nIt's still very much a pre-release title and maybe with some proper balancing and tweaks it could be more fun.\n\nI have a review of this game posted if you'd like to see it in action: (skip ahead to 4:26) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebYDFXDf3MY\n\nI was provided press access to The Red Solstice and was not compensated any other way for my review.

It involves a lot of teamplay and skill, however it may not look like it at first sight.\nThe game is about a marine squad that's exploring a planet, Mars (The Red Planet). And there they find out that there's an infestation going on, which probably is caused by a failed experiment, or succeeded one? Who knows?\nYou are in a team of up to 8 marines, trying to stop it, by either doing, missions, which are divided in a primary questline, and side quests. There are lots of waves, each wave obviously is stronger. You might just as well die, or run out of ammo? For that not to happen, you must also loot a little, since you can loot buildings etc, for ammo, medkits, and other random supplies. When you don't think you can survive any longer, you can get an evac, from on a certain wave (The wave at which it gets available is different for each difficulty). The evac is an item you can find on the map, and when you've got it you can activate it to evacuate, then you'll have to protect the person who activated it for 2 minutes, (he/she can move). When the 2 minutes are over the Dropship comes in for evacuation after another minute, but then you'll no longer have to protect the person who was calling the evac.\n\nI hope this review is helpfulish....

Considering the number of classes there are and there are like 10 ranks in each suit, that is a lot of grinding.\n\nVictory leads to 5k - 6k experience but if you're a new player that will come to you few and far between. And being that each game typically consumes 40 minutes or more, it will still take a considerable amount of time to max out the suit of your preference.\n\nRed Solstice CAN be fun, but the combat tends to be a little bit less entertaining than I was hoping for. I play with auto-targeting for the most part and that actually takes a lot of the fun out of the genre, but necessary, because manual targeting isn't effective enough to take out the swarming armies the AI decides to throw at you.\n\nGame has a tiny community, average at best. Multiiplayer games can take some time to fill (for a newish game).\n\nArt can be hit or miss (portraits). No major complaints, but there isn't enough emphasis on the "cool" element of manning state-of-the-art space marine body armor running around gunning or torching down alien zombies. I don't "feel" it. Far fetched hope that this will be fixed.\n","July 27, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It crashes every once in a while, the matchmaker is currently a tad instable but the developers made a game you want to play anyways.\n\nLike the Warhammer 40k feeling? Like Space Marines or "Starship Troopers"? Like a challenging game? Like Teamplay? Remember Alien Swarm, Alien Breed or Space Siege?\nThen TRS is most likely for you.\n\nYou:\n- get to choose from various classes and can save loadouts.\n- gain character and class experience.\n- you unlock classes, boosts, weapons and skills with your class level.\n- can take a few skills, a few boosts and various primary and secondary weapons with you on the battlefield.\n- loot tons of stuff on the map from barricades to nukes.\n- currently choose from multiple game settings, doing missions or bunker (defending a beacon) or mix it.\n- can command your squad with easy map commands.\n- die. mostly. either because the guy next to you felt it necessary to run with 10 ammo crates and watch you die out of ammo, or because you get blown up by team mates, or better yet, they deploy their drop-pods right on you :D\n\nOne note: There's no WSAD movement. It's click'n'run.\nAt first it felt odd, but once you got your awesome dude running you got to switch weapons and firing modes, throw flares, use your skills, drop satchels and blow them and whatnot.\nAfter some hours on the clock I feel it was a good choise not to use WSAD.

The objectives are strung along to frustrate players into hoping they have enough gear, ammo, and patience to withstand a non-negotiable 45 minute bullet spam session. While a nearly hour long bullet frenzy is usually the hallmark of excellence in a tactical isometric view shooter, The Red Solstace does not cater to objective based play styles.\n\nEach objective is given with a real world time frame, which enhances a strong narrative. Sadly the game does not support those players who head directly to each objective and accomplishes each task as the game asked. It is a game for a generation of video gamer who get distracted by shiny new things, who want to clear the entire map before moving to the next waypoint, and who don't care that the waves of monsters increase in difficulty as the time dwindles.\n\nThe Red Solstace becomes just another mindless shooter that ignores the very cool world that it tries to setup at the beginning of each mission. Run, shoot, survive should be the tagline - but instead it is more like meander, shoot, constantly fail because ♥♥♥♥ you. It does not care about how good a player is or how effectively and quickly a player may finish what the game asked it to do because it has another agenda as a moody shooter that wants to make a tactical horror shooter with scarce resources (while providing WAY too many resources).\n\nThe Red Solstace doesn't know what it wants to be. It struggles to be a game while also failing to provide an immersive story experience. It has a genuinely great random mission generation system that is a thin veneer of reasons to drag players across each map and hope they die later with each play through. The Red Solstace is, ultimately, a very well polished frustration engine that just wants your $20 and a few hours of your time so you can infect your friends' Steam Libraries with this awful piece of ♥♥♥♥.","September 24, 2015","false","20.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Not only that, but this felt like a reiteration of the game on a different engine, standalone, with a singleplayer campaign and a few nifty things added. There is the vision concept where its harder to shoot in the dark which is neat. The manual aiming was also neat with the bonus damage it gave, but was a little iffy in that you had to aim a little bit more up to compensate for the slightly angled top-down view.\n\nSadly, these things aren't enough to distinguish itself as a separate game, and in all honesty, I would rather refund this game and play the Starcraft 2 version where the character movements aren't as stiff.","July 14, 2015","false","25.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","2"

The main thing that I didn’t like was that most levels had equipment and weapons hidden in areas that would unlock them for future missions, and while looking for and finding them were fun, the design of maps didn’t work well for this.

It was a coincidence when I stumbled upon this EA on Steam. I've made some bad decisions concerning EA-Titles in the last couple of months, but luckily not with this one.\nAlthough the Game is quite hard and unforgiving, the Community isn't. The People playing this Game are eager to help you if you're new to it. I'd still recommend you to read a Guide, before you blow up your fellow Marines by accident (I assure you, it will happen anyhow ^^)\nIt still takes some time until you can get a full round with 8 People running, because there aren't that many players around. I hope the community will grow; the Game would deserve it. Sometimes there are occasional Framerate slowdowns, but it has gotten better.\nSo if you're fond of intense Bug-shooting mayhem and don't mind to learn and fulfill your part in a Squad, this might be just the Game for you.","July 23, 2015","true","22.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The Red Solstice has a steep learning curve for new players, and there is also a bit of a grind when coming to ranking up which essentially is just giving you a bonus to stats each time.  This game rewards good teamwork and punishes mercilessly bad teamwork.  They're plenty of in depth guides for new players and the community is pretty helpful in breaking you into the game.  I would advise having a teamspeak or something similar even if its just to listen due to the fast pace of this game.  You may notice at times desynch and bugs not gona lie it's nothing game breaking but it's defently noticable especially if you join a high ping host.  The player base has been revived so finding a match with others isn't nearly as hard plus it's got a single player now so waiting isn't really much of a problem anymore thankfully. That's not to say the playerbase won't leave in the future but for now it's doing well.\n\nAs for gameplay this game features 8 different classes each with their own unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. During the gameplay you gain energy which can power these different abilites making them more potent or unlocking new ones.  Six different maps to choose from and a myriad of different monsters and bosses all eagerly awaiting to chew your face off.  They're 4 diifferent main difficulties from Recruit to Aetridan with 8 different sub difficutlies to add with it. The objective of the co-op aspect is to survive 15 waves of hellish creatures all the while doing objectives and scavenging for items to use. At the end of the last wave you are to complete the last objective and then evac to the a certain point of the map, on average a game winning match will last around an hour.\n\nSo would i recommend this game... hell yes i would.   I had a great time with it and if you're willing to work with people it's one of the most rewarding experiences beating the game with others","July 24, 2015","true","566.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/recommended/265590/","deadjackfr","Deadjack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/","898 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor the moment i can't recommand this game for everybody.\n\nBecause...\n\nInstead of my last review [watch at the end of this one], i've won a game !\n\nThis is amazing how good it is. Especially if you loose around 20 times before it ^^\nIn fact the mission was different and, in my humble point of view, much better !\nAll the team was droped from a space ship near a beacon.\nIt must be protected until the end of a certain amount of enemy's waves.The beacon drops some supplies to help you in the battle, like sentry turrets, ammo and sand bags.\nAll the difficulty was to build the defenses, set up traps, protect sentries and for me, keep the other guys alive until the end of days that came on us.\nAnd we made it !\n\n\nI was a Medic as usual. After so much failures, i could start to upgrade my character.\nThe upgrade system is really cool, for each class you have a rank and defines how long you played this class, so the higher the better...\n\nSkills wich increase with levels: at the beginning too few, but with few levels... oh my ! That's so good to place a resurecting beacon during a hellish mission ! You can even call orbital drops to give stuff to your comrades or activate buffs to the whole team.\n\nYou have new weapons in two different types: primary and secondary. The primary weapons really changes your way to engage, as a Medic i can choose at high rank a sniper rifle, the basic weapon is a weak assault rifle. The secondary give you some shotguns and explosivs weapons like a rotary grenade launcher,ect..\nWeapons are different between each classe. Medic: assault rifles. Demolisher: explosivs. Recon: smg. Heavy: minigun, ect...\n\nYour armor can be upgraded with 4 slots to receive some "perks". A bit complicate to use because each perks increase a statistic of the character but reduce an other one. You want to run faster ?\nallright but you will have less damages done... quite nasty :'(\n\nAll of that is not too much to prepare yourself for the fire of the action.\nAnd this is really tought !\n\nAs i said before you gonna die a lot. But winning is very rewarding. Like some few rares games like Arma or Dark Soul.\nEnemies are quite numerous and very violent. Every creature has stats (you can see them when you hover your mouse on them). The special events happens quite often, and a good planning is really rewarding, like using explosivs to make chain reactions and take down a boss or a huge horde of creature in one blow. But when your team is splitting... in general you won't stand a chance.\nEvery classes needs skills to be mastered.\nAs a Medic i needed quite some time to understand how to get exp correctly (missions or the most common slaving monsters to get xp). Xp give you the opportunity to increase the level of the skills you have choosen (you can only have 4).  The skill level is lost between each mission.\nAnd like many games, maps needs time to be understood because hunker in a building and defending is really difficult. Especially with the light system that influence the line of sight of the team and the accuracy for shooting enemies.\n\nSo...\n\nThis game is really good but really hard too with unfriendly players that doesn't give a sh... of what you say in game.\nIt's a bit messy for now but with few updates... this is gonna be a gem !\nThe Red Solstice is nice and needs to be played with friends.\nAlone you gonna hate it.\nSo i recommand it for experienced player used to games really hardcore and ready to play with trusted fellow... for the others, wait a bit ^^.\n\n\n[Previous review: game not recommended]\n\n\nI was really disappointed. In the action you're just lost. You spend tons of time to search for gear in lockers. You always lack of something especially ammo. Shooting enemies is a pain in the ♥♥♥ especially due to the fact that firing in automatic mode is useless (automatic mode= your monkey see smtg he shoots. The problem, after 3 meters you miss all the time).\n\nThe objectives are ♥♥♥♥ed up. In fact you spend so much time in gearing that you can't see what you have to do.\nThere is no order in objectives or obvious triggers. You will have an AI which talks all the time and disturbs you by the same occasion.\n\nIn general in the game is like that (when you are a medic like me):\n\n-Clicking all the time on the screen to move sucks...\n-Shotgun ammo allready depleeed ?\n-Where is that dude? His health is dropping too fast, stop running away from the team damm it !\n-Why are we scavenging? There is a mission to do!\n-This auto aim sucks.\n-Please AI, shut your damm mouth!\n-Oh no! I've spent points in the wrong skill section...\n-This player is a bas... i doesn't want to give me some ammo.\n-More monsters. Where do they come from?\n-Ok righ... thanks for stealing the ammo I need!\n-WTF ?! We haven't done the objectives and we have to evac?!\n-It's crowed out here... I hope I will keep theses meat bags alive without ammo.\n-What he is doing?! The damm VIP is running into the danger!\n[Dead]\n-This boss sucks.\n-Thanks for the help guys!\n[Disconnected]\n\nSorry but for the moment we can't play correctly because there is no way to prepare the attack or talk in game. For a tactical game it's a bit difficult to accept.\nSo actually all games i've played failed, even in easy mode.\nI tried to do my best as a medic but seriously it doesn't appeal to take the role of support in this game. It seems more efficient to kill everything...\nAnd the controls are bad, moving should be with the keyboard.\n\n\nThere is a great potential but actually the game is unplayable.\n\n\nAnd if you don't like this review, well... thank you !\nBecause with your help other players will be completely wrong about this game.\nAnd it's not because of Early access. I've changed some of my reviews in front of the state of the game...","July 14, 2014","false","5.2"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","21","45","0","1"

This game is a peice of crap. If you are thinking about playing this game, realize that you will be playing it with yourself. Ive been checking it out on and off since day one, hoping that they will update or fix it, but half the time, the game wont even start.\n(July 13, 2004)\n\nState of the game; Promising, but unstable.\nThis game touches on alot of diffent genres, and alot of different gamers will find enjoyment in this game. Its a MOBA; Its an RTS (you must change tactics and think on the fly constantly); Its an RPG; Its got waves of monsters; It has persistant ranks and perks like some FPS games.\n\nPlay this game if you are patient with in-development games. Dont play it if a graphical UI bug ruins the whole game for you.\n\nAt this point, I can play for several hours with only a few crashes.

The random objectives & maps kept things fresh and unpredictable, though the difficulty is incredibly unbalanced in my opinion.  While matches supposedly can last up to an hour, I found myself dying within five minutes...mainly due to the "waves" growing in difficulty at a ridiculous rate.  Eight different classes and the ability to level up/gain xp help to make up for that, though.  It needs some more work (obviously), but I'd be interested to see how the final product looks once the game goes live.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMaIwiB1iHw","July 10, 2014","true","3.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I bought this game because I saw on Steam it had pretty good reviews and after watching some gameplay videos, I wanted to try it out. When I get into the game, the setting were not the optimal settings I wanted. I changed them and had to reset my game. I did that and now the mouse cursor was way off point. I decided to go on the discussion forums for this and see if anyone could help. When I did that, they had a section for bugs and other problems and they were LOADED with pages of bugs people were reporting. I understand it's still in the process of being made but wow, it was a lot. I posted about my problem. I even tried doing other things that people posted on different forums but nothing worked. The dev. replied back "You probably changed your resolution to bigger ratio your monitor doesn't support it, we'll be fixing this very soon. In the meantime go to users\local\theredsolstice and change settings.ini there to fix the problem." My resolution is set to my optimal screen resolution which is 1920x1080 so that can't be the problem. I tried another time going into the hard drive settings. It says 1280x720 and go into game and still 1920x1080. The game is unplayable for me. I feel like I lost $20. This is my first Steam review but I feel like this needed to be noted. If you're looking into buying this now, I'd wait till they seem to get everything under control.","October 27, 2014","false","0.2"," 17 of 47 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","17","47","0","1"

Balance wise, and more. This has potential, but I don't think they will ever change it. Another note. Even after the fixes, there are certain bugs that still hit a large majority of people. I for instance, can play this game, and every once and a blue moon, all the models actually load in. But generally, I am shooting air. Several people in the gorup I play with, suffer this same issue. This was recently tested again. All of us, more than meet the minimum requirments. This game is just poorly optimized, as of yet. If this game ever fixes these major issues, it may be worth picking up.\n\n\nUpdate 8/3/2015:  While I haven't had a chance to play through to much of it, it has definitely improved on a lot of little things, which actually make a big difference. Better yet, the game is working, and most of the major compadability issues everyone I knew had for the entirety of the beta, are now fixed. As the game is now, I would definitely recomend it. If you like these types of games, you'll probably like this one.  Admitedly, there are a few things I prefer about the Starcraft and Warcraft maps, such as the recon and marksman class, but, overall, this is a nice new twist, and I've played the other maps to death.\n\nIf you are worried about an unfinished game, have no worries. Everything felt rather complete, and the single player campaign is really well done, including having special features specifically made for the campaign alone that make the game something of a charm. Such as the tactical combat. An interface that slows down time, and allows you to control your entire squad individually. I was wondering how they were going to handle the lack of fellow players with AI, and they nailed it.\n\nTruthfully, some of the people online in the community are a bit sour, but there are also some nice, friendly people, just looking to have fun. Also, probably one of the better games to play with a group of friends.","December 5, 2014","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

There are some annoyances and the game is probably not worth 20€ but overall the game seems to be solid in design and nothing really feels half-arsed. In single player the 'bots' helping you park their arses to hold their ground a bit too eagerly and in some situations that is quite bad indeed, but at least they do not wander off and generally speaking they follow orders just fine. I think there is room for expansion in this game to many directions but that is a different story. This game is missing some flaws I would expect in a game like this and that is a good thing. But as noted, the 20€ price may be a tad high especially if you are playing alone.","June 3","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
