What music they make!"Dracula (1931)\n\nBloodRayne Round 2 - Fight!\nThe Combat-System of Bloodrayne 2 doesn't looks different as BloodRayne 1. Oldschool Hack & Slay and everywhere is blood. You have your typical bladed weapons but unlike part 1 you have only one firearm which has multiple firing modes and thus mimics several weapons. With your harpoon you sometimes have to finish mini-games to get further, by catapult opponents somewhere which can be really annoying. Special skills from part 1 still exist and help you again in the fight against different types of opponents. Unlike part 1 of the BloodRayne-saga, Bloodrayne 2 has some acrobatic parts like Prince of Persia where you jump from pole to pole. The checkpoint-system isn't so annoying as BloodRayne 1. Here you have special checkpoints in every level, so you don't have to repeat the whole level, only the part where you die. The graphic of Bloodrayne 2 looks ok for such a old game, at least better than part 1.\n\nTo bring it to the point: As cool as BloodRayne. 7,5/10\n\nIn summary:\nPro        Contra                + has still its sexy main character        - annoying harpoon mini-game                + Checkpoint-System                + still funny                + still bloody\n\nPS: I just wanted to write a short review, which brings the essence of the game to the point. I hope it will help you in your decision.","November 8, 2014","true","4.3"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","34","36","0","4"

The game is playable and fun for what it could be, but I just wish Platinum Games could buy the license for this or something and remake it into what it's supposed to be. So play the demo first before getting it. I got it for $2 and it's not a bad price to pay for what you get.\n\nThe controls are atrocious. It can be really annoying to jump on the platforms and throw enemies at objects at places where the game wants you to open doors and stuff. And most importantly, there is no way to set up a controller with less than 15  buttons (excluding the triggers) to play with this. I used Xpadder to use the triggers as  buttons and not as the z-axis.\n\nThere's also a lot of bugs that are encountered at a rate of 1-2 per hour of continuous playing. None game-breaking so far; they're just funny.\n\n\nWhat's wrong with the game:\n-Animations are just horrible.\n-Controls.\n-Blade attacks are slow.\n-Moves, apart from the feeding fatalities, are so unimaginative.\n\nWhat's good:\n-Rayne's attitude and the dialogue (not the acting though).\n-The gothic theme.\n-Enemies are dismembered as the blades hit them at the right places (happens often).\n-Blood sucking and its creative fatalities/finishers.\n\nAgain, it's such a shame that this game can't be remade by a more capable development team. Such a shame.\n\nUPDATE after finishing the game:\n-3-5 game-breaking bugs encountered, as in you have to retry so that you can proceed with the mission.\n-The gothic theme only lasts for the first mission.","June 18, 2015","true","16.5"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MercyAustralis/recommended/3820/","MercyAustralis","Claire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MercyAustralis/","383 products in account","I had a lot of fun playing through BloodRayne 2. I remember playing the demo in the early 2000s when at the time this was one of the most demanding games on the PC. It was nice to finally play through the game past my memories of the demo stage! Despite being a dated DX8 engine, modders have released an "HD patch" for it that lets you set custom resolutions, increasing resolutions of the textures and even installing some HD ones. Besides some minor glitches in widescreen, the game looks great when applied.\n\nThe gameplay feels very "2000s action game" when every game was abusing slow motion with fast-paced action. The vampire twist is what makes it interesting, as your health is solely dictated by drinking the blood of your foes, including all your guns which are "reloaded" the same way. The game is very violent, with decapitations, impalement, burning, etc. Story is spoon-fed to you as you go along, with a few pretty FMV sequences thrown in to highlight major plot points. The combat is fairly simplistic, though the developers tried to liven it up by adding a "combo" system depending on the sequence of buttons placed in addition to directionals. The game also heavily uses the environment as a means to the combat flow, requiring you to launch enemies into environmental hazards in what otherwise would be endless enemies to progress the game. The game also contains some basic platforming, but nothing overly challenging or frustrating.\n\nDifficulty wise, the game is easy, especially once you learn to abuse dodge in combination with your "blood rage" which essentially gives you infinite health and damage instead drains your blood rage meter. Replay value is also low with completion of the game just unlocking new costumes for Rayne. The game is by no means amazing and even for its time would be considered a typical action game, though Rayne's character and personality, as well as the gothic and vampire lore is enough for me to give it a recommendation!\n","June 27, 2014","true","9.5"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/3820/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","After an agonizing wait BloodRayne 2 has made the move from console to PC and the end results are somewhat of a mixed bag. For those who are out of the loop, BloodRayne is the sexy vampire agent who works for Brimstone Society. Just think Lara Croft with fangs and a sexier wardrobe. BloodRayne 2 wisely adopts the traditional gothic stylings that make vampire lore so cool, taking us well beyond the 1935 WWII setting of the original game. Set in current times or perhaps a near-future, Bloodrayne, being a dhampir (half human, half vampire), is still going strong in a more modern setting.\n\nBorn of a vampire and a human unholy union, BloodRayne declared war on her evil father Kagan, a Nazi collaborator. With his death, her siblings maintained Kagan's legacy, keeping evil in the family business, which culminates in their greatest scheme of world domination; The Shroud, a massive shield made up of millions of gallons of blood harvested from the homeless.\n\nThe game opens with the obligatory training level set at a fancy dinner party where Rayne gets to flex her bloodletting skills while wearing the latest in evening gown fashion. Not only does this show off the dynamic cloth modeling, but we also get ample leg and thigh exposure.\n\nThe console version of BloodRayne 2 had some of the best and most intuitive controls of any action game to date. It took less than an hour to master the controls and you were killing with maximum grace and style. While the PC version offers support for a gamepad, the camera control sucks with only vertical movement. Using a keyboard and mouse restores full camera control and you are free to map the limited controls to any keys you wish, but something just doesn't feel right when playing with a mouse and keyboard, and it certainly doesn't feel right with the gamepad.\n\nWhile not an RPG in any traditional sense, players do get to upgrade their character by finding different weapons like the Carpathian Dragons, which apparently focus vampiric energy into actual deadly projectiles. Unfortunately, these guns don't seem to have much of an affect whatsoever against enemies, so you'll most likely rely on your trusty blades and harpoon for a majority of the fighting.\n\nTake a look at the in-game move list and you will see dozens of different combos and moves available to our sexy little Dhampir. But while the list is long, and sports exciting names like Rising Thorn and Sinistral Bloom, in the heat of combat they all sort of look the same after a while, especially when your main tactic against bosses becomes dodge-and-attack, dodge-and-attack, blah-blah-blah. This takes the wind out of the sails of the whole experience system that rewards players with bonuses for especially fancy moves and attacks.\n\nAlthough where you really get some sense of satisfaction is in the finishing moves and fatalities that Rayne dishes out like a heavily armed, psychotic gymnast. And I mean fatalities. There's so much dismemberment happening on a regular basis you start to crave it, which is as disturbing as it is satisfying.\n\nAs if the hand-to-hand combat weren't interesting enough, Rayne also obtains various dark gifts that give her even more of an edge against her enemies. There's the Blood Fury mode that increases both offensive and defensive powers, a time affecting mode that slows everyone else down while you whip around them like a tweaker with a set of Ginsu knives, a Ghost Feed mode that lets you suck blood from a distance, and a revamped Aura Vision that reveals important hidden portals, even from other rooms and floors. While these modes could've been left out, they do add a nice visual flair that's hard to ignore.\n\nLevel design is fantastic with plenty of interesting locations full of gothic details and unique designs, many of which are obvious setups for the numerous arena-style battles you will find yourself fighting. There seems to be an abundant source of sharp objects lying around waiting to skewer a vampire.\n\nCharacter designs are excellent with some amazing animation that is fluid and lifelike. Even in death, the rag doll physics are eerily realistic. Special effects are in full use with rich lighting and shadows, reflections, volumetric fogging and plenty of particle effects. Shadows are particularly important since Rayne must avoid direct sunlight on some of the outdoor levels.\n\nThe music ran from interesting and appropriate to some annoying heavy metal combat music. It's not terrible, but it could have been better. The music that scores the cutscenes was excellent while most of the gameplay soundtrack is forgettable. Sound options allow you to tweak all the various sound levels, so you can tune this out if you want.\n\nSound effects kick ♥♥♥ even though most of the time you will hear the metallic whine of your harpoon followed immediately by the sickly wet crunch of an impaled target or the splatter noise of a dismembered body and the splash of a few gallons of blood as it paints the walls and floors.\n\nSpeech is phenomenal with great performance by all the leads and most of the supporting cast. There were a few bosses with some B-grade readings, but the banter between Rayne and her handler set the perfect tone for the game.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty easy for the most part with the only real challenges coming from the sub-bosses and end-level bosses. The game has a tendency to give away a lot of the solutions to the environmental puzzles through cutscenes, so you know you are supposed to toss bad guys into the garbage masher or drop a chunk of wall on them.\n\nIn the end, BloodRayne 2 provides a viscerally enjoyable experience pretty much from beginning to end. The game certainly has its blemishes, and it's definitely not the deepest or headiest action title you'll ever experience, but underneath those problems is a stylish and gory action game with enough kills and thrills to keep you entertained. If you were a proponent of the original BloodRayne, or if you're even just a fan of good old-fashioned stylish action games, BloodRayne 2 is worth checking out.","November 28, 2015","true","8.5"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","25","32","2","1"

Its possible to milk an enemy for more than one "resource" but youll never get equal shares - draining them for mostly health means less ammo or rage and vice versa, introduces a somewhat tactical element\n\nIt suffers from the same technical problems as BR1 (controller setup, glitches if the systems too fast), can be fixed in the same way tho. Unfortunately it doesnt give a good first impression. The starting cutscenes are obviously the ones with the lower budget and the first/tutorial level is the worst of the game (imo). It gets better quick.","December 24, 2014","true","11.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","17","18","3","0"

But my penchant for vampires in film and games won out. This game was made before vampires became pansies, and the character player, Rayne, shows this by being what you'd expect. She cuts people apart, and seems to try and appear as sexual as possible.\n\nI can't say much for the plot, it's -very- generic, and the environments get old very quickly. The abilites are alot of fun to use, i personally favored those abilites which altered the perception of time. The rank three of such abilites is drastically overpowered, but alot of fun.\n\nEnemies serve as healthpacks, Rayne can latch on and drain their blood to heal herself, and she's got a large amount of dodges and flips in her arsenal. You'll never get anything more than guns and blades, but these can be sufficently amusing.\n\nThe main issue with Bloodrayne 2, is the camerawork. It is TERRIBLE, and can/will get you killed due to some sadistic edge the developers had. My using a 360 control fixed this, but not everyone would have that choice.\n\nThis game isnt amazing, it's old style generic, and we really lack this kind of game in the current day. It's fun mostly due to nostalgia, and the sensation of playing something different to the standard War FPS.","March 16, 2013","true","11.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

First of all, the cut scenes don't work. I had to watch them all on youtube. Secondly, the game freezes, constantly. Every time you use the menu, the game freezes and you have to wait. Thankfully, if you wait, the game does go back and doesn't crash as it looks. I restarted the game several times thinking that. I couldn't of beaten the game without using god mode 3 times. Also the puzzles are all the same. You grab people with the chain, and throw them into something. Its cool the first few times, but after awhile, it gets ridiculous. Also the boss fights are a bit lack luster. The guns are absolutely useless because eating people is so much easier and everything requires blood. The worst part is the platforming. The platforming is absolute garbage! It is next to imposable to use it sometimes and it doesn't help your getting shot at while doing it. The pro's to this game? Well, the story is really good and this game has some of the best voice acting for the main character. Also some of the minions have some pretty hilarious dialogue. On a game system, this game was probably great but on computer, it sucks. So, don't play this game here. Heck, Bloodrayne 1 doesn't even work on steam.

Well, I had this game for my old X-Box. Felt I needed to get a copy for my pc for old times sake. Do I like it....kinda. Lets face it for a game like this you need to have a controller. Do I have one... no! Stupid me. There are so many move combo's that it is a real b*$%^ to play on the Pc with a keyboard and mouse. IS it possible... yes. For me not so much.\n\nAbout the game. It's an old X-Box game so keep that in mind (they did release a pc version as well which this must be it). I think if you can bare that in mind when it comes to mechanics and graphics you will probably enjoy this game. There is no complex puzzles here, Some are frustrating to complete yes. If you have a controller that will work with the game it should be a lot of fun in that old hack and slash way.\n\nBottom line... Are you old enough to remember playing BloodRayne? Then you should probably get this. It does bring back some good memorys.\nDo you love vampire games... then yea I would pick it up cause you will probably enjoy it.\nNot so sure or don't have a controller.... then you should probably wait for it to go on sale. Just in case you don't like it or cannot do well with the mouse and keyboard.\n\n\nHave fun sucking those goth girls (and for you ladies the goth guys) dry.\n\nOh and you gotta do the finishers before thier dead..... good stuff.","April 22, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s nice to see her again but the experience was rather frustrating.\n\nAt the ground level BR2 looks a lot better than the first game did, there are major graphical improvements and the game looks quite nice, although you are unable to go above 1600 x 1200 resolution and there are no AA options which detract from the overall experience. When I first played it in 2005 I didn’t care about the AA options or about the resolution cap as I only had a 1280 X 1024 screen.\n\nThe game play hasn’t really changed very much from the first game. As Rayne you hunt vampires and minions who serve your “father” Kagan and Rayne has been hunting them for a long time. The same dismemberment features from the first game return, and there is a lot more blood and effects as well as new finishers. The game has completely removed all other weapons and now only allows you to use a particular set of bullets that are all blood related and can only be used in a single specific gun. The limited amount of ammo you can carry makes them pretty much useless although they are required for certain boss fights.\n\nAlthough the game is pretty…the grappling hook/grapple shot was obviously not intended for mouse and keyboard. Trying to aim the hook after you have latched onto an enemy is a very tricky process and often results in death. This is especially frustrating when some of the bosses need enemies to be tossed at particular locations in order to damage the boss, and you often have to toss enemies into machines or places in order to proceed in the level (the game doesn’t tell you that you have to throw enemies in there so it can be quite confusing sometimes). You have a rage meter which is necessary to enable the super powers that Rayne gains after defeating enemies. Only a few of them are really useful and the rest can be hard to remember how to use. Defeating enemies helps power her up and increases the life and rage meter allowing you to survive longer. Some of the fights really boil down to just luck and timing.\n\nWhile it is nice to see Rayne again, and there are considerable improvements in the graphics and physics…the camera works against you usually and when you combine that with the poor accuracy of the grappling hook things can get very difficult. Once again the game can be very repetitive so you’d better like cheesy dialogue and listening to the same conversations over and over each time you die. If you loved the first Bloodrayne and desperately want more Rayne then definitely pick this up, but while it has aged fairly well the controls on the PC port have not.\n\nMaybe take a look at the PS2 version and see if the handling is any better.\n\nSo to sum up…more redhead, more blades, more blood, and a really frustrating hook/camera. I suppose it’s also a classic now so If you like vampires and hack and slash check this out when it’s on sale.","November 8, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is enough to bring the worst out of someone playing like myself, especially after struggling to defeat the first boss in the first level.\n\nIn short, don't buy this game if you're in the mood for frustrations.

This game is just... It's a nostalgia trip back from when vampires were actually creepy, gothic creatures of the night. Lurking in the dark corners of the earth... *wink*, *wink*. However, seeing how this is a 10 year old game, some parts of it don't quite hold up nowadays.\n\nIn BloodRayne 2, you once again take the role of Rayne, a dhampir set to destroy the rest of her father Kagan's offspring, and her half-siblings, that have formed "The Cult of Kagan" and are trying to make it so, that vampires are once and forever able to walk the street during daylight, by using "The Shroud", a substance rendering the sun rays harmless to vampires, thus creating a new era of vampiric supremacy in the process.\n\nCombat in BloodRayne 2, as the name suggests, is bloody great fun! You've got Rayne slicing and dicing everyone and everything, with body parts flying everywhere! Besides from the iconic dual blades, Rayne can kick, dodge around, has a pair of blood dragon pistols and poseses an aray of abilities, including drinking the blood of her enemies. Rayne is faced with fighting various enemies. From Marilyn Manson look-alike goons to gone wrong vampire experiments. The controls play well for the most part, they're standard for a third-person hack'n slash game, but some false targeting and the awful camera can at times ruin the experience.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is at all time complimented by its graphics. After applying the mandatory HD Texture/ Widescreen patch BloodRayne 2 just shines... The varied levels, from a night club to a meatpacking factory, show off the game's artstyle. The simple ragdoll physics and prerendered cutscenes, typical for the time, are also featured.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game can be heard throughout the story. It varies from classical piano melodies to 2000s techno music. The different compositions can really set the mood and are reminiscent of the Hitman:Contracts soundtrack.\n\nOverall BloodRayne 2, similar to its predecessor, was and still is pretty good for its time. Although it does not completely hold up today, you should still give it a try, just for the memorable concept. However... if you are planning on getting it, expect to have to deal with a handful of problems. BloodRayne 2 has never been meant to be played on newer systems, and not all workaround methods do the proper job of fixing this game!

Some of the fights really boil down to just luck and timing.\n\nWhile it is nice to see Rayne again, and there are considerable improvements in the graphics and physics…the camera works against you usually and when you combine that with the poor accuracy of the grappling hook things can get very difficult. Once again the game can be very repetitive so you’d better like cheesy dialogue and listening to the same conversations over and over each time you die. If you loved the first Bloodrayne and desperately want more Rayne then definitely pick this up, but while it has aged fairly well the controls on the PC port have not.\n\nMaybe take a look at the PS2 version and see if the handling is any better.\n\nSo to sum up…more redhead, more blades, more blood, and a really frustrating hook/camera. I suppose it’s also a classic now so If you like vampires and hack and slash check this out when it’s on sale.","November 8, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty much 100% of the game is combat and platforming but both are enjoyable enough to keep you entertained .If you like bloody gore and cuting of limbs of helpless enemies this game has more than several ways to please you  .\n\nThere are different skills you need to utilizy to find certain objectives but in terms of puzzles there is nothing that stands out as hard or thought provoking .\n\nIf nothing else this game is held up by Rayne herself with her sexy grabs that are deadly to her enemies and yet may make you a little hot .\n\nThe story revolves around getting revange which always seems to be a rewarding experiance as you will meet and kill those who taunt you . Cutscenes and cinematics are pretty cool and will keep you hooked .\n\nThere are some strange leveling mechanics that I did no like . You will need to to thraw enemies using hook to level up your life which is odd way to get stronger .\n\nLike most games that focus mainly on combat it may get a little boring by the end but this just reminds me the kind of arcade like style where you kill enemies and move to the next area .","September 25, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
