In a world where you can't even change your graphics quality, players assume the role of a fantasy hero and play out their life long dreams of being anime characters; desu-desu. Regular bug fixes, rehashed events, and more than 115 levels of doing the same thing over and over again with hundreds of hours of gameplay (thousands if you don't buy $500 worth of microtransactions) await you!\n\nHaving a hard time hitting that next level? Well don't worry we got 150% EXP Boosters there for you. This allows you to level up twice as fast! Now it'll only take 15 gameplay hours to go from 80-81!\n\nDrop rate boosts are also available so you don't have to spend 10 hours killing the same Great Goblin King over and over for a chance at that rare item!\n\nLets not forget mounts! Even you can run around at the speed of sound with these guys! (Food for the mounts must be bought separately from the cash shop)\n\nWho wants charms? These charms let you wreck any other player or monster in this game easily. Build a full physical damage Mage and still kill kiddies with your 200% boosted stats.\n\nCan't enchant your item because there's a 90% chance of it breaking and going away forever? Buy some ENCHANT BREAKING PROTECTION. Want to upgrade the chance of the item actually upgrading? Buy some UPGRADE CHANCE FOR UPGRADING stones. Want to upgrade the upgrade amount per upgrade? Buy some more unfair ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEither spend your life playing this to get better or pay to improve instantly. If you don't believe me on how much of a big deal this game's in-game cash shop is, try it out for yourself. Hell I played this for 3 years and thought it was great, then I graduated elementary school and got a PC.\n\nR.I.P.\nAka_Ryu guild (Bijou server)","May 20, 2014","false","0.3"," 662 of 785 people (84%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","84","662","785","16","35"

I remember loving this game and spending hours and hours online with a  community that was actually a joy to be apart of. One day, I just stopped playing Fiesta, and moved on with other games.\n\nWhen I saw that Fiesta had found its way to steam, I was surprised to see it was still alive. I'm not sure how its still around, considering how bland and repetitive it is. It's your typical Korean mmo grind fest with an uninspired tab targeting combat system and a pay 2 win cashshop.\n\nI guess the only thing that would keep someone around would be the community. Its a shame there isn't one anymore. The game feels dead and empty.  At one point in time, areas that would be bustling with activity and parties  are now nothing more than barren maps with the occasional mob of enemies here or there. From what Ive seen, the towns are dead, say for the few newcomers who downloaded the game out of curiosity. I can only assume the sight of an empty starting town won't keep them playing for very long.\n\nFiesta kind of reminds me of the world in Dark Souls.

I played this game in it's first few years, 2007-2010, and it was great.. I made lots of online friends (many of which i still keep in touch and/or play other games with) and generally had a really good time. The game itself is a generic mmo with rather simple mechanics, it's essentially a beginner's MMO... but of course that's not what made Fiesta fun, what made it fun was the social aspect.. unless you make friends and join a guild you ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE FUN, this game isn't for "lone wolfs" that are just looking to play a game and level up because it gets extremely tedious.\nI downloaded this game again after seeing it on Steam while mindlessly browsing in order to see how much it has changed and damn, has it changed. This game is now just a shadow of the shell of what it used to be..that's right, it's not even just a shell of it's former self, it's the shadow of it's shell... the reason being, there's very few people playing and even fewer new players getting into the game, it's currently Friday night and the server populations are all on Low.... It's mostly just populated by a handful of true newbies that in all likelyhood won't make it past level 50 and the rest are veteran gamers that have sunk way too much time and/or money to quit, which is made evident by the high number of not only high level characters but also mid to low level characters with +9 - +11 gear whom are most likely just alts belonging to veterans. I looked around the low level maps and saw only a few people doing quests, all of them by themselves of course.. Roumen to Uruga ( they're the maps for levels 1 to 60 ), checked all the maps in between and didn't see more than 10 people, none of them were in parties/groups.. just solo'ing. If you look at the screenshot of a group of players above, that's pretty all the people you'll see in Elderine which is the main vendor map...half of those people will most likely be AFK though, so you'll only see around 20 active players in that main city map.\n\nSo in short, don't bother playing this game.. I imagine it won't be around for another year or two.\n*sigh* it really was nostalgic running through the maps though, almost brought a tear to my eye remembering all the good times I had with my old guildmates.. all the fun, drama, and plain old silliness.\nBijou, Angel_Assassins and Rye <3 ^-^","October 4, 2014","false","1.2"," 98 of 125 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","98","125","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EMDream/recommended/300970/","EMDream","EMDream","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EMDream/","111 products in account","I'll start by saying I played this game years ago from 2007-2009 that was the time to play the game. Every server had lots of people and economy was thriving and was a great time to play the game.\n\nAlso, I played more than 27 hours I found that steam makes this game crash so I downloaded the client from the Gamigo website.\n\nThis game is dead now has been for some time I heard about a server merge and figured I'd download it and check it out. They just merged the servers into 4 new servers so it's just like when I started 4 servers. When I left the game in 2009 they had 6 servers I don't know if there were more added between 2009-2015. They would have to merge the 4 servers they have now into one to even get 1/2 of the amount of people they had on just one server in 2009. Don't let the population reading confuse you. Two of the servers say medium population they should say "very low" Don't get me started on the ghost towns that are the servers that say low...\n\nNow for the people I played up to lv 62 I couldn't do any kingdom quests that was the reason I came back to check on this game anyway. The kingdom quests or raids are (were) so much fun! These no longer matter and have not I assume for years. The only kingdom quests that were going were the lv 105+ ones and they were not even full. I saw some people desperately shouting for people to join the KKP Lvl 70-79 KQ the one I loved the most. These were some of the shouts.\n\nJoin KKP mats <3\nPlease Please Please join KKP\nJOIN KKP FOR MATS WE DO HAVE A CLERIC!!!!\n\nThe people are not that bad they just seem to me to be trying to hard to hold on to this game when they know it's on its last legs. The people I met were mostly nice they helped me out more because they wanted to show off their cash shop godly powers than any other reason I got the feeling. I was being run through this dungeon tower for Lvl 20+ toons by a Lvl 60. The whole time we when in there he was saying things like I can do 4000+ damage with these charms. (Charms are cash shop items that increase your damage for a set amount of time) He must have been wearing 60$ or more worth of cash shop items.\n\nNow on to the economy guild academy, at least, the two I joined were giving rewards of 1-10 gold per LVL based on what level you are. The academy I mainly stayed in "Eradicate" I made 10g the last level 60 for a total of 2gem and 30 gold more than I ever had before. I still could not afford anything for my toon the prices are insane now. I saw one good weapon priced at 7 gems or 700 Gold it was a lv 70 weapon not even enhanced or anything. I started talking to the guy and asked if he would come down on the price he said one simple word "NO" The economy on this game now if based on everyone believing that everyone else has a secret level 100+ toon where the quests alone can make you a millionaire.\n\nWhat really finally bashed the nailing into the coffin for me was today 10/9/15 I spent 20$ in the store on enhancement bundles so my weapon would not break as I was leveling it up. I bought 3 of the T3 Bundles for 20$ I had already enhanced my axe to +4 the max limit before it will break if I try again without shop items. I used all 30 of the protection items and only got my axe to +10..... now remember it was already +4 when I started.... the max is +11 I spent 40g and 17 of those protection items just trying to get my axe from 10 to 11 the price is too high for me. A sub to World of Warcraft 15$ a month and no paid in-game items except for looks on that game. I would have to spend 50 or 60 maybe 70$+ just to get my axe to +11 and armors to +10 anyone who says you can do it without ever enhancing your items has never played the game or played the game when there were 1000's of other people playing it and you could get a party if you sucked. I decided to let this game go and wish anyone who is addicted to it well I hope you see what you are doing to yourself before you waste your life away like I did this past week.\n\nI try to think of it this way\n\nSay I keep on playing past level 62 The good thing is that you can get to Lvl 70 just from quests alone now but then what... So I spend the rest of this week getting to lv 70. I'm now level 70 so I start getting to 80 things are slowing down now as there are no kingdom quests. The quests offer 10-50% of the required XP per level. So I grind for the next few months to get to 100+ then what now I'm a level 100+ toon and now what?? I can get all the money I need by doing quests and play 1 kind of KQ. I can hang out with my "Friends" most of whom will be decked out in cash shop items. These people won't want me in their circle unless I spend money on the cash shop too... say I do spend money on the cash shop then what??? I'm now a level 100+ toon with godly stats that is accepted by his peers who spent 100's if not 1000's of $$$ and can do 1 kind of KQ if my "friends" feel like doing it too. I can go on raids if my "friends" feel like doing it too... I see no future for myself playing this game anyway but, if what I just summed up seems like your kinda place to be jump right in and enjoy the fun woohoo!!!!","October 9, 2015","false","27.2"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","56","67","6","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/recommended/300970/","YouthOfFreedom","+ Youth Of Freedom +","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/","42 products in account","OVERVIEW\n\nFiesta Online is an anime adventure MMORPG. It is published by gaming AG who is almost an unknown company since most of the games they published is extremely forgettable or just didn't received well by both players & critics. Despite my short playtime,i really have to say that i can't enjoy the game that much mainly due to many horrid decisions and turn-off combat system.\n\nGAMEPLAY : 5/10\n\nThe most important things when it comes to MMORPG is the character creation. However is so poorly done with little to no customization to your character so basically a lot of people gonna look the same. There is a total of 6 class available for you to choose,one of them being unlockable if you able to reach your character to level 60 ( that class is a crusader class ).  Cleric is one of the best class in my opinion mainly because the huge amount of buff and healing ability.\n\nThe tutorial and guide tip present to you is fairly well done though some of them are not well explained enough. Quest can get extremely repetitive as you need to travel quite far to your quest destination and once you complete it,you need to go back to the quest giver for your rewards. I don't mind this but your character moves way too slow though you can buy mounts early with real cash.\n\nSkill progression is very linear as there is no skill tree and you able to buy different type of them from the merchant. From there the skill points you earn from leveling up let you upgrade the skills you buy from the merchant. Leveling can get extremely grindy,took too long & not rewarding at all.\n\nThere is a emoticons system you could messed around so that a plus i guess.\n\nAlso i have to give them a credit for having an auto-navigations system so you don't get lost easily.\n\nGRAPHICS : 4/10\n\nThe cartoonish artstyle they were going for fail to impress me.\n\nCharacter models look so awkward and a lot of environment is extremely bland.\n\nThe details on the monster decent and a lot of variety you see later on the game.\n\nThe world can look pretty appealing but at the same times it make you want to vomit so it a mixed bag.\n\nTo be honest the game graphics look pretty uninspired and it sure it doesn't look like it came out in 2007.\n\nAUDIO : 5/10\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty nice for the most part since some of them have upbeat soundtrack. Though it might be really repetitive because not much variety put into it and it also kinda short.\n\nI believe this game doesn't have any voice acting at all for a lot of the NPC including yourself. You will only hear scream,yell & grunt.\n\nSound effects wise is not really that great but it acceptable nonetheless.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 6/10\n\nIf you managed to get far into the game,i think you start to appreciate the game a little bit.\n\nThe game offers a lot of events,quest,PvP system and many dungeons for you to explore.\n\nWhile i may not venture further into the game,i could say the world is vast judging by the map.\n\nYou can mange your own guild and do questing with your own guild members together for an enjoyable experience.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 5/10\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game even for a fan of point & click MMORPG.\n\nThough the game offer some variety in some way,the combat system is just extremely lackluster and skills progression is very linear.\n\nNot to mentioned the cash shop system have a lot of pay 2 win items and very few permanent items you can bought ( most of them have 30 days limit times ).\n\nIf you really wanted to give it shot at this game,be my guest but prepare to be dissapointed a lot.\n\nAt least invite some friends to join you in playing this game otherwise playing alone get super boring.\n\nOh and the player base is almost non-existant at least for some part of the server.\n\nIs it one of the worst MMORPG to be released on steam ? Maybe. Is it one of the worst MMORPG ever made ? Not even close but it could be better.\n\nGRADE : E ( Passable )","May 21, 2014","false","1.1"," 136 of 198 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","136","198","0","3"

And pvp is no fun cause of what I am about to say in next paragraph\n\nFrom 50% additional hp, 70% additional damage and armor, 20% more damage from weapon skins,  80% crit rates [crits are double damage], 50% additional item drop rates, Instant full hp, no cd potion, 100% xp rates. Everything is monetized, if there is an advantage you can get there is a thing to buy.\n\nI played years  back, maybe 7 years ago, cash shop was mainly used as a consmetic items, maybe some had crit rates but were very minute, i remember a crit set [full cash shop items] having a whopping 3% crit, now its nothing to see people rolling with 80% crit rates.\n\nThe perm [never leveling] community is what made me wanna stick around, The farming of gears is actually a really fun aspect to me, it's all random statted and I am a collector at heart, i got near all max statted sets and the perm community on Epith never used cash shop, we were really all free to play outside of enhaching our sets.\n\nThis is where I am now, it's a terrible community thats filled with people buying items for hundreds of dollars, through facebook groups. Pvp has turned into people obtaining the best items by paying real money for them, if you dont buy the items you spend cash shop points to obtain items so that you may gain gold faster, if you are true free to play you can not make the gold another thats spending hundreds selling his cash shop or just flat out buy items for real money, You will not outbid other pvpers for the best items cause some has spent thousands of dollars to obtain un heard amounts of in game money.\n\nThe drop rates are terrible, beyond bad, even with cash shop items that boosts rates its not fun at all, It wasnt always like this. The ratio of gears farmed to gears that people want is too low, the low drop rates has forced a sellers market that items are so rare that they can decide how much they want for it, where as if drop rates were increased and alot of that item was available it be buyers market where people undercut each other to sell theirs. Guess who gets to buy gears? You guessed it the people that spend real money, you will not succeed if you do not spend you will not have a good time if you do not spend, Do not be used as a skinner rat [ google search skinner box technique] Cause playing this game you will become one","March 16, 2015","false","773.0"," 43 of 53 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","43","53","4","0"

I would play it everyday with my brother and a lot of the friends I made on that game. There were always events, dance parties and the kingdom quests were so full, you had to be quick just to get in. But then the switch to gamigo brought the player base to like 100 players and now they did a merge that erased my friends list, my marriage and spouse, and seperated my characters so my main character is on a different server and I lost all my cash and stored items.

All of my characters, that were leveled quite high, were deleted and I contacted the support, but didn't get a decent response and nothing resolved my issue. I quit playing, for a good 2 years after.\n\nFast forward to today, I started playing this game again and I was doing well, I enjoyed it like I did the first play through, and my characters were well leveled and I had plenty of them to keep me busy- Now, I just tried to play it, today...

This is going to be a fair review for a game that is quite old compared to the "new-gen" mmo's, comparing the good parts and the bad.\n\nNow the only reason I recommend this game is because I would recommend it to new players who are playing their first mmo, why you ask? Because this game is fairly good when one doesn't expect anything from a mmo, people that have played mmo's before are not going to like it only because they have played better. Fiesta isn't top notch and never will be but it's a good starting point for anyone who really wants to start getting into online gaming. Fiesta has a nice community, diverse classes (traditional mage/fighter/cleric/archer type of deal with a few different ones, crusader/trickster), and a huge PvE aspect from level 1-115 (Or whatever the cap is at now). When I say PvE I mean there's a lot of things to do, but there's a short list of what you SHOULD do to level and not just mess around. You can get pretty much anything without paying a penny but its extremely difficult, there's only 2 people that I know of that have never payed a penny and still were able to cap with high end gears. The guild/academy system is very useful as you can always find help provided that you joined popular guild or a guild with at least 5 people who still play.\n\nNow for the people that have played mmo's before, don't bother trying with this game. Compared to most mmo's this is pretty far down the list of "good games." It's pretty old and follows old mmo standard playstyles, it's very grindy and it's very P2W (pay to win) there's a large gap when you compare people who don't pay vs those who do. And it's not spend 10$ and you can get some good stuff like in other games, you nearly have to pay 40-50$ a month now to be properly "geared" with sc (slime cash/cashshop) items for the MONTH.\n\nNow the PvP is very tricky. I can say that it's bad and that it doesn't require any skill for a fighter/mage since they're the "PvP classes" of the game since they're easiest to spam skills with or that the cash shop really overly unbalances the PvP with the stat increases + some multipliers of skills = insta death but I have seen people fight really well using any other character that is supposively "bad" for PvP so it really does depend on skill in the end along with a little push of SC. ( the company has got to make money somehow right?)\n\nIn the end, recommended as someone's first mmo but not recommended for anyone who has played any mmo before.\n","July 2, 2014","true","0.2"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","30","38","0","0"

Leveling isnt as hard as it used to be, and quests feel rushed. It feels like rather than increasing the exp rate of the game, Gamigo decided to add more, seemingly meaningless quests which give ridiculous amounts of exp. You can accept and turn in quests without even being near the NPC you got it from. This does mean that the "pay to level" system of the older outspark game is gone, but it doesnt feel as satisfying to level (I hit level 60 in 3 days, whereas it used to be a huge achievement). The Trickster felt like Outsparks final attempt to reinvigorate the game before they turned it over to gamigo. And gamigo responded by adding the Crusader, a class which seems so rushed that it doesnt even exist below level 60, and it even has some skills copy pasted from other classes.\nI can see that Gamigo are really trying to update and reinvent the game, with graphics updates, new quests, and a quicker leveling system, which allows you to get into the action faster. It even merged all the servers into a couple of servers to make the servers full of people again. As a result, this isnt the same game as it used to be, but its an evolving, fun game nonetheless.\n\nUltimately, this isnt the golden '105 cap' fiesta that I remember, but I'm not gonna say it isn't worth playing. While its not the game I poured endless hours of my childhood into, its still a good game. Fiesta used to be hailed as a "pay to win" game, but now more than ever I feel that this isnt true. You can do really well without paying a cent. Im going to miss the days of stacking, endless grinding and massive guild raids on Karen, but the game is still fun. If you're coming to revive an old interest, you may be better off on a private server. But if you're willing to try a new game, this will be good.","November 28, 2015","true","67.6"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","25","32","5","2"

What can I say? I saw an ad, liked the colorful characters, and signed up. It's a fairly unimaginative game with very little free customization. I began playing back in 2008 and when I tried signing in a few months ago, my characters had been deleted, including all my mounts, custom character designs, and upgraded weapons (all of which cost money). I didn't try very hard to get the game back up and working after that.\n\nBut back in 2008, I invested a ton of time and a nice chunk of money in Fiesta Online. What eventually drove me away was the community and the grinding. If either could have been better, I might have stuck around but the carpal tunnel-like symptoms and the bickering were enough to make me quit.\n\nI tried signing in again today, knowing full well it would mean starting over. I was curious. The same three hairstyles, three faces, and three hair colors are present. They updated the character creation screen but it fails to impress. They added a class, which I've only played for a brief period of time, but the mechanics of the game are still pretty much the same. The starting gear is the same cowgirl-esque stuff from 2008. They added a tutorial which I find frustrating to get through but maybe that's because I've done this all before. I think it could have been a bit more streamlined than it presently is. It was really boring standing in place as I swing the same mallet from 2008 at the same Honeying for several minutes before it dies.\n\nAs a Cleric, I still don't get any offensive abilites until a handful of levels in. The graphics are the same. Roumen appears to be the same. The controls are still clunky and because I've experienced other games since Fiesta, it was enough to make me lose interest. When I closed the game down, the same "Fiesta.bin has stopped working" error came up. Ah, nostalgia.\n\nIt's a very grind-heavy game in which dying means redoing HOURS of repetitive monster killing. Some levels give you a small handful of quests, others give you none meaning you have to space your quest turn-ins out so you don't go crazy.\n\nAll in all, the game does not appear to be any better than it was 6 years ago but I can't say I was expecting it to be.\n\nI will, however, say that I rather liked the Kingdom Quests and still think they're a neat idea. You sign up for a KQ and go into an instanced zone with a number of other players and defeat the end boss. I would say the KQs are probably the more creative aspect of Fiesta Online. They're timed and utilize different mechanics to make them interesting. They tend to require a decent amount of teammwork which can be both good and bad. I also like that, even though I'm currently back on foot and moving slowly, I can press a button to lead me to my objective and basically AFK until I get there.","May 25, 2014","false","0.9"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","21","34","0","3"

I now find most of my time in the game making scrolls and potions and selling them because it does get boring.

For the heads up so you don't go all, "You haven't even tried this game!" on me, I have played this game from 2009-2013 (with several breaks inbetween).\n\nAnyway, this game is the generic anime MMORPG with men running around disguised as women and vice-versa (you know, to keep the creeps away). With a click-and-sit system and months of grinding-even with an EXP. buff. Honestly, all I can say is the friends/guildmates I met are the ones that kept me coming back after 2009-2010.\n\nPS. (11/1/14) After looking at this half-done "review", I take back my statement with men-playing-as-women. Some men just enjoy trying different things, same goes with women.\n\nPROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME?\n\nThe cash shop. 'Nuff said.\n\nThe problem with the cash shop, is that it ruins PvP. Entirely. I remember walking into Uruga (main city), fresh 60, with a bunch of 100's and 90's with an arrow above their head (which I later learned, it was a debuff), and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. However, PvP since then has died down - rapidly. The excitement of Abyss wars, FBZ wars, or just wars in general, used to be the most exciting and anticipating thing in the game that kept me going (well, part of it was my guildmates).\n\nThe cash shop allows you to use CHARMS IN PVP.\nWhen you kill someone, "CHARMED!"\nWhen someone kills you, "CHARMED!"\nWhen you get killed by the hammer in PvP KQ, "CHARMED11!!1"\nNobody assumes a player is good anymore - heck, the "good" players are considered good when they use charms. However, I am not discrediting those who worked hard in raids to earn their well-earned gear. Just those who assume one is using charms or is one of those pvp-charm-users.\n\n(A/N) This is an exaggeration, of course. However, some people really did act like this. Also, charms aren't as bad as they seem, it's just that it caused people to become somewhat paranoid of it and believe that everyone that doesn't take 10k dmg from them is charmed.\n\nRight, now for the more serious problem. PvE.\n\nThis game is literally a grind-fest. At level 90 (or so), I was able to run Leviathan runs for gear and EXP. While using an EXP. booster, it still took me OVER 4-6 HOURS just to gain maybe 20-40%. That's terrible. Kid me not, it was MUCH longer once I hit 100. (I don't even understand why I stuck around). Heck, I was looking forward to leveling my alts again, which normally would be the thing I hated the most.\n\n(11/1/14)\nAt level 93 or 94, all you can really do - besides that terrible leviathan run - was to do a quest repeat which gave 1% every turn in and had terrible drop rates.\nLeviathan became around 10-15% every 4-6 hour grind in the later 90's.\n\nI salute everyone who took the time to level their characters to 100+.\n\nPS. I hated when they stopped making that cool mage animation with their spammable skill.. forgot which, but they kicked and it was cool.\n\nGOOD THINGS?\n\nOkay, yes, this game had a few good things. (From my point of view, it was the nostalgia that kept me going). If you're lucky, you would've made a guild/found a guild that's friendly and fun to be with, making everything much more worth it. However, the rest of the community... not so much.\n\nAlthough they rarely do, but the events in this game are fantastic. My favorite was the Christmas one and I kept killing GM's. :)\n\nThe flashiness of the weapons - yesss. I thought +10'ing my stuff made my character look absolutely beast. Heck, when I first hit 100, I walked around (like a boss) Elderine and Roumen with my +10's looking so fresh. (Then in a few seconds, I would be bombarded by, "Buffplz," but who cares?)\n\nRIGHT. I WILL NOW BE GETTING DOWNVOTES, BECAUSE.... this didn't really feel like an actual review, more like an experience of my pain. Haha.\n\nTL;DR. I would never play this game again and would not recommend it - unless you like big grinds and people walking around in the opposite gender's character. ;)\n\nPS. THAT MOUNT DURATION STUFF WAS ABSOLUTELY MONEY-EATING.\nPPS. I downloaded this game on steam and sat there for 20 minutes, just to write a review.","July 16, 2014","false","1.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

The problems lie within 2 things.\n\n1. The creators of the game are money hungry. It is extremely hard to ignore this when every person you see around has +9/+10 gear. (These are the best enhancements for gear, which can only be obtained with either buying things from the store to stop your gear from breaking and increasing success rate, or you can try with a 95% chance for your gear to break otherwise.\n\n2. The community is basically dead. Most maps have only veterans or new players who have just started. Also, a lot of the community likes to scam you out of your money. You will come across the rare "helpful player" every so often though.\n\nSo, let me enlighten you on something that will make this worth your time, and will cost you less (Or no) money.\nPrivate servers. Servers made by a community that cares about its players more than it's income, unlike Gamigo.\n\nUnfortunately, I am unable to name any off the top of my head, but there is a site with a top 100 for them, look it up.\n\nNow, these servers are more user friendly than the original server. Here is a list of things they do compared to the original.\n\n- Most cash shop items (If not all) can be bought with in-game cash instead of your credit card.\n-Exp is multiplied (ALL servers have different rates!! ) to prevent you from "Requiring" an exp x2 card from the shop.\n-Drop rates are higher, but usually not to the point where you get a drop every kill.\n-Money is easier to get, and items that are sold by other players are usually fairly priced, unless it is godike. (Max stats on it)\n-Server maintenance is usually weekly for most servers, usually fixing bugs and adding in custom items, bosses, and more.\n-Like I said above, custom content exists. Most servers will also accept user-made content, if that's your thing.\n-Some servers run purely on donations, others DO have a cash shop, but they usually only contain non-gamebreaking items.\n-Every server has a different feel and experience.\n-Much more.\n\nSo really, the game is alright, but can be easily improved as shown by private servers.  If I were you, I'd skip the steam download and take the time to look one up, as It's well worth your time to try them out.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you take my advice.","June 19, 2014","false","105.5"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Though this isn't the issue I'm faced with, it's just how irritating how imbalanced classes are. As a 100 sharpshooter you cannot kill a single enemy in pvp even though sharpshooter is made for pvp. We just get pwned by a mage who can 1 shot us or spam their magic blast, and gladiators who dash to you and somehow land the stun perfectly even though sharpshooters have the best evasion in the game. Also dex is broken, as an archer it's impossible to kite enemies without speed scrolls which cost a fortune if you're broke. And one last thing, at higher levels it's impossible to find a +11 bow/crossbow from venders as with archer sets. The game is supposed to get a rebalance, but that was said by gm's about 3 months ago. If you want to play this game I highly suggest to play an op class like Fighter, Mage or Cleric.","July 10, 2014","false","0.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

They should have put alot more into the visualstyle instead of leaving things bare-bones pastels. Not bad, but definitely not good... evenf or a Free-to-Play game.\n\nAudio:  3/10\n\nLike most MMORPGs the audio ranges of the game almost feel like they are bringing back the old 8-bit music ranges. Constant loops and single grunt dubs are all you have to look forward to. This combined with some other lack luster features convinced me to do an uninstall after reacching level 7.\n\nGamePlay: 1.5/10\n\nLike most other MOORPGs out there the variety of quests are limited to:\n1) Kill this for me\n2) Get this for me\n3) Do this for "Yourself"\nNothing really new here, but they way that the quests were set up could have been more creative without hacing to add any new features. Grinding gets boring fast, and having to use the rest function (which heals you at an agonizingly slow rate) shows you that you either have to be as patient as a Saint, or be willing to forrk over some cash for a game that isn't going to be getting much better.\n\n\nFor the most part, this game was everything I hope to not find in an MMORPg of any caliber, but one thing that did please me was the "Free Stat" system which most RPG players are happy to see. The ability to choose where your stat point go into is always a nice thing :3\n\n\nSo unless you have the patience to lug through a fairly clumsy battle system and agonizingly slow walking speed, you might want to look into play some other MMORPG.

However, it's SO easy to get hooked. The majority of the hardcore players are either people with a surplus income and have nothing to spend it on...so no kids and they live alone...OR...it's people who have absolutely no life whatsoever that they spend 24 hours a day just grinding mats to make money and then buy the enchanted gear.\n\nGranted...I had a blast ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people off in full charms in PVP...but still. This game is a poor excuse for an MMO. It's a grindfest...and unfortunately every aspect of the game is set up so you can keep spending money. I played this game for 2 years and I must've spent about 100 bucks a month on charms/xp boosts/outfits/customizations/enchanting mats. It was pathetic. I could've paid for my car 2 times over with all the money I spent on making my character all 'elite'...and it didn't matter...if you're not willing to suck some guild masters ♥♥♥♥...you're not gonna be able to raid or do anything remotely fun in the game. That's why 90 percent of the community sat around in town talking smack...and only the elite 10 percent of the active community were all in the same one guild and they'd farm the one raidable boss in the world...which isn't instanced so any other guild was ♥♥♥♥ outta luck.\n\nMy advice? Stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from this game unless you have absolutely no goals for your life that take place outside of your house. If the most interesting thing that happens to you in your day is that your cat looks at you...buy this game. If not...go play a real MMO.","June 13, 2014","false","0.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","1"

Fairly standard stuff. The cartoonish graphics are easy on the eyes and the Lore is fairly rich. Most importantly, however, the community is fairly nice and it's easy to make friends here. While there are items that require cash to buy, there's no real pressure in the game to get them. If I were to recommend any MMORPG to someone, it would definitely be this one.\n\nHowever, Fiesta Online has one critical flaw: it is a time-draining, virtually-endless game. Do not play this game unless you are willing to sacrifice at least 4 hours a day, every day, for the rest of your life. The game is definitely easy to work with for the first ten levels, but the next ten are truly horrifying. Getting to level 20 in this game is incredibly difficult. It's not that the game is challenging; the hard part comes from forcing yourself to sit there and grind for the countless hours necessary to get out of the gloom that is the lv. 17-19 range. The game picks up after that, but only for so long. The cruel cycle continues to repeat itself. This game will eat your life.\n\nIf you like the typical WoW-style MMORPG setup, then, sure, this game is great. However, ultimately, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone.","January 24, 2015","false","244.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xdyimy/recommended/300970/","xdyimy","xDYimy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xdyimy/","6 products in account","So, I have to take the time out to give this game a review. Despite the number of hours logged through Steam, I have played this game for a very long time. It deserves some love. Let me tell you a little about Fiesta Online.\n\nIf you're looking for the next-big-thing, this isn't it. No, it's not like WoW or TERA. It's not Black Desert, either. It's an older game that's changed companies a few times, had it's share of population dips, and (shock) still has some bugs. It IS, however, still a very good game and will provide you with a lot of old-fashioned entertainment.\n\nI'm not going to do a formal Pros/Cons, but I am going to casually tell you about the game should you be in the midst of a decision on whether or not you want to try it out.\n\nThis game is very generic in a lot of good ways. Yep, you read that right. It has all of the traditional things you would want in a MMO. Yes, you can buy and level up skills. Yeah, you can quest to your heart's content. It's got the trinity system you'd want from a standard game like this. The game still gets new content. It still gets patches that work on improving existing problems. The graphics have even been updated recently. It has six classes with each having a branch-choice at level 100 for a total of 12 end-game roles. The game has just the right amount of tradtion to relax ya. Grab a cold drink, sit  back, and enjoy some good old-fashioned game play.\n\nAesthetically speaking, the maps are bright, colorful, and easy on the eyes. There's not a huge deal of customization, but you do have the option of furthering your character's design through the cash shop. Speaking of, I've always leveled just fine without using the Cash Shop. (That pay-to-win crap is, well, crap). If you're looking for a good ole anime game, then this is it! (However, I would like to throw out there that I've always found it odd that your characters can only be light-skinned. Then again, they don't have natural hair colors much either).\n\nPerhaps the most enjoyable, and unique, aspect of the game is the "Kingdom Quest" system. It's an instance-based raid, but it doesn't depend on your class. So, no, dear DPS players, you're not going to wait an hour in que. It's not a perfect system, but it's different, fun, and is currently working very well. When the game changed companies awhile back, the population dropped a bit. This made the Kingdom Quest system kind of broken. I mean, it's hard to run an instance with no people in it. They cared enough to finally merge the servers, and they're working great now. If all else fails, you do have the traditional instances where you find your own party members.\n\nThe game isn't easy to level. It plays like a casual game, but it actually has some pretty thought-provoking challenges in it. While it's not as hard as it used to be, you're not going to cap in a month. It takes time, effort, and by the time you're there, it feels fantastic! Not to mention, the game has new bosses and raids for end-game. I'm looking forward to them!\n\nSo, no, Fiesta isn't the best game in the world, but it WILL be fun for you to play should you decide to stick with it. I hope you decide to give the game a go and make tons of new friends in the end!\n\nBest of luck,\n\nxDYimy","December 30, 2015","true","25.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is by far, the epitomy of not just micro-transactions, but pay-to-win or uninstall before your account goes dry.\n\nWith that being said, you can spend on average $50 a month alone just on costumes, accessaries, cosmetics, useful power-ups such as extenders/charms etc, and that's not including the amount you need to actually get good gears, enhance them, have in-game money for pots/stones/scrolls, and then include the amount of money you'll end up spending on trying to get a skin for your shield or weapon to look and be as strong as everyone else. But the strongest players, myself included at one point, were spending over $200-300 a month just on one game to keep up appearances, raid daily, PvP daily, and continuously get better gears.\n\nMost of the systems involved in-game are currently broken, including levelling, enhancing gears/weapons, farming for gears/weapons, and the community itself is just as appalling. It took a slow tumble from 2010 and onwards, down further to what most people could refer to as, ELO Hell in League. Spammers, scammers, ♥♥♥♥♥ and prats are loose from everyone to converse with, and the amount of times a person can get catfished in one game alone, well this would definitely be situated for the award ceremonies.\n\nAs most people have stated, the game used to be good, had a very friendly and on-going community, it still had it's problems, especially at higher levels within specific guilds, but hey, what game doesn't.","December 27, 2015","false","777.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game has really good combat in my opinion because the skills and healing with sp/mana hp/sp pots and stones is really fun and different from most games of the genre. It has a really good core idea with lots of little funny and odd anime stories but i have more complaints then things I like.\nI said that I really like the combat which in a very grindy game is a must need. You dont have a million abilities but you have enough to keep you interested. I like that the balance is really good because there are a lot of buffs you can do to your character. You more often then not will have scrolls or potions on that increase your stats tiers 1-5 that can all be created through crafting and receiving from quests. The stat system is very normal and well made. The game has lots of different cool thins like your mini house. You reviece a mini house that over time restores your hp and sp over time from sitting in this mushroom that you can change the look of the higher levels you reach. Now on to the bad things.\nThis game has a decent structure I think with a few personal things gamigo has come up with with cool buff systems and healing items to keep you in battle. But there are a few things that make this game absolutely atrocious at times. I am not sure what level it starts happening at (around level 50 I think) when you die you loose hard earned xp. Ok this seems ok sure you die and you loose like 5% of your base xp FINE. But this game was made so that when you level up you get a certain amount of quests for the next level and if you die to many times durring that level you are suck having to grind or do "repeat quests" which are quests that give next to no xp which are very grindy and take forever to do just so you can get the last 10% of your xp bar to level up and get a new set of quests to go grind more mobs. They try to cover up the flaw by giving you the "repeat quests". Another thing is the economy... THERE IS NO SUCH THING because the way you can sell items to other players is by setting up a mini house and selling your items in a stationary spot which means if you wanna sell things you have to be online. And instead of playing while your online which the makes should be emphasizing you sometimes just have to get on and go afk all day to make money.\nIf gamigo would just let as keep our xp when we die and come up with an auction house or somethign like world of warcraft then you would be afloat i think.\n","August 29, 2015","true","304.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I originally had it before it came out on Steam, and the only reason I got it through steam was because I stopped playing and uninstalled it at one point. It was originally owned by a company called Outspark, and it hasn't changed all that much since it switched over to Gamigo. Mostly skin changes for monsters and the starter town.. oh and maybe some NPCs.\n\nIn terms of classes, it doesnt really matter what you pick since all the quests are the same. There is no story line whatsoever. There are seasonal events, and the premium item store holds some goodies if you are willing to spend real cash in order to get store currency. It has been said that FO has become a pay to win game, but as long as you're willing to put in the hours, it is possible to reach cap without premium items. I dont suggest battlefields, pvp dungeons or PVP kingdom quests without premium items... which I guess proves the pay to win section.\n\nThe enhancement system is also a lot harder if you dont use premium items, and even though enhancement offers some perks, and makes your gear prettier... it is still possible to play without, or you can always farm/sell for in game currency and hope to buy off another player. Players stores can be ridiculously priced though.. unfortunately people dont really offer an item for what it's really worth and tend to overprice useless gear. Be mindful of your class and stats before buying from other players, and really consider whether it is actually worth the price.\n\nIt has its pros and cons like any game, but if you're into things like this then by all means give it a go. It's not so bad, as long as you're willing to sink hours into it. (Though... if memory serves... since I havent started a new character in a very long time... you can get to level 30 within a couple hours)\n\n","February 17","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At first it was OK with the Tutorial, but when I started a real quest it screwed up back. I tried auto-walking to the NPC and it took me to another area, to a specific portal, where I would stop walking. I then tried auto-walk to NPC from there and it took me in a circle through another portal and back to the first one. After about 4 or 5 times of that. one of the portals I went through, I tried to just manually walk away from the portal and after so mnay seconds it set me back at that portal. It continued to do so every time I walked away from it. How am I supoosed to do a quest with glitches like that?\nTerribley pathetic!!!!!!!! You know what else I noticed? When installed it has this certain game security program installed to run while the game is on. Can't remember the name but stats with X then about 4 more letters. That same security program, I have seen installed with quite a few games I tried has caused a problem for every one of them I played. Usually it just shuts down the game after some message about another program being a security issue. I shuts them down after about a minute or so when I first open the games.","February 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

It is not a pay to win game, it is only pay to win if you choose to pay to win. The only useful things you can buy that actually help combat wise and gameplay is enhancement bundles, so your item doesn't break when you want to upgrade it. Fashion gives you slight crit buffs or hp etc. and it's not that effective unless you have a lot, either way you don't need to pay to get these kinds of buffs. Just build your character right, and you have a pretty easy going time.\n\n[Fighters] usually build END, and STR. Me personally, I build STR and DEX for damage and so I don't miss and have much more evasion when I fight.\n[Archers] build DEX, SPR, and sometimes END depending on what kind of gameplay you would like, like if you wanted to AoE, you would need a bit more END.\n[Clerics] build full END, or END, SPR, and STR (sometimes). Clerics are the tankiest class in the game, but you also build SPR for more mana so you don't just kill it with a set of buffs.\n[Mages] build INT and SPR. INT for magic damage (I usually go full INT), and SPR for more mana and crits.\n[Tricksters] build STR, SPR, and DEX. Tricksters have the fastest attack speed and the highest crit chance, evasion, and hit chance. I mained a trickster for a while before switching to Fighter.\n[Crusaders] I have yet to experience. I'm sure they build STR and END. I've seen some crusaders that build tanky and others that build pure damage and destroy everything. Though you need a level 60+ character in order to make a Crusader.\n\nBut yeah in conclusion, I would give this game a try. It's pretty fun, just takes some time to get used to some stuff. There are even vaults you get every so levels that help your experience, whether it be from fashion to mounts, from resting houses to weapons. They reward you for leveling up. Plus if you're running out of money, you could join an academy and every level from 10-60, you'll get money and item rewards for leveling up. I'd give it a try.","May 23, 2014","true","35.2"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninako-ren/recommended/300970/","ninako-ren","Aqua783","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninako-ren/","6 products in account","I read another review here that said that this game is recommended to those who are just starting to play mmorpgs. I completely agree. Fiesta was one of the first mmorpgs I've ever played and somehow, I still love it (even with all the repetiveness and grinding). Why? The community is nice (which I find very assuring when you're just a starter, so this is the big concept I want to point out to beginners). People will always help you when you're least expecting it; whether it be a random buff from a cleric or people asking if you need help in your guild -you can always rely on the community.\nI might be naive saying this, but I've played other mmorpgs to some extent as well, and at some point they all have their repetiveness, so as far as the gameplay goes... what's so bad? The skills have increasing levels that you unlock as you level up, and skills that you eventually come to gain. You don't come equipped with all your skills and for me, I found that such an exciting experience when I first started playing. [If anyone else has played Vindictus then I would like to compare: you do get skills along the way, and can level them up to some degree, but unless you're not into the whole paladin/dark knight thing then there's no other skills] I always looked forward to getting new skills in Fiesta and still do (because I haven't reached the level cap yet since I've taken such a long time off this game, but I still come back to it).\nNow if you don't like grinding or P2W then sorry; this is definitely NOT the game for you if you plan on playing it for a while. This is the reason I've taken long breaks and the only reason.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this games to starters of the mmorpg worlds.\nEven so, I still recommend this game to experienced mmorpg players as well. This game goes back to the classics. Classes of Fighter, Mage, Cleric, and Archer can never let you down. To add, the developers have even added Trickster, and Crusader to those who want a little variety. note* Crusader becomes availible at level 60. I always seem to come back to this game even if it is repetitive because I miss it, and I think others who have reviewed have the same feelings. It's a relaxing game that has cute sprites and reliable gameplay. I think that's all from me ^^","November 22, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obeyandwifey/recommended/300970/","obeyandwifey","[N] Obey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obeyandwifey/","48 products in account","Summary: Fiesta is an anime-themed massively multiplayer online (MMO) game that emphasizes group play. It is simple enough for ten-year-olds, but a few annoying bugs and a very grindy lategame may discourage you after many hours of play. It is free, and buying in-game items can help speed you along without breaking the game.\n\nPositives:\n1. Fiesta is simple as MMOs go: you don't so much *win* the game, but you gain levels by earning EXP from completing quests. Quests mostly require killing monsters, collecting drops from monsters, or gathering items in the wilderness. The quests and overarching storyline are text-based and perhaps tangential to the game itself; there is virtually no real "roleplaying" of your character. Don't let the anime feel fool you: you spend the bulk of your active gaming time looking for monster spawn points and exterminating them.\n\n2. If dressing up your character in funny and cute cosmetic items is a draw for you, you will be pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of available costumes, hats, ears, pets, and mounts you can (rarely) earn or buy in the real-money store. Most cosmetics give a mild buff, such as increased critical hits or more EXP, and some can be earned by leveling, playing games of chance in the Lucky House, or completing timed rewards during in-game events.  You can run around in a t-shirt, butterfly wings and rainbow tube socks while fighting the bad guys, and still have all your gear equipped and active. Even a free-to-player can earn about 15 specific cosmetics by the time a character reaches level 66.\n\n3. A handful of typical classes provides some variety, but you only acquire perhaps 10-20 skills unique to each class, so there isn't the deep customization you would find in action RPGs like Diablo or World of Warcraft. That said, you can spend skill points on your favorite skills to make them more powerful, cheaper to cast, or to refresh their cooldowns faster. You also get stat points to increase the raw abilities of your character also.\n\n4. Fiesta boasts one one of the few truly female-friendly gaming communities. Also, the gender of your character can be chosen on creation regardless of class and without effect on your character's stats. Also, if you're a parent of a potential user, Fiesta has virtually no content that is inappropriate for preteens; only the chatter of the other players need be monitored. There is also no way in-game to purchase real-money content; the store is on a separate, secure website.\n\nNegatives:\n1. Fiesta needs to address a few bugs that cause the game to crash repeatedly, usually caused by switching areas or standing around in populated areas. This is causing the existing community to slowly leave, however the most popular server (Bijou as of this writing) still enjoys a large population. If you want to play alone or just with some close friends, you can choose one of the other servers and not be bothered much by chat spammers or other annoyances.\n\n2. No Steam overlay for a Steam game.  No Steam Guard for a Steam game; it still utilizes a third-party anti-malware software (X-Trap). You can't use Steam Wallet Funds to buy Slime Coins, the currency used by the parent company, Gamigo (at least that I can find). Steam does little more than hold the shortcut for you, much like a non-Steam game you've added to your library. So what's the advantage of being a Steam game...?\n\n3. Some of the crafting skills (i.e. making potions and scrolls) require you to spend hours of real time crafting many more items than you will ever need or sell. It's something you can have the game running in the background while you do other tasks, but it is kind of a pain.\n\n4. On one hand, the game is growing: some low-level maps have had graphical updates, and the level cap has increased to 125 replete with new areas, quests, and items to find.  On the other hand, the North American servers are slowly depopulating, just because there are so many other games out there to play, and that the patches (and bugfixes!) of new content are coming too slowly. If you can find friendly players and join a Guild Academy, you are more likely to stick with playing longer. But playing solo is a real grind (even for me, and I'm used to grinding solo).\n\nFree Advice:\n1. You will level MUCH slower if you ignore the quests and just find a place to grind.  Until level 30 you can play as you wish, but in later levels, most of your EXP will come from completing repeated quests, not from defeating the monsters required by the quests.  That said, I hope you like grinding, because in the mid-game (say your level is in the 60s) a typical quest may require you to kill 40 of a monster for 4% of your required EXP to gain a level, and a repeatable quest will require 120 of a monster to earn 7% of the required EXP.\n\n2. Save your skill points until you have played the character for a few hours and have become comfortable with your hot-keyed skills. You cannot unspend the skill points unless you spend real money to do so. Maxing out the power and maxing out reduced cooldown time of your main attack skills is common.\n\n3. As far as your stat points, most players maximize their character's Strength in order to increase damage, unless you are a Wizard (max INT instead). Depending how you play your character, however, you may put a few points in SPR (to have some more SP and to crit more often), and perhaps a bunch in END (for extra health when you intend to get hit a lot).\n\n4. You can earn a lot of random cosmetic items by participating in month-long Attendance Events. By logging on for one hour a day per character, that character can earn a reward of 1-3 cosmetic items per week, as well as another reward for earning attendance for at least 21 of the 28-day event. Stash these items, then use them when you're bored or when you plan to do a lot of leveling!","December 28, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clearly 1.8k hours I SHOULD know something about fiesta and how it works. Well your in luck as I do, bare bones this game is extremely P2W and grindy as **** to the point that it just became to much.\n\nNow in some more detail about this game:\n\nLets start with the bad parts of the game!\n\n-The cash shop:\n\nMost MMORPGs usually have a cash shop which you buy stuff from and for me personally any cash shop that offers boosts to a player's stats things such as DMG,crit, crit rate, HP or whatever form of boost aren't exactly something I like unless it's from a event or obtainable via in game boss or dungeon run things of that nature that can give F2P players the same opportunities as P2W players and I do understand that companies must be profitable to maintain operations of a game however fiesta I feel just lets you download the game for free just to make a few hundreds or more off of you and make you work your *** off for close to nothing. Not only that but their cast shot is virtually stat boost that only last for 30 days at a time before you have to buy something to replace your old outfit.\n\nWhat's also kind of funny the cash shop can make a mage into a tank.\n-The community:\n\nNow this one is a little hard to put on the bad however there are a lot more bad apples then there is good ones when I first started playing this game I joined a guild abid it was a small guild with a good guild leader and members and they REALLY were the only people that kept me playing for as long as I did, however, a more big guild eventually absorbed our guild into it and I met a much larger community and that's when I realized how bad the community really is most of the level 100+ abid some aren't as bad as others but still it's bad most people I met seemed to be WAYY to power hungry and into PvP (Which is really broken due to the nature of the game) ill admit that being power hungry isn't a bad thing or being into PvP, however, one instance from the guild I was in one of the strongest players (We had 2-3 of the top players in our server) in our guild decided that instead of sharing loot which was distributed by how many runs you do which normally take about 2-3 hours to get done per run to keep the loot they got that did get our guild leader angry but decided to let them keep the loot because of the fear of losing one of our top players rather then keeping his word and promises to the other within our guild.\n\nFor as long as I've been with this game I did noticed that newer player areas really don't have any life to it normally you wont see other players in Roumen (Newb town) or they'll be afk or something like that. Most people that are lower levels get power leveled by higher level players normally for free or they'll ask for gold in return for leveling (yes it's not against the TOS at least the power leveling part is not so much the asking for money part).\n\n-Events...\n\nThis one is pretty short, Events in this game are practically nothing. Most events are done on forums which I can say just is lame because it gives the game a feel of nothing interesting is happening which is most part nothing IS happening. And when a event is out it's normally just something for Halloween or xmas that's really the only 2 events you are normally guaranteed to have. Most other events happen on blue moons or out of the blue.\n\n-The player market\n\nAnother short one I'm getting tired of writing so ill try to keep everything from here on out short. The player market everything is really over priced even after I quit the prices of things only really just gone up and that's about it. It's a real problem.\n\n-Scammers\n\nNot that often you'll find people that would go out of their way to screw you over for money or whatever but a common scam in this game is gifting this game does let you gift cash shop items from other players sweet and all right? Wrong, as people normally know you need to spend money to be able to even gift (I don't know much about it as I never gifted or brought items from the cash shop) Scammers know this and would say something like give me the money first and ill gift you first or if they want to get something for free from a gifter they'll asked to be gifted first. There are other scams out there, however, that's the most common one other scams aren't done as much however that's the most common one out there.\n\n-THE GRIND\n\nOH GOD, Can I say this game becomes just to grindy to the point you have to do it for hours to just see 5% for level 105 at black bear repeat quest with a party of level 100-105 this game starts to get grindy at levels 61+ and slows and slows down a lot to the point it's not fun to play even with a group of high level players the grind becomes old pretty quick.\n\nThe good of this game FINALLY!\n\nSo here we are at the good things about fiesta good on you if you read this far into it.\n\n-The community\n\nWhile this is in the bad part it also has it's good bits it really does if your able to find a guild or a group of players to play with regularly this game becomes VERYYY addictive because of how fun it can be to run a high level kingdom quest or do group repeat quests to level up.\n\n-It's about as classic of a MMORPG as you can get\n\nTitle says it all fiesta is for the most part the most classic of a MMORPG as you can get to at least as far as I know.\n\n-The end-\n\nI know this review isn't a perfect one at all but I do hope it help you out a fair bit in not picking this game up.  my personal rating of this game it would have to be 3.3 out of 10.","October 26, 2015","false","841.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of friendly people who weren't always selfish or shy were everywhere, and really entertaining soundtracks would always set the mood when seeing people fight monsters, but now it's a really depressing game. Unless you have played games that are similar to Fiesta ( like Rift, Warcraft, Eldevin, etc.) you are going to be bored and the atmosphere of the game may ruin your fun. I don't even think it's going to be fun if you have friends playing WITH you. Overall, I wouldnt recommend it, unless the game gets a major re-work to when it honestly wasn't Pay-To-♥♥♥♥ing-Win. (Note: I played this game on the client in 2009 before the game was handed over to Gamigo [When i realized the game's fun dropped dramatically] and logged on about 100 hours, so if anyone has any questions or does not feel like i have the experience in this game to write a review, I just wanted to let you know I did spend a lot of time playing the game.

There are other scams out there, however, that's the most common one other scams aren't done as much however that's the most common one out there.\n\n-THE GRIND\n\nOH GOD, Can I say this game becomes just to grindy to the point you have to do it for hours to just see 5% for level 105 at black bear repeat quest with a party of level 100-105 this game starts to get grindy at levels 61+ and slows and slows down a lot to the point it's not fun to play even with a group of high level players the grind becomes old pretty quick.\n\nThe good of this game FINALLY!\n\nSo here we are at the good things about fiesta good on you if you read this far into it.\n\n-The community\n\nWhile this is in the bad part it also has it's good bits it really does if your able to find a guild or a group of players to play with regularly this game becomes VERYYY addictive because of how fun it can be to run a high level kingdom quest or do group repeat quests to level up.\n\n-It's about as classic of a MMORPG as you can get\n\nTitle says it all fiesta is for the most part the most classic of a MMORPG as you can get to at least as far as I know.\n\n-The end-\n\nI know this review isn't a perfect one at all but I do hope it help you out a fair bit in not picking this game up.  my personal rating of this game it would have to be 3.3 out of 10.","October 26, 2015","false","841.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am one of those players back in 2010. It was amazing I've made a lot of bonds/friends in that game spent countless hours of fun chatting/gameplay. Maybe I am trying to cling on to old memories of good times but at the same time I do not want this game to die. For those of you who did have a good time in the past I beseech you to come back and play again. Gamigo isn't perfect but at least they are trying listen and cooperate with the communities. Development is slow but please give it time I know things will get better. The server merge will help repopulate the game and as of right now all the "jerk" players from earlier in the game are gone. I've found that because the community is smaller everyone is a bit more tight knit and therefore helpful/friendly. There's barely ever any drama.  I haven't seen much of people screaming of being scammed or wanting to be gifted. etc. I know this was once a great game and I know it can also be it once again please don't give up on it and download this game to play it for old times sake. :D If anyone is ever on the (soon to be Isya/Epith server find me and I'll help you out to the best I can.

At time of this review you have 6 class choices; Fighter (your typical tank), Cleric (Healer roll), Mage (Ranged magic damage), Archer (Ranged physical damage), Trickster/Joker (A dual wielding melee class) and most recently added, Crusader (A interesting mix of Physical damage, magical damage and healing abilities).\nThe tutorial is very straight forward and welcoming to new players. Alternatively, there are many academies (A training group for guilds) who are filled with happy and helpful people who can help you out!\nThe current level cap is 125, with many quests to help get you there. Early levels can be simple to level, but the higher you get, the more challenging it becomes, but it is doable!\n\nOver the years, I've watched the game evolve, go through glorious moments and struggles. At present, I believe Gamigo are doing a fantastic job at trying to keep the game fresh and bug free as possible, while trying to constantly impress a negative community (grown from all the messed up patchs and previous lack of listening to the community).\n\nRegardless, this game IS ADDICTIVE! After spending time on various other MMORPGs, I always find sooner or laterI get drawn back to this game. And I have this game to thank that I have made a few friends for life.\n\nSo give it a try, it's free, and you've got nothing to lose!\n\n~Pagel Server~","January 4","true","658.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AveryNiceGuy/recommended/300970/","AveryNiceGuy","[CB]Black Jesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AveryNiceGuy/","83 products in account","A F2P PLAYER'S REVIEW!\n\nWell nearly 2k hours into fiesta and still haven't decided to write something about it I figured I'd write one now, anyway, your probably wondering why I'm not recommending this game. Clearly 1.8k hours I SHOULD know something about fiesta and how it works. Well your in luck as I do, bare bones this game is extremely P2W and grindy as **** to the point that it just became to much.\n\nNow in some more detail about this game:\n\nLets start with the bad parts of the game!\n\n-The cash shop:\n\nMost MMORPGs usually have a cash shop which you buy stuff from and for me personally any cash shop that offers boosts to a player's stats things such as DMG,crit, crit rate, HP or whatever form of boost aren't exactly something I like unless it's from a event or obtainable via in game boss or dungeon run things of that nature that can give F2P players the same opportunities as P2W players and I do understand that companies must be profitable to maintain operations of a game however fiesta I feel just lets you download the game for free just to make a few hundreds or more off of you and make you work your *** off for close to nothing. Not only that but their cast shot is virtually stat boost that only last for 30 days at a time before you have to buy something to replace your old outfit.\n\nWhat's also kind of funny the cash shop can make a mage into a tank.\n-The community:\n\nNow this one is a little hard to put on the bad however there are a lot more bad apples then there is good ones when I first started playing this game I joined a guild abid it was a small guild with a good guild leader and members and they REALLY were the only people that kept me playing for as long as I did, however, a more big guild eventually absorbed our guild into it and I met a much larger community and that's when I realized how bad the community really is most of the level 100+ abid some aren't as bad as others but still it's bad most people I met seemed to be WAYY to power hungry and into PvP (Which is really broken due to the nature of the game) ill admit that being power hungry isn't a bad thing or being into PvP, however, one instance from the guild I was in one of the strongest players (We had 2-3 of the top players in our server) in our guild decided that instead of sharing loot which was distributed by how many runs you do which normally take about 2-3 hours to get done per run to keep the loot they got that did get our guild leader angry but decided to let them keep the loot because of the fear of losing one of our top players rather then keeping his word and promises to the other within our guild.\n\nFor as long as I've been with this game I did noticed that newer player areas really don't have any life to it normally you wont see other players in Roumen (Newb town) or they'll be afk or something like that. Most people that are lower levels get power leveled by higher level players normally for free or they'll ask for gold in return for leveling (yes it's not against the TOS at least the power leveling part is not so much the asking for money part).\n\n-Events...\n\nThis one is pretty short, Events in this game are practically nothing. Most events are done on forums which I can say just is lame because it gives the game a feel of nothing interesting is happening which is most part nothing IS happening. And when a event is out it's normally just something for Halloween or xmas that's really the only 2 events you are normally guaranteed to have. Most other events happen on blue moons or out of the blue.\n\n-The player market\n\nAnother short one I'm getting tired of writing so ill try to keep everything from here on out short. The player market everything is really over priced even after I quit the prices of things only really just gone up and that's about it. It's a real problem.\n\n-Scammers\n\nNot that often you'll find people that would go out of their way to screw you over for money or whatever but a common scam in this game is gifting this game does let you gift cash shop items from other players sweet and all right? Wrong, as people normally know you need to spend money to be able to even gift (I don't know much about it as I never gifted or brought items from the cash shop) Scammers know this and would say something like give me the money first and ill gift you first or if they want to get something for free from a gifter they'll asked to be gifted first. There are other scams out there, however, that's the most common one other scams aren't done as much however that's the most common one out there.\n\n-THE GRIND\n\nOH GOD, Can I say this game becomes just to grindy to the point you have to do it for hours to just see 5% for level 105 at black bear repeat quest with a party of level 100-105 this game starts to get grindy at levels 61+ and slows and slows down a lot to the point it's not fun to play even with a group of high level players the grind becomes old pretty quick.\n\nThe good of this game FINALLY!\n\nSo here we are at the good things about fiesta good on you if you read this far into it.\n\n-The community\n\nWhile this is in the bad part it also has it's good bits it really does if your able to find a guild or a group of players to play with regularly this game becomes VERYYY addictive because of how fun it can be to run a high level kingdom quest or do group repeat quests to level up.\n\n-It's about as classic of a MMORPG as you can get\n\nTitle says it all fiesta is for the most part the most classic of a MMORPG as you can get to at least as far as I know.\n\n-The end-\n\nI know this review isn't a perfect one at all but I do hope it help you out a fair bit in not picking this game up.  my personal rating of this game it would have to be 3.3 out of 10.","October 26, 2015","false","841.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spamming repeats and saving quests for levels with no repeats is the only way to level after a while. But there's more than just spamming repeats. There are Kingdom Quests, where you join other similar leveled people to beat the boss...or survive for a period of time.  The Kingdom quests and the anime style are the two reasons I keep coming back.\n\nThe population isn't very high, but there is a server merge going on, so that might fix things like people buying instance runs. The economy is also very broken. Things that used to cost like 80g now cost gems because the server is being flooded with money with no good gold sink.\n\nEven with all the problems with this game, I still recommend it. I still enjoy playing and interacting with the community in game.\n\n\n\nEdit: As much as I liked this game, even I have to admit that Fiesta is dead at this point. I've seen some things...like people being paid small amounts to just make a Fiesta account. I've moved on, and so should other people who play this game, or are thinking about playing this game.","August 5, 2015","false","477.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
