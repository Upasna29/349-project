Combat begins to feel like a chore.\nUnsatisfying story with anti-climactic events.\nNew mechanics such as the "cold" meter feel underdeveloped and superfluous.\nInstead of being filled with meaningful content, the world is filled with meaningless collectibles and recycled side missions.\nFar too many fetch quests in the main story line. The game starts to feel like a slog.\nOverall thoughts\nFrom an audio/visual standpoint, Far Cry Primal is pretty great. To me, this is clearly the biggest strength of the game. There are so many incredible vistas/scenes, it's actually hard to find a scene in the game that isn't worth screenshotting. Combine the game's visuals with the distant echoe of primordial wildlife and you have one of the most beautifully realized prehistoric game worlds ever made. In terms of presentation, the game is actually quite stunning.\n\nMy biggest problem is that interacting with this game's vast open world feels so pointless and dull. This is an unfortunate trend in Ubisoft's open world titles. They manage to consistently create beautifully realized worlds and then fill them up with meaningless collectibles and recycled side-missions. These may be fun for you, but as someone who has spent dozens of hours in past Far Cry games - Primal is far too familiar to keep me fully engaged. There's no sense of wonder or desire to explore the world around you in Far Cry Primal because the game teaches exactly what is around every corner in the first three hours. I feel like in open world games, you should want to say " you know what, I actually think I'm gonna walk there instead of fast-traveling ". In Fallout you might find yourself in the midst of a three-way skirmish between mutants, raiders and the BoS's vertibirds. In The Witcher you might stumble upon the lair of a monster with a price on its head. This is the magic of open-world games, you lose yourself and just get sucked in by the world around you. Random events or enemy skirmishes that happen out in the world of FC: Primal are extremely predictable and overall they feel uninspired. I found myself completely ignoring them about halfway through the game. In fact, everything in the game starts to feel the same about halfway through. It almost feels there is no reason for FC: Primal to even be an open world game other than to say " Hey, look at me! I'm an open world game! Buy me!"\n\nThe sad part is that the core game is generally pretty satisfying and very fluid. I'd even say the game can be a fun way to kill an hour here and there - but I don't think it's meant to be played how other open-world games are meant to be played. The beastmaster idea is cool and ties into the Far Cry theme very well. Although, even with the best combat system, clearing out packs of enemies and animals becomes tiring after a while. The gameplay scenarios they've built around their combat system feel repetitive and poorly balanced, and if you've played a Far Cry game then you've likely seen them dozens of times before. So while riding your mammoth into a base and burning it to the ground is undeniably awesome the first time through, it gets old pretty quick.\n\nI don't recommend Far Cry Primal at its current price (60 USD). If you've never played a Far Cry game, then you might find yourself having a good time, but in that case I would recommend maybe picking up Far Cry 3 as your first.","March 15","false","28.1"," 607 of 749 people (81%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","81","607","749","44","25"

However if I judge this game based on how I enjoy the game, this is a great game.\n\nI watch all my tv with subtitles, so hearing the odd language and reading the subtitles isn't a big deal for me. I kind of enjoy it to be honest. I laugh all the time at how they structure their sentences and the phrases they use don't feel genuin for the time period, but it is still funny and enjoyable.\n\nI keep all my drivers on my pc up to date, and have a fairly expensive build. As a result I believe this is why I dont have problems running the game; and maybe ubisoft loves me. It is kind of annoying that you buy this through steam but you launch with steam, then ubisoft.\n\nGameplay feels different from the games I have been playing lately. Trying to take over an outpost while being undetected I feel like I could do many different methods and be successful. If I want to be hidden the whole time, I have a tactic for that. If I wanted to rush through it I have a tactic to do that as well. Theres much more on the gameplay aspect of this game that has been enjoyable that I just don't have the time to type it all here.\n\n10 hours into the game and I am only 22% through this game, only having 2 major quests completed, and constantly having things to do. So far its been fun, and I had some crazy moments that made me laugh. Cannot wait to play through more of this game.\n\nIf you were able to read through this entire thing you are great. If this review was helpful in your decision to buy the game let me know. If however, no matter the positive reviews you still dont decide to buy this game, I hope you enjoy the next game you get.","March 2","true","14.4"," 1,293 of 1,704 people (76%) found this review helpful 90 people found this review funny","76","293","1","90","44"

Far Cry Primal is a copy and pasted Far Cry 4, some things have changed, but it's not enough to be worth the price it's being currently sold at. Being set in the stone age, the weapons that you have are vastly different and more primative from the other games in the series (obviously), but there is nothing good about this, the bows I found were too weak to be useful, I ended up throwing spears instead, and the melee weapons (there are 3, club two handed club, and spear) felt dreadful. The melee combat had not been developed at all since the past games, which isn't a good idea because in the other games you do not rely so heavily on using melee. On the standard mode, normal, this game was way too easy, I rarely used the owl to scout when I discovered I could simply charge in with a spear and spam left click.\n\nThe only language spoken in the game is a mix of made up words with a Proto-Indo-European structure, this was an issue as it meant that it was near impossible to have a real connection with any of the characters, by the end of the game I could remember basically only the main characters name as the other characters didn't mean much to me, their stories felt pointless and were there just to make the game time longer. I didn't feel like I was doing anything for a reason, I'd go to a place and kill some people and burn some stuff, with no real care as to why. The main story was also short and uneventful, spoilers but there aren't really any twists during the entire game, you go to a place, kill some person and it's gg.\n\nThe main antagonist of the game was no where near as interesting as the other Far Cry game's baddies, I felt no emotions towards him and never really wanted to kill him because he hadn't really done anything, he comes to your village in one scene and burns like a hut or two and suddenly he's the sole base of the games story.\n\nOverall running around in 10,000 B.C was fairly enjoyable, but it felt so pointless, easy and I was never really immersed in the world, at the current price I would strongly advise against buying Far Cry Primal, if you still want it that badly then I'd just wait for it's price to drop massivley because only then would it be close to being worth a buy.","March 4","false","25.4"," 776 of 1,050 people (74%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","74","776","1","44","20"

Then get in line for Far Cry: Primal! The game where you can taste the copy and paste.\n\nYet again Ubisoft has treated it’s audience to an a,ss blast to the past that has left me unfulfilled and a little ashamed.\nThe first few hours were fun and full real "badass" moments as I plunged my spear into generic cave man #2’s face or burned a forest down to keep the wolves at bay, but the more I played the more I felt there was a glitch in the matrix and I was going in circles. The experience of this game is like being the security camera monitor in any heist movie ever; where the thief’s have looped the footage and its the same thing over and over and over. Save this random, collect this animal, find these carfting items and save the random person again. The story has all the drama and complexity of a dirty puddle and all builds to a climax as satisfying as a sandpaper hand-job. In fact I’m not even sure if I finished, I never saw credits? But I couldn’t do anything else after the mission so I  suppose I have. Then Ubisoft had Uplay throw acid in my face and was all like "Consoles? What consoles? Can’t you see that we really pushed for graphical performance on every platform?” I commend Ubisoft on using a real cave man dialect, but can't they just admit that we are in the animus and it can just translate it for us. I didn't mind reading subtitles but when I read the subtitle and the character is still letting out emotional grunts it really breaks up the any emotional investment in any of the dialogue. Someone was talking about killing children and I just sat there thinking I get it, he's bad and Adam Jensen is cross about it.

I'd like to point out that this wasn't supposed to be a direct copy of the other Far Cry games, whilst still being a Far Cry game. However out of all the reviews I see, these 'experts' are playing the game on normal and complaining about it being 'too easy'. I'm running around on expert mode having the time of my life and feeling some very REAL fear when confronted by a Sabretooth. A big part of Far Cry is immersion. Game is too easy? Up the difficulty. It's not neuroscience. If you're not feeling hunted when you're running around at night, you're not playing on a hard enough difficulty. Don't give a bad review because you didn't decide to challenge yourself.\n\n2) People keep complaining that the melee system is flawed. Why? Because there aren't brutal melee finishers for every weapon? Last time I checked if you got into a brawl with 3 guys with a club it's not going to be a moment of finesse. It's gonna be a moment of blind rage-induced swinging hoping to hit their faces. The same is true for the spear. If I stab someone in the face or the throat it counts as a 'headshot' and is an instant fatality. That is the sort of accuracy of a spear. You're trying to tell me we should be able to swing it around like a quarterstaff? Far Cry isn't known for prompted cinematic kill moves other than silent melee kills with most weapons. Why did you expect anything other than the very basic idea of an amateur swinging a stick? You're a caveman. Not a professional assassin.\n\n3) Complaining about the fact that they went through the trouble to include genuine proto-european dialect, or that the game is too short. I reiterate, a big part of Far Cry is immersion. If you're not paying attention to the script, the emotion in their voices, or the storyline, and then you complain about not enjoying it, it doesn't sound like a problem with the game. That sounds like a problem with you paying attention. When it comes to timeframe, I'm 33.3 hrs into the game right now, and due to difficulty level (died probably 14 times trying to kill Dah) and how I genuinely enjoy hunting in this game, I've got plenty of collectibles and side quests left, and several story and character missions.\n\nAll in all, I'm not trying to bash anyone for their review because everyone has their own opinion. However I felt that this game was very harshly judged and mostly so because of the preceding games. People either expected something completely different or relatively the same. The weird balance in between seems to have some people upset, but did any of you really expect Far Cry to evolve as a series without some trail and error? Considering this is their first foray into any other era than modern, I'd say they did pretty damn good.\n\n8/10 For a decent story about the brutality of this time period.\n9/10 For appearances, the game is just plain pretty on high settings! Spent probably over an hour of gameplay just admiring certain views!\n9/10 for performance. From being attacked by Dholes at any moment to wondering if that growl from a Cave Lion was near or far, the game definitely gives the impression of a nonstop fight for survival.","March 10","true","44.2"," 424 of 575 people (74%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","74","424","575","41","45"

Without speaking a single word of english (which is usually a deal breaker for me but they did a great job with language in this game) the characters are very likeable and fun. There is a lot of humor in the characters interactions as well. People obsess over "recycled" this and that but at the end of the day it's a damn series.

And wait.. Wasn't there one more thing that was fun in Far Cry 4? Ah yea of course! The co-op. That got removed as well.\n\nThe spear animation is ridiculous just as most of the melee fight animations. It's just poking! And enemies don't even have wounds where you poked them. So actually you're just clicking your mouse, there is no real fight system. There are Takedowns but we've seen them already haven't we?\n\nThe hunter vision looks like witcher senses from The Witcher.\n\nThe pet system... That could have been something new and nice but what they did is, they let you tame animals (in the blink of a keystroke), and afterwards you can press G so they attack or ALT so they stay. You can also pet them. That actually is all the pet "system" does. Even the early access ARK let's you do more with your "pets". Also taming animals makes more sense in ARK.\n\nMain missions play like side missions. Why? Because all you get to do is going somewhere (which takes awfully long because you don't have any vehicles of course) and gather some stuff. That's it. Sometimes it's not gathering stuff but taming some animal.\n\nThere actually is no other activity to do in Primal other than taming animals, hunting, gathering resources and ambushing/capturing bonfires. Crafting is so basic compared to other games that it can't be considered a part of the gameplay. You just collect resources and click menus so you can finally carry around more stuff or what ever you upgrade.\n\n\nIs there anything positive about this game? The graphics look better than Far Cry 4. You could even say it looks great. But then again, a 970GTX won't even be able to render this game at 60fps. What a joke. You also have to install and use that Ubisoft crap ♥♥♥♥ software (I don't even know the name). Just thought I mention it. Only because it's been bad for a long time, it's worth to note it's still bad.\n\nTo wrap things up, I played this game for about 3 hours now and I'm already bored. The graphics can't compensate for the many things that got removed compared to FC4 and there literally isn't ANYTHING new in this game (besides the pet system that comes with 3 features - attack, stay, pet). Nothing would make me spend money on this game again, if I wouldn't have made this mistake already.","March 7","false","4.0"," 185 of 285 people (65%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","65","185","285","18","2"

Started with Error Code 88500014, fixed this by adding an exception in my firewall. Game finally loaded and hung beofre it started. After 4-5 hours messing around trying to get it to work, I gave up.\n\nContacted Ubisoft via thier support, forum, twitter and Steam and didn't recieve one single response. So I uninstalled the game.\n\nI pre-ordered Far Cry: Primal along with The Division. After many problems with the Division Beta (which is not ready for release in a weeks time) and  now having problems with Primal, I have requested and been granted a refund for both products.\n\nAs mentioned, with The Division being released in 7days, It's nowhere near ready. Far Cry: Primal is a testiment as to what to look forward to. Both of these Ubisoft titles are not ready for release (and I mean nowhere near ready) and it makes me wary of ever buying any Ubisoft game again.\n\nI know people say don't pre-order, but usually you get extra stuff and that's what I want out of a game, but in the end, the developers should have a working game instead of something riddled with bugs and errors on Zero Day!\n\nTotally dissapointing.\n\nEdit: For those of you trying to be clever by offering words of wisdom about pre-ordering, when you buy a brand new shiny car, you mostly have to pre-order it (though most of you probably aren’t old enough to shave, let alone drive), same goes with food. Buy a tin of beans for next week’s dinner, and yes, you have just pre-ordered and own a tin of beans. Opening the beans, you find the contents have turned bad or some form of dead, rotting insect is floating in the beany goodness. You'd be pretty miffed that your favorite beans are not what they should have been and you complain or want a refund. The point, when you pay for a new product, you want it to be working 100%. We all pre-order something. But If I decide too, that's my business and my choice and it's nothing to do with you. I can change my mind at any point about pre-ordering, but being a sad, pathetic little comment troll and a complete m o r o n is something you will have to live with for the rest of your life.","March 1","false","1.3"," 241 of 377 people (64%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","64","241","377","14","11"

There's a lot of polish here in terms of the animations and open world mechanics but that's kinda where it stops.  Far Cry: Primal feels like a really solid foundation for a superb survival game but utterly fails to capitalise.  There are no real driving mechanics governing the necessary acquisition of food, water or shelter, and only a token gesture at warmth.  Nor is there any sense of mortal peril.  If you are severely wounded after a tough fight, you can heal to full health in a matter of seconds.  Even if you die there are no real consequences; only the minor inconvenience of respawning nearby.  It’s not that it tries to deliver a survival game and comes up short, it just doesn’t appear to make any attempt to do so; leaving the player with a beautiful environment but an empty experience.","March 2","false","13.8"," 383 of 619 people (62%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","62","383","619","18","10"

Ever since I was 3 I've fantasized about being a caveman in the Ice Age era hunting mammoths and taming wild beasts.  This game is the closest I'm ever going to get to that fantasy and I'm loving it.  The gameplay is what you expect from Far Cry, in other words, it sublime.  THe melee combat feels brutal and satisfying and getting headshots with the bow and arrow is so much fun!  It might look it's not an innovate game but it is incredibly innovative as a concept for a game.  I know a lot of people had problems with crashes but I haven't had thosse issues and I think Ubisoft patched the game because I'm not hearing about crashes anymore.

The sneaking needs to be fixed!! For example if you use the owl to drop bombs on an enemy camp everyone in the camp knows your location, just because someone died from a bomb that fell from the sky?!?! The detection system is also extremely half ♥♥♥♥♥ making it incredibly hard to sneak.This is my biggest issue with this game, as well as the melee combat theres no dodge move so its just two guys smacking eachother with sticks until one person dies, so 90% ill be using my bow and throwing my spears and very rarely using my club for melee combat. The taming is so easy all you have to do is throw down some bait wait for the beast to eat it and hold E,wow that took some real thinking. All the taming should be like the beast master hunts were you actually have to defeat the beast to tame it. The night time feels much too short, they made some cool featrures like more predators and making them more agressive at night only for it to last a few minutes.","March 3","false","32.1"," 208 of 333 people (62%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","62","208","333","9","6"

I have never played a single Far Cry game in my life and I was interested in this title because I could become a beast master. The game was okay at first, but as I kept playing just to finish or hope for something better it just got worse and worse and worse. Its not terrible and its hard for me to call it a bad game, but it is utterly cringe worthy. It is definitely a below average title and does not deserve the price point. Even with 20 hours of gameplay and probably another 5 hours just to finish collectables and the side missions, its just not worth it. This might be a nice grab when its price is reduced by 75%.\n\nThe game overall just feels lacking and unfinished; its disappointing they had a great concept and with some simple ideas could have expanded upon it and made the game much more enjoyable and much more interesting. Two common themes that you will find while playing this title is that you will be gathering and in combat. There is no let up, no breather (unless you swim in the middle of the lake). You will have aggressive beasts and tribespeople just spawn on top of you...even if you just killed that same person/beast at that spot. I literally killed five loops of the same group enemy type in the same location just moving a little bit away. (I wonder if its a coding issues as you will find a few loop bugs with some beasts audio and animations as well). You become numb to it and at the end you just run past everything because arbitrary objective points continue the mission...lack luster and uncreative missions.\n\nThere were only a handful of moments where I become the hunter and roleplayed myself being the beast master...like 2 or 3 moments that I can think of...and there are just too far few of those experiences. The drug moments were kindve cool, but also pointless...not to mention all the relationships and character development; everyone feels like they are just "there"...and really that's how I feel about the game. Things are here or there just because.\n\nThe only redeeming factors of this title is the idea...which doesnt say much...and the mostly bug free play through; nothing so dramatic as to make it unplayable for me, just laughable moments....anyhow I have ranted long enough, get the game when its 75% off, its mediocre, below average and cringe worthy.\n\n\nTo add something...when I finished the main story, completed side character quests and took all forts, fire pits and literally got the achievement and end game cut scene "conquered oros"...it literally said I completed about 45% of the game....45%...I dont believe that for a minute. That means 55% of the game is made up of collectibles and side missions (note side missions just offer some typical reward to resource, anima hides and etc; no meaningful story and etc).","March 3","false","22.4"," 205 of 328 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","205","328","8","16"

Not Far Cry enough? I beg to differ. You're still running around a lush open world, murdering your enemies like a righteous badass; it just so happens that your living in 10,000 BC this time around. So, no massive arsenal of machine guns and rocket launchers and the like. Instead you're rocking (heh heh puns) a more primitive arsenal. Your spear is your best friend in the wilds, functioning both as a face-jabber and a long range projectile. You've also got clubs for more personal encounters (which can also be thrown) and of course, a trusty bow. Any weapon you throw can be retrieved, plus you can craft more weapons on the go - which means foraging for resources and supplies is now an important part of your life.\n\nOh yeah, you can also tame wild beasts, which is good since pretty much everything wants to kill you and make you its lunch. Once tamed, said beast becomes sort of like a 'familiar' in the sense that you can call and dismiss it at will. There is a pretty good variety of beasts to tame and each has its own specialties and abilities. Plus, you've got your very own spirit animal - the trusty owl which can be used to scout the surrounding area, mark enemies, attack from above and even drop bombs on unsuspecting foes.\n\nSeriously... what's not to love? If you're a Far Cry fan I implore you to at least give it a chance. Hell, even if you've never played a Far Cry game in your life I still recommend you give it a go!","May 11","true","11.1"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","29","34","6","0"

But this is the same thing copypasted but with spears instead of guns. I know, I know, Ubi always reuses assets for their games, but could you atleast put some effort into it? Really? Reskinning the FC4 Map to FC Primal?\n\nPlus, there is the issue with DRM, specifically Denuvo. It's legal maleware to be perfectly honest. It leeches on your computer and ultimatly makes preformance worse than what it already is. Not to forget the lack of any co-op mode or even a map editor, which basically every FC game has had in the past so the Primal dev team could "focus on the story".\n\nWell guess what. Story is lackluster. You're Takkar, one of the last of the Wenja tribe in Kyra-- I mean Oros. Your tribe is surrounded by massive beasts (except the ones that could and exist in that time along with the sabre cats and mammoths) and two warring tribes, the Udam and the Izila. Both of which are basically the same but one eats people and the other worships the sun.\n\nSo, is there anything good in this game? Yes. The enviroment is beautiful and since Ubi upped the animal population in the game, you'll get to see cave lions running down herds of goats, wooly rhinos chasing after people, and you get to tame predators from a Dhole to a Sabretooth Tiger. Each animal has it's advantages, Dogs can scout and reveal the area around you, cats are pretty stealthy and bears are hevy hitting bulle-- I mean spear sponges. But when you aren't fighting animals, you're fighting humans, and boy does that suck.\n\nYou'd think that Ubisoft would do good on the melee, right? No. FC Primal's melee combat is just as bland as Skyrim's.

For 60 bucks? and 5 bucks more you get a horrible mammoth mission, a mammoth with no legs that floats around and can't stop gliding here and there. The graphics for a 2016 game....well, the scenery is nice, can't complain there. However, it would have been much nicer if it had better textures, very low res foliage. The environment is so much fun to play in however. Can't stop looking at the vistas....at the same time, can't stop how badly the vistas' View Of Distance are. When you climb the mountain....the grass, animals, people and smoke all disappear, and the mountains are really not all that high.\n\nWith this game, every good point has a bad point, and bad point with a good point. I can't stop playing, and yet at the same time can't help but notice there are such few side missions. Story wise.....I don't know remember anyone except for Sayla and Takkhar(Takkar, depending on region of game). Playing with bow and arrow sure makes the game more challenging, having to wip out the tiny club or big club in split second before you get your head bashed in, AWESOME. Playing with fire (however not new as this is the same thing with every farcry series) still AWESOME. I loved the fact that animals are scared of certain beasts and fire. But, when you traverse the land of Oros, you seem to come across your people, Udam, predators and prey.....all in the same 10 meters of eachother...every 2 minutes( yes, I actually timed it). There is no peaceful free-roam really, every step you take, you come across an enemy, or enemies attacking my people, or enemies attacking prey, which in turn then for some reason attack both attack me for some reason (Not having Facebook in Oros at that time and being the Beast Master, they sure know how to spot me.....animals and enemies both)\n\nAll in all, this is an addon for farcry 4, same engine with same tactics. However fallout 4 was same engine as Skyrim, look at the difference there! So, there is no excuse as to why the graphics have not been maxed....specially for 60 bucks. No NVIDIA hair effects? really? And of course, no mod support, so we can't make the game look or feel better even if we wanted to. I'll have to give it 50/50....which Unfortunately means....thumbs down.

It will get boring and and the combat is getting repeatable fast, the animals is a nice idea but it also gets repeatable. I will give ubisoft respect for trying to change the normal fps games out there But its simpe too similar to the other far cry games. So if you own them just play those and if you dont go buy them there will be a better story in those to. To describe it best think of Far cry 1/4 as a dark chocolate cake recipe and far cry primal is the chocolate cake recipe but with white chocolat insted and a different glaze. They said that this game was gonna be a different Game out there But really it will just blend in with the rest at the games out there. Go look at the gameplay videos on youtube and see for yourself. Hope this review helps you :)\n\nlook at this and then you will know https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVp0x_eaMVs\n\nWait for steam sale to bring the price down on the game then you should buy it.\n\nAlso i know it only say 3 hous gamplay on steam but i played the beta on PS4.","March 1","false","2.6"," 99 of 157 people (63%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","63","99","157","12","0"

The ambience of Oros alone makes it worth buying the game.\n+++ As for the gameplay, Primal reproduces the great formula of FC 3 and 3.5 (4); the movimentation and the aim are very fluid as well as the adaptation for more focus on hand to hand combat is very nice.\n+ The story is ok. Not bad but not as engaging as we saw on FC 3.\n+++ Ubi made a awesome job with the soundtrack.\n+++ The game is a lot of fun if you play it at least on hard difficulty; that way, you really need to think about your approach on the main missions and when capturing advanced posts. Also, Primal has a good replayability value.\n- The PC port definetly could be better. The game does not take advantage of multi-core processors. I had some small fps drops with a GTX 970 and i5 4590 (not fully maxed out [shadows only on high] 'n' playin' @ 1080p) and alt-tabbing the game makes it unplayable. Altough you can eliminate this problem by resetting the processor affinity values in the task manager, the procedement has to be made everytime you launch the game, which is a little annoying.\n\nOverall, this FPS with tiny RPG elements is a marvelous game.\n\n9/10","May 7","true","32.9"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","34","45","3","0"

Whatever enjoyment I got out of the other Far Crys, they made changes to this one that ensure I don't get that enjoyment with Primal.\n\nThere is no inventory loot that you are used to.  The looting system punishes you for picking the item up too many times.   Extra annoying is the fact that you can spend many minutes hunting and killing an animal only to be told it was a waste of time because "Your pack is already too full of that item".\nLikewise for "treasure" and "Loot bags" that seem to be the same limited repeats of the same items.   Follow a treasure item on the mini map and go cave exploring for it, but after 10 minutes of exploring you only find it to discover that you are full of that item yet again.    How unrewarding.\n\nThere is no quest log either.    Simply the same familiar icons on the far cry maps, which are quite often unclear as to where to go or even if they are linked to quests you have accepted.   Very poorly implemented.\n\nI'm pushing myself to finish this game, but it feels like a chore.   A repetitive chore that I just want to get over and done with.\nThere is some worth to the game, but perhaps wait quite a while for a price drop and hopefully some patches that will improve the gameplay quite a bit.\n\n---------------------------------------------\ni7-4790K @ 4.00Ghz\nMSI GeForce GTX 980 Ti Gaming 6GB\n16GB ram\nASRock Z97 Extreme6\nSamsung 850 EVO Series 1TB SSD\n\n\n\n\n\n","March 3","false","23.2"," 71 of 110 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","71","110","0","0"

Yes, sponges are back to torment you.\nStory feels a bit too boring and the game would force you to play it.

I just wish one of the parts of the mechanics was to unlock flint-knapping skills. I also wish you could cave paint, though I am glad it plays a small part in the game.\n\nTotally a Far Cry game. Outposts, side quests, collectable hunts, crafting. If you are tired of that move on. If you like that it is here.\n\nThere is no over the top Vaas-like villain here, and for some that is clearly disappointing. I could care less. I for one don't play open world games for the story, I play for the world interactions. I guess if you don't read books then you may want more story here. For myself I find the narrative pieces and missions often the most frustrating parts of this whole genre.\n\nIn this game the crafting is more integrated than ever before. The materials hunt is meaningful to the gameplay and you use it to replenish your weapons and supplies to the very end of the game.\n\nIt is not a caveman sim. It is a Beast-master fable set in a late ice age world. The animal control is key part of the tactics of the game and serve to allow some of the mayhem type of action that was so much fun in FC3 and FC4.\n\nThe map textures are familiar. The way you move around on foot is familiar (I never drove that much in the FC games after FC2). Many say the map is reused from FC4, but I never once felt like I was in that map. It is a Far Cry map to be sure, but it still felt fresh to me.\n\nI don't regret a single cent that I spent on this. This is one of the first Ubi-soft games that I actually have managed to get all of the achievements and pick up all of the collectables and enjoyed the process from beginning to end.

I apologize if this review is lacking, as it is my first. Long story short, it's a Far Cry game. It has stealth kills, basic crafting, animal hunting, karma events, outposts, collectibles, all the bare bones stuff that has become the basis of the Far Cry series. That's where most people will complain, but Primal is more than it's skeleton.\n\nGood Stuff\n- Great setting. Running through the environment is awesome.\n- Language is pretty cool, though I've had a few laughs at how it sounds sometimes (Think male Twi'lek from KOTOR. You know the one).\n- Limited base building. You can't choose where it goes, but I like seeing the village being built up over time.\n\nHit or Miss\n- Taming system is basic, but there are plenty of animal choices.\n- Melee is simple, but fun.\n\nBad Stuff\n- Open world elements are the usual Far Cry filler.\n\nWithout guns, the pace of combat has changed quite a bit. Sure, Jason/Ajay could charge someone swinging a sword wildly, but in Primal you're far less likely to get suckerpunched and shot in the face. The melee combat is simple, but effective. I haven't had this much fun bashing things in an FPS since Bioshock and Half-Life.\n\nThe taming system is about as primitive as it gets, throw meat and press the button. I dislike this, but beating a sabretooth tiger halfway unconscious with a club while it tears you limb from limb probably isn't as fun as it sounds in my head. We can't all be Drago Bludvist, I guess. The animals themselves are fairly varied, with different stats and abilities between the species. It's pretty fun comboing them together - start attacking from stealth with your leopard, then call on your lion/tiger/bear (oh my) to finish them off in open combat.\n\nThe major complaint about Primal is going to be that it's just more of the same. And I suppose in a way it is, but if that's the attitude you take then you'll miss the forest for the trees.","March 1","true","25.1"," 203 of 342 people (59%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","59","203","342","26","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/susofseattle/recommended/371660/","susofseattle","-xTc-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/susofseattle/","56 products in account","A brutally honest review of Far Cry: Primal, played on Expert difficulty, by a HUGE fan of the Far Cry series.\n-----\n\nFar Cry: Primal really makes you feel like you're a part of our ancient history. The immersion is amazing and genuinely feels like you're a terrified, tasty piece of meat, walking around carrying a stick. ..Until you become a near-god, 24~hrs into the game and find yourself thinking about all the other games available for the sticker price of $60ish.\n\n[tl;dr] - This is a pass / wait until a discount comes out. Ignore the hype..\n\n-----\nCons\n*Missions: My biggest complaint is the lack of auto-added minimap waypoints, once you've begun a mission. Yet the game will allow you to set a way point on the other side of the map, and that shows on your minimap. But if you accept a mission and the objective is out of your viewing range, the new mission icon on your world-map, will be the exact same size shape and color as all the other missions strewn all over. Good luck finding it.\n\n*Story: What story? Caveman loses tribe. Caveman saves idiots, grows a village. TA DA. >.>\n\n*Enemies: Remember the drunk, Molotov tossing idiots in Far Cry 3? They're reskinned in 2 flavors. All the other enemies are exactly the same, in reguards to their mechanics, and just as repetitious and boring. /Copy Far Cry 3, retexture, change dialog, print.\n\n*Skills/Leveling/Experience: I'm 40% in and nearly all of my Skill are maxed already. I'll be capped by 50% completion. The XP comes way too fast and far too easily. Accelerating the processes is the bonus XP to level, for completing missions and growing the population! YAY! Cap everything in 60 Hrs!\n\n*Taming: I was hoping this would involve some mini-game, requiring skill and finesse, to eventually tame a new catagory of beasts. Nope. Might as well be point-click-tamed. And it ALWAYS succeeds. I have every beast tamed that doesn't require a special mission (and only because I'm saving them).\n\n*Beasts: Your pet died? Mk. Open a menu and click the icon. Good as new. No wait time, and no punishment for letting your pet bleed-out.\n\n*Crafting: The resource nodes are so abundant and easy to acquire, that you'll end up capped in the first 3 hours. You'll stay that way for the majority of the game, only dropping below cap as the Skills you select, unlock crafting options.\n\n*Survivability/Difficulty: I am now Caveman-Superman. It took 8-12hrs to become fearless. And at 25~ I will now charge head on at any creature or enemy and poke them with a sharpened stick, knowing full well that they will collapse long before I do. Rinse-Repeat.\n\n*FIRE: ...don't use it. Seriously. Its like turning on God-Mode and lawl-clipping your way through the game. Everything pee's their pants, panics and get's 1-shot. (metaphorically)\n\n-----\nPros\n*Survivability/Difficulty: You will die, a LOT.. for 12 hours; Until you get used to the aiming / controls and learn the sounds of animals nearby. Then, see above about the same subject. But for 12~ish hours, you will ♥♥♥♥ yourself every time you're charged by anything. And you WILL get eaten / mauled / trampled / gored and set on fire. Its terrifying, like Doom 3, all over again.\n\n*Vehicles: I won't go into details, as I found out about this aspect only by immersion, but its the best feature of the game. Nothing beats hauling ♥♥♥ at cheetah speeds, at night, through the ancient forests.\n\n*Language: The Tribes all speak different dialects of a Proto-Indo-European ancestor language that Linguistic Historians reconstructed and developed specifically for FC:P. The immersion it provides is heightened some-what by the lack of subtitles during open-world encounters.\n\n-----\nIf you have any questions or concerns, feel free to comment. I will answer what I can in a generic form, as to not spoil your gaming experience. Nothing pisses me off more than spoilers to a game/movie I'm VERY excited about.","March 9","false","68.4"," 50 of 76 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","50","76","7","0"

Best part is spending some time in the world running around with the bow (and spear) like I did in the previous games - simple pleasures I guess.\n\nPros/cons;\n\n+ Open world Farcry 3/4 'reskin' with new location/items etc\n+ Looks good and is immersive as you run around the world, especially at night\n+ Crafting system\n+ Addition of beasts\n+ Some of the NPC characters are a bit of fun\n\n- Story not as engaging as the previous 2 Farcry games\n- Repetitive (particularly capturing bases and free/save quests)\n- Should be better optimised\n- No HD textures\n\nOverall, like most games nowadays unless you're a huge fan of the franchise I don't see it being worth full price. If you liked Farcry 3 or 4, wait until it is on sale and grab it for 30-50% off and enjoy 30+hrs in the world.","March 27","true","32.6"," 64 of 101 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","64","101","9","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thirdrail1/recommended/371660/","thirdrail1","shark music","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thirdrail1/","181 products in account","I DO recommend Far Cry Primal, but only with a bundled set of disclaimers, caveats, and concessions. Let's cover those first...\n\n1) Ubisoft/Uplay. An understandable dealbreaker for many gamers. You have to be signed in to Uplay and Steam to play, even though Uplay is a useless ghost town everyone hates. But Ubisoft doesn't care. Because they're Ubisoft. Being THE WORST is just what they do. Sometimes I try to imagine what the Ubi offices must be like, and when I do, I always envision a bunch of unregistered sex offenders sitting around in cubicles chomping their own sun dried feces.\n\n"Yo, bro, you wanna bite of my mookie stick?"\n"Naw, bro, I got a peanut allergy, I best chomp my own."\n\nSo, instead of drowning this collection of human detritus in the nearest bathtub or waterlogged old tire, you have to give them $60. Assuming you possess a human soul, this will make you feel dirty. #foreverunclean\n\n2) The core game, played on default settings, is just another crummy, shallow, hand hold-y Far Cry game. If you've played one, you've played them all. The spear and the dingo won't change that.\n\n3) Technical issues abound. From what I can surmise, Primal inherited some pretty massive frame rate and memory leak problems from Far Cry 4. My rig overpowers Primal by miles, and yet there have been many times when I could only play for half an hour, before crippling frame rate issues forced me to restart. Sometimes I'd make it all the way to a couple of hours, but most of those forced resets landed in the 45 to 75 minute zone. Ubisoft was, of course, too busy a'chompin' to offer any tangible assistance, despite my requests for help. Luckily, I was saved by a kid on youtube, who had posted a video about how to tweak the problems away in the .ini and nvidia control panel. That was a complicated hassle in its own right, but I was lucky enough to have a set up very similar to the one in the video, and in the end, it did fix my issues. Completely. There's no gaurantee that's going to work for you, but, hey, feel free to utter a prayer to whatever gods you worship and take the leap, if you're feeling frisky.\n\nAnd now you say, ok, Third, I get it, and I'm still potentially willing to navigate this circus of failure if there's a fun game on the other side of it, where I get to run around as a cave man!\n\nAnd I say to you, excelsior!! For those that survive the many trials of the feces chompers can find something very special at the end of their stinky, half broken rainbow.\n\nIn Survival Mode (which was added post launch), with almost all of the interface turned off, Far Cry Primal becomes a fascinating and unique experience. It's just you and the wilderness.\n\nYou have to eat, and sleep and stay warm. It's survival-light, really, but that's the correct setting for what's going on here. Unlike many of the true survival games, where survival mechanics overwhelm everything else, Primal's realism has a much lighter touch. The food and shelter considerations only add to the organic feeling of being there, among the Wenja (your tribe), without ever hijacking the experience.\n\nOrganic. In almost every circumstance, organic is what Primal does best. The combat, for example. In a game with a spear, a club, and a bow, the combat is never going to be the centerpiece. And it's not. Fighting feels functional, at best. I find that accurate. You're a bunch of primitive hunter/gatherers, not ice age warlords, and the combat reflects the fact that you're using primitive hunting tools to engage in warfare, at the times where warfare happens. The big game changer of interpersonal conflict is not a grand contraption like a massive rocket launcher, or the guidance lens for an orbital laser array, but, simply, fire. Good old fire. It's what keeps the wolves at bay.\n\nIn this case, literally. All of the conflict in Primal takes place on a steep incline. A couple of wandering tribesmen are easily dispatched with a few jabs of your spear. Encounter a little pack of fussy dingos and they are likewise fodder. In these types of fights, the game can seem too easy. But add just a few more tribesmen, or substitute a trio of wolves for those three dingos, and you've gone from academic to intense. Add a village. Meet the wolves at night, in unfamiliar terrain, far from the nearest campfire. Now we're all the way to overwhelming, and we haven't even reached the game's true leviathans: big animals. You don't want to make them angry. A wooly rhino or a bear will come down on you like an angry mountain. I've never been killed faster than that time I thought it would be a good idea to shoot an arrow at a moose. The hooves were real. It was like being the floor at Riverdance.\n\nLuckily, most of the animals are only hostile if you mistreat them, and most predators can be tamed, assuming you can isolate them from their pointy friends, and you've been keeping up with the homework at wild kingdom charm school. The taming is a lot of fun, if vaguely reminiscent of pokemon. Tougher animals need to be worn down before you bait them, but once you get them interested in the free snack, it tends to go pretty well. A lot of the joy in Primal comes from these furry friends. They're fun to pet. And since you've got the interface turned off, they're also vital to exploring safely, as their growls and yelps provide a kind of sketchy biological radar. It's another great example of how beautifully organic the experience of playing Primal can be. Correctly optioned, you're never looking for an icon, or following a trail of magic waypoint lights. You're being there, in the forest, scanning foliage for danger, listening to your companion for clues, listening to the myriad calls of the wild around you, deciphering what feels like a breathing world on its own terms, in its own language. It's a wonderful, unique experience.\n\nThere is a story, and it's a fairly simple one, befitting of the simple cave folk it concerns. There are a few named NPCs, and what they lack in numbers they make up for in sheer lunacy, most of the time. Without spoiling the game's scripted moments, I will simply say that they are a fairly memorable group of people, with similarly memorable interactions. There are collectibles to stalk, and rare beasts with different pet skills, better pet stats, or, just finer pelts. Your village can be upgraded and expanded as you find and recruit more Wenja. Aside from a few NPCs, they don't really interact, but they're fun to watch in an ant farm kind of way; the villagers without real speaking parts get up to all kinds of domestic shenannigans as they pursue their daily lives. And there is the owl, your friend and totem, who would be useless in the default game, had we not agreed to kill that interface and play survival mode. In our version of the game, where no icon pops up in your HUD to inform you of nearby people, quests, and locations, the owl, with his flight and keen eyesight, is an invaluable scouting tool. (And a lot of fun to inhabit and fly.)\n\nI feel as though I've said almost everything that needs saying here, so I'll close with a few notes on killing the interface, because you probably want most of it turned off, but not all of it...\n\nLeave your health bar on. If you turn your pet's health bar off, you can still tell when it's injured because you will have an option to heal it. Your health bar has no in-world equivalent, so if you turn it off, you have no idea when to heal yourself. Leave the environmental prompts on. If you don't, you'll spend ridiculous amounts of time on simple things like looting or trying to align for grapple throws. And finally, leave the thing on that tells you what you're picking up. You kind of need to know what resources you're accumulating, and even if you didn't need to know, it's still silly to suggest that you wouldn't know what you're putting in your own bag.\n\n***A quick thanks/credit to my friend Matt, who coined "unregistered sex offender".","May 22","true","19.1"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","72","31","43","18","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/recommended/371660/","zweistein_Jimmy","monster elf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/","226 products in account","Personally for me - So close to a 10/10\n\nIf you love exploring and finding collectibles with a combination of stone-age open world survival without minding story-rich content then this game is pretty much perfect to spend your time in.\n\nFar Cry Primal is a glimpse into the past that takes the player in a hypothetical setting somewhere in the middle Europe of around 10000 BC. You play as a character who while surviving in the wild finds out that he has the ability to tame wild carnivores and use them as allies in order to achieve the only goal that mattered at that time. Survival at its best and making sure that your tribe survives.\n\nThe aim of the game is to help you emerge in a world that 3 tribes coexist, each trying to claim their own land and right to hunt, live and evolve. Your clan, the Wenja, a group of people who are spread all over the land and which you need to help survive and form a safe community. The Izila, a group of people who seem to be more evolved, are aware of how to use resources like fire and materials in order to build communities and temples and have a basic form of civilization. And the Udam, a group of people that seem to be the last remains of the kind of Homo Erectus (a species that ironically has stoped existing ever since the 70000BC but is set in the game in order to spice things up) and are at the edge of extinction.\n\nThe game offers a very interesting set of gameplay features and skills. You can craft some basic types of weapons at start and then either by evolving your crafting skills (for example finding a unique type of volcano rock to make knives out of) or by exploring(for example through the quests you will find a better type of bow) you get to have upgraded forms of these items. All your items can be crafted with materials you need to find. From gathering wood and rocks to meat and bones and special animal skins (thankfully you can set the gathering animation off). You can use nature to your benefit now and this matters a lot. You can combine strategies using your tamed animals, the element of fire, sneak attacks and your weapons in order to achieve your goals.\n\nGraphics are amazing. I didn’t mind a few FPS drops now and then, im not going to pretend I care for a drop from 60FPS to 40FPS, things were always still smooth while set on Ultra specs. Sound and environmental design is AMAZING. Exploration is very fun and satisfying. The map size is decent, though the shape is similar to that of Far Cry 4’s but something I didn’t really mind at all because the whole design and nature settings is unique. Voice acting was nice, eventhough the languages in the game are completely made up, I find it interesting when voice actors manage to pass feelings, ideas and character to you without making any sense in words, everything was based on the perfect balance between voice and face expressions.\n\nThe game as a new release has some bugs. I missed a Uplay achievement from an action I already completed. There is a type of collectible that when found doesn’t let you interact with it. The AI of people of your clan is not so smart during missions that you have to help them. They might get on the way, get hurt, and then see you as an enemy, which is annoying since every single person you save becomes a +1 member on your growing community – a village which you will spend time and materials to help build and even upgrade.\n\nNow many complain for this game that it is a reskin of farcry 3 and 4. That the map is the same with FC4. That is has no story. The fact is that the trailers provided and the spoiler-free opinions expressed before this was available on PC had me knowing almost exactly where I was stepping in. Hard Core Far Cry fans got something that was not what Far Cry meant to them until now. But you know what the game by itself is great. I loved this game a pretty damn lot. Only couple of things i mind is that I wish this game had a longer cmpaign and that that it's too bad it hasn’t a co-op option, like going hunting with a friend, or having a game mode with special co-op missions. That would be sweet (if done right).\n\nAll in all, I loved this game. It left me satisfied. It had enough content to leave me happy. There were some fun moments. And there were some funny moments too. I do recommend this game but I kinda wish there was a bit more into this making it worthy to spend at least 10 or 20 more hours in it. DLCs will cost money which makes me also wish this was a 50 buck title and not a 60.\n\nIt’s a 8/10 with potential of 9/10 if some fixes take place soon.\nIt’s nice, its beautiful, its enjoyable but a bit expensive for what it offers.","March 11","true","45.0"," 62 of 98 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","62","98","4","2"

Spending 90% of the game time trying to unlock things with basic functionality such as traps, throwing daggers (or "shards"), quivers and the most basic bag capacity, so that your hunts for resource won't be all for naught.\nAs I feared it's very much the same as all the previous games, just without a lot of content like a wingsuit, parashute, vehicles, customizable weapons, voice acting in an actual language, and at least one interesting antagonist, like Pagan Min or Vaas.\n\nOn top of that I will also have to complain about stuttery performance on my Nvidia GTX 980 Ti, where the performance will at times slow down the game, followed by a strange rapid speed up to make up for the time passed. Not to mention the game having had a terrible release, completely unable to even launch the game and without public official response from publisher or developer for hours.\nI've still not been given any answers from Ubisoft support, even 11 hours after release and 11 hours after my support request going up.\n\nUpdate 2: Having contacted Ubisoft support immediately after discovering the problem together with a whole lot of others on the Steam community, I'm yet to recieve ANY answer from support.

Reccomendation is on personal opinion only.\n1. Hunting- Pretty boring due to inept animal AI and lack of danger. 5/10\n2. Gathering- Not the best change that they made, now making people run out and find resources to upgrade your village I personally didnt care for the fetching since most buildings only upgrade twice. 5/10\n3. Weapons- Club, Bow, Spear, Grenades, and....uhh thats about it I guess. Headshots with a bow kill all early level humans in one shot, 4-6 take down a bear. The DLC club is meant to be swung wildly and haphazardly into the path of your enemies, since I only used that club I cant review the normal ones. The spear is pretty neat. 6/10\n4. Enemies- Clubman, Spearman, Bowman, Grenademan, and Heavy. Not sure if there are more vareity since I only played 3 hours. For the most part they are pathetically easy to kill, especially if you possess the DLC club which can kill most low level creatures and humans in one shot. Suprsingly you can kill the enemy civilian women. 5/10\n5. Upskirts- Balls, and Bush. Pretty odd thing to add, rule 34 incoming Pretty sure I saw a enemy and a woman having sexual intercourse in a camp (think is was called lost grotto if Im not mistaken) 69/10\n6. Story- Its okay, I liked it enough to get 3 hours in, but there is no hook to the story it doesnt draw you in. 4/10\n7. Animals- The variety was welcome, but most use the same animations as the last game, the bears look pretty awesome though. Beware of the orgy of goat moans as you travel through oros. 8/10\n8. DLC packs- Didnt get my resouce packs, didnt even need them. 0/10\n9. DLC missions-First mammoth mission was...disappointing. Mammoth was animated poorly, and unrealistic. Mammoth can run basically forever and can get killed in 2-3 hits. If you want a good laugh the physics upon death are pretty funny. 4/10\n10. Enviroment- Forest, rivers, waterfalls, and mountains. Overall not bad. 9/10\nFinal thoughts:This game looked and seemed like it would be fun, but I guess since I was rambo in Farcry 3-4 being a bowman lost its luster. Wait until the error problems are solved then and only then buy the game, but personally  I would wait for a price drop if you want to get the game. Also make sure your computer can handle the game, the graphics are really good.\n6/10","March 1","false","2.6"," 47 of 74 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","47","74","5","0"

There is not that much varation in those quests but altho a FEW was enjoyable. I did enjoy the Beast Master Hunt quests alot since it felt more action packed and it was a more realistic kind of a hunt.\n\nOut in the world when hunting animals, it gets very annoying, shoot them once and they run straight to f¨¨king Africa and you have to chase them for a good 2 miles, i mean sure its realistic but considering the miles the animals runs, its just ridicoulus. If they bleeded out a bit faster i wouldnt have pointed it out that much tbh.\n\nOut in the world i did not notice that much bugs, it was mostly the Companion AIs and interactions that was completely bugg infested.\n\nHas a good pace on leveling up, gathering materials and its not too grindy, the ONLY problem i ever encountered with grinding for hides was to find Badgers, but i was most likely in the wrong place for it. Otherwise it was a breeze and it was exciting to find rare kinds of animals and start hunting them.\n\nBEASTS:\nFirst of all: Healing the Beasts seems to be VERY broken, the option to heal them doesnt pop up as it should, so you have to reposition them, yourself and wiggle it out in order to get the option, VERY ANNOYING.\n\nThere is one more MAJOR thing i want to say about them, once you get the Bloodfang Sabertooth, you will probably never switch it out. Ive let it run into camps and strongholds, let it take on 20 ppl and then the companion comes back with a big smile and still half health left. This pet is by far the best pet you can get.\n\nThe Wolfs are pretty decent companions, they reveal the area of the map, they got decent damage, speed and stealth so they are mostly all around "okay".\n\nBears have some kind of a Personality Disorder wich makes them think they are a wrecking ball, i dont know whats up with their AI but as quickly they see destructible fences or objects, they rush into it without a command or anything, they just go for it. So going stealth with a bear is NOT a good option, pretty decent amount of health tho and they take the attention of the enemies from you.\n\nDid not go that much with Leopards and Lions but as the minor input i got from the Leopards atleast is that they are great at stealth, good speed but if they get seen in a camp, they are pretty much dead.\n\nAnd last, probably the most OP pet there is, Sabertooths, i STRONGLY recommend to get it as early as possible, they are amazing killing machines! Fastes companion in game, they can catch up to anything in a very small amount of time, great amount of damage and decent health.\n\nWEAPONS:\nGreat varation when it comes to weapons, it really felt like each weapon had a defined and specific purpose wich felt really good. no complains about them and they look awesome aswell! :O Most used weapon was the Double-Arrow Bow ;)\n\n\nSTORY:\n\nGreat story, written very well and was probably the ONLY thing that kept me playing this game tbh. It was good characters, the ooga booga launguage did not put me off that much, since it fits the whole idea of it being in the Stone Age:ish times.  Not many complains about it. PS: You are gonna love Urki.\n\n\nBUGGS:\n\nCompanion AI is very bugged, the interaction to heal them doesnt work properly, you have to wiggle and reposition to force it out. Some pets cant jump up ledges or swim at all, Only Sabertooths can jump up ledges as i noticed and only Bears can swim.\n\nThe "Kill Command" for the companions is bugged aswell sometimes, it comes up saying "Your beast cant reach the target" even tho it stands RIGHT afront of it.\n\nThe Bears have personality disorder of a wrecking ball, and very aggressive since plenty of times it just ran off into a camp and started killing people without being provoked or harmed.\n\nSometimes Arrows got completely lost? For example, i shoot 3 arrows into a cannibal, retreive the arrows, i get 2 back.What happen to the 3rd? if its SUPPOSTE to break occasionally, it would be nice to know :P\n\nWhen you open up the world map, could have been a personal problem with my computer, my FPS drops down to 2 or 3, so using the map to travel around gets very annoying since it takes longer than it should, was a bit un-sure to include this since it could be a problem that my PC have, and not the game itself.\n\nIS IT WORTH BUYING?:\n\nWell, if you love open world games where you can just run around and just do random stuff, explore with a good friend at your side, killing people in many ways, then yes. It has a good story, its interesting and it really provides with plenty of "the enemies wiew on the conflict" moments, good plot twists and good characters. I would honestly say its just a bit rough around the edges and it needs a patch or two to fix some stuff. Otherwise i did enjoy it. :)","March 6","true","25.7"," 75 of 125 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","75","125","10","0"

I see that a lot of people are bashing the game for not being the same as all the previous installments in the series, others doing the same for it to be to similar to the previous games...go figure :)  So, my approach to the game was x-hours of youtubing all the Far Cry games, watching gameplay, reading way to many reviews and in the end Primal easily stood out as something different.\n\nFor me as a FC novice I found the absent of big guns and frantic shoot-outs really refreshing, while at the same time, you DO get them frantic shoot-outs and melees, only this time it's bows & arrows, spears, clubs and whatnot that makes your day. Ok, it might not be that a big difference from any gun-loaded game you played a hundred times before in that sense, but the environment, the dynamics and made-up language together with the overall ambience in the game does a pretty good job convincing me that I'm a proper 10.000 BC bad@ss hunter-gatherer :)\n\nI'm running the game on Ultra settings on my pc, and even before I got the DLC HD-package the graphics was blowing my mind. After installing the HD-package I'd got a friend to play the game so I could just sit back and enjoy the stunning scenery of the Land of Oro.\n\nIf you're into adventure/action pc-games where you don't need eight left-hand fingers to pull out as the winner of a fight and don't have fetish on casting spells while doing acrobatics, this might be just the game for you.\n\nHighly recommended!","April 16","true","36.0"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","1"

Despite how short it was. It's an alright game, really. But that's just it, it's nothing more than that. The map is recycled from FC4 apparently although differently laid out so you probably won't notice when playing. The gameplay is pretty much identical to FC3 or 4 except with different fluff, this time around you can have a pet, you drop guns in favor of melee and throwing weapons, or a bow. It's pretty fun to throw spears at a Mammoth, or blow an arrow through an enemies skull but the game offers nothing special, it's a time filler game that you'll probably uninstall and never replay once you are done with it, obviously there are no multiplayer either.\n\nI won't tell you not to play it, but I won't recommend either - it's simply not worth the price. If you are a fan of the series i'd suggest waiting until the price drops or a good sale that puts it at 20€ or so, that's more along what it's worth.

I watched a few videos on the game and thought it was interesting. So I decided to buy it regardless of what peope were saying. And I'm glad I made that decision. The game has a decent story. It's about what'd you expect considering FarCry isn't extremely story driven. The free roam is a great aspect of the game. Infact, I felt myself not wanting to do story missions because there were so many other things to do. I loved taming the beasts, especially the boss fights, it added an extra difficulty to the game. I also liked the crafting and upgrading weapons or building the Wenja bases for upgrades. But I finally beat the story and I enjoyed the entire game.\n\nSome people were saying that the game felt like a re-skin of FarCry 4, and I can agree. The game did play and feel a lot like FarCry 4. But it wasn't in a bad way. The game had enough variety as to where it was entertaining and wasn't getting in the way. Rather than buying weapons you had to make them. Or rather than claiming bell towers you had to light bonfires.

Personally, I like how hunting and expanding one's influence is more intended. The world is beautiful and they did great in the animations of wildlife (gotta love watching a sabor take down a deer xD ).\nAll that to say that the most intriguing part to me is the focus upon primative groups and natives as they were before and without technology.

And it is. However after you get past the initial shock, the game is just a tedious scavenge for endless crafting material in an overpopulated world where you can't move 20 ft without getting attacked by something.\n\nSomehow unlike its predecessors, the game suffers from an amazing sense of enemies spawning right behind you, even after you've just cleared out an area. The weapons become tedious and unexciting (and there are realistically only 3 weapons), the missions are dry, repetitive and mundane, the emotional character connections are completely dead, the story is as primative as the game name and the worst of it all, is the ending is completely and utterly anti-climatic. Mostly on account of there is no actual final mission, you just finish all of the main quests (in any order) and then BAM, you're done. Finally, because it was a grind getting there.\n\nStealth is now even more clunky and vexxing, and since the bow or knife-throw doesn't insta-kill enemies anymore there is no reliable way to ensure a stealth kill shy of a take-down or throwing a spear through their guts which sends the corpse flying across the map likely alerting others to your "stealth kill". Beasts, even the stealth beasts, are just going to tip off enemies, who somehow know that your beast is no normal beast but you the fkn beast master must be hiding nearby.\n\nThe key to this game is the "beast taming" - which is all well and good but then you set out to do epic beast hunts and tame super beasts after throwing everything but the hut sink at it just to pitch your new uber beast up against a single "heavy" tribesman and watch the ****ing thing lose to a single man! Which isn't so bad, considering a sabertooth tiger will die to a fkn honey badger (I guess that is true to Far Cry's demonic honey baders that make the killer rabbit from monty python look tame).\n\nThe crafting items required and skills in this game have been expanded considerably, which leads you to spend forever collecting ♥♥♥♥. So much so that the game offers you an option to disable the loot and collection animations to speed things up.\n\nI wanted to open this review with:\nIn Far Cry 4, you ride into battle on an elephant. If Far Cry Primal, you ride into battle on a sabertooth tiger.\n\nCatch is, the riding of beasts is just a gimmick to compensate for a lack of vehicles to get around. Don't actually ride into battle on a sabertooth tiger. You'll both die in no time. I long my signature silenced Shredder and grenade launcher back.\n\nRespect to Ubi for the hard work in this game, they've done an amazing job.

Honestly, the story fits, the combat style is interesting, and the gameplay in general was solid. The early game survival aspect lasted until mid game for me, maybe even later, and was to me a core component of immersion into the time period. The combat did to some may seem stale, but i believe the progression of combat was timed perfectly, not becoming easy until the last mission of the game. Unlike farcry 4, which was a terrible game, this game doesnt seem to force you in any set direction, and with the taming system encourages exploration, with some interesting side quests for the legendary tames towards the end of the game. I had fun doing them and once again it had shown me complete immersion while you stalk the named beasts. The only negative I have about this game is probaly how short it was, which is not really a negative because considering all the single player games ive played in the last few years, the length of this game matches perfectly, but to me being an older gamer, I am used to longer games.\n\nOverall 10/10\n","April 22","true","26.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","0"

In the face of spending 60 bucks for all new materials this game lacked characters with memorable personalities that really shined as the previous Far Cry, in depth melee combat and a mechanics we have seen time and time again thus making the game feel like a spin off such as Blood dragon than an actual new Far Cry that shines.\nNot a bad game but very mediocre at best and it pains me to even rate the game as I wanted to give it a thumbs up but I cannot because doing so will be telling you that its a must buy. I can recommend it if you love the setting the game offers and just want more Far Cry no matter what it is.\n\nVideo Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQDJvjxS06s\n\nPros + The hunting mechanic in the game is well done. Tigers, Dire wolves, Mammoths so on.\n+ Environment and graphics are really well done and make one feels like they are actually in the B.C period\n+ The language created to go with the game is very immersive.\n+ Treating my Sabertooth like a pet cat, then being able to ride it along with mammoths etc.\n+ The story pacing for the subtitles is perfect so that the player can follow with the story fine.\n+ Every weapon can be on fire and used to set environments on fire and thus fire is a powerful element. Very fun to use.\n+ Plenty of missions and side missions to do on the map\n\nCons - Unmemorable characters in this game. Farcry 3 had Vaaj, 4 had Pagin Min, Primal had... who?\n- The hunting to upgrade the base gets tedious after hours of hours of play to upgrade the base to progress in the story and also the lack of even customizing your tribe.\n- Overused Far Cry mechanic that needs to change. Players who played all the Farcry will feel really burned out\n- The map is the Farcry 4 map, placed on top of each other its the exact map and breaks immersion if you realize and spot the geological areas in the game, Farcry 4 takes place in Himalayas while Primal is supposed to take place somewhere in Europe lol so thus breaking immersion.\n- The melee combat is stale without the ability to block at all and feels unengaging mostly just hit hit and move away.\n- The taming could had been so much better than throwing meat and being able to summon multiple times. Felt very unrewarding when you earn the beasts in the game.\n- No multiplay of any sort so replayability dies off after finishing.\n\n\nConclusion - Ubisoft has dropped the bomb on this one for me and I didn't hate it since I sat through it but if it had taken the game farther back in the period where dinosaurs existed then it would had been AMAZING. The game just felt like a spin off but at the same time didn't offer enough materials to keep me interested from sleeping at times literally.\nI thought it was mediocre and to be honest I can see some people enjoying this if you never played the Far Cry series or just like the setting in general, but having played all of it I am so burned out from the same mechanics which didn't really change for this game. I hope Far Cry 5 will bring glory back to the series or else it's time for a new IP.\n\nCheck this game out if you just love Far Cry and want more, otherwise wait for price drop. It isn't a game you will want to get right away if you played every Far Cry ever expecting something new. If anything check Farcry 3 and 4 if you never played it.","March 12","false","18.4"," 84 of 153 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","84","153","9","7"

Ride some of your tamed beasts or hitch onto a wild young mammoth.  Yes, you can do mounted combat.  You can use all your weapons while mounted and your beasts will even attack as well.\n-Day and night. Packs of wolves hunting at night.  You can capture an outpost at night and eliminate your enemies while they're sleeping.\n-Plenty of side missions and random events.\n-Skinning and harvesting have a short animation so its quick.\n-Primitive weapons and crafting!  I put these two together because for every weapon you have, you build.  Harvest materials from all over the map to build and upgrade and replenish your stock of them.\n-Combat with primitive weapons is really fun. You carry every weapon in the game with you. No more weapon shops where you swap loadouts.  You can do takedowns with different weapons for different kill animations.  Ignite your weapons and arrows for deadly and interesting action (sabertooth will drop and roll when on fire).\n-Fire good! Fire bad! It's so useful and deadly in this game. I remember one mission where i had to burn enemy crops; I took some high ground and kept shooting in fire arrows which burned up the entire farm and most of the enemies in it. The fire spread so much that I started to take damage from it. Good times.\n-Some of your beasts do takedown/kill animations when you take them hunting!\n\nTheres some more good things I can say about this game but these are just some highlights. Now for the (not so) bad...\n\nCons:\n-Short story. It's not rich but it's not bad either. I enjoyed the language and the historical setting. But it was way too short that it made me regret paying a full price when I've paid way less for games I haven't even beaten yet. It should have had more story missions aside from the main plot.  If I had at least 3 or 4 more story missions with Urki, I'd cry happiness.\n-No multiplayer. Games are just so much more fun when you can have a buddy join in.\n-No challenge for achievements.\n\nEven though I beat the story in a fraction of the time I played this game, I enjoyed it very much. I like the far cry games and Primal is easily my favorite of them all. The gameplay keeps me glued to it and makes me want to get 100% completion. I'd start a new game after too.\n\nYou should get this game. It's fun. But buy it at a cheaper price.","March 7","true","43.2"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

The game play is solid and enjoyable and loaded with features. Its biggest flaw is the lack of incentive to use all the pets, skills, and features in the game because of the lack of content. The content that exists starts to get monotonous by the finish because of the copy and paste programming used to fill it up. Here is an analogy to sum up Far Cry Primal.\n\nOne of the top restaurants in the world wants to make a great dessert. They hire some of the top pastry chefs to work on it. But the restaurant is impatient and wants to start selling the dessert before the chefs have time to finish. One chef insists it is great the way it is, and the customers won't notice whats missing. When the first customers order it, they are in awe when it is brought to the table. It's one of the most beautiful desserts they have ever seen. When they taste it, it has almost no sugar. When they ask about it, the chefs say that they will add more later for an extra charge.","March 22","true","702.2"," 113 of 212 people (53%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","53","113","212","40","3"

While the game in and of itself is fun.. the AAA title price point is laughable. Almost all assets were recycled from Far Cry 4 and once you get past the initial novelty (about 20 min in), the game gets old almost immediately.  All of this is made worse by the rampant BS pushed by the dev team prior to launch as to how hard they worked to make the game original, and feel unique.  Zero effort was put in to polish pre-existing systems or make the game unique other than visually.  Its a game about the survival of your tribe... with ZERO survival elements. Save your money.

This game excells at being different in comparison to the other Far Cry titles by being not that different at all. Same mechanics, mostly same animations.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dangerhesh/recommended/371660/","dangerhesh","Dacia Sandero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dangerhesh/","280 products in account","THE GOOD\n\n1. Loads of things to do\n- The map is full of quests, different animals, gathering, terrain, and enemies.  Perhaps TOO full of that last one.  Sometimes it's hard to get anywhere due to all the enemy tribes you encounter, but the world feels as alive as in previous FC games.  Good but not overwhelming crafting.\n\n2. Graphics\n- They won't blow your mind.  But they look good.  Even up to "pretty darn good" in a few areas.\n\n3. Period weapons and gadgets\n- If you are interested in fighting only with a bow different types of pointy and bashy sticks then this is a blast.  There's only a bit of snark there.  I always enjoy archery in games.  And you certainly get that here.  So I'm enjoying it.\n\n4. The cut scenes\n- There aren't too many of them and you can skip the vast majority.  When cutscenes are robust and advance my interest in a game then I am all for them.  Read on for reasons why you may not be interested in the cutscenes for this game.\n\n5. The animals\n- They really did do a good job with the animals.  They all have distinct sounds that you will hear off in the distance as you move about.  They behave as you would expect.  The deer are shy.  The jaguars are stealthy.  The mammoths are friendly until you ♥♥♥♥ them off.  The taming is... eh.  Not my thing.  It's alright. Not to worry. You can ignore if you want.  You've got your trusty machine-bow-and-arrow-sniper-railgun-flamethrower.\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\n1. Old stanky map\n- It's the FC4 map.  It underwent a small tweaking.  But it's the FC4 map.  Lazy sausage pumps...\n\n2. Ooka Booka Language\n-  Don't look away.  Don't pay attention to the art direction, scenery, character animation, or any of the other stuff on your screen. Don't go to the toilet with your headphones and listen to the story.  Just keep your eyes fixed on these subtitles if you want to have any clue what the story is about.\n\n- For those of us who watch Game of Thrones.  We know how incorporating a newly created language SHOULD be done - The Dothraki.  A language created just for one story should advance that story rather than impede it.  In GoT, even during the Dothraki scenes we didn't get only their language.  Sometimes there weren't subtitles and a character did our translating and other times there were simply no translations at all and we relied on the visuals.  Not this game though... every scene... every word...all the way through... subtitles.  I'd like someone to find out how many times you here the fake word "Wenja" throughout the game.  A punishingly gigantic amount I can tell you.\n\n3.  The story\n- Who the hell knows what it is because of the Ooka Booka langauge.  Previouc FC have had rich stories, excellent villans (well at least one), and rich cutscenes.  Maybe this one does.  Maybe it doesn't.  Do a lot of reading of some mediocre broken english if you'd like to find out.\n\n4.  The gameplay\n- It's simplisticly fun and easy.  When you watch your character make his first bow you think "Ah, this bow will be poop because it's my first one."  No no... that bow is all you need.  Son, that thing shoots 200 yards before the arrow starts to fall at all.  I was quite disappointed at how easy the bows are.  The melee weapons are exaftly as you'd expect them to be - not that fun.  Also, the x-ray vision and shiny loot is the kind of console-coddling that I can't stand from Ubi.\n\n\n\nTL;DR - Some things suck, some things don't, but it's definitely not worth $60. Wait for a sale.","March 1","false","12.1"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","22","39","2","2"

I would not however, recommend it for those who enjoyed previous Farcry games purely for their gunplay, explosives, and so on.\n\nI am writing this as of patch 2, about 3 weeks after launch, and I am still encountering a number of bugs. Specifically:\n\n* The cutscene audio frequently goes out of sync, usually the audio goes ahead of whats on the screen\n* The recap segments have spoiled elements of the story for me a few times, showing me things that hadn't happened yet\n* When I try to close the program normally, it occasionally comes up with a Windows "This program has crashed" error screen\n* Some of the objects and people you need to interact with are extremely picky about where you need to stand in order to activate them. The worst example of this was when I needed to speak to a person who was tied to the ground, and I had to jump into the air and talk to him mid-air in order for the interact prompt to appear. Normally you just need to circle the person or object a few times until you find the very tiny, invisible sweet spot. This was an issue with Farcry 3 and 4, and so I can see that this is still not fixed.\n\nLastly I wanted to comment on the story. I'm a little dissappointed with it so far. I'm 20 hours in and I still don't really feel like I'm part of this vast, epic struggle as was the case in previous Farcry titles. That isn't necessarily a problem, but coming from a long time series fan it is a little bit of a let down. However, the gameplay and environment is engaging enough to keep me entertained, though not quite as enthralled as I had hoped for.","March 27","true","22.2"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","18","32","0","0"

Although I am a huge Native American fan as I am half Native American. I do tend to leech to anything that has that style.\n\nI am about 10% done with the game at the moment and I have to say so much fun. I was a bit worried buying this game since the reviews seem not soo great. I listened to my gut and went for it since it was on sale. First off just let me say I have not played the other Farcry games, I know a lot of the complaints are due to the game feeling like Farcry 4. I can't really comment on that since I have never played it. The best way I can describe this game is this is exactly how I was hoping ARK would be. A fun survival game that allows you to explore, tame beasts, build huts/houses, help your fellow villagers and just do whatever you want along with doing the story, random objectives that pop up. The world feel like it is very alive. Everywhere I turn there is some sort of animal. Some that want to kill and some that do not like butterflies, birds and turtles. The scenary is very nice. I have caught my self just climbing to the top and looking at the beautiful world. I personally feel the game does a good job of setting the scenary and then bringing you into it. The native tongue they speak is something I really enjoy as well. It really makes me feel like I am back in 10,000 bc. I will most definately keep playing this game for a long time I can see, as this is a game I have been looking for for a long time.

I love the feeling of roaming the world with a saber tooth tiger by my side as well. The game is controller friendly. It says "partial controller support" but it uses the whole controller. The stone age weapons are refreshing to me after playing countless games with guns. I'm not sure some of the negative reviews are deserved because I noticed those players only had an hour or two on record. I have 21.9 hours logged in just two days and I still have tons to do.

It's more than immersive - it transports me to another place (especially when I remove the HUD elements). It doesn't just allow for emergent game play - it encourages it. If anything, I find the 'story' elements often intrude on what is otherwise an almost zen like experience for me.\n\nI understand that some may find it repetitive; I have certainly lost interest in Assassin's Creed, (and other Ubisoft products) which are in many ways very similar, but there is something about the Far Cry series that really has me hooked.\n\nSteam controller works well, and there are a couple of good community configs, but I wish there was an official profile for the game.","March 31","true","55.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

In previous titles you had to do these things for a few upgrades. but in this version you can count on it to do it alot. You can tame different animals with different abilities to fight with, or even ride on some of them. Since it's not a shooter, you have to use different type of weapons: like bows, spears and clubs, to take out your enemies. It's a fun game to do all the main missions, but the side missions will get repetitive after a while.\n\nThe game looks beautiful and runs really smooth, and I didn't discover any setbacks or major bugs.

The animal companion is a blast, I kept switching them out just to watch them duke it out with the enemies.

Hmmmmmm, I wonder why the layout would be similar??\nThe gameplay is great, graphics are phenomenal and the hunter vision and lack of guns is amazing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/recommended/371660/","aps97","[ARX]AnthonyPS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/","140 products in account","Far Cry Primal is an open world, story driven, FPS game set on pre-historic time (10,000 BC). You play as Takkar, a Wenja (some kind of a tribe) warrior that is trying to conquer the Land of Oros for his people. Conflict starts when Takkar found out that Oros is conquered by Udam (cannibal tribe) in the north and by Izila (Sun worshipper) in the south. Far Cry Primal introduces several new features and an entirely new story 'pattern' compared to its predecessors. You are no longer a badass rambo-like warrior or a teenager stranded in an island or a remote area. The main new feature is the taming capability. Along the journey, Takkar was introduced to his skills as a Beast Master, capable to tame dangerous predators and even ride it after you have reached a certain level. In short, Far Cry Primal is a fresh new idea in the Far Cry series that offers the same gameplay pattern but with new environment, features, and challenges.\n\nFirst off, I'm going to talk about the good things. It still has the same gameplay pattern as other Far Cry series - you still have to conquer 'radio towers' (now called bonfires) and enemy encampments while completing your journey in the main story at the same time. It still have the same epic graphics like Far Cry 4 but the story pattern is completely new. Hunting has become a major element in Far Cry Primal since you have to craft everything instead of purchasing it directly from a store. Takkar also has Assassin's Creeds' Eagle Vision that can track animal tracks, blood scents, and enemy heat signatures. This is vital in helping you hunt for animals, especially rare animals. If you love hunting games, Far Cry Primal might not be as realistic as an actual hunting game but it's satisfying enough for me. You will also progress faster compared to previous Far Cry because you'll get permanent XP boost if you rescued a lot of other Wenja (remember the impromptu events). The combat system is obviously very different, there were no guns yet so you only have clubs, throwing shards, several different 'bombs', bows, and spears. You can't butcher the whole base from afar with a .50 cal sniper rifle again, you have to come up close for most of the combat - even the long bow only give you so much attack distance. Their effort to create their own pre-historic language is also worth mentioning, I always respect game developers that pay a lot of attention to details in their games.\n\nNow, the bad things. The content is a lot less compared to Far Cry 4 in order to make it 'makes sense'. But come on, the throwing shards, grappling hooks, animal taming, animal riding, and a ton of other features already don't make sense in the first place. The 'radio tower' part is also much shorter, you won't need to climb anything. Simply kill several enemies, shoot a fire arrow and boom, you're done. No more parkour-ing to the top of a tall tower. Map is also smaller-ish (I'm no expert in measuring virtual stuff) but it's adequate. They really should have put more features in the game. Now, the story. I somehow feel it's much less engaging and very short. As you see from my gameplay, I finished this game only in 23 hours. That 23 hours already gave me a TON of time to fool around completing the side quests, crafting everything, complete my beast collection, and building my village. IMHO, this is the reason a lot of people harshly dismissed this game as a Far Cry 4 re-skin with less content. The short story, little amount of weapon choice, and the less content disappointed them. The main beast taming feature simply couldn't make it up to the amount of lost content. To make it clear, the specific 'lost content' for me is the long and beautifully written story, fighting arena, flying, lots of weapon choices, engaging story, capability to make choices that will affect the outcome of the story, etc.\n\nBut, I still personally love the Far Cry series. I don't really care much about the less content, it's still 23 hours of fun for me. As I said in my thesis, it's a fresh new idea. An entirely different age, a different combat system, different story 'taste' and basically, as long as it's a Far Cry series, I don't care about the reviews - I want to play it. As an analogy, same thing goes for the PAYDAY 2 DLCs, the weapons may be useless and all but as long as it's something new, I want it, regardless of the mostly negative review. I'm not saying this game is 'bad but buy it', it's good and it's worth it, but don't expect to have the same experience as the previous Far Cry series. If you're looking for a very long gameplay, go for Far Cry 4, but if you don't mind the bad things that I mentioned, this game is heavily recommended.","June 2","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main story is long enough, if you include side missions, and if you want to upgrade your gear and village to maximum, and if you go out of your way to tame all the beasts, that adds some time too.\n\nWith the issue with there not being very likeable characters -- just because the characters do not speak English, doesn't make them any less likeable. Each character has his/her own reasons for being a part of Takkar's village, and their own reasons for disliking the enemy factions. They all have their own personalities, and are different from each other.\n\nIn conclusion I find it a really enjoyable game, it's nice to take a breath from Guns and cars and modern tech, and work with the basics. The growing of your character makes that game feel like it progresses very well, and the growing of your village as more and more people join makes the game feel alive. Stunning visuals even on lower graphical settings.","May 25","true","32.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I waited a bit to buy it and after beating it I can say that Ubisoft has fixed the problems.  The game looks beautiful and runs smoothly.  Overall I strongly recommend this game.\n\nI was initially a little hesitant to try this game. A Far Cry game without guns was hard to picture but the combat in Far Cry Primal is fast paced and fun.  I find it especially satisfying to crack skulls with my two handed club and there is enough of a variety of weapons to keep things interesting.\n\nOne area that this game falls short on is stealth.  Being good at stealth is something I have prided myself on in earlier Far Cry games.  The opportunities to employ stealth in this game though are few and far between and since a lot of the environments are relatively flat it is nearly impossible to clear some outposts completely without being seen.\n\nI would put the pets in both the pro and con column.  While it’s pretty awesome to be able to tame a sabretooth cat or a bear and even ride them, at times they are so overpowered that they almost trivialize combat.  Kind of like how in Far Cry 4 you could throw a couple pieces of bait into an outpost and the random bears and tigers that show up would do all the work for you.  They are a big help with hunting though.\n\nMy only major gripe about this game though is the story; there really isn’t much of one.  For most of the game you are completing quests and acquiring villagers or completing quests given to you by said villagers.  Eventually you complete enough quests that you fight and eliminate the rival tribes in the valley and just like that the game is over.  At no time does the game really feel like it has a solid cohesive narrative.  I mostly felt like I spent 60 hours playing non-stop side quests and by the time it was over I was glad for a break.  It was definitely entertaining along the way though and I wager the next time I play through I will probably be able to shave off about 20 hours since I will know what I am doing so the last half of the game won’t drag on so long.\n\nIf you are a fan of the series I don’t think you will be disappointed in buying this game.\n","May 19","true","61.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am hesitant to compare the game on that note however, considering the fact that it generates a world that feels entirely different than previous games.\n\nWildlife feels dangerous until you're better equipped. Night-time is accompanied by an increased traffic of carnivorous animals that of course only furthers itself as you travel away from your Village. Every enemy will become increasingly agressive as you progress further into the world. At first a pack of wolves hunting game might seem trivial, with you crouched in the bushes ready to strike. Though as soon as a cave lion, a group of yak, and a mammoth walk into the picture... you're met with a sudden sense that things could get very bad. They usually do.\n\nI can almost guarantee your first encounter with a Sabretooth will leave you wanting one of your very own, so long as it doesn't eat you first.\n\nThere is slightly more gathering than you might expect, though the game includes a "Rewards Stash." Your stash will increasingly flow with free "loot" items (wood, stone, hide, etc.) as you upgrade your main tribesman's huts. This causes gathering to become an optional thing further into the game, so long as you take the time to upgrade said huts.\n\nThe skill tree is broken down into 8 branches, with each having skills that unlock as you find your fellow Wenja and complete their quests. Upgrading the weapons that each person also gives allows you to craft plenty of dangerous items, giving you plenty of combinations to take down whatever beast, or man is rushing toward you.\n\nLike previous games, this one doesn't immediately tell you what to do once you're through the initial introductions. There are enemy tribes that you will encounter that follow a main story arc. Side-quests begin popping up across the map, and give you the opportunity to earn easy Skill Points, as well as giving you a distraction and well needed practice throwing spears into wolves' faces. Caves allow you a much more stealthy exploration of the game, though often end up with you face to face with the game's stealthier creatures as well. Beast Master Hunts that allow you to kill, or tame the most dangerous animals in Oros. There's plenty to collect and explore!\n\nWhat truly struck me right away with this game is the simple fact that, well... it's pretty. Very, very pretty. If you're able to run this game at higher settings in 1080p and above, you will not be disappointed.\n\nIf you're unsure about the game, wait! This game will be on sale in no time, and is plenty worth your time when you can get it for $30-40!","March 4","true","21.3"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","0"

Nobody said it would be survival, its is Farcry in the primal age and it does it well.\n\nSo, my personal opinion so far after gloriously riding my blood drenched sabertooth into battle is that its a solid and interesting new edition to the farcry franchise. A breath of fresh air in a franchise that direly needed it. The combat is visceral and hilariously satisfying. From the thumping sound of hitting someone with a club to watching your badass pet take down a person in the most merciless of ways.\n\nGathering is solid and for the first time to me, actually fun. I dunno if its actually different or I finally let it in but its a lot more satisfying then it used to be to me. Building up your village is somewhat meh but it is pretty fun to watch it grow and gain the new abilities associated with it.\n\nIf you like visceral combat, satisfying hunts and a decent story. I don't see why you shouldn't get this game.

Some have commented that this game feels too simalar in style to the previous two games, and in some ways that is true. However, its not a bad thing. The Far Cry theme fits very well with this time period. In fact, it feels more realistic and on edge knowing that at any moment you could be attacked by a gang of cannibals or a sabertooth tigher. The gameplay, once you get it down, is really fun and brutal. If you like melee and traditional forms of combat, you will probably enjoy this. The graphics are also very nice, even on low settings the game is stunning. The combat upgrades, control over various animals, and the village building system all give Far Cry Primal a unique feeling. Definitely worth a try for those of you that are skeptical.","March 2","true","24.4"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","14","27","4","0"

When I heard about Primal I was hardly disappointed due to lack of guns because I knew the true spirit of the game would go uninterrupted.\n\nStealthly taking over outposts via bows and knives.\n\nAiming with bows has changed the game (without reticle). Previous installments allow you to aim with iron sights. The bows in Primal don't have them. Your shots fly about one arrowhead (drawn) north, directly on the left edge of your intial arrowhead position before the draw. This makes aiming with a drawn arrow difficult without practice, albeit a fresh challenge. However if that type of aiming with the bow carried over to previous installments or other games, that would not be good. It may be reason to turn the reticle on. Other than that the game is a new twist on old Far Cry fashion. I've enjoyed it so far.\n\nIf you enjoyed Shangri-La, you will enjoy Primal. If not, skip this one.\nIf you have never played a Far Cry title before I would not reccomend this as an entry to the series because it's probably best fit for a particular playstyle.","March 3","true","18.2"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","14","27","3","0"

From what i have seen, a lot of the poor reviews are from people that are having problems due to their own computer issues and thus it is often easier to just blame the game. I struggle to see why fans of the Far Cry series would not like this game. It is stunning in every way.\n\nI have played all of the Far Cry series and after playing just 2.9 hours of this one so far, i am completely blown away and addicted. Graphics are breathtaking and i have had no issues at all so far. Game is being played with all settings maxed out (Ultra) @ 1920x1200 and it is smooth as silk (i7 4790K @4GHz OC'd to 4.7, 16GB Memory, R9 390 @8Gb).  In the 3 hours i have played, i still havent even hit 4% of the game yet. The map is massive and the beauty of it compels you to explore and take in the scenery and explore some more. Easier to give you an example of what i mean. I was wondering across the mountains and decided to find a nice spot and sit and wait for some birds to fly across with Bow and Arrows at the ready. To my left, a huge Elk came wandering by. Me being a bit itchy fingered i drew back the bow and fired an arrow into the Elk. Unsurprisingly it ran away and so i continued in wait to line a good shot up on some birds. 5 Minutes later, i received a pair of huge Elk Antlers up my back side. It had circled and flanked me and attacked me savagely. While i was trying to back away and react, a Wolf jumped on the Elk and tore it to shreds. I waited till the Elk was dead and then killed the wolf and skinned them both. Then i continued on with my bird hunt and eventually got a couple. At this rate i am going to have many hours of breathtaking fun. Money well spent and anyther great Far Cry game. Possibly even the best of the series.\n\nThat is what Far Cry Primal brings you. Unique experiences, beauty and complete freedom. Would definitely recommend. Abolutely love the game.","March 2","true","50.3"," 111 of 220 people (50%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","50","111","220","12","9"

Then remove a huge chunk of variety that previous Far Cry games brought to the table with tons of weapons and gadgets.  Also remove interesting antagonists like Vaz and compelling motivation like seeing your brother killed.  Enemies will detect you from insane distances, sometimes without line of sight in classic Far Cry fashion.  To anyone who says it's not fair to judge this game by it's predecessors, I don't know what to tell you.  If a game comes out that's a copy of a previous game but worse, the comparison draws itself.\n\nThe game is very pretty.  I loved the lighting and scenery.  The few new elements like taming animals and improving your village are interesting. However the pet AI is bad and even though there are lots of different animals to tame, it is easy to get some of the best pets early on which makes the others pointless.  The village upgrading seems more like an excuse to convince you to run around and gather more resources that are scattered every five feet.  Heavies make a reappearance, but without the variety of items in previous Far Cry games the only viable way to fight them is the heavy takedown skill which removes a lot of the flexibility that made taking outposts a fun challenge instead of a timewaster.  The game takes a stab at variety with the bee bombs, berserk bombs, and fire bombs but in the end they are all useful as distractions at best against stronger enemies.  One weapon they really got right was the spear.  It is extremely fun to use melee and ranged but they break after a few uses and you will never have more than a few of them at a time.  The game will let you carry more two-handed clubs than spears for some reason.  And that basically defines this game.  The things this game does that are fun are too few and hard to come by.","March 15","false","18.3"," 39 of 77 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","39","77","3","0"

This game is great, It is so much fun, the graphics are beautiful and I just cannot keep from playing it. However my only problem with the game, not sure if it's a glitch or what, but if you tame a Cave Bear, you cannot mount it. But the cave bear out puts a lot of damage and can take a lot of hits. But I would like it if we could ride the Cave Bear instead of just a regular bear, because I mean you can ride a mammoth, So we should be able to mount it. But overall this is my favorite Far Cry game. I enjoy the different weapons, Like there are three types of bows, Just a regular Bow, then you have the longbow, and my personal favorite is the Double Bow where you shoot two arrows at once. Did I mention you can ride a Mammoth. This game is so much fun, sometiems it does seem repetitive, for example, the Bonfires/Outpost, but so were the towers in Far Cry 3. You ran up a tower, and you got a piece of the map. Kinda the same except you have to kill some enemies then light the bonfire. But other than that the missions are fun.

Its pretty good, i am getting 50-60 fps on max setting, sometimes i dip lower for whatever reason, but this is only about 5-10% of the time.\nStory-good concept, and emotionally draws me in after you have ur first battle against the udam, but as far as the enjoyment of the quests so far, i am not very pleased (i am also not that far in, so i plead ignorance here)\nHunting-ok this is some beef i have, you are almost always in hunter vision if you want to be effective which i hate, and i knew i would hate that, it makes everything grey and super yellow glows, it can be destructive to the immersion. I do like how you have to hunt for food now in order to heal instead of having an unlimited number of bandages to put over that one bullet stuck in your forearm (farcry 3 & 4). But the hunter vision annoys me, i wish i could play the game without it and still do good, but its tough, i also really am bother by the sheer amount of creatures and people, its the stone age, i didnt know there would be this many humans to bump into, also i am bothered by animals literally running into me there are so many, i would think animals would be better at avoiding humans, and also maybe having less than 100 deer in a small valley that would probably realistically have under 10 or so animals in it... oh there is also your whole tribe living in that valley.. and the cannibals. This is somethign i really dislike, the amount of people and animals is literally tooooooo much, i know this could be easily modded on the PC i am just waiting for someone to do it, PLEASE someone do this. i really like the environments though, and hunting is much more interesting with the tall grass. Its also nice that animals bleed out and what not.\nWeapons-People complain about the weapons, but i think they are fine, maybe it should be a little bit harder to make one and have them last longer, they do feel a bit like minecraft as far as the duration and useage goes. But maybe that goes hand in hand with the sheer amount of ♥♥♥♥ im killing. Dont expect a vast array of weapons to pick from, its the ♥♥♥♥ing stone age. Your lucky you get as many that are actually in the game. So i am pleased here. And getting headshots with the bow is very satisfying with the one hit kill (which is realistic!! this should happen!!)\nimmersion- i think i would be alot more immersed if it wasnt for the damn number of things i bump into, it feels less like your hunting and more like your fighting a bunch of mobs from a mmo when this happens. I really would like to see the nights be a bit more hazardous too, also i feel like less npcs in general would be better, and maybe make hunting last longer than just using the hunter vision, and shooting an arrow at a deer and using hunter vision to go find it after it dies. perhaps a more manual mode of finding these blood trails would have been better, and of course with less animals in general it would create a higher risk of missing because you cant just go find another  so easily.\nAll in all though, its decent thus far, i think if they had made a few more changes (cough cough, had me on the game design team xD) it would have been alot more immersive than it is, it has alot of potential, and the stone age idea is fun as all get out (if you are in any way drawn to the savageness of what humans are then you will enjoy it). overall with my short play time, i would give this game a 8/10, although with a few simple tweaks it could easily be a 9 or a 9.5. i would still recommend this game.","March 1","true","18.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Sure, the one armed guy pees on you and calls you "♥♥♥♥ Man" for the rest of the game. Sure, there were some funny parts. The game's graphics are good as always with a Far Cry game. But really?

This is the first game to accomplish that (for me) since The Witcher 3. The environment in Far Cry Primal is rich, diverse, vibrant, and beautiful. Sometimes I just have to stop and admire the scenery. The story is somewhat primitive (yeah, I know), but it's enough to keep you engaged and give you some direction. As some others have mentioned, you might find the game more enjoyable and immersive if you disable some of the UI features, especially the minimap. The game is not particularly difficult, even on the 'hard' difficulty setting; however, it's still very enjoyable. There's just something to be said about using a pet owl to drop fire bombs on a village before charging in on the back of a sabertooth tiger and impaling people with spears. The only thing I don't like is no option for third-person view. First-person is great for shooters, but I'd much prefer third-person for games like this with primarily melee/throwing weapon combat.

If you go into your firewall settings turn firewall off and boot the game it will run. Then after the it gets to the menu you need to close the game and go back into your firewall settings and enable your firewall. Then you should be able to launch the game like any other game and have your firewall up. For some reason it only happend on the initial boot of the game. Now that I have figured that out and have played for about 5 hours now I would have to say wow. The graphics are stunning some people are complaining about fps drops I have not so far. However I do have two GTX 970's on board with intel I7 also. The game runs smooth for me almost fully maxed out with minor tweaking and the stone age world is amazing. I would say go for a harder game setting to enjoy the game to the fullest potential. I really like the crafting and have not progressed to far in the story, only because like in every far cry game I try to craft, build, discover, unlock all I can before I progress any farther in the story. So far enjoyed the game minus having to figure out how to get around the error message at the beginning. I hope that once others either do what I said to play the game or UBI release a patch they go back in and fix the horrible reviews, becuase this potentially could be one of the best Far Cry games to date. Personal favorite is Far Cry 3 however this could very well take its place. Being able to tame the beasts and use them to help fight is pretty entertaining. To be able to tame an animal is a little to easy however, and wish you could give more commands to the animals, like weak fast attack, strong attack, charge, stealth, etc..... that would make the beast aspect of the game more challenging and honestly a little more interesting. However with all the flaws I still would say this game is pretty sweet.","March 1","true","34.8"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","14","28","0","0"

That was, in itself, one of my favorite points.  And I love history, especially of animals, creatures and how a time was, that no museum can match up to.  You, as a human, WAS NOT on the top of the food chain.  The creatures then, were not afraid of you and WILL KILL YOU like any other animal that they want to eat.\n\nThe gameplay ...  Ubisoft, I know there was A LOT you want to bring into the game.. but you put WAY TOO MANY DISTRACTIONS!  I am TRYING to save my people!  I am TRYING to get my people better equipped with supplies of food, skins, stones and safety of all things, and you put events and sidequests and question marks and showing me who's walking this way, be it Uldam or the other tribe that I CAN'T GET TO because of the DISTRACTIONS!  Do you WANT ME to get these creatures or NOT!?  How would you feel if you were trying to get a good business deal going and someone is constantly tapping your shoulder and wanting you to sing Daisy Girl after you already sang it 6 times?  Sounds fun right?  Sounds good right?  NO!  If anything, this could have been corrected by somehowmaybe (I did that on purpose. That isn't a typo.) placing the distractions until after a certain point, or maybe beating the game ONCE and then you can do whatever you want. (I mean, I get it it's a FTR and all that jazz, but how can I enjoy something when I'm being told that my people are being slaughtered and they are OFTEN on their own and there's over 5 ULDAM going after their ♥♥♥!?)\n\nI know this was lengthy.. but one thing I also need to clarify.  After finding out what I was trying to figure out what do I do in the guardian chase (to learn the taming)  and I have found A LOT of people who were having this difficulty.  I'll be frank.  WHERE THE [BLEEP] WAS YOUR DAMN INSTRUCTIONS!  You had us following our brother to go after the mammoth baby by those instructions, but OH NO!  You didn't include what the [BLEEP] to do when we have to chase the guardian! Did you guys REALLY check everything?  I mean, I heard you guys failure rate's absurdity, and I completely understand the need to quench the fan base's thirst for a new game, but COME ON!  Clean the quarters out of your ears and do it right!  If you're seeing how Capcom, Sega and another company, I forget who..is failing majorly bad by releasing terrible and yet was so hyped games, shouldn't you be learning from this?\n\nThe music.  Wait, I caught some glimpses of music, but not much of it.  I suppose this was one of those where the music feature is taken out during the actual gameplay, so you can immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the prehistoric era.  the only times where music really was needed was when I was fighting the Uldam or when I completed a goal to move the story along.\n\nFor the most part, this is good, but again.. way too many distractions.","April 28","true","51.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I spot this incredible elk, twice my size with giant antlers. I take a shot at it, and my arrow hits it in the side. It runs away. I chase after the beast, switching to  my spear. I lose sight of it when it runs into a tree line, however, its still on my mini map. The red arrow is still moving fast in the opposite direction....then turns around and bee lines straight towards me. I don't have enough time to raise my spear when it barges out of the bushes and knocks me to the ground, taking away half of my health. I rise up and throw a spear into its back. It runs and circles around for another charge. I take out another spear and go to raise it up to throw it when....the screen starts rumbling. Three mammoths, two adults and a baby, bound towards me. I throw my spear into the babies face, but its no use. It tramples over me, and its company roar and stomp the ground in front of me. I equip my bow, hoping to at least take out the elk. By the time I turn back to my left, its already less than 5 metres away from me, mid-charge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacobPriceChloePrice/recommended/371660/","JacobPriceChloePrice","X_[Homefront_[The]_Revolution]_X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacobPriceChloePrice/","49 products in account","After getting born in this planet, we are listening so much things about Stone Age. What really happened before, how people survived from dangerous animals, how was the life on Stone Age. Well, the answer of all these questions you can get from FACRY PRIMAL. We can be familliar and get known about Stone Age if we experience this title. As usually, we don't know the view of Stone Age or the world 10,000 B.E.C ago. In this title, we can experience the Stone Age as Takkar. We can see many types of plants, animal, surviving weapons. In that age, you have to survive by carrying few types of weapons with you to hunt down dangerous animals and get foods for yourself. You can't survive a single day without light of fire and sharpness of blades. All we know that age was the beggining of humanity. We trust everything about Stone Age's life what we hear from the history. But now you can lively experience it yourself on Stone Age through FARCRY PRIMAL. Feel the pain of injustice what Udam did with Wenja Brothers. Feel the way of how humans changed their fate. but there is bit problem with language because i have to understand the whole story with just English subtitle, well overall it's massive. The most interesting thing is Mammoth for me what i wanted see the most, too big and scary also Saber Toothed Tigers looks far scarier then other animals. So now lemme say about coolest things about this title.\n\nGameplay\nI'm really enjoying the open world activity of this game. I can collect various types of things to craft new weapons and important meterials for me like Woods, Slate, Flowers, Leaves. I have to hunt down animal for getting suffiecient foods for me. Because you need enough food to replenish your health when you are attacked or wounded. The atmosphere of this game is too scary and gloomy. Sometimes the roar of sabre toothed tigers and wolfs frightens me the most of all at night. Because that's Stone Age not modern generation so there is only dark calls at night. So only fire on the club can figure your way out at dark night. Because all the animals awakes at night for their prey. Also, you have to explore the entire world to find story missions and side quests. Though the map is full of missions and activities.\n\nGraphics Quality\nFARCRY PRIMAL came up with breath stopping GFX this time, just truly remarkable and mind blowing if you ask me i would say it. At night it looks more amazing and thrilling as hell. In every point of view, graphics quality looks quiet attracting. You can stop yourself from capturing beautiful shots at every view of it. So i just said my opinion about it.\n\nOptimization\nFARCRY PRIMAL is really tremendously optimized masterpiece. I'm playing with very high settings means all the options are maxed out on Intel Core i5 4690K, Ram 8GB DDR3, R9 290 Vapor-X 4GB GDDR5, S2240L Monitor, 1080P display. Firstly, from a technical point of view, the game is running great: a steady 60 FPS with no dips on R9 290 Vapor-X. So it's providing me remarkable smooth performance.\n\nErrors, Crashes, Bugs\nWell, till now i didn't found any kind of bugs and get any crashes nor errors. But sometimes it takes quiet a long time on first launch loading sreen which is really wierd for everyone usually.\n\nLanguage\nAs we know FARCRY PRIMAL is based on Stone Age so basically there is no chance of English. So you have to understand the story by just reading English subtitle.\n\nNew functions and stuffs\nIn this title, you can collect more crafting materials for better experience on gameplay. You can upgrade all the things you are using for surviving in game. Also, you can get skills by completing missions and gaining quiet numbers of XP. You can gain XP from every activity like headshots, animal hunting, completing hunting missions, discovering caves or secret places. Also you can test benchmark now if you want.\n\nMost Amazing Things\nYou can tame Wolfs, Saber Toothed Tigers, Baby Mammoths if you want them to make a great advantage for you on combating moments. Basically combat will decrease the health of your tamed pets so you can use meats to feed them and replenish their health. If you complete side missions, you will be rewarded with populations for your village. You can use Owl to indentify enemies around the world and mark them as beast master.\nPros :::\n+You can explore the world and discover secret places to gain more XP for your level\n+Open world is bigger than ever\n+Best atmospheric game in your choice\n+Most beautiful graphics quality yet\n+Enjoyalbe gameplay activity\n+Tremendous and perfect optimization\n\nLemme rate this game in few ways\n-Gameplay 9/10\n-Graphics Quality 9/10\n-Combating 8/10\n-Optimization 10/10\n-Characters 7/10\n-Atmosphere based on Stone Age 10/10\n-Soundtrack as atmospheric 8/10\n\nSo that's all i can say about this game for now. Becayse i haven't made so much progression on this game to explain you more. So i'm surely recommending this game for everyone, i hope it won't make you dissapointed.","March 3","true","70.5"," 42 of 85 people (49%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","49","42","85","7","0"

It's not really about being a Farcry game here. This game is the best, most immersive, BEAST MASTER game. You can do everything you want as a beast master and hunter. The game has a ton of dynamic features and random events, making it fun to play with or without the story missions. The map is huge and the ecosystem/animal interaction is so immersive and alive. I play the game on the highest difficulty with almost all of the hud turned off, including the mini-map so my experience is more geared toward immersion and challenge but I think it's integral to experiencing this kind of game properly. All I'm saying is: don't judge Primal as a Farcry sequel or another hardcore survival sim. I'ts a great simulator of something very specific and somewhat fictional.\n\nTry shutting of all of the unneeded HUD elements, playing on expert, and never use the hunter vision unless you really have to. It'll be way more fun.","March 1","true","55.8"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","0"

There are no guns, obviously, so the quantity of weapons at our disposal is basically limited by 4. Four! There's barely any story, and playing through it will take you some three, maybe four hours. Magic 'four' again.\nWhat's there to do but the story, you ask? Ho-ho, we've got the whole package for you.\nFarm. FARM. F-A-R-M. Stones, rocks, sticks, leaves, animals, chicks (for food, don't get your hopes up).\n\nHowever, FC3's core gameplay is still present, and with a little addition of animal companions (not such a big thing as advertised, though) it is still enjoyable enough - hence my game time, and my positive recommendation.\nPrimal might be a good pick on the Summer Sale.

And its somewhat refreshing to be given such limited tools and equipment.\n\nDo not compare this to other first person titles, or the previous Far Cry games as you will be dissapointed.\nThat being said, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing cool if you can appreciate what Ubisoft is trying to create. The whole point is to try to depict what it would've possibly been like to exist, hunt and craft 10,000 years before high tech weapons, computers and the internet. And I think they have done a fairly good job.\n\nDon't take this game too seriously, but all in all it is very immersive and allows you to momentarily step into the life of a "primitive" human being. Life back then wasn't easy, people from this period of Earth's history had to make do with whatever they could create with their bare hands. So I think that everyone who is criticising it based on the somewhat "lackluster" features should consider the context and setting of this game. Yes, some of the crafting is hard to believe, and yes some of the dialouge is somewhat humourous, but let's not forget that this is a depiction of reality from a time where we know very little.\n\n\nAnyway, I think many people who have enjoyed the Far Cry franchise will enjoy this latest installment, if you take into account the context and setting.\n\nHappy hunting.","March 3","true","24.2"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","14","29","3","0"

Tensay the Shaman has nearly topped Pagun MIn.\nThe game on the surface is a generic retextured Farcry game, it has collectables strongholds etc, but at its core it is very different, if you try and play this game like a normal Farcry game you will find it boring and uneventful, but if you really get into the feel of Oros and wander around, explore go out of your way to just find some stone, something like that, thats when you really enjoy the alive world of Oros, not fast travelling everywhere, skipping cutscenes, not stopping to check that out or not killing that animal. I have heard other people describe some of the game as pointless busy work, and I can definitly see that, but I feel if you treat it like busy work it oviosly will be, you have to treat it as an adventure, rather than doing it because you have too. Rather than gettign those logs on the way to a mission, just go out into the world, get lost, and explore. If you can't tell already I'm a big fan. But warning for those who are expecting mission to mission first, person kill sprees, beware, you can play it like but its very boring if you do.\nP.S, if you are a Nvidia graphics card user you may have to update your drivers before the game runs smoothly, I had multiple framerate and CPU problems with the game untill I downloaded the driver off Geforce experience, but don't let this put you off, its extremly easy, just open the app and click upate drivers.

Not so much fun as a chore from time to time. But you can choose your current mission and move from storyline missions to quests as you desire.\n\nGraphics\nit looks awesome at any of the preset options (low, medium, high, very high, ultra) I recently switched to a single monitor to run at ultra settings and whilst there are difference of course, im going back to triple monitors on lower settings for more immersion.\n\nBecause that is where the secret lies with primal, The immersion factor when your doing the main story is fanatastic, and on multiple monitors it really is a treat since it has better support than most for this option with no icons being all the way to one side, as it will place all the HUD information on your central screen.\n\nGameplay\nIt claims to have ties to survival bloodlines, but truthfully its not any more survival than what you might expect from a regular title. Dont Expect the survival tag to deliver content such as ark survival, Stranded Deep, Etc...\n\nAnd the crafting is more geared towards weapon upgrades and not construction, but you do upgrade a small village as you playthrough the game. This is achieved by going out and resource collecting, but thanks to rewards it can be achieved at a less choreful pace if desired.\n\nAlso tagged as Open World, and despite having a large map it will at times it will feel like the scenary is shaped to guide you along a set pathway. In freeroam mode whilst not on missions is where this tag applies.\n\nConclusion\nThere are things in primal that come together in just enough amounts to make you not regret buying it but overall, i feel the vast majority of the games gameplay is very repetitive and that lets it down. Despite this when it works, its works really nice !!\n\nAnd i have yet too discover any major bugs/issues playing this game, but after a few hours of playing the map starts to lag but exiting and restarting the game often elivates this issue.\n\nMy Computer Specs\nAMD FX 6300 (6core) @ 3.50 GHz, nvidia GTX 960, 8GB DDR3\n\nRuns on Ultra with no shadows @ 50-60fps\n\n\nScore 7/10","March 3","true","87.8"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","13","27","2","1"

It is a port from the console system, so options are limited.  Graphics setup are low, normal, high and ultra high and saves are done by way of the "check point" system.  I built a new high spec PC in December 2015, so it should run this game with little to no problems, but one hour in on Ultra High settings the cpu shot up to 60c which is very hot, after reducing the graphic setting to Normal and setting up a profile for the cpu fan to start at 75% and go up from there, the issue is all but solved.  With all that said, for me the game is a blast, you play the role of hunter, gather, working your way through the map via points of intrest and in doing so earn XP and skill points that increase your characters abilities.  For now it is a single player experience only, Co-Op would be awesome and is probabley down the road in the form of DLC.","March 3","true","10.2"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","13","27","3","0"

You get 3 bows in this game, and a sling shot. You get spears that you can throw, hell you can throw your one and two handed clubs! Everything can become a projectile in this game, and every weapon can be set on fire! You get throwing bone shards (used in conjunction with stealth kills) some kind of flint throwing shard and a berserk one that just makes people attack their friends, also bee bombs are pretty funny.\n\nI can understand some people have a hard time reading words while watching videos, but as soon as you get out of 5th grade it becomes a non-issue.\nDespite the language barrier, the facial animations and hand uses are really well done. The inflection it gives to what you're reading works really well and a lot of these characters will be more memorable than previous FC characters (except Vaas, Hoyt and Pagan Min, do you remember any of the other characters names? No Googling!)\n\nThe world is incredible, I've seen evidence that this is the FC4 Map just repurposed. I have also seen a girl I refused to go to prom with who turned into a drool inducing bombshell a decade later. The map is beautiful, it's actually dense, it feels like a forest, and looks like a forest. It's going to win best forest simulator 2016 no doubt. If you enjoy the idea of nature, but don't actually like going outside this game is for you! No sunburn, bug bites, or allergies in this game.\n\nI'm 18 hours in so far, says 44% done, maxed practically every thing, but now I have Master Hunts to do which looks like I may get legendary animals to tame/ride. The quality you get in this game, plus that it looks to be decently long (I hate games I can beat in a day, eat it Lara) make me feel my purchase was worth it. Plus I've never beat a FC game only once, so I will spend plenty of time with this. I hope this review was helpful to some of you, may the spirits guide you Wenja!\n\nI didn't have any issues with running the game.  I have everything on High with 51-34 FPS, 3.5 quad, 16gig ram, 2gig AMD card, anti-aliasing SMAA.

You get 3 bows in this game, and a sling shot. You get spears that you can throw, hell you can throw your one and two handed clubs! Everything can become a projectile in this game, and every weapon can be set on fire! You get throwing bone shards (used in conjunction with stealth kills) some kind of flint throwing shard and a berserk one that just makes people attack their friends, also bee bombs are pretty funny.\n\nI can understand some people have a hard time reading words while watching videos, but as soon as you get out of 5th grade it becomes a non-issue.\nDespite the language barrier, the facial animations and hand uses are really well done. The inflection it gives to what you're reading works really well and a lot of these characters will be more memorable than previous FC characters (except Vaas, Hoyt and Pagan Min, do you remember any of the other characters names? No Googling!)\n\nThe world is incredible, I've seen evidence that this is the FC4 Map just repurposed. I have also seen a girl I refused to go to prom with who turned into a drool inducing bombshell a decade later. The map is beautiful, it's actually dense, it feels like a forest, and looks like a forest. It's going to win best forest simulator 2016 no doubt. If you enjoy the idea of nature, but don't actually like going outside this game is for you! No sunburn, bug bites, or allergies in this game.\n\nI'm 18 hours in so far, says 44% done, maxed practically every thing, but now I have Master Hunts to do which looks like I may get legendary animals to tame/ride. The quality you get in this game, plus that it looks to be decently long (I hate games I can beat in a day, eat it Lara) make me feel my purchase was worth it. Plus I've never beat a FC game only once, so I will spend plenty of time with this. I hope this review was helpful to some of you, may the spirits guide you Wenja!\n\nI didn't have any issues with running the game.  I have everything on High with 51-34 FPS, 3.5 quad, 16gig ram, 2gig AMD card, anti-aliasing SMAA. I did turn off motion blur because....F motion blur.","March 3","true","31.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","8","17","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/recommended/371660/","volt615","Volt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/","405 products in account","Far Cry PrimalFar Cry Primal is an action-adventure video game.  The game is not a sequal to Far Cry 4.  The game is developed and produced by Ubisoft.\n\n\nStoryI really have enjoyed the story so far.  The game is set in 10,000 BC, during the beginning of the Mesolithic and Epipaleolithic periods.  Players take on the role of a lone surviving hunter, Takkar, who makes his way to Oros and sets out to build his own tribe.  Takkar learns to tame animals in his quests.  He eventually rises to power and leads his tribe.\n\nI should note that the game is in subtitles for the fictional language used.  At first I was not too enthused about the use of subtitles, but after playing the game I really did not mind.  Although I have to argue that by taking on the role of Takkar, I shouldn't need subtitles to understand what I am saying.\n\nThe game is designed with difficulty levels in mind.  The April 12 patch to Primal has introduced Survivor Mode for those that want something much more difficult to play.  Elements, stamina fatigue, permadeath for trained beasts, more difficult taming process for the stronger beasts, skill trees reworked for difficulty, and the option for permadeath for your character.\n\nCraftingThe crafting system is very similiar to Far Cry 4.  The system is easy and in no way overwhelming.  It is simplistic yet ample enough to provide plenty of items such as weapons, equipment, medical items, and food to help you through your adventures or Oros.  Players must craft weapons using the materials scavenged while playing such as wood and stone.\n\nControlsThe gameplay feels very familiar to anyone who has played Far Cry 3 or 4.  The controls work very well with most keys able to be bound. I could not bind my Cap Locks Lock key which was disappointing but I think I can manage another bind.  The player can dirrectly control the owl which beocme a very useful tool to scout enemies.  Transitioning into the animal controls is fluid and works well.  The owl feels very similiar to flying a helo in FC 4.  The gameplay is very smooth and I really do not have any complaints with the controls, at least in terms of using a keyboard and mouse.\n\nGraphicsFC Primal was built on the Dunia 2 Engine which was used for Far Cry 3 (2012), Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon (2013), Far Cry 4 (2014), and now Far Cry Primal (2016).  While the engine looks good, it is dated and the visuals suffer for it.  Although aestheticly pleasing in many ways, the enviromental fidelity suffers as does the character models.  Why Ubisoft did not pass the AnvilNext 2.0 game engine which Assassin's Creed Unity (2014), Assassin's Creed Syndicate (2015), Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege (2015), and For Honor (2016) are built on or perhaps even the Snowflake Engine which Tom Clancy's The Division is built on is dumbfounding.\n\nThe game initially had no SLI/Crossfire support.  My fps would double if I force my system to run on a single GTX 980 rather than in tripple SLI.  The patches and Nvidia drivers have resolved this issue, although there is not true sli support that benefits using multiple cards.  But at least sli is now running as good as a single card.\n\nThe April 12 patch introduces a HD texture pack for those that want to run Primal on Ultra & 4k.\n\nRecommendationI really enjoy playing Far Cry Primal and do recommend it if you are a fan of the series, even with the changes such as the time period, weapons, and the lack of vehicles the game stands on its own and is very satisfying to play.\n\nGameplay Videohttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=636325142\n\nPerformance Benchmarkhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=636403600","March 1","true","26.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

This is misleading because most of the negative reviews reflect frustration over technical issues at launch. I experienced none whatsoever, and I understand that there appeared several solutions to problems presented.\n\nThat being said the game deserves a solid 8/10. It is very similar to other Far Cry games, yet it differs from Far Cry 4 more than Far Cry 4 differs from Far Cry 3. It stands out from the series in a few key ways. The setting takes center stage here, from the language, the flora and fauna, everything feels very primeval. Folks may miss the gunplay, but I found that combat can be very fast and deadly once you realize that many of your weapons are better thrown than used for melee. It is a bummer that there is no block or counter feature to combat, but if you play it right, there is never a need to. With beast in tow, there are plenty of opportunities for melee takedowns, a signature of the series. At least half the combat comes from and between the beast population, which is far more dense and deadly than in previous installments. I also like the improvements to the crafting system. Now that all your weapons can be thrown or are single use, it behooves you to keep well stocked in supplies to craft said weapons. In other Far Cry games I was let down a little in that crafting extended to only about half the game, after I crafted all my bags. Resources and crafting are more relevant thoughout the playthrough now.\n\nAll in all, very competently made. It is not ground breaking, but it is more than just Far Cry 4.5 like Blood Dragon was to 3. I would suggest, however waiting for a sale, as it is more of a $30-40 title. No regets here though.\n\nOn a side note, I know how frustrating it can be when your purchased software doesn't work properly, but that is why there is a refund system. Seeing the bad reviews leads people to believe that the product is inferior, which isn't the whole truth. I wouldn't say that a movie was bad if I was locked out of the theater. But I would get a refund and complain directly to management. Condemning the hard working artists and coders for the DRM policy of their bosses is unfair.","March 2","true","61.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

These altered the gameplay quite a bit, it's definitely worth at least trying the game for what's new.\n\nBecause the game takes place in 10,000 BCE, classic far cry features such as vehicles and firearms are obviously not present. This is pretty bothersome for me, as you are now required to run from place to places across the maps. Although the game now has a lot of outposts/fast travel checkpoints, this is still quite tedious. You can unlock a skill that lets you ride your larger beasts, but that's not unlocked until quite a few hours into the gameplay typically.  I'm also not a huge fan of non-firearm type weapons such as spears, arrows, and clubs, but they can still work somewhat well after practicing for a bit. Although the game has tons of main missions available, the overall story and plot development is a bit lacking to me.\n\nOverall, I'd say buy the game when it's discounted on sales. The gameplay can get quite boring pretty fast for a lot of players who aren't big on stone age weapons, but it's still definitely fun to play for a few hours at the very least. The game may seem boring at first, but it gets more fun when you've added more citizens to your village.","March 5","true","18.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I havent finished the story yet but got to say it delivers, with some pretty deep cut scenes and turns. Animations and actror/models work are very good, makes you feel and understand what those cave folks felt and what they went thru almost every day. Great job devs!\n\nLots of people told me that leap from modern day weapons to club and bow is too controvercial, but i got to say that for me its native and actually closer to Far Cry genre now, because now hunting actually makes sence and fits the picture. It was pretty hard for me to be immersed in game when you got to hunt kill Rhino lets say with C4 or RPG.\n\nI had no problems with pre-ordering or starting the game, and actually bought two of them now PS4 and PC versions.

There are no guns like the previous Farcry games, which I actually like more than I thought I would. Having to take careful aim with your spears and bow is great... The double arrow bow is by far my favorite! Being a Beast Master is very awesome in this game as well. Having command over the animals adds some strategic depth when trying to take over outposts or bonfires. My only gripe here though is how simple it is to tame animals... Ubisoft could have made taming alot more interesting/difficult but whatever. The graphics are amazing, and the day/night cycle is a very nice touch. Having animals behave differently based on the time of day is pretty dang cool.\n\nIf you like the idea of being a beast master, and are a fan Farcry games, I would recommend this game. The story isnt as long as say... Farcry 3's, but there are tons of things to do just like FC3 and FC4.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Croaker1084/recommended/371660/","Croaker1084","THE GODDAMN BATMAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Croaker1084/","88 products in account","To preface; I will say that this is not a full review of Far Cry Primal, rather this is an overview. I am doing this because.. I feel that too many people are giving this game a negative review wihout much or any substance objectively. That and in the three or three and a half hours of plaaytime, I found this to be a very fun game, it is exciting and it is entralling. I would aactually like to see Ubisoft experrment more with different time periods, eras. And I feel that people who on the fence should know that this is worth the $60 price tag. I'll update this after I have completed the game, as some things may change. I'm sure I will develop criticisms over the course of the game, etc.. I will not mention anything about the story yet, because I have not progressed far enough into the story. The character animations and VO work that I have experienced so far is convincing and is outstanding work.\n\nSo, what makes Primal so captivating, I'll tell you. The setting in itself is one of the major reasons. The world of Oros is beautiful, full of life and is a sensory overload when it comes to the audio; a good thing. Teaming with wildlife and, yes other cavemen. Depite its beauty, this world that has been created is dangerous. You can find yourself into some serious trouble in Oros very quickly! The weapons are primitive and they do lack complex or cool looking animations, but you're a caveman, you're just trying to survive. When attacked and under stress, with your aderline pumping, and a lack of formal training, you are going to swing your club as wildly as possible, and a spear is a thrusting weapon, not a slashing weapon. You're not a highly-trained martial-artist wielding a staff or or a sword. With that said the combat is brutal and fun! That's what matters! It is satisfying to throw a spear into a mans face as it is into an animal, same thing with clubing someone to death. The hunting is great fun! I enjoy the fact how I have to track whatever game I have shot with my bow or thrown spear, because as someone who actually hunts, animals don't just drop dead on the spot most of the time. It's a nice change to see in a game. Many have complained of the partially made up language. Ubisoft did work with experts to craft a language that would be believable, though not 100% accurate. You can hear the emotions converyed through the voice actors and I appluad this apporach. The subtitles do not bother and it adds another layer of immserion to a game that very atmospheric. There is no other game, that I know of that has a wrold like Oros. It is unique in that regard, even if Ark has a world similar. In Ark you have firearms, which to me would detract from the experience overall.\n\nI will recommend to everyone to play on "expert" difficulty and to turn most, if not all of your HUD elements off. You'll rely pretty much solely on audio cues and it'll take a while, but you will feel scared and you should feel that thrill, that anxiety. Of both being scared and exploring a land you know nothing of. Get out there and get lost, feel the experience and bask in the atmosphere! You are not at the top of the food-chain, you're far from it. I find myself, especailly at night, which is so much different from the dynamics of daytime play, always being cautious and listening very carefully to sounds. As well as hunting for animals that appear at night only. I am having as close to a caveman experience as I think we may ever get in a AAA title. And this experience feels authentic, as far as video games go. This game as is so far in my experience gets a solid recommendation.\n\nEDIT: Having played more of the game, I feel that the story is good enough so far. It's not top tier, it is not The Witcher 3 calibre of story-telling; but it is not a bad story. What is most important that I've realized is that now that I have tamed most of the beasts, and have uncovered aa good portion of the map. The game has become highly addicting! I am about 11 percent complete with the game. My one major complaint is that night cycles should really last longer; as well as the frustration of losing a rare beast because it died. I like the mechanic on paper. It's more immersive, but it isn't fun to try to track down another rare black leopard.","March 12","true","23.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Probably the best thing about this game is the controls feel just as smooth whether you're playing with a controller or the keyboard/mouse, which is an often overlooked feature, and I love they put the extra effort into it.\n\n\nAll in all, 8/10, if you liked Fallout 4, give this a shot, you won't be disappointed.","March 2","true","23.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

So far I have really enjoyed the game. All I'm gonna talk about are the elements of the gameplay. It isn't very inovative gameplay wise, but they took a big risk by making a FPS, in a way, set in the stone age. I think the lack of guns make it challenging. Far Cry is Far Cry after all, the usual running around and taking outposts for towers to take over an area. The set amount of resources you can carry does make the crafting interesting. You have to run around and search for different sources in different areas of the map to upgrade your village huts, weapons, resource bags, etc. The resource hunting is endless. The hunting is a bit more challenging because of the limited amounts of weapons you have. To move to different areas you must upgrade your weapons and clothing to be able to survive against harsher elements and the dangerous animals in the different enviroments. The map is a nice size although I haven't explored all of it yet. The missions aren't too mindblowing but they provide entertainment.\n\nIf you want a game that will change your life, this isn't it. If you just want a game to entertain yourself until something different comes out, or something to keep the boredom away, then this would be a great game. I can't say anything about the crashes because I haven't experienced any of those yet. It has been fun. Wait for a sale and then pick it up.\n\nIn the end the game is entertaining and will keep you busy running around hunting, doing missions, side objectives, and resource gathering. Buy it or don't buy it. Watch some gameplay first. With the whole steam refund thing it makes it much easier to buy a game and try it out. I give it a 7 outta 10. Not the most amazing game I have played but definitely something different. The whole stone age thing really is a cool idea and it would be interesting to see if other developers try it out. Sorry for the long read.","March 2","true","44.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The major problem I've had so far is not being able to distinguish friend from foe at a distance.  The animal skins work too well as camouflage and everything becomes a jumbled mess unless you're already aiming and let the cross-hair tell you what you're about to shoot.  Yes that is part of the challenge of the game but it can still be annoying to not know there's an enemy around until the gauge that alerts you to being spotted flashes on the screen.\n\nThe audio is excellent.  You really get the feeling that you're the one being hunted in Oros, partially because the animals never seem to shut up around you and it becomes a challenge determining which noise means food and which growl means you're about to be food.\n\nMenu interface is counter-intuitive, the same as the other far cry games. The weapon wheel could benefit from being more simplified, and the crafting / character perk menus are overcrowded with icons that are just a tad too small to be useful.  Honestly I don't have a problem scrolling on a perk tree menu if it means I get a little more detail without having to select each individual icon and read it's description.\n\nTraveling can be slow but fast travel is available when you're ready to start hacking away at the game, and there's an actual reward system for helping other people during escort / rescue sidequests so you'll be less likely to ignore their cries for help.\n\nReally, Far Cry Primal is solid, and the complaints I have are in no way deal breakers.  The experience is unique and will more than make up for the game's few flaws.\n\n(Played for 2 hours with X360 Gamepad.

Just getting out in the wilderness and heading in a random direction to see what happens. There are so many random events occurring in the world and they have actually bolted on a very good AI driving the actions of the humans and animals. Ubisoft have done an amazing job. I've turned off almost all player UI aids in the game (this is a must IMO) and it delivers a very immersive experience. I am still trying to tame a sabre tooth. It is difficult. :)\n\nThe sound engine is superb. Night time reminds me of the nail biting suspense of Dying Light nights. Night is also the domain of predators.\n\nIt's exactly what I want in a Far Cry game and I hope the next iteration of the series builds on the technology and gameplay they have added to Primal.\n\nA huge Thumbs Up!","March 4","true","29.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I've found that sound is very important in the game because sometimes my vision is blocked by grass/bushes/etc, even with hunter vision. I've had a bear get me twice now because I didn't see or hear it. And outrunning them is a joke. They'll catch up and rip you apart unless you kill them.\nFire is your friend. Lots of predators are afraid of the fire and will keep a safe distance until they see an opportunity. Your tamed animal is another deterrent for some predators.\nI like how they really tried to be realistic with the wolves and how they hunt. They're always in packs and they use tactics to try and attack you. I've had it where one has rushed me so that my focus is on that one then 2 others flank me while the first runs to a safe distance. It's also kind of sad that if they run, they'll come back and howl for their fallen wolves. Also, their eyes reflect the light at night which is just awesome.\n\nThere's definitely some things that they need to work on with the tamed beasts. Sometimes my beast will be stuck somewhere while I'm getting my butt kicked by enemies. Other times, my beast won't disengage from enemies so it ends up dying because it won't come back for me to heal it. It's a bit annoying and frustrating, especially when you're trying to take a bonfire...but it's not a deal breaker.\nYes, it's annoying that they speak a different language and you have to read the subtitles...but you get used to it after a while.\nThe graphics aren't bad...but they're also not the best. I'm also running it on "high". I could probably run it higher than that, but it doesn't really matter to me. Again, not a deal breaker.\n\nThere's plenty to do in the game to keep you occupied. Right now I'm just capturing various bonfires and hunting/gathering so I can upgrade my camp.","March 2","true","16.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

To actually review a game you must play it first.  You have no business writing a review of a game you haven't played.  Yes, uPlay sucks and probably will continue to do so until Ubisoft gets smart and uses Steam.\n\nPros:\n\nThe visuals in the game are great it really does feel like a perhistoric land.\nThe interaction with environment is great.\nThe crafting system is awesome I actually have to make my own arrows for my bow and in order to do that I have to gather the required materials.\nThe material gathering for huts and other upgrades seems somewhat realistic you don't have to get a ton of materials.\nThe language that they developed is amazing.  Props to Ubisoft for that one.\nCharacter visuals are pretty realistic the faces have so much detail and the hair styles seem like what they would be during that era.\nInventory management has greatly improved from previous games I don't have to micromanage anymore.\nI could go on but its minor detail stuff.\n\nCons:\n\nIt needs to be optimized occasional hangs and crashes (to be expected just after release honestly).\nAs with all Far Cry games its resource heavy so it isn't for the feint of heart machines.  Not really con though.\nThe save mechanic seems to be glitchy is only saving at checkpoints not when you tell it to.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThis game is for people who like survival this is a hunter gatherer type game as it was during that era.  If you like to shoot things up and blow things up prepare to be dissapointed this is a survival game.  If you like survival games this game is for you but if you are mainly a shooter type give it some thought before you purchase.","March 2","true","10.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

This is exactly what I expected, Far Cry in 10,000 BCE.  Good and somewhat understandable villains, in that their motives while not exactly sound, do make a bit of a twisted kind of sense.  Granted it takes time to get to that point because they aren't as quickly shown as they were in 3 and 4.  Taming animals is fun, and scavenger hunting for special items to upgrade your items is always fun to me.  I prefered the twin sided upgrade system since it made more linear sense to me, but this one is far more fleshed out and allows you to more specifically decide what you want to do as your character.  All in all a good game, I'd give it a 8.5/10 from where I am right now in the game, seems like it could go up from where I am since I haven't gotten all around the world yet.","March 2","true","16.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Garenator/recommended/371660/","Garenator","Garenator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Garenator/","169 products in account","Finally someone decided to break from making generic shooter #378B and tried something new.\n\nStory is pretty good, more or less what you would expect from a Far Cry but set in 10,000 BC. Your tribe traveled to new lands, but the warrior cannibals (there are a few other factions but those are the main bad guy so far) in those lands killed most of them. You are a warrior who got separated from your tribe and has to try and reuinite your scattered people in the new village you start.\n\nSo now you have a village that you can upgrade and grow. You not only upgrade your cave and other's huts, you have to find new people who will bring their unique skills to their village and give you new unlocks (I.E. Bring the warrior guy in to unlock new takedowns, bring the crafting guy in to unlock new gear, bring the hunting girl in to get new bows, etc). It's a well done feature that also breaks your skill tree into different blocks for each new (important) person you bring into your village. Theres also a lot of different skills and craftables now. Haven't counted but it sure feels like WAY more than FC4.\n\nThe combat is very fun. Basically the same as FC3/FC4 but without the guns. You use clubs, bows and spears to kill your enemies aside from the beasts you can tame. Each weapon has its own unique takedown animations instead of always using your knife.\n\nThere's also a day/night cycle ala Dying Light. At night, more predators and certain more rare animals come out, some of these night animal's skins are needed for crafting or missions. I approve of day/night cycles simply for the (relative) realism, but it doesn't change too much in gameplay from what ive seen. Predators are still easy to avoid or kill for the most part (save bears, do NOT ♥♥♥♥ with bears until you have a few upgrades)\n\nHunting is much more fun now. Instead of a camera you have "hunter vision" which, rather than tagging enemies (thats a skill you unlock) it will highlight enemies/animals in your FoV. It also highlights animals blood. So if you hit a deer in the leg and it takes off, now you can just follow the blood trail to the animals body since it will bleed out in a minute.\n\nI like the new map as well. Large with lots of variance in terrain, the ambient sounds of all the animals are great. Sometimes you'll stumble upon a pack of wolves chasing after deer, or a bear fighting a group of Udam (the warrior cannibals you fight). Some people have said it's the same as FC4's map based on where the water is, even if they did use the old map as a foundation to build on it feels very different. Lots more vegetation, way more variances in elevation so you can sneak around above/below enemies.\n\nThe whole north half of the map is also covered in snow and can be very risky to go into early on. You get a "cold meter" when there that decreases until you die. You can either run from campfire to campfire to stay warm or upgrade your clothes so your cold meter goes down more slowly.\n\nAlso runs very well, I've had no issues with crashing and with everything maxed get a stable 40-60 fps with few to no dips. Also has a FoV slider that goes all the way up to 120 (something a lot of AAA games somehow miss)\n\nA solid next step (or first step?) in the Far Cry series. The gameplay isn't too much different from FC4 aside from the lack of guns (you still have some of the same animations for manual healing, you have a primitive grapple hook, etc.) But the new setting combined with the lack of guns adds a whole new feel to Far Cry. The characters are all interesting with their own reasons for hating the Udam and the gameplay is enjoyable.","March 2","true","15.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","2"

Unfortunate that he rallied everyone to bury the game, which hurts sales when Ubisoft finally make something interesting, but oh well what can you do.\n\nAnyway, unpopular opinion, but the Far Cry team tried something (semi) new and i think it's great.

You have to run around and search for different sources in different areas of the map to upgrade your village huts, weapons, resource bags, etc. The resource hunting is endless. The hunting is a bit more challenging because of the limited amounts of weapons you have. To move to different areas you must upgrade your weapons and clothing to be able to survive against harsher elements and the dangerous animals in the different enviroments. The map is a nice size although I haven't explored all of it yet. The missions aren't too mindblowing but they provide entertainment.\n\nIf you want a game that will change your life, this isn't it. If you just want a game to entertain yourself until something different comes out, or something to keep the boredom away, then this would be a great game. I can't say anything about the crashes because I haven't experienced any of those yet. It has been fun. Wait for a sale and then pick it up.\n\nIn the end the game is entertaining and will keep you busy running around hunting, doing missions, side objectives, and resource gathering. Buy it or don't buy it. Watch some gameplay first. With the whole steam refund thing it makes it much easier to buy a game and try it out. I give it a 7 outta 10. Not the most amazing game I have played but definitely something different. The whole stone age thing really is a cool idea and it would be interesting to see if other developers try it out. Sorry for the long read.","March 2","true","44.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Just getting out in the wilderness and heading in a random direction to see what happens. There are so many random events occurring in the world and they have actually bolted on a very good AI driving the actions of the humans and animals. Ubisoft have done an amazing job. I've turned off almost all player UI aids in the game (this is a must IMO) and it delivers a very immersive experience. I am still trying to tame a sabre tooth. It is difficult. :)\n\nThe sound engine is superb. Night time reminds me of the nail biting suspense of Dying Light nights. Night is also the domain of predators.\n\nIt's exactly what I want in a Far Cry game and I hope the next iteration of the series builds on the technology and gameplay they have added to Primal.\n\nA huge Thumbs Up!","March 4","true","29.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I've found that sound is very important in the game because sometimes my vision is blocked by grass/bushes/etc, even with hunter vision. I've had a bear get me twice now because I didn't see or hear it. And outrunning them is a joke. They'll catch up and rip you apart unless you kill them.\nFire is your friend. Lots of predators are afraid of the fire and will keep a safe distance until they see an opportunity. Your tamed animal is another deterrent for some predators.\nI like how they really tried to be realistic with the wolves and how they hunt. They're always in packs and they use tactics to try and attack you. I've had it where one has rushed me so that my focus is on that one then 2 others flank me while the first runs to a safe distance. It's also kind of sad that if they run, they'll come back and howl for their fallen wolves. Also, their eyes reflect the light at night which is just awesome.\n\nThere's definitely some things that they need to work on with the tamed beasts. Sometimes my beast will be stuck somewhere while I'm getting my butt kicked by enemies. Other times, my beast won't disengage from enemies so it ends up dying because it won't come back for me to heal it. It's a bit annoying and frustrating, especially when you're trying to take a bonfire...but it's not a deal breaker.\nYes, it's annoying that they speak a different language and you have to read the subtitles...but you get used to it after a while.\nThe graphics aren't bad...but they're also not the best. I'm also running it on "high". I could probably run it higher than that, but it doesn't really matter to me. Again, not a deal breaker.\n\nThere's plenty to do in the game to keep you occupied. Right now I'm just capturing various bonfires and hunting/gathering so I can upgrade my camp.","March 2","true","16.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Croaker1084/recommended/371660/","Croaker1084","THE GODDAMN BATMAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Croaker1084/","88 products in account","To preface; I will say that this is not a full review of Far Cry Primal, rather this is an overview. I am doing this because.. I feel that too many people are giving this game a negative review wihout much or any substance objectively. That and in the three or three and a half hours of plaaytime, I found this to be a very fun game, it is exciting and it is entralling. I would aactually like to see Ubisoft experrment more with different time periods, eras. And I feel that people who on the fence should know that this is worth the $60 price tag. I'll update this after I have completed the game, as some things may change. I'm sure I will develop criticisms over the course of the game, etc.. I will not mention anything about the story yet, because I have not progressed far enough into the story. The character animations and VO work that I have experienced so far is convincing and is outstanding work.\n\nSo, what makes Primal so captivating, I'll tell you. The setting in itself is one of the major reasons. The world of Oros is beautiful, full of life and is a sensory overload when it comes to the audio; a good thing. Teaming with wildlife and, yes other cavemen. Depite its beauty, this world that has been created is dangerous. You can find yourself into some serious trouble in Oros very quickly! The weapons are primitive and they do lack complex or cool looking animations, but you're a caveman, you're just trying to survive. When attacked and under stress, with your aderline pumping, and a lack of formal training, you are going to swing your club as wildly as possible, and a spear is a thrusting weapon, not a slashing weapon. You're not a highly-trained martial-artist wielding a staff or or a sword. With that said the combat is brutal and fun! That's what matters! It is satisfying to throw a spear into a mans face as it is into an animal, same thing with clubing someone to death. The hunting is great fun! I enjoy the fact how I have to track whatever game I have shot with my bow or thrown spear, because as someone who actually hunts, animals don't just drop dead on the spot most of the time. It's a nice change to see in a game. Many have complained of the partially made up language. Ubisoft did work with experts to craft a language that would be believable, though not 100% accurate. You can hear the emotions converyed through the voice actors and I appluad this apporach. The subtitles do not bother and it adds another layer of immserion to a game that very atmospheric. There is no other game, that I know of that has a wrold like Oros. It is unique in that regard, even if Ark has a world similar. In Ark you have firearms, which to me would detract from the experience overall.\n\nI will recommend to everyone to play on "expert" difficulty and to turn most, if not all of your HUD elements off. You'll rely pretty much solely on audio cues and it'll take a while, but you will feel scared and you should feel that thrill, that anxiety. Of both being scared and exploring a land you know nothing of. Get out there and get lost, feel the experience and bask in the atmosphere! You are not at the top of the food-chain, you're far from it. I find myself, especailly at night, which is so much different from the dynamics of daytime play, always being cautious and listening very carefully to sounds. As well as hunting for animals that appear at night only. I am having as close to a caveman experience as I think we may ever get in a AAA title. And this experience feels authentic, as far as video games go. This game as is so far in my experience gets a solid recommendation.\n\nEDIT: Having played more of the game, I feel that the story is good enough so far. It's not top tier, it is not The Witcher 3 calibre of story-telling; but it is not a bad story. What is most important that I've realized is that now that I have tamed most of the beasts, and have uncovered aa good portion of the map. The game has become highly addicting! I am about 11 percent complete with the game. My one major complaint is that night cycles should really last longer; as well as the frustration of losing a rare beast because it died. I like the mechanic on paper. It's more immersive, but it isn't fun to try to track down another rare black leopard.","March 12","true","23.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Yep, role-playing. Not using shortcuts, taking everything off the UI on screen, already you'll find the game more interesting. Now, decide to only play as realistically as you would if you were there. You wouldn't stand in the middle of their camp and hope to shoot them all first. I get the Owl out, recce ahead, plan my moves two or three ahead. I find the outter enemies of an encampment or whatever the best to pick off first, just as I would in real life. I summon my stealthest beast.   The stragglers get eaten without out any alarms.   You know what Im getting at. This game is a fantastic open canvas of how ever you like to play. I was about to refund this game, but I decided to try realistic style approach.  No helps, no exploits, no cheesy running in and taking your chances. You wouldn't do that in real life. But in this game does it ever bring in the suspension of disbelief.\n\nGive it a good try. The game becomes all that you wished it would do for you. But this is a game you play close to the bone, and it comes alive. I'm 24% through, and 30 hours into it. I have 3/4 of a game left, and I'm already not wanting it to end.  There is just so much you can do in this game, but it will take a choice on your part. Are you willing to put a bit of effort into it, or moan, because the Dev's have left something out that you feel makes the game poor.  Not a chance, This is a polished, smooth running, innovative aspects of stealth, pet taming, etc. Brilliant. Can't wait to see where this goes.\n\nDeveloper's, thanks you for a wonderful labour of love youve put into your game.

All the negatives I've seen are just people complaining about an error instead of looking into the forums for the simple fix.\n\nI've not had any issues with the game on my 3.4GHz i5, 16GB RAM, 4GB GTX970 box. With my 1440p monitor, the in-game benchmark shows around 44FPS on ULTRA settings.\n\nAs for the game itself, I feel Ubisoft redeemed itself from the uter launch failure that I found FC4 was. Haven't experienced a single bug, error, or glitch. And you get a ton of UI configuration to get rid of almost all the immersion-breaking features. My only annoyance is untagged hostile animals and humans show up on the minimap and the only way to get rid of that is to disable the ENTIRE minimap.\n\nThe world is absolutely GORGEOUS! And unlike FC4, the absurd amount of animals in the world works very well, creating the feel of man being part of the nature untouched by the civilized world. The familiar mechanics received an upgrade as well. Unless you headshot a goat from your bow, it'll run away, but will soon bleed out; and you can use your "animal" vision to track it. You can use animal fat or burning things in the world to set your arrows or club on fire, increasing damage. And yes, you can set a bear on fire with a burning club, and it'll run around burning down the woods. You can also collect materials and build up your village.\n\nYou can tame animals, which will function as your attack drones. You also meet multiple characters that join your village and offer you side quests. Collecting resources and building (and upgrading) village huts for these people gives you upgrades.\n\nIf FC4 blatantly rehashed the enjoyable elements of FC3, Primal certainly makes the concept more subdued. You still have the familiar random encounters, hunts, plants, outposts, and collectables, but they feel much more an integral part of this stunning and outlandish caveman world. With FC4, I felt it was a cash grab. With Primal, I feel Ubisoft took a risk, poured some heart and soul into it, and it paid off. If you've enjoyed FC3 and FC4, you'll definitely enjoy Primal.\n\nBuy this game.","March 2","true","36.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The map is WAY different than FarCry4. The river layout is similar, however the topography is INSANELY different! The combat is more challenging i feel, since there's no more guns, and thats a plus for me! Taming animals could have been made a bit more of a challenge, but I'm not complaining.

I was looking forward for it.\n- The graphics are ok for me; probally they should have made the possibility for higher graphic settings.\n- Also the  fire is cool. Unfortunately you can't really burn down the enemy villages; you can put them on fire but this    doesn't change a lot. Even in missions where you need to burn down things these things will respawn.\n- Stroy has good basic approaches, but there could have been done much more.\n- Language is interesting. But again, there would have been MUCH more potential.\n- enviroment looks nice and interesting\n\nCons:\n\nThe game is much too easy: The beast taming is incredible easy, you can get a cave lion in the first few hours of the game, even on hardest difficulty. And if you have one you will have no trouble at all anymore, because then you have in short time ALL beasts. You can run through the country with your cat following you scaring and killing everyone you meet while collecting everything you see on the minimap, so that your village is fully upgraded after 10 hours of game play.\n\nIt has nothing to do with survival:\n- no starvation etc\n- healing too easy; beast revival too (even if the beast is killed in battle you can run to it, give it 3 meat and it will have full health again)\n- your population can only grow (even if you see your people dying by a enemy attack. Population is only reduced by teamkills)\n- too much population on close room (bascially every 10m a enemy patrol etc)\n- beast taming is a joke: throw a few flesh infront of an cave bear who attacked you 2 seconds ago and be best friends with the cave bear 4 seconds later. You can even kill your animals or put them on fire; they won't hurt you at all if you tamed them once.\n- you can use a owl to scout but its the only owl in the whole world\n- combat is awful (melee is nothing more than a click orgy; archery is ok though). Beasts will kill everything. You kill a wolf with 1 strike? The enemy warriors of a naturally stronger tribe are murdered 3vs1 by a normal wolf. And I don't even need to say what happens if you have a saberthoot cat...\n- Poisonous snakes are a joke. You got bitten by such snake? Eat 3 meats and feel fresh like bevor. Or better: You can find the snake with your x-ray before and give it a headshot with your bow).\n- No weather (no storm, winter etc) which makes the life in stone age hard\n\n\nI played Witcher 3 on god mode and even with invulnerability it was more difficult than Far Cry Primal.\nIf you want nothing deep and just rush through a game with stone age setting and repeating missions it's perfect for you.\nIf you expected to travel through a beatiful world without being attacked every 10m by 2-3 enemy warriors (even if you have a saberthoot cat) and hope that this game is more survival and immersive than Far Cry 4 you might be dissappointed.","March 4","false","29.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I think people are being just a little too pretentious in their reviews thus far, its something different from the normal hey let me just run around and shoot stuff up.\n\nI feel way more vulnerable in this game than I have in awhile, animals and enemies can really sneak up on you if you are too busy enjoying the view, especially if you are in thick brush!\n\nAnyway I would recommend this game but I do understand the frustration of others not being able to boot it up on release day.\n\nThe only thing that really pisses me off so far is I can't find a way to change the settings other than changing it from "High" to "Ultra" and whenever I do try and change the settings the game either stops responding or just force closes. Not sure what that's about, if someone found a workaround let me know.\n\nMY BUILD:\ni7 Quad Core 4790K Devils Canyon 4gb unlocked\n16GB RAM\nSeagate 1TB HDD\nEVGA GeForce GTX 780\n850W Power Supply\nWindows 10 64 Bit","March 2","true","25.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Sure, this plays like the recent FC games. But we, the people who pre-ordered or picked this up in the first couple of days must have enjoyed those, right? If you didn't, then why on stoneage-earth would you pay full price when every single trailer, preview stream, and week's worth of console footage showed it was going to be just like the FC3/4? If you're completely new to FC, and just got hooked on the stoneage world and are now suffering issues, then for you I feel genuinely sorry.\n\nSo I knew what I was buying, and I love it.\n\nThe new setting is both beautiful and terrifying. If you want the experience, switch the UI off, crank the sound up, and just go exploring. As you'd expect, there's a ton of stuff to go see, to hunt, to quest for and to gather. Build your town up, talk to the locals, realise you're picking up words of the language and geeking out over pronouncing the words just right, and admit to yourself this game has sucked you in like its predecessors.\n\nThere must be some issues and bugs - so many people are saying so. And it's Day 2 of the PC version, so that's not surprising. Googling around, there's not many hints of confirmed game-breakers, and most (not all) of the complaint reviews here on Steam haven't got enough playtime to have come anywhere close to those. My machine's no powerhouse - it's just a 980 (that I bought for FC4) sitting with an AMD Black from 2015, OC'ed a little, and everything is running at 1080 on maxxed settings - no stutter, no frame-rate drops to anything noticeable, no crashing. Maybe there's issues at 4k, but until my kids have grown a little, that option's not on the table for me, nor for a whole host of other gamers. If it's not running properly on your shinier rig, and you've tweaked all the settings and got nowhere, then go find a way to report it. They will fix it, just probably not today. They want your money, they want you to buy the next game. Just try to be realistic - there's no way of testing a game on even a significant fraction of all the possible machine builds out there, and sorting performance issues can take some time.\n\nShould you buy it? If you're new to the FC series, sure, jump in here and spend a *lot* of time in this world. If you liked FC 3 or 4, and don't mind that this one is kinda the same, but with pets instead of rocket launchers, then again, yup, buy it and enjoy the bits they've done differently as you work your way to becoming the most epic caveman of all time. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat, and I'll be continuing to play it slowly in the few gaps I get these days.\n\nRock on, cave-dwellers!\n\n","March 2","true","4.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Some don't, for various reasons, but I do.\n\nI am a big fan of the aesthetics; the looks, the feeling that they've captured. It is truly a beautiful game. I do enjoy the combat as well, especially charging into battle on the back of a Mammoth or a Sabertooth. There is lots to do and it does feel like a Far Cry game set in the stone age.\n\nThe game fails however, at presenting you with a clear story, or a sense of purpose or direction. You go through side quests until the story is complete. Some might consider this approach (having the story delievered in a non-linear way) good, but i personally didn't like it. There were some minor graphical bugs that were annoying. Speaking of annoying, forget the "Oros is a dangerous place where you aren't on top of the food chain"-thing, frequent animal attacks become a huge thorn in your side after a while.\n\nAll in all, I think that this game is nice (if a bit overpriced). It is a fresh idea, which I like, from the Proto-Indo-European language, to the Beast taming, to exploring the huge map. It is flawed, yes, and certainly not perfect, but I'd say that if you like either the Stone Age or the Far Cry franchise, chanses are you will think as I, that the good DOES outweigh the bad.","March 4","true","33.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But I do love the franchise in general so I gave it a shot. Primal does have its upsides; graphically its beautiful, the storyline is interesting enough, and the gameplay is immediatly familiar to anyone who's played the previous games. That said, I very quickly tired of using nothing but a bow and a handful of melee weapons. Admittedly I haven't played it much at all, but it seems an FPS without any actual shooting just can't hold my interest. Compared to earlier entries in the Far Cry series the combat in Primal is horribly lacking in variety. Had it been made under a different title it might have been less of a let down, but I'm afraid the Far Cry name set expectations that Primal simply can't live up to.","April 29","false","3.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I love the time period and the rawness of using more simplistic weaponry, but I was concerned about some of the negative reviews the game was getting. I decided to take the risk and buy it, and I'm so glad I did.\nFirstly, the game looks beautiful.  The lighting as you creep through dense jungle through rays of light is just astonishing. As is the volumetric fog and the atmosphere it creates.  The different biomes really do breathe life into the map in a way similar to Skyrim.  I just don't get the irony of all the people who bought Far cry 5 and are complaining that the game is like a far cry game.  The simplistic weapons really add to the crafting system and make the survival element of the game more real than just walking around the map to complete a story.  There's more UI customization in this game than previous ones.  I 've chosen to get rid of all the clutter.  I turned off The minimap, game hints, enemy tagging etc in favour of realism.  The game now feels more like a more advanced stone age Skyrim than a Far Cry game.  Another patch is in the making already to add a survival mode with features such as permadeath and other options, so support is ongoing.\nMy advice to anyone thinking buying the game, is to ignore negative comments and trust your instincts as I did.  If the nature of the game appeals to you, the simple weapons, the survival elements and the time period, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\nPeople who buy a game set in the stone age, then complain that there are no guns, belong in the stone age.","March 31","true","75.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It is a great game just not for everyone.\nIts not a shooter, its more of a stealth/exploration game with a healthy dose of hunting and crafting thrown into the mix. It's not grindy, contrary to what I had read before buying it. Those reviewers must have the attention span of an 8 year old. Seriously I'm not kidding.\nUbisoft has done a great job of bringing their vision of 10 000 bc to life, complete with the spoken languages of the inhabitants and a living, breathing world teeming with life. You can almost smell the fresh, unpolluted air blowing down off that giant glacier hanging on the distant mountains.\nAll the boohooing about the shape of the map matching farcry 4. Don't worry, This is a complete new world to explore. I put alot of time into Farcry 4 and if I hadn't read about the map thing I would have never known. This is a lush beautiful, orginal world to spend some time in.\nI don't miss the guns. I actually feel alot more relaxed in Oros, honestly its kinda freeing. There are enough upgrades for the available clubs, bows, spears etc that it is keeping it interesting enough for me.\nBesides you can ride a sabertooth tiger what the hell else can a guy ask for. They had me the first time I speared an enemy from the back of my sabertooth.","April 10","true","38.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","2"

Insanity is doing the exact same f****** thing over and over again expecting things to change." -Vaas Far Cry 3\n\nI have now realized that's a quote used by Ubisoft about Ubisoft. Nice hair tho.\n\nIt's a good game, on its own. But, the same game was created four years ago, and then again a year and a half ago (from 2016). And now, this is the 3rd installment of the same game. To add insult to injury the map of Far Cry 4 and Far Cry Primal have the same topography. The sounds and animations are all the same from Far Cry 3 and the entire game feels like Far Cry 3/4. The major difference is that the story isn't as intriguing, and also its set in the stone age.  Far Cry 3 was such a strong game and Ubisoft has milked it's greatness to the bone. I was happy to see that the game was somewhat lenghty (+15 hours to complete story, similiar to Far Cry 3/4), but it was mostly just copy paste, all the main missions, side missions and exploration felt same old, same old. Not going to lie, I liked it. But not loved it, though I loved Far Cry 3. I feel disgusted that Ubisoft can put almost zero effort into a game but can sell it like hotcakes because it used the same formula. They didn't even fix the problems with their Dunia Engine. It's still absolutely terrible around any structures, with many framerate drops around all outposts, though, it's more consistent than it was in FC4. What ubisoft has done is created a formula to print money, and it works. If Far Cry 4 is actually Far Cry 3.5, then Primal is Far Cry 3.75 Stone Age Editon.\n\nIn all honestly, I liked it. I am a fan of the series and a fan of Far Cry 3. But after this game I am ready to move on, I am ready for a new Far Cry experience. I am dehydrated of the same formula. A new formula is needed, badly. But overall, on its own, not compared to is prequels, it's a fun game. It's an enjoyable game with stunning visuals. It has enough content and to keep you playing for hours, though it does get repetitive. Final verdict, 7.5/10 or 3.75/5, because truly that's what it is; Far Cry 3.75.","March 28","true","33.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Anyway thats not all that annoys me, lets talk about the farcry series as a whole... why can they not choose one either let the players jump up on top of every ledge thats under x feet tall or have a specific interface for jumping up on a ldge and show an annoying little cutscene of you climbing up a ledge slowly... no no they have to take the worst parts of both and mash them together... a genericly generated ledge that you can climb any part of randomly that may or may not work... AND you have a generic cutscene of you climbing a ledge slowly... oh and did i forget to ask for a grown in that cutscene? i think we need to through a grown... nothing shows effort like a grown.  now then i'm probably far enough down to start talking about the boobies... yes there are boobies in primal... well 1 boob... at a time... unless they are painted and have bumps all over them... now dont get me wrong i did not buy this game for porn but if your ganna go there... GO ALL THE WAY... and yes pun was intended... they hadent even invented undies yet so why are the women warring them? at best it was a rope or lether thong!... and then all the women ware pants but only the men ware skirts? REALY?... not to mention aperantly the men havent heard of this undies invention the women seem to be keeping it to themselfs... dont ask me how i know this i was throughing some bodies on a fire... why?... lets just say i have issues... but it did get me interested... no not in the mans balls i have a pair i can look at them if i ever wanted to... i was wondering if the izuli wore undies... and it turns out that they do... but their balls stick out... and ubi painted them... that prooves it ubi is gay... just figured that out... theres just no excuse for painting another mans digital balls... they just used this title to come outa the closet... well congrats ubi you have made it official... oh but not all women ware undies... i did find a random old hag with a conspicuesly placed dark spot or LOTS of hair... well they probably didnt shave back then so im ganna go with she has one hariy ♥♥♥♥... can i say ♥♥♥♥?  well if i can say ♥♥♥♥ i probably can... anyways... ya ubi... why did you stop at one boob a mans balls and his uncircumcised ♥♥♥♥? you had to get the ♥♥♥♥ in there but not the ♥♥♥♥?thats just... multiple levels of wrong and not just the normal kind... and this has nothing to do with your digital yurination fetish... im not going to talk about that... NEVER going to talk about that... ever time i deal with that npc i have to take a REAL shower... plus dunk my character in some digital water and then run my comp through the dishwasher and its STILL not enough... its NEVER enough...  and all we did to that npc was throw him against the wall? we shoulda punched his ♥♥♥ out and then DRAGGED him back to the colony...   also the story is short and im 30% complete with all but on wep one character to get and 0 of the evil bosses defeated... oh did i forget to mention that ALL of the wenja are wusses... they cant fight there way out of a wet paper bag... they dont get upgraded and i am sitting on one metric ton of usless ♥♥♥♥ resorses because i have noware to put it and noware to use it on.  also the 2 people that were supposed to make your npcs stronger... nah not at all.  also i cant send them anyware despite being there so called leader and the uldam can apparently walk frealy right up to my doorstep even though ive taken out at least 2/3s of the outposts bonfires... oh and those are also useless except as fast travels... the vision range boost? you would think from previous titles it would be a region or a section... nope its only slightly further then your normal range... by the time you have actualy captured the bonfire youve probably already covered its vision range... and the outpost stopping the enemy from coming into your territory after youve captured it? nope its increased rescue missions for you cuz your people are pethetic... if it wasnt for you theyed die from well everything... a small disabled kid was one of the bosses that was killing thousands of your wenja brothers... not realy but im sure he could.  and theres also the random events that arent even events... so annoying... its like do i kill ever uldam i see or do i actualy travel more then five feet...   or how about the weapons... for those that have not lost to ADD yet... make sure you pick up wood when you can because first you will use ALLOT of arrows... second you will lose ALLOT of arrows... thin you can grab them out of that enemies quiver?  think you can take thier "advanced" weapon like bombs? NOPE!!!...  so to sum it up its short repetitive and a bit annoying but its still fun and will keep me ocupied till theres another elder scrolls title that isnt the mistake elder scrolls online is.","March 6","true","28.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Insanity is doing the exact same f****** thing over and over again expecting things to change." -Vaas Far Cry 3\n\nI have now realized that's a quote used by Ubisoft about Ubisoft. Nice hair tho.\n\nIt's a good game, on its own. But, the same game was created four years ago, and then again a year and a half ago (from 2016). And now, this is the 3rd installment of the same game. To add insult to injury the map of Far Cry 4 and Far Cry Primal have the same topography. The sounds and animations are all the same from Far Cry 3 and the entire game feels like Far Cry 3/4. The major difference is that the story isn't as intriguing, and also its set in the stone age.  Far Cry 3 was such a strong game and Ubisoft has milked it's greatness to the bone. I was happy to see that the game was somewhat lenghty (+15 hours to complete story, similiar to Far Cry 3/4), but it was mostly just copy paste, all the main missions, side missions and exploration felt same old, same old. Not going to lie, I liked it. But not loved it, though I loved Far Cry 3. I feel disgusted that Ubisoft can put almost zero effort into a game but can sell it like hotcakes because it used the same formula. They didn't even fix the problems with their Dunia Engine. It's still absolutely terrible around any structures, with many framerate drops around all outposts, though, it's more consistent than it was in FC4. What ubisoft has done is created a formula to print money, and it works. If Far Cry 4 is actually Far Cry 3.5, then Primal is Far Cry 3.75 Stone Age Editon.\n\nIn all honestly, I liked it. I am a fan of the series and a fan of Far Cry 3. But after this game I am ready to move on, I am ready for a new Far Cry experience. I am dehydrated of the same formula. A new formula is needed, badly. But overall, on its own, not compared to is prequels, it's a fun game. It's an enjoyable game with stunning visuals. It has enough content and to keep you playing for hours, though it does get repetitive. Final verdict, 7.5/10 or 3.75/5, because truly that's what it is; Far Cry 3.75.","March 28","true","33.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And in terms of gameplay, graphics, ambience, and pure fun, it deserves a 10/10.  This is the game that is the most Far Cry-ish Far Cry game ever created.  They took the best parts of the Far Cry series, the hunting and crafting and exploration and environment, and built the game around those things as the primary focus.  So 10/10 for the devs and designers.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is published by Ubisoft, who sneer at Valve's radical concept of "let people play the games that they paid for".  Far Cry Primal just recently received an update.  Work had kept me busy, but it's Saturday and I wanted to try it out and see what they've changed.  So I open Far Cry via Steam, and I get an error message saying that they couldn't sync my achievements with the Cloud.  There's a retry button, but two retries gave the same result, so I just hit "skip".  Then there was some sort of error message about sound not working, and the game exited before it could load up.  Ok, fair enough, maybe I need to update something on my end, but lemme try one more time.  This time when I try to run Far Cry Primal, I get an error saying that Ubisoft has suspended my account due to multiple login attempts.\n\nYes, Ubisoft has decided not to allow me to play a game that I paid for, because I had trouble launching the game that I paid for, as a result of an upgrade to the game that I paid for.  Oh, and any of their other games that I have paid for as well, since it's my entire account that is suspended.\n\nIt sucks, because I really love this game, and I've played FC3 and FC4 through twice each (well over 100 hours logged in each one according to Steam).  I pre-purchased FC Primal.  I won't make that mistake again.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  Ubisoft has a history of pulling stuff like this, but it's the first time I've experienced it firsthand.  Why pay for a game that the publisher won't let you play?","March 19","false","20.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Nice hair tho.\n\nIt's a good game, on its own. But, the same game was created four years ago, and then again a year and a half ago (from 2016). And now, this is the 3rd installment of the same game. To add insult to injury the map of Far Cry 4 and Far Cry Primal have the same topography. The sounds and animations are all the same from Far Cry 3 and the entire game feels like Far Cry 3/4. The major difference is that the story isn't as intriguing, and also its set in the stone age.  Far Cry 3 was such a strong game and Ubisoft has milked it's greatness to the bone. I was happy to see that the game was somewhat lenghty (+15 hours to complete story, similiar to Far Cry 3/4), but it was mostly just copy paste, all the main missions, side missions and exploration felt same old, same old. Not going to lie, I liked it. But not loved it, though I loved Far Cry 3. I feel disgusted that Ubisoft can put almost zero effort into a game but can sell it like hotcakes because it used the same formula. They didn't even fix the problems with their Dunia Engine. It's still absolutely terrible around any structures, with many framerate drops around all outposts, though, it's more consistent than it was in FC4. What ubisoft has done is created a formula to print money, and it works. If Far Cry 4 is actually Far Cry 3.5, then Primal is Far Cry 3.75 Stone Age Editon.\n\nIn all honestly, I liked it. I am a fan of the series and a fan of Far Cry 3. But after this game I am ready to move on, I am ready for a new Far Cry experience. I am dehydrated of the same formula. A new formula is needed, badly. But overall, on its own, not compared to is prequels, it's a fun game. It's an enjoyable game with stunning visuals. It has enough content and to keep you playing for hours, though it does get repetitive. Final verdict, 7.5/10 or 3.75/5, because truly that's what it is; Far Cry 3.75.","March 28","true","33.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And in terms of gameplay, graphics, ambience, and pure fun, it deserves a 10/10.  This is the game that is the most Far Cry-ish Far Cry game ever created.  They took the best parts of the Far Cry series, the hunting and crafting and exploration and environment, and built the game around those things as the primary focus.  So 10/10 for the devs and designers.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is published by Ubisoft, who sneer at Valve's radical concept of "let people play the games that they paid for".  Far Cry Primal just recently received an update.  Work had kept me busy, but it's Saturday and I wanted to try it out and see what they've changed.  So I open Far Cry via Steam, and I get an error message saying that they couldn't sync my achievements with the Cloud.  There's a retry button, but two retries gave the same result, so I just hit "skip".  Then there was some sort of error message about sound not working, and the game exited before it could load up.  Ok, fair enough, maybe I need to update something on my end, but lemme try one more time.  This time when I try to run Far Cry Primal, I get an error saying that Ubisoft has suspended my account due to multiple login attempts.\n\nYes, Ubisoft has decided not to allow me to play a game that I paid for, because I had trouble launching the game that I paid for, as a result of an upgrade to the game that I paid for.  Oh, and any of their other games that I have paid for as well, since it's my entire account that is suspended.\n\nIt sucks, because I really love this game, and I've played FC3 and FC4 through twice each (well over 100 hours logged in each one according to Steam).  I pre-purchased FC Primal.  I won't make that mistake again.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  Ubisoft has a history of pulling stuff like this, but it's the first time I've experienced it firsthand.  Why pay for a game that the publisher won't let you play?","March 19","false","20.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's an open world first person shooter (With bows and spears) set in the year 10,000 BCE. It's got collectibles, outposts to scout out and capture, and bonfires which open up the surrounding map.\n\nBy far, the biggest knock against this game is that it is ostensibly too similar to Far Cry 4. However, I never played Far Cry 4 and my last Far Cry game played was Blood Dragon in 2014. It's the proven Far Cry formula and it still works. If you're tired of it, then I suggest you wait until a sale. But, for me, it was worth the price.\n\nRemoving the guns from a Far Cry game was a bold step and I welcomed the difference. Combat is closer than the past far cry games since spears and bows don't have the range of a sniper rifle. This change made me have to adapt my usual play style to make it work. I played the game as a pseudo open world stealth game as a result. Sneaking through the night dodging wolves and bears only to chuck a freaking spear into the back of some dudes head and then watching the impact cause him to fly off a cliff was always satisfying. I'm pretty sure I killed 2 guys with the same spear once.\n\nI spent about 40 hours with this game and never got bored with it. I didn't even do every side quest or collectible so if you're a completionist, you can dump a ton of time into this game. The setting was very interesting and the story wrapped up nicely.\n\nBottom line is that it's a Far Cry game. If you're new to the series, this is an interesting place to start. If you're tired of the formula then maybe wait until you see a sale. But this game isn't as bad as some have said.","April 11","true","40.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It may not quite make my price/hour ideal but such is life. Ideally if I can get 1$ per hour on a single player story based game I am quite pleased. FCP looks like ill get away with 2$ per hour.\n\nYes UPlay can be a pain sometimes get over it. You knew what you were getting into.\n\nI have had 2 crashes in 14 hours of game play its a new game ♥♥♥♥ happens. Had a brief issue with Uplay but that resolved in around 10 mins on Uplay's end. ♥♥♥♥ happens.\n\nFor those complaining that the map is recycled I suggest to you that Oros is Kryat in prehistory.  The work they did on making a "living world" is well worth looking at a similar map as the one for Kryat. I'm gestimating that the full Oros map is at least 50% larger than Farcry 4 just from what I've seen so far.\n\nThe story is fine. Hasn't hooked me like FC3 but I really liked the story for 3. But makes sense and is coherent\n\nGraphics are beutiful on my system. Definately an improvement over FC4. For those having issues I suggest upgrading.\n\nAt the end of the day Far Cry Primal is a unique title covering a period that isnt often addressed in video games and is well worth a look.","March 2","true","18.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

IMO it would be better if we had a special building  to help tame pets, but no, 2 buttons is enough\n- quests degrade has you advance, first quests are awesome and mistic, final quests are "go there and kill everyone"\n\nyou can still have fun with this game, but not at this price, you are better off waiting for a sale if you really want this game","March 5","false","36.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

People say its repeatative, go here, get that, but its not. Sure you have to travel, but for different reasons. In my four hours so far, ive already saved a hunter, helped a crazed warrior burn corpses, escape a freak's cave filled with leopards and urine, gone on 3 acid trips, hunted a bear, and created a village. And you know what, I regret nothing. I havent even scratch the games surface yet, and im already having tons of fun.\n\nHunting is amazing. To track an animal, then hunt it down, or, even better, have my recently tamed bear wipe it out by tackling it and biting its throat. Visuals are outstanding from affar, fur gets a litle funky up close, but thats understandable.\n\nPeople say the characters arent interesting because they dont speak english. I find that a lie. I have met a fearful gatherer, who wants to be more than she is, a crazed shaman who loved getting me high as the sky, a insane warrior who loved to burn corpses, and a elderly hunter who thinks i look like a mammoth. Not to mention the one armed psycho who peed on me.\n\nI dont follow all the hate for this game, yes its not perfect, but its a long way from a thumbs down. Id rate it a personal 8.8/10 Its good, the only downfall I see, is getting my damn population count to 40. Other than that, Far Cry Primal has taken me to a time i never thought I'd see, and I wouldnt trade that for the world.","March 21","true","21.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No games are perfect. But to you people who expected it to be:\n\nPeople being mad because the game didn't go the way they (who goes into pointless details) wanted it to be. It's a simple game about being in the stone age. What do you expect? Mansions and cars? 10.000 B.C.E barely has fire invented. The game is for people that actually likes other stories than Farcry 3 and 4 over again. If you're a real fan of the Farcry series, you actually like it even if it's only spears, clubs, bows and arrows. It's a challange. Countless times I finished Farcry 3 and 4 on the hardest difficulties, but Primal gives the right challanges a real fan wants.\n\nYou can't compare Primal with farcry 3 and 4 because 'Primal' itself isn't Farcry 5, it's about old history. 'Primal' means 'first'. First inventor, first in time discovering. Learn the name before judging that the "game is pointless". It's a reason it's not called Farcry 5. It's an additional game for fans that actually supports their work. Real supporters - Real fans gets what they want, you don't because of your pointless whining.\n\nuPlay owns the FarCry series, is why it's originally through their community you play it. Yet, they sell it on Steam, so what? Create a uPlay account, what's so hard about that?\n\nI recommend this game to the real fans out there that has doubts because of kids not getting the 'perfect' game they wanted. Real fans knows, you don't.","March 27","true","28.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There isn't much direction or much story, and no centrla villain, so if you want a story this isn't the place to go.

The reviews so far are all over the place, and some people I normally agree with hate it, and others love it. Shoot, there's even some apathy.  I had a great time in the game, and it felt like a good length.   Maybe the game's format just wasn't what I needed at the time, but I still haven't finished FarCry 3, whereas I powered through 4 and Primal. The map feels like a great size, although I wish the snowy areas and tundra were expanded on, as well as marshier marshes and maybe some other terrain as well.  Love the sequoia style fir trees.  The game has some of the best ambient lighting I've ever seen, especially at night with the moon out and distant fires lit throughout the land casting their cozy glow.\n\nThe combat needs a tad bit of fleshing - if melee is a focus, blocking and dodging should also be options.  Swinging and powerswinging is nice, and the autoaim is enjoyable for the most part.  Even if you're not a great counterstike player, you can still nail those satifying headshots with a spear atop a sprinting sabrecat, and those are some great moments.  There is much repetition - indeed, I could save a lot of words if I simply agreed with someone else that said it was FarCry 3 with a Caveman skin, just like 4 was 3 with an alpine skin.  There's a lot of fetch and kill quests, but the characters are great and some of the dialogue you get makes the grinding seem less grindy.  The owl is a treat, and the one thing that really changed, I felt.  No longer are you restricted to binoculars. I remember a lot of speclation about what, exactly, one would climb in this game, and the answer is naught.  Cliffs, to be sure, but you actually light bonfires instead of climbing towers.  The bonfires are like small, small forts, though some of the endgame enemies (midgame?) like the yellow shield fellas with flaming clubs, can still make them a challege.  As always, and more so than ever, pulling off a stealth takeover on a fort is a feat.\n\nIn any case, I'm just rambling with no sense of focus.\n\nTL;DR -  Is FarCry 3 with Cavemen. Beautiful atmospherics, fun quests and dialogue, but similar game.  Uncover the map 'n' kill stuff.  Very fun at base level - just running and hunting is a treat.  Fetch quests are omnipresent. Owl is great.\n\nPS: URKI!!! He's back - only he could pull off a trailer-trash caveman that, even though speaking a primitive dialect with powerful, dignified-sounding words, still sounds like he just rolled out of a double-wide in lower Alabama.

It's an open world first person shooter (With bows and spears) set in the year 10,000 BCE. It's got collectibles, outposts to scout out and capture, and bonfires which open up the surrounding map.\n\nBy far, the biggest knock against this game is that it is ostensibly too similar to Far Cry 4. However, I never played Far Cry 4 and my last Far Cry game played was Blood Dragon in 2014. It's the proven Far Cry formula and it still works. If you're tired of it, then I suggest you wait until a sale. But, for me, it was worth the price.\n\nRemoving the guns from a Far Cry game was a bold step and I welcomed the difference. Combat is closer than the past far cry games since spears and bows don't have the range of a sniper rifle. This change made me have to adapt my usual play style to make it work. I played the game as a pseudo open world stealth game as a result. Sneaking through the night dodging wolves and bears only to chuck a freaking spear into the back of some dudes head and then watching the impact cause him to fly off a cliff was always satisfying. I'm pretty sure I killed 2 guys with the same spear once.\n\nI spent about 40 hours with this game and never got bored with it. I didn't even do every side quest or collectible so if you're a completionist, you can dump a ton of time into this game. The setting was very interesting and the story wrapped up nicely.\n\nBottom line is that it's a Far Cry game. If you're new to the series, this is an interesting place to start. If you're tired of the formula then maybe wait until you see a sale. But this game isn't as bad as some have said.","April 11","true","40.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I play on 4k resolution, ultra graphics and have had absolutely no crashes. I think the first day I played when I tried to exit it froze up on me, but nothing the task manager couldn't handle. Nothing  game breaking.\n\nThat being said; the game is fantastic. Visuals are excellent, I love the survival feel to it, I like not having a gun and having to feel a bit more like a survivor in a big dangerous world; until you get the long bow, tamed Saber and get really good at anticipating your enemy; then it's easy as pie to take down an entire village.\n\nThere are a lot of standard features seen in other Far Cry games though, in this one, so the experience of being a 'new idea' only lays within the atmosphere. Starting half of the country-side on fire, or doing simple missions for the tribes is nothing new. The standard, same, clunky climbing system and uneventful underwater encounters as we have all experienced in the past with the Far Cry series.\n\nSame stuff, different setting; really. Graphics are slightly upgraded, runs smooth, maintains a nice frame rate for a system that can handle it. Really just a shame that it doesn't feel like a new game, just a mod of the previous releases of the game. Nonetheless I still enjoyed the experience.\n\nOverall it's good. A change of scenery and change of pace with the weapon choices; give it a 8/10 **Here's to hoping the 2018+ version of Far Cry has some NEW ideas.","March 13","true","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Far Cry Primal seems to have captured it better than any game before it and with a familiar interface.\n\nFar Cry elements are obvious, the familiar stealth-o-meter is there as is the grappling hook (eventually), you ride animals instead of driving vehicles, capture and light bonfires instead of capturing and deactivating transmitters on radio towers. You will hunt and skin animals just as before but a lot more and your quarry is bigger, less familiar, teeth longer.\n\nYou eventually become a beastmaster where you tame all sorts of predators to work for you. You will command an owl to do reconnaisance, call in a cave bear to unleash remote death by claw and you may even send in a badger to do tasks under the noses of the enemy. You will have a living arsenal to command and pet.\n\nThe languages spoken feel real and you will think you can speak them since they are open captioned. There are friendly  and unfriendly tribes and as you capture prisoners, some will work for you and teach you their secrets and technology.\n\nIt appears that it used the same map as Far Cry 4, hard to tell from the ground but in map mode it is obvious. This did not bother me, rather it served as a reminder of the many hostories of the same land we live on now. The Flora and Fauna are quite different than in FC4 and far more plentiful and dangerous.\n\nThe Dunia engine runs well on modest machines but give it some horsepower and it becomes nearly photographic.\n\nAll in all it is a worthy and important addition to the Far Cry story and I will finish this like I have everything else in the series. And if you, dear reader, are human you should rent and see the movie "Cave of Forgotten Dreams".","May 26","true","47.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then a couple of games later we get THIS. Some people set down one day and said "hmm how can we change things, ooo what if we removed all guns from the game". So they gave us primitive alternatives but I bet many people out there went "WAIT WHAT?!?!" then someone got up and said "lets remove every and all online elements, no multi, no co-op". And then to top it all off they finished it with "I know, I know let's not do it in a known language".\nSeriously, if I was a game developer and I wanted to pull a prank on a really large scale that's exactly how I would do it LMAO.\n\n\nAlso I noticed something: if you take a look at the whole map shape and size, it looks almost exactly like the south half of Far Cry 4 map.\n\n\nOn a more serious note this game is good, allowing us to focus on the hunting and the wild life more than the capturing and the battles. The UI is actually very neatly organized and the story isn't bad at all. Yes, you basically have to run around with just Bows and a bunch of sticks as weapons, and yes, read everything anyone says in game but it's all about the roaming free around exploring, avoiding or confronting the dangers of a primitive world.\n\nJust be prepared to drink some blood with eyeballs, look into creepy people with weird eyes and horrible faces and run none stop like you are in a marathon that never ends. :) enjoy.\n\nDo I think this game is worth the price?

I run the game at 1440p in Ultra and rarely drops below 50fps. Most of the time I'm at a steady 60fps. My rig is quite powerful (i7 4790, 16gb RAM, Gtx 980ti and a G-sync screen) but I've seen some alarming post from people playing with equal or better rigs having crappy performances so I kinda wonder what's the deal here.\n\nGameplay: well, it's Far Cry with all the good things and bad things that goes with the licence. There's barely anything new here (appart from the Taming) but to be honest, It doesn't bother me as I knew what I was signing for here. Anyone pretending otherwise must live in a cave without internet. The game is more brutal than 3 & 4, lot more punishing early on but once you get the hang of things and your new tools, ennemies (humans and beast) are kinda easy to dispatch. Special mention for the first Izila fort captain who gave me some trouble (I wwasn't prepared!)\n\nGraphics & Atmosphere: as I said, I play on ultra @1440p and its gorgeous. Once again, not many improvements from 3 & 4 but everything looks fantastic. Some textures are still low quality but hey... No nvidia "crap" this time, that should make AMD users happy. Furs and beards still looks cool though.\n\nOverall the atmosphere is very good with smooth day/night transition and lights effects are well adjusted (to my taste at least!). I've noticed some discrepencies somehow from objects that shouldn't be in this era and some subtitles using words that couldn't have existed at the time but that's just me being a nerd I think. The langage invented for the occasion seems rich and credible, and is very well interpreted by the voice actors.\n\nMusic and sounds: nothing much to say about it, I like it, it reinforces the atmosphere very well and is quiet enough not to impair the experience.\n\nTaming: well it's kinda disappointing at this point and I fear I won't get any better. There's some nice beasts to tame and rare also, but it's kinda to easy for the moment. Also, the AI isn't that great, and sometimes your beast just get lost on its own and it can get frustrating. I like the Owl recon mode, it's a nice idea. Beware the archers ;)\n\nSkills: skills in FCP follows the skills we know from other FC games. the more you get, the more you'll feel overpowered. Deal with it!\n\nSide activities: nothing new here, same as before, hunt, kill ennemy captains, kill courriers (wtf?!), save Wenjas, helps wenjas in battle, take control of outpost and bonfires (for fast travel), collect ressources for craft and village upgrade, etc.\n\nMain story: havn't goten very far, but that's not a good story so far. Man get separated from his hunting party (well they're all dead...), man meets girl, man wants to help wenja and goes into Punisher mode. We're faced with some classics (drug induced visions) and to be honest it's starting to get very old. I'll update once I finish the main story line.\n\nHere it is folks! I'm gonna put a thumb up for this game because, to be honest, I enjoyed these 8h so far. I recon the game isn't for everyone and will mainly content hardcore fans of the serie. But if you haven't played any Far Cry yet and still hesitating, go for it. The settings is nice enough and I'm kinda glad there's no ubber rocket launcher or super sniper in the game.\n\nPlayers that fears to play some kind of FC3.5.2 (FC4 being FC3.5.1) you can just pass on this one or wait for a decent sale around december.\n","March 1","true","22.1"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

Number one, that having windows firewall enabled stops the game from opening. Number two, that the framerate is bad and makes the game choppy and hard to play. So how can the everyman PC gamer avoid these two problems? Start by turning off windows firewall. That should take about two seconds. Secondly, if your PC doesnt have the hardware to hang with a brand new massive open world open RPG, dont get mad when you cant run it at 60 FPS on Ultra graphics. I'm running the game on Ultra and having no issues. My framerate consistently stays above 50 and the game looks beautiful. In addition, I'm having a lot of fun with it.

This is a FARCRY game, so if you want to hunt, utilize stealth, control animals, take outposts etc. This is the still the game for you, UNLESS, you are one of these children that can't stand a game a truly and beautifully immersive game.\n\nAfter just 5-6 hours of gameplay I am trying not to sit down and play right now, my village needs me...\nThere's no other game (Amnesa, Slender) That matches this game in fear. I've screamed at the top of my lungs in fear, anger, rage and then fear again, all in five hours of playing this game. And I ♥♥♥♥ing loved it.\n\nAlso, this game is set in 10,000 BCE, if you're expecting harpoon guns and throwing daggers you need to learn what that means.\n\nI'm very impressed with the overall sound quality of this game. I use a Razer Tiamat 7.1 and the effects in the game don't take too long to take me out of my world and into theirs, everything about this game is incredibly immersive but they really nailed the audio effects, I'm not gonna lie, bricks were ♥♥♥♥ when I heard a jaguar up coming behind me.\n\nMy personal favorite part of this game is the (Spoilers) Village of people you have to help and manage grow. You start out basically alone and through bringing food, wood, supplies etc to a village you will attract other remnants of your society to reside with you in the village, this made the immersion incredibly more real to me because I really did care for these people and what happened to them, because, in a time and place like that; we were all we had, and it really felt like that too.\n\nAnimals:\nI haven't got far into this part of the game yet, I've only tamed my 2nd wolf (♥♥♥♥ing love him) but I feel as though they should keep on adding more animals into the game as time progresses, along with tools, to keep the game interesting for years to come","March 3","true","12.3"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","12","26","3","0"

Also you may have heard the map uses the same shape as the previous game only redone and has a different look........yea so? Does that make it not fun? Its been smooth sailing and tons of fun for me so far. Im glad they went a different route with this game and didnt make another modern day Farcry shooter as we have already had 4 of those. If you like large land masses, different biomes, different dangerous tribes, taming a massive cave bear only to send him to eat a caveman, and a large collection and variety of prehistoric beasts and killing said beasts with primitive weapons then this game is for you.

Another thing that isnt too great is the price of the game. I feel that $60 is a bit high for it and would be better if priced at a lower price.

The game does reward stealth so it does not need to just be a spear everything and just spam. The animals do add to the game and some are fun to have along. You can reset some of the objectives and start 'over' again, which does give it a limited replay ability.\n\nNow, for the parts I don't like. You can learn all skills, so at one point there is no reason to earn EXP, your Takkar will be just like everyone elses in the end. (I know this isnt an RPG, but still.) It is an extremly short game in my opinion. I have 100% in game, not all achevments though. Melee combat is a bit rough, so I mostly used bows or spears. Owl bombing run will clear an encampment way to easly. Again this is fixed by not using it, again, just an obsevation. Something that maybe an ongoing thing in FarCry games that I dont know about is Urki. He just didnt fit in the setting. I will admit he was funny, just seemed out of place.\n\nAll in all i do recomend this game. I dont think its worth $60 for the limited game play though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScarlettVespira/recommended/371660/","ScarlettVespira","Incursion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScarlettVespira/","65 products in account","Coming back to write my in-depth review.\n\n*There are not any Spoilers that I know of, but just in case here is a little Caution: Potential Spoilers*\n\n[TL:DR] - The scenery is beautiful, and nothing anyone will regret looking at. This s the perfect stone-age open world game. The graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is suitable, and the glitches (for me) are minor to none. I highly recommend this game. Also, I wish we could name our pets!\n\nI will start off by saying I've contributed a lot of time with the game so far, and will definitely continue too. This game has gotten a lot of crap and negativity from people anywhere from pre-ordering down to the nature of the game.\n\nScenery: I have to say I am impressed. The scenes in this game are absolutely breathtaking and screenshot-worthy at almost every frame. I would have bought this game simply to take in the world. It has been constructed incredibly well and lacks in no areas. You can tell a lot of effort has been put into the making of this world. From the foliage and ambiance, down to the trickles of water, the nature and sound completely immerse you within' a new era.\n\nSound: The sound is authentic. You can hear screams in the distance, animals, enemies, and birds. Each step you take, and arrow you are about to fire come accompanied with an absolute quality of sound where I have no complaints. The sound in this game truly brings to life the atmosphere and ties in well with the world's reactions.\n\nGameplay: The characters do not feel stiff to me, and look fluid and natural within' their actions. I am slightly saddened by the effects and actions of portions of the game, however. I do not like that when I stab an enemy or an animal, there are no marks. It truly pulls me back into the realization that I'm not submersed within' the world. I wish that it was done better. Needless to say, a lot of other aspects of the game make up for it. And not to mention, having your own pets fight for you? That's awesome! The quests keep coming up, and the side-quests are endless. I really enjoy this feature as I do not feel bored. I am overwhelmed with things to do, which is a good thing! Nobody likes a boring game!\n\nSkills/beasts/weapons: As far as skills go, I do enjoy the way they've been constructed. I like that you need to unlock different Wenja in order to obtain their skill trees. I think this is a very good feature, and also, there are a ton of skills! I adore beast taming. I wish that I could name each of my beasts! That would be extremely cool, and hopefully they will find a way to implement it in the future.  Fingers crossed! You can tame a variety of beasts, and using your skill points, you can unlock the tames of other, stronger beasts. As far as weapons go, the selection is numbered. While being low in diversity, I didn't really mind. I like that the weapons are basic, you have your bow, your club, and your spear. What more do you really need in the stone age anyway? I think they chose very good weapons, and their limit was fine. I also love that you can upgrade your weapons. Your bow can be turned into a longbow, and a double-arrowed bow, for example.\n\nSo what?: This game has a lot to offer, and I haven't seen many games of it's type. The Era, being the stone age, is such an awesome idea. An open world game set in the stone age is something that really drawed me into want to purchase the game. I also appreciate the pricing, a lot of Steam games (due to coming with season passes) are up in the $100 dollar range, so it was nice to be able to purchase a game of such a high quality and not have to spend the almost $40-$50 extra (USD). For the price, I think the game is perfectly fine and I highly recommend it.\n\nGlitches/problems/etc: As per my own experience, I have not had any frame-rate issues, nor frozen screens. The game runs perfectly fine for me, and need I say it runs flawless. I had 1 glitch throughout my time, and it was quite minor. The glitch I experienced was by a lake, I seemed to have fell through the map when I crouched, and instead of falling to my inevitable death, I was put in water. The way the area was built, water must have flown not only from the depth of the river, but also under the land, so it was pretty much there to catch my fall. I swam back over to the river and voila! I was fine.\n\nMy Rating Scoreboard:\n\n[] Trash\n[] Do not buy\n[] Maybe… but only maybe\n[] If you’re into this kind of thing\n[] Only purchase when on sale\n[] You won’t regret it!\n[x]  Well done! Worth the money!\n\n\n-Thank you for reading!","March 1","true","36.7"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

I think i may be one of the few individuals who wish and wonder why more games set in the neolithic times haven't been developed. I feel that Farcry Primal does a very good job making the Cro-Magnon/Neanderthal seem realistic and natural. The only cons so far is the Missions are kind of Repetitive and I'm still figuring out if I like the storyline. I do like the concept of moving your tribe to a better area and dominating the landscape to ensure the survival of your tribe. The Taming animals is a nice touch as well. The developers did a good job in not makng your tamed pet too op. My animals still get messed up as much as i doso you actually have to be tactical how you deploy them. I also am digging the crafting. ijust wish it wasn't so hard to find those Rare materials but hey thery wouldnt be rare if they were easily found. all in all i would recomend it to anyone who enjoys this time period in human history and the crafting/taming abilities. Think of it as a linear storied "Ark".","March 6","true","25.8"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

I haven't experienced any crashes, glitches, or errors yet- thankfully. I'm only about 2 hours into Primal, but I'm finding it very enjoyable. The mechanics aren't deep, but Ubi nailed the atmospere.\nPrimal is immersive and intense. Hand-to-hand combat is quick, viscious, and brutal. Bows and spears function well, and having to constantly hunt in order to heal seems very fitting to the period. Being only 2 hours into the game, I've barely made it out of the prologue, so I can't comment on story as yet.\nBut so far so good. This game gets the peroid feel down, and I have to hand it to a corporate publisher like Ubi to allow their team the creative freedom they obviously needed for this game. I'll update this review as needed, but I am very much enjoying this game. That hinges on appreciating it for what it is- escapist FPS with a unique setting. Far Cry games aren't the Cohen brothers and Fargo. They're Michael Mann and Heat, and that's perfectly fine.","March 1","true","18.9"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","9","20","3","0"

For those writing negative reviews for not being able to launch, I understand and have been there, but I still put my concerns in the forums and give the devs a chance to fix issues. then if no help write negative reviews then, but I explian its because of support not game. Seems like alot of the issue (not all) is alot of people play games on pc and dont know how to actually use a pc. I have alot of friends I have to help do basic cleaninig and fixing issues with drivers and other things all PC users should know. Again im not saying that all the issues are unfounded but alot seem to be due to users not having basic knowledge or just dont have the systems to run stuff.

Only thing I had to do was to add it to Avast exclusions. The game runs smoothly on very high settings on my medium range PC. I have a stable rate of 55-60 fps (and I’m tempted to try it on ultra). Graphics are very nice (granted, it’s not Rise of Tomb Raider level of awesomeness), the wildlife and the forest look terrific (albeit the waterfalls are terrible). The soundtrack fits the game perfectly and the ambient is superb. It’s a very atmospheric game, especially when you hunt at night.\n\nFor me the story is fun. It’s pretty much what I was expecting from a story about a primitive tribe. Ubisoft’s crafted language is simply awesome. And it’s not gibberish, as some might think. They actually tried to make it from scratch (apparently from Proto-Indo-European. It’s pretty easy to pick up familiar sounding words (like tiger – tigri or brother – brashtar).\n\nGameplay is good – but it’s my very first Far Cry game ever. Previous titles never grasped me as particularly interesting. I’m not a great fan of FPS games. But Far Cry Primal, as an action game, is good enough for me. I’m happy Ubisoft decided to change the setting to 10k BC, because otherwise I’d probably never pick a Far Cry game at all (and now I’m a little bit tempted to try other parts of the series, maybe).\n\nThe only gripe for me is the overall number of animals. I want more of them (hint for Ubisoft – make a DLC!). I’d love to see aurochs, giganthopitecus, primal horses (yes, there were horses back then as well) and some more extinct exotic mammals, like gomphotheres.\n\nI don’t mind that there are only a few weapons, but it would be nice if they could add a sling and maybe an atlatl or a bolas. Other than that, one or two more tribesman with missions wouldn’t hurt.\n\nOverall I’m pretty satisfied with this game.","March 2","true","31.7"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

Boring.\nThis will be the last Far Cry game I ever purchase and I have them all except FC1.\n\nThe world of Far Cry is way too easy in 2016, and that's exactly what this game is. This is just the previous Far Cry games in ancient times with ancient tools. They put a lot of work into the ancient setting, but not much on making the game fun. Games shouls have an iterative "fun" development cycle much like Pillars of Eternity demonstrated in their dev diary's.\n\nEven turning off all of the Interface Elements, Expert Difficulty, and not using healing items. I have yet to find any challenge that keeps my interest. It's so hard not to use the hunter senses button to see all of the hidden threats, which totally ruins immersion. I'm also constantly reminded what to press to heal, when I'm trying not to heal - because I have infinite healing in my back pocket. There's also no dodge button, no block button, so what's even the point of trying to make combat interesting - just snipe everything with the bow or your overpowered animals. And if you run out of arrows during combat, just pause the game to instantly fill up the quiver. So just machine gun those arrows away.\n\nThere is one motivation to play the game, that's to do all of the things.

If you go in expecting another Far Cry with different mechanics, or improved combat, this may not be the game for you.\nIf you want to experience a creative take on prehistoric life with gritty combat and everything out to kill you, then this is your game!\nThe pet system along with the primitive aspect of your abilities and weapons makes this a game about hunting prey. It's not stalking: steath is only so-so in Primal, but what it does do well is communicate a sense of hunting prey down to become an apex predator yourself. I found the immersive culture, visuals, and time period to be the greatest part of the game. I enjoyed playing through it and yes it is short compared to other Far Cry games, but I think it has more replayability. I loved the sense of total vulnerability from the beginning of the game, and evolving into a nonchalant badass by the end-game.

Boring.\nThis will be the last Far Cry game I ever purchase and I have them all except FC1.\n\nThe world of Far Cry is way too easy in 2016, and that's exactly what this game is. This is just the previous Far Cry games in ancient times with ancient tools. They put a lot of work into the ancient setting, but not much on making the game fun. Games shouls have an iterative "fun" development cycle much like Pillars of Eternity demonstrated in their dev diary's.\n\nEven turning off all of the Interface Elements, Expert Difficulty, and not using healing items. I have yet to find any challenge that keeps my interest. It's so hard not to use the hunter senses button to see all of the hidden threats, which totally ruins immersion. I'm also constantly reminded what to press to heal, when I'm trying not to heal - because I have infinite healing in my back pocket. There's also no dodge button, no block button, so what's even the point of trying to make combat interesting - just snipe everything with the bow or your overpowered animals. And if you run out of arrows during combat, just pause the game to instantly fill up the quiver. So just machine gun those arrows away.\n\nThere is one motivation to play the game, that's to do all of the things. Or 100% all of your collections, gather all of the different resources to craft all of the items, use hunter vision to easily line up headshots with a bow for added xp so you can unlock all of the overpowered skills to make the game even easier and skin the downed animals for their skins to collect them all, and tame all of the animals, basically 100% the game.

The game FEELS like far cry 4, you can definitely tell it's the same engine. There is also a lot of the same ideas you're used to from far cry 3 and 4, such as hunting for crafting upgrades, capturing towers, i mean bonfires/outposts,  but there's just enough that's unique to make is work perfectly, unlike between for far cry 4 (for me personally at least).\n\nThere is just something "primal" and savage about bashing some dudes face in with a fiery club, or watching your arrow sink into someone's eye socket as they rush you with a spear. Or speaking of Spears, watching your freakishly strong arm ragdoll them back when you throw your spear into their gut is also quite satisfying, I swear I'm not a serial killer... There's numerous upgrades for most of the weapons and inventory types, probably due to the fact there is not a huge selection. Your primary weapons are the bow (of which there are 3 I've found so far, the fast beginning bow, a slow, powerful longbow, and a double arrow bow with aim assist), the spear, three club types (regular, Apex club, and two-handed), shards, which are throwing knives, and thats about it aside from traps, and a sling that makes your distraction rocks lethal. Despite the limited arsenal, it is extremely satisfying to use, at least for ranged weapons. The longbow is especially op due to the extra range and power. However, melee just lacks interaction in my opinion. You basically just sit there and swing and hear impacts, but don't really feel it, the fight doesn't really have a ton of immersion I guess and feels like hack and slash but without satisfying kills. However, with how great ranged is you won't really notice it, especially as you upgrade takedowns and unlock more bows. You can clear a squad in two seconds from a distance or surprising them.\n\nThe story is not really what I would call enthralling, but moreso the world that you are in is and makes you interested in what's going on. The non-spoiler version from what I've seen so far (I've mostly done all the side/crafting quests for the village) the Udam are a cannibalistic tribe attacking you initially, and the other people that are blue which haven't been introduced as in conflict with the Wenja yet, but they're the ruling southern tribe, whereas Udam are northern, and you're ♥♥♥♥♥ from both directions in the middle xD You have to swell your tribe after you find the first crazy Wenja and keep them safe from the neighboring tribes while you swell your territory. More population provides extra bonuses like; the passive resources you receive each day increases, you unlock upgrades for structures which in turn unlocks new quests, skills, and items/weapons, and at higher population an xp bonus ( as by the time you have like 80 population you should probably have most of the weapons and tools unlocked so skills are your main grind left to you)\n\nMinor complaint but  I would say the world kind of blends together at times due to how prevalent earth tones from the era, which forces you to use hunter vision for everything, which wouldn'y be that bad if it wasn't a hideous low res matte, yellow overlay on anything important, but is necessary when your'e sniping archers in bushes and dark huts. However, I also am playing with only the reticle on for immersion, which I would reccomend because the game is gorgeous.\n\nI'll update as I actually get into the story but as long as you can run the game, you're off to an amazing start. Also since I've seen people complain about the Division, I played the beta with no issues, no crashes, and on ultra, basically the exact same experience I'm having with Primal right now... You can look at my specs on my profile (although I have 10 now not Windows 7) and how they match up with yours, anything similar to mine shouldn't have any issues, although I cant help you with your firewall, only apologize you're missing out on some fantastic, primitive badassery.\n\nMy opinion: 9.5/10","March 1","true","27.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","1"

It shies away from the previous games in the series that were mostly set in a more modern setting, and instead introduces the player to what life was like in the Far Cry universe 10,000 years before the common era. You play as Takkar and belong to the tribe known as the Wenja, which you figure out very early into the game are the punching bags of the two other dominant tribes occupying Oros... and also the animals occupying the inhospitable region. Frankly the Wenja are terrible at surviving, which is where you come in! In your epic caveman quest to become the baddest creature in Oros you will need to take on animals and humans alike by crafting better weapons, taking advantage of native plants to help adapt to new situations, and tame some of the fierce animals that inhabit Oros itself to aid you in pushing back the Wenja tribe's aggressive neighbors.\n\nIf you enjoyed the solid game mechanics from Far Cry 4 you will welcome their understandable return. Sprinting across Oros while hunting man or animal feels fluid, and once you invest some points into Takkar's caveman perk tree of... caveman skills, you will come to find sneaking, scavenging, and combat becoming much easier. There is even a simle "village growth" aspect to the game; the more Wenja you rescue from danger and the more unique characters you bring into the fold, the more the village grows. You won't have a direct influence on the growth, but it is satisfying seeing the area become full of people who can't survive on their own.\n\nThe story itself is regrttably short, but the gameplay itself more than makes up for it. If you are a completionist than the sheer amounts of quests for you to complete will be an encouragement in and of itself, even if they can become repetitive. Upgrading your gear and taming beasts is very entertaining, and I would recommend doing as much as possible early on to help you feel more like an Apex predator once the time comes for you to take on the other two tribes in their respective questlines.","March 12","true","44.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

With Far Cry 4, Ubisoft took a 'it isn't broke, so don't try to fix it' approach, taking 3, transporting it to a more mountainous area, and giving it a new story and new protagonist, plus one or two other little tweaks and features.  Primal is a little bit more of a departure, with the lack of vehicles, a beast taming function, and a basic village building bit that ties into an expanded crafting and skill set, but it is Ubisoft doing this again, so it's basically what you'd expect from Far Cry in 10,000BCE.

The world feels huge and the atmosphere is just perfect you'll often find people from your tribe minding their own business, maybe you'll catch a glimpse of two predators beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other.\n\nWhile it's true combat can get a little repetitive you can use traps, bombs, owl ambushes, jaguar silent kills and even more stuff to make the experience better, you could just grab a club or a spear and stomp your way through the game but come on what's the fun on that?\n\nOne small complain i have is the wildlife feels a little lacking so if by any chance there is DLC planned for this i really hope they add at the very least 5-10 animals, because the stone age had a lot fo amazing animals that could have added even more mechanics to FC Primal.\n\nI recommend it to FC newbies just like me, because it seems veterans aren't getting anything worth their while.","March 2","true","14.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","2"

The one time I got into the game, I was able to play about 15 minutes or so, which seemed okay enough. However, I had to exit and go to work, and it hasn't worked since then. I have since followed the steps offered by the developer's representative in the forums, and absolutely nothing has changed. People say a lot of bad things about Ubisoft, but until this, I was willing to look past complaints about their business practices and their games' content etc, because I really enjoyed Far Cry 3, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, Far Cry 4, Beyond Good & Evil 2, the Prince of Persia games, and many more. However, they're one of the big name brands, and they've put out a game that doesn't work properly.\n\nThis is a game I have paid full retail price for, and it does not function despite obviously meeting the system requirements (I played on high settings just fine that one time it worked). Quite a few users are having this problem. A significant number of players who appear to have gotten it to function report performance issues making the game unenjoyable as well. I am extremely disappointed with Ubisoft. Please avoid this game at least until (if) they fix it. I will be refunding my purchase in a few days if no fix has been provided, and if it comes to that, I am seriously considering no longer purchasing Ubisoft titles until they have been out for months to be properly patched and discounted, because I shouldn't have to put up with this when I am paying them full price for their game.","March 3","false","0.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Wolves roam the forest and this is all best taken in without a torch.  Let the starlight and moonlight shine down upon the area.  Then notice the sillhouettes of predators, probably wolves, roaming around.  Listen to the sounds around you as the predators hunt down their prey.  Know that you, are a human, at a time when you were part of this food chain, and not standing atop the guns that put you at the top.\n\nI love that this game makes you rethink how you would do a few things because this is a time before even ancient conveniences.  You're part of a tribe of humans that have to fight to survive.  Part of me thought about how awesome it was to not have to pay taxes or rent, but then I remembered that pretty much everything wants to kill them, so maybe it wasnt so nice.\n\nEither way, I like it.\n\n","March 4","true","39.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I noticed changing field of view slider to any number over 100 for some wierd reason caused it. When I set it back to 100 or below I ran at Very high settings @ 60fps With no crash.

The world feels huge and the atmosphere is just perfect you'll often find people from your tribe minding their own business, maybe you'll catch a glimpse of two predators beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other.\n\nWhile it's true combat can get a little repetitive you can use traps, bombs, owl ambushes, jaguar silent kills and even more stuff to make the experience better, you could just grab a club or a spear and stomp your way through the game but come on what's the fun on that?\n\nOne small complain i have is the wildlife feels a little lacking so if by any chance there is DLC planned for this i really hope they add at the very least 5-10 animals, because the stone age had a lot fo amazing animals that could have added even more mechanics to FC Primal.\n\nI recommend it to FC newbies just like me, because it seems veterans aren't getting anything worth their while.","March 2","true","14.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","2"

The one time I got into the game, I was able to play about 15 minutes or so, which seemed okay enough. However, I had to exit and go to work, and it hasn't worked since then. I have since followed the steps offered by the developer's representative in the forums, and absolutely nothing has changed. People say a lot of bad things about Ubisoft, but until this, I was willing to look past complaints about their business practices and their games' content etc, because I really enjoyed Far Cry 3, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, Far Cry 4, Beyond Good & Evil 2, the Prince of Persia games, and many more. However, they're one of the big name brands, and they've put out a game that doesn't work properly.\n\nThis is a game I have paid full retail price for, and it does not function despite obviously meeting the system requirements (I played on high settings just fine that one time it worked). Quite a few users are having this problem. A significant number of players who appear to have gotten it to function report performance issues making the game unenjoyable as well. I am extremely disappointed with Ubisoft. Please avoid this game at least until (if) they fix it. I will be refunding my purchase in a few days if no fix has been provided, and if it comes to that, I am seriously considering no longer purchasing Ubisoft titles until they have been out for months to be properly patched and discounted, because I shouldn't have to put up with this when I am paying them full price for their game.","March 3","false","0.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It's beautiful and stunning visually.  Beyond that I enjoy how the night/day phases altered my game play.\n\nAt night, predators come out.  Wolves roam the forest and this is all best taken in without a torch.  Let the starlight and moonlight shine down upon the area.  Then notice the sillhouettes of predators, probably wolves, roaming around.  Listen to the sounds around you as the predators hunt down their prey.  Know that you, are a human, at a time when you were part of this food chain, and not standing atop the guns that put you at the top.\n\nI love that this game makes you rethink how you would do a few things because this is a time before even ancient conveniences.  You're part of a tribe of humans that have to fight to survive.  Part of me thought about how awesome it was to not have to pay taxes or rent, but then I remembered that pretty much everything wants to kill them, so maybe it wasnt so nice.\n\nEither way, I like it.\n\n","March 4","true","39.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

One of the most satisfying moments was riding a Mammoth and leading a herd of them into an enemy outpost and just watching them get completely destroyed.\n\nThe pet system is really good except for that you are wayyy more likely to get caught if you use anything besides the jaguars, but sometimes it works out that someone I didn't see will be about to kill me and then suddenly my Sabretooth is mauling their face off.. I found for challenge's sake I would leave my pet behind for boss fights and moments where I would want a better stealth experience.\n\nThe world looks amazing and the hunting system can be challenging on hard (the only difficulty I have played on) if you are not careful you will be killed.. simple as that.. But once you fill your pack it kind of loses a point.\n\nThe mount system is pretty awesome , the Sabretooth feels very quick and is alot of fun to chase your kills after they bolt off instead of just sending your pet to chase them while you stand there wondering where the hell they went, the bear mount is pretty awesome too but it can be a bit slow.\n\nOverall I would give it an 8/10","March 24","true","37.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

You only have two "primary" attacks, your bow or melee; "secondary" attacks use up resources so you will likely avoid using these if you are low on resources. Some of these secondary attacks and special weapons are fun to use, but don't really add much to combat as you will be more than fine with your basic bow or club, even on the highest difficulty, specially if you have gathered the resources to level them up.\n\n\nWhich brings me to the most boring part of the game: Gathering resources. You have to gather resources to build up your base, to build up your tools, to upgrade your weapons. Yes, this element has been around since Far Cry 3 but Primal requires you to do this for the better part of the game, and unlike the other entries in the series, you won't be done with it until halfway through the game because most melee weapons can be used as throwing weapons, which means you will use them up, which means you will have to build more. It doesn't take long to get tedious and on the way of fun. Later on you won't have to gather as much or any at all, your village provides sufficient resources, and due to certain skills you will need less and less resources to construct weapons, but by then you have sank hours gathering and it will probably have left a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nThe game is also very easy, I had to switch to Expert difficulty for any kind of challenge and once you get your first  beast the difficulty goes down. Fast. The beasts are fun to use, but in reality you will be sticking to just a of them. The map is pretty big but uninteresting, your wanderlust is sated pretty quickly and after more of the same you will leave exploration aside and rush the game.\n\nThat said, not all is bad. The first few nights were terrifying and exiting. The first time a pack of wolves moved in my general direction I did not know if I should move and risk being spotted or stay an risk being smelled. keeping them at bay with fire while I tried to make it to a nearby bonfire was very tense and set the tone for what I hope the game was going to be like. Sadly, as I mentioned, difficulty goes down fast and I found myself sending my beast away to increase the challenge.\n\nIn short, Primal is a nice game but fluffed with uninteresting content and it doesn't takes the setting as seriously as you are lead to believe.","March 9","false","31.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

I say that primarily because that is what most people who play sandbox games are though some of us like to shoot our guns/bows or swing our swords/clubs more than others. Ubisoft Montreal has crafted a beautiful land for you to explore and conquer. It's filled with danger at every turn, until with a little time and a few prehistoric beasts; you can stride the land like a confident apex predator. The abilities of all the critters vary and give you ways to spice up what has become a standard in the Far Cry series; taking outposts. There are dozens of ways to occupy your time in Oros apart from that standard, and a large variety of mission types can be played or not just like FC 2, 3, and 4. Ubisoft continues to polish this series and find ways to add to the variety of options in which you can conquer your stone age world.\nI have read a number of reviews that bemoan the lack of multiplayer and a cohesive compelling storyline. I have told a friend, that for myself I would have loved there to have been a coop campaign like FC4, but alas instead we get a highly polished singleplayer game instead. I prefer that dedication to honing the SP experience over trying to mash in a multiplayer mode and both SP and MP suffering for it, I wish more companies would take note of what Ubisoft has been doing with the Far Cry series.\nAs to the story. A stone age era is exactly that. Stone age. Languages are not overly expressive, there is no wealth of history for characters to rely on, only oral histories. Human interaction at that level of development would be just as infantile and primordial as the technology said cavemen are using. I mean the wheel hasn't even been invented yet and cannibalism is rampant, so what makes people think there would be some super complex emotional rollercoaster of a narrative?\nI've played all the Far Cry games, and the stories have never been "OMG make a movie out of that!", but they have been entertaining, and so is the simplistic tale of a tribe's struggle for survival and the need to evolve that was presented in this game. For me this title fires on all cylinders and delivers exactly what one would expect. A great romp through the year 10,000 BC with a plethora of weapons, tools, and tactics at your disposal to make any style of playthrough possible.\n8/10 for me, with the minus two points for no multiplayer or announced plans for it.\nA word to the wise Ubisoft, take what you have done and make a DLC that adds something of merit for once. A multiplayer campaign expansion that is unlocked after you beat the game in singleplayer that features a whole new tribe invading the land of Oros.","March 2","true","44.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

I only get 20fps max, and I freaking love it! I've seen reviews saying things like: "All you do is gather materials and complete missions and stuff." Uhhh... Yeah... Duh! It's a game, so missions and quests are a given - this is nothing new guys... And gathering materials is kinda the point of a survival game... And no, you can't carry 500 logs at one time. You couldn't carry 10, so don't complain that your character can carry 50 of each type!! :P\nThere are a lot of "random" events that happen in the wilderness (almost too many, considering it's supposed to be 10,000 BC), and there are plenty of things to do at all times!\n\nMy only complaint so far is that the beast master system is fairly simple and not very thourough. Don't get me wrong, without it, I wouldn't be able to make it past hour 3 or 4. 1 man vs. a saber tooth tiger... The man isn't supposed to win. Each animal has special traits or characteristics (wolves = better detection, jaguar = stealth, etc...), but that's as deep as it goes. I really wish the devs could expand upon this in upcoming updates or DLC.\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nIt's a blast\n\n\nAlso, the game hasn't crashed once...

You only have two "primary" attacks, your bow or melee; "secondary" attacks use up resources so you will likely avoid using these if you are low on resources. Some of these secondary attacks and special weapons are fun to use, but don't really add much to combat as you will be more than fine with your basic bow or club, even on the highest difficulty, specially if you have gathered the resources to level them up.\n\n\nWhich brings me to the most boring part of the game: Gathering resources. You have to gather resources to build up your base, to build up your tools, to upgrade your weapons. Yes, this element has been around since Far Cry 3 but Primal requires you to do this for the better part of the game, and unlike the other entries in the series, you won't be done with it until halfway through the game because most melee weapons can be used as throwing weapons, which means you will use them up, which means you will have to build more. It doesn't take long to get tedious and on the way of fun. Later on you won't have to gather as much or any at all, your village provides sufficient resources, and due to certain skills you will need less and less resources to construct weapons, but by then you have sank hours gathering and it will probably have left a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nThe game is also very easy, I had to switch to Expert difficulty for any kind of challenge and once you get your first  beast the difficulty goes down. Fast. The beasts are fun to use, but in reality you will be sticking to just a of them. The map is pretty big but uninteresting, your wanderlust is sated pretty quickly and after more of the same you will leave exploration aside and rush the game.\n\nThat said, not all is bad. The first few nights were terrifying and exiting. The first time a pack of wolves moved in my general direction I did not know if I should move and risk being spotted or stay an risk being smelled. keeping them at bay with fire while I tried to make it to a nearby bonfire was very tense and set the tone for what I hope the game was going to be like. Sadly, as I mentioned, difficulty goes down fast and I found myself sending my beast away to increase the challenge.\n\nIn short, Primal is a nice game but fluffed with uninteresting content and it doesn't takes the setting as seriously as you are lead to believe.","March 9","false","31.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

It's a refreshing game in the sense that it isn't the norm. Without the sniper rifles, grenades, explosions, etc, it changes the way you play. I hardly ever play stealthy, yet in this one there is something extremely satisfying with sneaking around and doing a Takedown on enemies.\n\nI haven't had any game crashes like others have, and I play it on max settings. I usually get between 50-60 fps. I do however, use EVGA Precision X in the background, and lower my clocks by 50mhz. This has solved many a game crashing for me. Previously unplayable games due to crashes are fixed by using Precision X. So for those having trouble with the crashes, try Precision X. Make sure to open it, set the profile, then close it and reopen it (the profile will automatically be there). If you don't do that then some keys might not work (Like Ctrl+Right arrow, and in some shooters Ctrl is crouch).\n\nThis game is their best one yet in regards to gameplay and style. I love being in the stone age and not having an arsenal of guns and rocket launchers. The wildlife of the world constantly attack you (unless you use a pet to ward them off) and there are many random encounters with the enemies, just like previous Far Cry games. Gathering is a bit easier than previous games, in my opinion.\n\nThe story is a little short and lacking compared to Far Cry 4, for example. That doesn't take away from the game though, at least not for me. For those on the fence, get the game if you like Far Cry games. People complaining are either stuck up gaming snobs, or are quick to hate a game. As far as this being a copy+paste of other Far Cry games, it isn't. It does take a lot of aspects in terms of abilities from Far Cry 4, then expands upon them. This is always done with games that release newer ones (Far Cry 2 > Far Cry 3 > Far Cry4).\n\nThere are some bugs, which I hate. I would rather a game gets delayed and has less bugs. The two that mainly ♥♥♥♥ me off is sometimes when my pet needs healing, it won't register me next to it and I can't heal. Another is the Climb option. Sometimes you will be right there and unless the Climb appears on the screen, he won't grab on.\n\nThe game gets a solid 8.5 for me. Worth it in my opinion.\n\n**Also if you think the bows are too weak, then get a headshot.

IS..MASSIVE. took me a good while to even traverse a quarter of the terrain just to get to a mission so thats a bonus and paired with the true fog of war you really dont know what to expect.\n\nnow to combat, the combat in this game is more of an aquired taste because nearly every projectile the enemy can launch at you can be dodged with ease by using some pretty simple sidestepping and even with melee combat unless your playing on a harder difficulty is just to easy. the real danger are the animals, mostly they are fighting between each other but if they arent then it can become a problem. if you see 2 bears and get to close they will chase for the kill and they are fast and if you accidentily run into an eagle in the process of running away then your pretty f****d lol.\n\nso my verdict is 7/10 great game and visually pleasing but could use some improvements to the combat and taming.","March 1","true","54.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

To this date my only other 'Masterpiece' is Red Dead Redemption. This game is exactly everything you could ever want from a game about the struggles of primitive man. The prevelent themes of which I mean the importance of the alliance between Man and animals (primarily man and wolf but thats less important given story elements), the presence of Neanderthals in the evolution of man (their defeat/ultimate integration) and the importance of religion in the development of mankind. I'll admit I have a level of bias given my personal preferance to the major themes and their design choice of trying to adhere to history (or prehistory as it might be) as much as possible for example referring to linguistics professionals for the language and likewise for how weapons and clothings and such resembled what they had back then. So as to be expected the plot is simple though it is more than enough fleshed out by the backstory of the cultures involved and as such I found it very fulfilling (despite and including the nuances) in the plot department.\n\nThat being said (spoiler warning kinda) there are only three catagories of weapons the Club, the Bow and the Spear though all three of which are versatile and varied enough to be satisfing in their own way. Clubbing someone and wantching them ragdoll away is just as satisfying as watching someone cop an arrow to the face and collapse to the ground. And that all separate from watching the tamed animal takedowns or the owl kill people.\n\nIf your looking for Far Cry 4 then perhaps look elsewhere as more than a few people have mentioned the lack of weapons and vehicles make them unhappy, though riding animals was more than an adequate replacement and the weapon variations was more than enough to keep my attention and interest. If you want as accurate an experience as you'll ever get to an engaging experience of what it was like to be primitive man then this is exactly what you should buy. Personally, the weapons, gameplay, mission and animals were all very exciting and fulfilling including the very tongue in cheek character Urki. That all being said its very much a Far Cry game, if you like pulling your thumb back in place then with a satisfying snap and pop or a varied cast of weird and interesting characters and their subsequent development then you'll be more than pleased.\n\nI could not speak enough about how much I enjoyed this game and I have waited since it was announced as DLC for Far Cry 3. I'm not even a Far Cry fanboy, I have yet to even buy number 4 and this game blew me away. Please buy this game!!!!!!\n\nIn regards to other reviews about the game, my firewall and computer never had a single iota of issue with the game. My comp is an average gaming rig from 2008 and it runs it almost perfectly on High (aside from a second or two of lag as I spawn in) and it looks superb!

But the feeling will come back to you, when you try take down your first so called "tigri", or when you get hunted through the regions by wooly rhinos and aggressive mammoths.\n\nThe story itself is pretty basic, but when you're put into the situation that the protagonist Takkar is put in, it makes the story so much better. Both the ongoing fight with Ull, leader of the cannibalistic Udam, and the one with Batari, queen of the sun people.\n\nAll in all, i think that ubisoft did a surprsingly good job at taking Far Cry back in time, and gives the game a solid 8,8/10","March 5","true","24.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

So much to do. Bit repetitive; however, you can then decide to change it up or go do some other quest or hunt.\n5) Perhaps a bit expensive now.

My main rig, AMD FX-8350, 16Gb RAM, SSD, GTX 980, running the game on ultra settings, 1440p; my media PC, AMD FX-6300, 8Gb RAM, HDD, GTX 770, high settings, 1080p; and my laptop, i7-4710HQ, 16Gb RAM, HDD, GTX 860M, medium-high settings, 1080p.\n\nI didn't get any error messages nor crashes on any of my systems. Performance is overall playable: got 50-60 FPS on my main and media PCs, and 40-50 on my laptop. The framerate does drop to 30 sometimes for no apparent reason, but it's occasional and thankfully doesn't last more than 3-4 seconds.\n\nIs the game well-optimized? Nope. Far Cry 4 runs at a better framerate, has better-looking graphics and doesn't hiccup as much as this one. But Primal's performance, while not great, is not horrible. All things considered, it's very playable.\n\nSo, should you buy this game? Well,  I only gave a positive recommendation because it worked for me and I personally don't mind the performance issues all that much.  It's a bit of a roll of the dice when it comes to getting the errors, but either I got very lucky (game worked on 3 very different systems) or chances are most people won't get them. Now, if you're not in a hurry you can always wait a month or two until everything is smoothed out (I'd wait until the Summer Sale in that case). But if you REALLY want to play it now, give it a try, my guess is you probably won't struggle a lot with it. And if you do, thankfully you can always ask for a refund.","March 4","true","8.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I was pretty excited to see a new kind of historic game and looking to see how it turned out, but unfortunately for me I did not go to as planned. Many drops in FPS and graphics weren't near as good as I hoped. And the biggest issue I have which probably only occurs to me is my screen displays these weird etched lines that only happen when I play this game I've messed around with the settings and things only get worse. Anyways the story is quite dull unfortunately and not as good as I thought it would be. This game is fun and entertaining if that's what your looking for but in the longevity and actual gameplay I think you will have interest elsewhere. Check out my steam profile activity to view the screen problem, thank you.","March 1","false","7.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Got 16.5 hours under my belt now. It gets better. Storyline is all kinds of generic and the characters are unrelatable but I never imagined a caveman game other than Joe & Mac being so good. The gotta catch em all pokemon crap they threw in is actually pretty awesome and time consuming.\n\nAlso to clarify I do recommend the game but honestly I'd wait for it to drop in price. If you absolutely have no other games to play and you're craving some game time then this game will probably satisfy that itch. If you're a completionist it will probably last you 20 to 30 hours from the rate I've been progressing.\n\n[ORIGINAL FIRST IMPRESSION]\nBeen playing for almost 3 hours now. Game is okay I guess although taking guns and vehicles out of Far Cry might not have been the best idea on Ubisoft's part. The graphics are not nearly as impressive as I thought they'd be for a next gen game. I don't know if they downgraded the graphics to hit 60 FPS on consoles but my Titan X is chewing through this game maxed out at 1440p despite the benchmark showing drops to 50 FPS. So far the gameplay has consisted of gathering supplies, killing animals, upgrading stuff, killing people, doing mission, repeat. I'll add more later when I've played a bit further into the story but as of right now I'd suggest people wait for a price drop before taking this trip back to 10,000 BCE. In my honest opinion Far Cry has been going downhill since 3. Ubisoft really needs to stop milking these titles for all their worth and come up with some new IPs with some fresh gameplay.","March 1","true","22.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","53"

Without a rideable animal, it kinda gets boring just running around - heck even with riding one and going to your destination gets boring in a while, although its also just part of the game.\n\nthe storyline just follows through from one quest to another. It took me 35 hours just to conquer oros since i kept getting sidetracked with collectibles, sidequests, and gathering materials. ok, this happened a few times: i accept a tribal clash/help wenja quest and when i check the map, theres no destination marked as well as, obviously, getting the reward, which is what im after - skill points.\n\nthe crafting and skills part of the game really helps you finish quests with ease. thats why i always get those sidequests with skill point as a reward. i think you could finish the game a lot quicker than me if you just go through the main quests. thats just me though - going the long way.\n\nThe animals or also known as beasts are awesome. was stoked when i found out that you can ride one, boy was i glad too since it wont take me so long to get into my next destination. btw, not all animals are tameable - which sucks big time. the tameable ones are still awesome and be sure to check out their descriptions - some have interesting skills.\n\nthe characters.... hmmm, id say theyre all crazy. well, what else would you expect as the result of getting their home destroyed. since i cant understand a single thing their saying unless i read the subtitles, i just listen to my music instead.\n\nmy take is... if you like a little pokemon kind of adventure, id say go for it and spend a bit more!!! if not, the price is just too high for this kind of game","March 4","true","37.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is amazing at first sight. Beautiful scenarios in a prehistoric environment without limits. If you liked the Far Cry series or free roaming games, this game is probably for you. What I liked the most are: the taming beast skill, the weapons (different compared to games of nowadays). Bought the game on day one, didn't have any errors or fps lag. Worth the price.","March 4","true","22.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Cannot put it down. The graphics aren't anything ultra beatiful, but my 4K monitor died and playing it on my 720p TV, but even with its slightly pixely worlded it is a pleasure to play. The crafting is back in full and has even more depth with its focus on hunting and gathering, to be honest I enjoy that more than its side missions. The characters while nothing new, have that same depth (crazyness) that I like to see.\n\nCons: 12 hours into the game, I cannot really find a story to it other than increasing the villages population. Having seen both the Udam's and the blue people's leaders, they don't have that same vibe as the 3 and 4 main villians. The mammoth missions suck in every possible definition. I dislike the owl and its controls. The only technically innovating thing is the ability to tame the animals, and I dislike it. Having played ARK Survival Evolved, I can honestly tell you, it never gives the same satisfactory, so I just play without using the wolves and the big cats. I do wish the weapons were a little stronger especially the long bow, as I tend to love playing the sniper class and think in such a way. It does crash ALOT and it does so in such a weird way that makes my TV not register the computer sending a signal to it.\n\nIn conclusion, I do recommend this game because for all its bad, I still cannot put it down...however you might  just wait a while until it goes on sale or another patch or two.","March 4","true","26.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Many might not understand that, but for me that's a big deal. It's now day 2 after purchase and I've been thinking about the game all night and even feel like missing work to play it (sadly I can't though).\n\nThe game itself is increadible atmospheric and I feel almost like being in the game for real. Of course some HUD features 'off' like mini map, object highlights/shimmering, objective on SMART, etc. to name but a few as well as hand holding weapon & melee assist (off!) then the game comes even more alive; just don't forget to turn the lights down as well. The feeling of being back at such a period in time is further accentuated with a slight heart pounding fear and tension I've not experienced for a while in a game - I actually felt like I was scared when hearing a bear growling nearby having seen how fast and powerful they are.\n\nThe scenery is super lush and completely believable. The physics, the control and feedback is exceptionally rewarding as well as the observable movements of all other life forms in the Primal kingdom as they stroll or scurry around. Initially one is drawn in so much that in the back of your mind as you get carried away, you kinda wish they thrown in a few Dinosaurs but at the same time realize that would be a mistake for the time period the games based in and is probably better for it's attempted historical accuracy.\n\nThis game is more of an experience than simply an observation and attempted interaction. Admittedly my setup helps me to enjoy that more sitting one meter away from a 42" 1080p monitor with dual GTX970M SLI's running the game 60fps at High setting, using Xbox One Elite controller and last but not least and probably one of the most contributing factors a Sony Pulse headset for that added reverberation rumble type sub low end bass - i.e. in BF3 I use to just hear the tanks fire and Heli blades chop the air, but with the Sony Pulse headphones, I 'feel' the Heli blades chop the air and Tank shells letting rip as the sounds from the Sony Pulse's reverberate your skull; because a game is both a visual and sound experience I can honestly say that the these headphones are one off, if not the most prized accessories in a gaming setup as they make games become more alive (gave up HD25's for these).","March 7","true","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
