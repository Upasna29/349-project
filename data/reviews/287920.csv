Its steep learning curve. unforgiving pvp, Those nerves that tingle when your most precious items and your guilds assets are on the line.\n\nIt has an amazing crafting system that I have yet to see in any other MMO.  The combat system takes some time to get used to it but feels rather clunky at first. Mounted combat was really fun to me.\n\nThe taming and breeding systems are pretty decent.\n\nThe Negatives:\n\nSome of the systems in the game are broken and incomplete for a title that has been out for 5 years. For example spear stance, the backstab mechanic, the akward hitboxes for certain melee weapons, the ranged combat with bows is very erratic. There are virtually no combat encounters that do not involve hit and run. Unless you include Seige mechanics, that involves players destroying your assets when your peak players are offline. No different then Ark Survival.\n\nThe UI is very simplistic for a game that has been out for so long. So many Inventory bugs happen daily that  doing /droploot to check your gear for invisible items is a thing. Many lores for creatures that are not even in the game are still cluttered in the players skill list, making it even more diffcult for players who already have a hard time learning the game.\n\nThe community is so secretive about everything that its hard for new players to even thrive. You can barely even get someone in your guild to tell you the correct recipe for weapons and armor to make them worthwhile. Sadly it is because most of the players in the community are on a huge powertrip. They are afraid to be on an equal level of playing as newcomers. It is also why you find very few guides about the game. The official reddit for MO has less then one thousand registered people. I am sure this pushes players away from the game.\n\nif you ever really want to know how full of themselves these kids are just take a walk over to the offical mortal online forums in the media section and watch the videos and the trash talking that these guys do on a daily basis. Soon after check the guild politics section and just read the constant pe nis wagging that happens.\n\nThe last thing I am going to say about this game is the community is downright TOXIC, There are a few players that exist to try and make the game a better place. But overall the game is filled with either present or past hacks / hackers. Undercover gold and asset selling for real cash money.  GM's that abuse power by not hearing out two sides to story or warning you about things before punishing you. Veterans who think that you have to respect them because they have mastered the combat system and therefore will even grief thier own guildmates. (Msg me if you want twitch recordings) and the WORST OF ALL.\n\nA community of players that will use DDOS programs constantly on each others Communications during times of war. Or just for any kind of revenge they deem necessary. Abuse of TS adresses. IP adresses, to anyone in thier own guilds and to other guilds.\n\nAlot of the functions of the game are client side and can be exploited very easily. Its why duping of items has and more then likely is still is a problem that is reoccuring and hard to track and ban people for.\n\nI think thats about enough. I just unsubscribed and will take another year long break from the game and check once again if they have fixed any of these issues or the community has changed.\n\nSad thing is I dont really hold up my hopes. =(\n\nAs a side note, the pet pathing is the absolute worst I have ever seen. Three to four tickets to a GM a day just to have them returned to you after they dissapear through the world.\n\nEdited for grammar, because I am a scrub.","October 11, 2015","false","941.5"," 458 of 508 people (90%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","90","458","508","28","16"

Ok, no problem, it is a hardcore MMO after all. Kept playing game and got "blue blocked" (that is when a normal not criminal player intentionally puts himself in front of your attacks so you hit him and you turn criminal and everyone can kill you now) and ganked by 8 people to my death. Lost countless hours... Again... got BBd and killed again... Paying OP player killed me just for the lolz in a starter area where I was farming calmly. Lost couple hours... Again...\n\nI get this game, I really do, and I love its concept so much. But the community is SUPER TOXIC.

I mean LITERALLY, you can just do nothing and wait for people to do the hard work and kill the mobs and then quickly take the fallen loot, just like that, and if they hit you for taking their loot then THEY become criminals. Such logic.\n\nThere are a LOT of active GMs and saw a dev once and they answer most questions, but when I and countless others asked "why don't you fix Blue Blocking and accidental hits? With like making it 2 hits at someone to then become a crim", they just responded: "that's just how the game is, adapt". Wow, that 100% confirmed me that the aforementioned problems will NEVER be fixed.\n\nIt's a shame really. For some reason people choose to show their absolute worst in this game.\n\nI don't recommend this game UNLESS, you have: unlimited time to waste, unlimited patience, and don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about other players\n\n5/10 - Great concept, cancerous community.","September 6, 2015","false","33.0"," 1,029 of 1,192 people (86%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","86","029","1","82","128"

I needed to get to a vendor, who's entrance was over a hill, far along the wall to the city I had to circumvent. I was going to be rich.\n\nYet at the same time, I knew it would look suspicious to be seen moving at such a slow speed while running. Enter my adorable deer like pet I called NotaBear who I would stop and turn to whenever another person was in sight.\n\nAs I neared the arena I had to pass before closing in on the city gates, I knew encounters would become more frequent. By this time my daughter was cheering me on!\n\nI made it past the arena, only stopping to socialize with NotaBear 3 times, the end was in sight! And then it happened.\n\nEnter a man in silver robes covering his body. Blinding me and filling me with fear, he asked what I was doing. How much gold I had. What I was carrying. He told me the command to type that would drop all the loot in my bags, and he would let me live if I dumped my gear.\n\nI told him I only had meat. He told me to dump my gear. My daughter told me to dump my gear. I continue to back up with my shield out, hoping to stall for 20 minutes as I walk backwards to the city. You have no idea how slow going this is...\n\nI am losing all hope. He is telling me he going to kill me. The end is near.\n\nBehind him I see a man on a horse with the largest bow I have seen in the game. I yell out that I am being robbed. He stops. My robber turns and greets the man by name with humility and fear!!\n\nMy Savior asks what is transpiring, and I repeat that he is trying to steal all my meat. My Savior retorts with a funny meat joke and we all laugh.\n\nHowever my robber still attempts to get me to drop my gear. My crawling backpeddle to the gates looks more hopeful, as my Savior tells me to continue into the city and that this man will leave me alone. I offer my thanks.\n\nAnd then the robbers horse attacks me! Shield up I quickly learn to parry this magnificent creatures attacks. Life is dropping, at 60% life my Savior notices what is happening and runs to the rescue.\n\nThe robber runs. The horse runs. The Savior gives chase.

I had to keep on starting from scratch and back up to where I was just to be killed by a vet on horses who armor are almost indestructible and whose weapons can cut right through your armor and kill you with one blow. Even 2 AI guards has a hard time killing them and the guards are powerful. Thats how strong these players are. They even camp the graveyards in the cities where noobs go to make money.\n\nAlso other players will keep on killing your horse/donkey, the ones you bought with your gold that takes you a couple of days to make, just for the heck of it anywhere even infront of guards just to watch you rant. Most vets in this game are murderers which are worst than criminals. They prey on noobs and gets a kick out of killing them while they're trying to learn the game. They do this because they know they have years and years exp in this game before it came out on steam. You will barely get to explore the world alive because they are also patrolling the lands outside the city to track and kill you. The only way to explore the lands is as a ghost. Be warn, when you revive at a priest, there will be a vet with their name in bold red letters which signals they are murders and they will kill you. Do not download this game because this game is made to support griefers. Im ending my subscription and hanging this game up. I was so excited to see a game like this but once you exp it, you will be let down. Nothing but bad community and too many criminal RP. Today was my last day. What did it was, I bought a horse which cost 4 gold and 50 silver. Went to go buy equipment for it. Had a large bag equiped on my horse so I can carry items to trade. Bought a 1000 food for the horse which cost 1 gold for the journey. I put on my armor and equiped myself with my shield and weapon. got on the horse and was ready to explore. Soon as I stepped out the city gates i made it 100 yards away from the gate. All the sudden POW get hit by a powerful mace and my guy feel off the horse and died. Then I watched my horse fall from one blow.\n\nA screen popped up with the murderer name saying report murderer. For what? He is already red and enjoys killing! So far I died more than 30 times in within 16.6 hrs from blue blockers, murderers, and criminals. I lost 4 donkeys and 2 horses from criminals. 10 of those deaths was me trying to leave the city and 2 of those 10 deaths was from me reviving at a priest in a town i traveled to as a ghost just to die from a murderer patrolling the town buildings. For those that dont know what blueblockers are, they are players jumping infront of you while you are swinging your weapon to kill a animal or the dead just for you to accidentally hit them so you can turn grey which grants everybody to kill you and take all your stuff because your now a criminal. Until this game is fixed and im done. Good luck to anybody who decides to download this game.","September 17, 2015","false","16.6"," 690 of 838 people (82%) found this review helpful 117 people found this review funny","82","690","838","117","48"

Alas, there are far too many problems with the game, the hardware backing the game, the devs, and the community for any of those good ideas to shine through.\n\nHere are a few of those good ideas and why they don't work.\n\n+Mortal is now on Steam  with all the benefits that come with it. For the game and the playerbase, I think this is sorely needed, but I'll get back to that.\n\n-Unfortunately, the servers simply cannot handle the influx of new players. Multiple tries are required to log in and gameplay in general is laggy and unresponsive compared to how the game used to run. Especially with Mortal's dynamic combat system, this can make the game almost unplayable.\n\n+The character customization is very unique. Your character is generated by choosing your heritage. The not often seen feature of having your age and height affect your stats is an interesting addition as well.\n\n-However, the distribution of stats can be rather confusing, as there are no tooltips that tell you exactly how each stat point affects your character, forcing you to just guess which stats will match your playstyle.\n\n+The game has open survival-esque PvP in all areas, only limited to how long you think you can last without getting killed yourself.\n\n-This is poorly implemented, however. You will find yourself accidentally taking swings at players, especially in the densely populated starting zones, labeling you a criminal and being killed shortly after. The combat itself is very clunky and slow compared to the speed people can move. Most PvP battles consist of bouncing at your opponent, hoping your attack will connect first or being assaulted from behind while your attacker flees.\n\n+The game has a rewarding loot and crafting system  and you can even loot the items of dead players.\n\n-The latter being inappropriate for this type of game. Mortal is supposed to play like an RPG, not a survival game. You can spend hours amassing materials and crafting items as a simple craftsman with no intent of combat, only to be slain and lose all of your items rather unceremoniously.\n\n+The economy is entirely player run. Most items are made for players, by players. This game may be the only MMORPG I've seen that actually has honest to goodness crafting guilds that function like a real business.\n\n-The economy is broken as hell. Unlike games that have a player run economy that is gently shifted by the judgment of the developers for maximum fun, this one was just left to its own devices. Low level gear is oversaturated and difficult to sell, making the early game merchant completely implausible without first having a high level beefstick to harvest better materials.\nJust as well, high level market is cornered to the point of it being cheaper simply to spend the time and effort to make it yourself. Since there is such a high risk of losing all of your items upon death, it makes you question why you'd want to put in the effort at all.\n\nNow that I've covered most of the 'good' aspects of the game, here are some of the purely negative ones.\n\n-The playerbase is horrible. As I hinted at before, I'm hoping Steam will make this game's community a bit more bearable. Almost all high level characters will kill lower levels to grief them. Most are unhelpful and others are downright caustic. Of course that doesn't go for every player, but the sheer number of simply mean spirited people are scarily high.\n\n-The developers don't care about the game at all. I must admit that it has improved a small amount since the last time I played. Unfortunately the game still seems to be in a constant state of neglect. Bugs and issues are everywhere and some are still present since I last played in 2011.\n\n-Most of the GMs are unhelpful. Again, this doesn't go for every mod, but there have been recorded cases of GMs repeatedly scamming players for real world money. On a smaller scale, GMs will constantly 'play' with their privileges in ways that actively disrupt the game, such as spawning bosses in low level areas or even verbally attacking specific players in global chats.\n\n-The game has some very seedy business practices. Not limited to: Capping player skills at a ridiculously low value unless they have a subscription, asking for weirdly personal information such as your address and full name unless you are a subscriber, and lifting any ban if you donate.\n\n-If you are a subscriber, you are allowed to take items from other player's inventories. Plain and simple. You just... take stuff. Like... What the hell, right?\n\nThat about wraps up what's wrong with this game. In this state, I absolutely cannot recommend it. The game has some great potential and fun gameplay, but a hardcore reorganization is in order before this game becomes anything that's worth your time.\n\n+++You can also see some top notch elf ♥♥♥♥.","September 2, 2015","false","3.6"," 267 of 368 people (73%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","73","267","368","13","8"

I still don't know half the crap that you can do..... (Remember, game was released June 2010, this is just it's release via the Steam Platform).\nThis game truly defines an open world, free aspect. You can do just about anything you want, even with a "free-to-play (Better called Unlimited Trial) account, excluding a few items and skills that REQUIRE a Subscription (Thievery, Building/Owning a House, couple of mob drops that are used to buy skills that f2p's cannot uteilze efficently, but if you want them, you can pay gold instead of collecting the items and searching for the vendor and get them anyways),  - REALIZE THOUGH - You can never truly succeed in most categories as a f2p. It is NOT a free to play game, it is UNLIMITED TRIAL - Steam forces the Devs to claim it as f2p. (Updated to help with many people's confusion over f2p tag - April 12, 2016)\n\nIn this vast game, you can do everything from spend your days fishing off the docks of a coastal mediterranean city, to fighting other players in the pitch black Minotaur Dungeon, where a lack of light can mean disaster for everyone involved. Any player can find something to do in this game, as long as you open up your mind, and have the dedication it takes to get your feet in the ground.\n\nNow, lets get more practical with some pros and cons.\nPros-\n*Unique PvP System, extremely skill based and rewarding, featuring Full Loot Game Mechanics (Almost every item you have is dropped and open to being taken on death), plus indepth PvE that can be devestatingly powerful and require Siege  Equipement just to defeat. Cons to this system as well, check below for better details it's the first in the Cons list)\n*Guild Warfare to the MAXIMUM - Players can join guilds, build their own keeps (Or Houses, Towers, Sheds), and create amazing towns from scratch.... Or they can dedicate themselves to the destruction of everyone and everything around them. Most NPC towns can even be taken control of by Player Guilds.\n*Amazingly vast areas to explore. Everything from ancient ruins of lost civilizations, to the darkest pits, filled with beasts of untold power can be found in this game. All this, along with an AMAZING sound design, from the ambient sounds of the Sewers to the epic Soundtrack of Sarducca.\n*Extremely complex and in-depth crafting system where players must start by retrieving the materials via Extraction, Refining, Butchery, or picking them up off the in-game map before you can even really BEGIN to make the items you need to level lores to craft efficiently. The possible combinations are nearly limitless once you start digging in, and there are plenty of unexplored areas (Like Alchemy).\n*Consistent changes are being added, like ingame voice. It's really buggy, but they're working through the kinks to see if they can make it work efficiently. As of right now, it's a buggy mess. (Added this bit April 12,2016)\n\nCons-\n(Removed the Toxic Community Part - It's not that bad anymore, just get some thick skin and it's no worse than many others. Improvements have happened! April 12th, 2016)\n*Combat is extremely difficult, and relies quite heavily on your CPU's Ability to perform. If you've got an old PC/Potato, you're going to fail at PvP, struggle in PvE in this game. A fact of life.\n*If you live far from the server, stationed in Northern France, or have generally terrible internet, you will have INCREDIBLY high ping. It WILL pose a problem, but many players have managed to get around it. A fair warning, players have been banned before for having TOO high of a ping. A downfall of the client side choice, cannot be helped. On the same note, if you get better internet and prove it to the GM's, they will undo said ban, as it's only fair since you fixed the issue. There's a decent population of Aussie players in the game, some have had this situation occur. You want lowest possible ping (Added to help understand that internet connection is important in this game. April 12, 2016)\n*Filled with bugs, that are always coming and going as they please. You can never tell when something that currently works might break, or another bug will show up again. (I expanded upon this, adding a Pro in, it refers to a great idea that is currently craptastic and bug riddled. Small teams work slow - April 12th, 2016)\n*Game takes a lot of time to max skills, create gear, and even travelling can be a challenge. A subscription is a MUST if you wish to ever make decent gear in the game, sorry.\n*AI can be a bit wonky at times, and the tutorials can leave a newer player confused. You must learn to rely on in-game player assitance, and even the forums on the website to learn as much as possible, as help-chat is time-limited (Time limit was extended greatly recently for Help Chat. You can still be kicked out for being a nusience after warnings - April 12th, 2016)\n*Occasional game-breaking balance changes (Usually fixed in 2 days or less) occur. I name this because it's a pet-peve, but do not take your anger out on this small team of Devs, as they're just trying to improve the game and keep it fresh.\n*Literally the steepest learning curve in any game I've ever played. It's crazy hard.\n*Subscription is truly a MUST for any player wishing to truly succeed in this game. I know, I know, it says F2P, but it's not. Sorry, it's just a part of life in joining the Steam Community that it went that way. It's BS.\n*If you tick off a GM, expect to get treated like crap. There aren't many, and they don't forget names. You will be put on a crap list, and don't expect them to do anything. Ask, and you shall recieve. Demand, and you shall get ignored. It's BS, but they have dealt with too many guys over MANY years who played the system, along with many truly corrupt GM's in game from the old Player-Councilor System. (Added to warn - BE NICE TO GM's OR IT SUCKS. They're jackholes at times, but that's almost always because you did something to tick them off. Please and Thank You, along with sincere questions are the best way to get some real support. April 12th, 2016). *Game takes up a huge amount of space, and is BEYOND poorly optimized. It'll run just fine on most modern computers, don't start claiming you run Witcher 3 and Fo4 on perfect and crashed and couldn't run MO, we all know you probably are just trying to hide your poor little potato that mortal fried into some nice warm french fries. But that aside, even guys who can run those new, graphically intense games have issues with this game. It is poorly optimized, and will crash randomly, might not want to start, etc. etc. Game is weird, any problems that are consistent should be reported onto the forums (MortalOnline.com/forums) in the bugs section first, then go to the Round Table and ASK for help. Don't be whiney/demanding or you're going to get some real h8 from the community, including me probs. (Added April 16th, 2016. It's a fair note).\n*Game is full of griefers and trolls. They feed on mechanics that are imperfect. Accept them, beat them at their game, or even join them, they're here to stay. They recently added in an option that disables your ability to hit players who are blue, so as long as you turn that off, the common complaint of Blue Blocking is a thing of the past. (Added for greater impact on the extent of the subject. It's not as big of a problem as you might think, because if you can't handle these fools, you're not right for this game probably - April 12th, 2016).\n\n\nThis game might very well take your life over....\nDo you think you have what it takes to become a Mortal? Or will you just become another casualty, unable to cope with the brutal difficulties of day-to-day life in the world of Nave?\nWhy don't you come find out.\n\nEDITED - April 14th, 2016 for new changes.","August 31, 2015","true","538.6"," 287 of 400 people (72%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","72","287","400","21","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deeplogic/recommended/287920/","deeplogic","deeplogic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deeplogic/","87 products in account","I started downloading this game with visions of a sprawling medieval land, where I was free to forge my own path. As I watched gigabytes tick away, I dreamed of my homestead. I knew it would be hard, but I was ready for the challenge.\n\nBoy, was I disappointed. I started playing the game as a "fledgling." During that time, nobody could attack me and I couldn't attack them. I used the time to gather resources. I found a bank, made some deposits. I was disappointed immediately that the only quests in the game were the tutorials, which were an absolute mess, but I kept going. I bought armor, managed to craft a few things but kept feeling like the work was going to far outweigh the fun had in-game. The graphics were sub-par, the UI was reminiscent of Ultima Online's, terribly outdated, the servers were fairly laggy at times, the controls themselves were less than responsive, the items in-game were somewhat cryptic and disjointed and the help system looked like someone just put some filler text in and moved on.\n\nA messaged popped up, "You are no longer a fledgling!" "Woo-hoo," I thought, "Now it's time to conquer." No such luck. Within a minute of getting my upgraded status, I was murdered. I figured, "Oh, well. It's a survival game. I like those." I shook off the fact that I lost all my inventory and set to respawning. I found the priest, told him to bring my back and was on my way. I grabbed only what I needed this time and decided to flee to a quieter area. Just outside of town, I was murdered again. This happened over and over. I gave up for the day.\n\nI came back to the game the next day and set out, only to accidentally target what was apparently someone's pig. The game punished me and the guard killed me. I set out again. I found a quiet area, it was nice. I was murdered again. I was way out this time, far from a priest. I asked the game to send me to the priest, which takes 60 seconds. I patiently waited, "20 seconds... 10 seconds." To my dismay, the game popped up with its message that I had been transported, but, guess what? I hadn't been. I tried again, "I'm not walking that far." Same thing happened.\n\nI started hoofing it only to come across priest after priest that would only service their guild, with no distinction between the ones I could use and couldn't. This meant walking endlessly, going to priest after priest, just hoping. I thought, "I could make a new character. That would be easier." If it's easier to create a new character in a game, and go through the leveling process again, than to simply respawn, it has problems. That realization brought me full circle and I gladly exited. Of course, it made me wait 10 seconds. I ALT+F4'd just to show them I wasn't going to be their plaything anymore.\n\nThe concept of the game is great, but it is poorly executed, poorly supported and lacks direction. This feels like a college project, not a game meant for production. For anyone wanting to proceed, despite these words of warning, I only say to you, "I bet you're going to be disappointed."\n\nUPDATE - 10/3/2015\n------------------------------\n\nI still wanted to like this game after my review so I popped back in to give it my full effort before I uninstalled it. I was pleased to find that my spawn issue was corrected (probably due to the server reboot occurring when I logged on) and I set off to a new town. I found that town less "murdery" and was able to setup a haul near a banker as to quickly deposit my funds. Although the murders came less frequently, they were still of great impact. Unless you want to run back and forth constantly, you need to amass a decent amount of resources to make the time worth the effort. The murders wipe out tens of minutes of work and are really disheartening.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong; I know it's a survival game, but it shouldn't also be work. A murder shouldn't necessarily come with less impact, but should definitely be less frequent. There needs to be a greater penalty for murders, just as is the case in the real world. They provide guards, but that doesn't introduce any real preventive measure, and players are apparently allowed one murder of an innocent before the murdered player can call guards (I'm not sure of the cooldown). I understand what they're going for, but, unless there is some sort of policing when it comes to other players ruining others' experience with the game, these types of reviews will keep coming.\n\nSo, unfortunately, I still can't recommend the game. What would it take for me to change my mind? Stricter penalties for murdering other players, such as a jail period that equates to actual time lost in-game. I'm sure the problem would decrease drastically. The survival aspect would still be intact, but players would be able to somewhat comfortably navigate the world. If you want to create a pure survival game, then do that, developers, but if you want to create a game players will come back to and can take pride in what they've accomplished, make the question of their survival one that can be answered, not one led by the whims of a murder bound five-year-old with an itchy finger.\n\nDevelopers: Make this Moral Online by doing what any responsible government does: protect its citizens. I won't uninstall the game just yet. I'll ensure I continue to check release notes for these types of changes. If I see a similar dynamic has been introduced, I'll come back and give it another go, consider a subscription and, of course, update my review. The game has potential, and I would love to see it all come together, but I must admit, I won't be holding out hope considering how long the game has been in development. Please, consider the value of a wider player base. Simply satisfying the relatively small group of existing subscribers isn't the best route for funding your development.\n\nUPDATE - 5/5/2016\n------------------------------\n\nI just realized I hadn't provided another update. The game never got better and, after seeing how the developers responded to the community, I just got rid of it. Don't hitch your wagon to this horse. It's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will just call you names.","October 1, 2015","false","32.3"," 117 of 149 people (79%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","79","117","149","12","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RichiRamjag/recommended/287920/","RichiRamjag","RichiRamjag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RichiRamjag/","80 products in account","Mortal online should be called Potential: The Game.  It is a game full of unlimited potential, from its elder scrolls-esque combat system to its open world.  Unfortunately, after years of playing, I found myself constantly waiting for it to meet that potential.  From constant bugs, terrible combat balancing, to staff corruption, it is one thing after another with this train-wreck of a game.\n\nFirst things first, the CEO, Henrik Nystrom has no clue what goes on in his own game.  Having dealt with the guy in regards to the testing of new mechanics and game bugs, he is clueless.  There are mechanics in the game from years ago that do not work and he still has no idea whether or not they do, requiring him to hear such feedback from the playerbase and sometimes getting quite indignant when faced with the problems of his game resorting to calling those who bring them up trolls even if the feedback is provided in a respectful manner.  When assisting on the test team, he would blatantly ignore feedback regarding bugs, pvp mechanics, etc and simply to whatever he liked.  He does give the appearance of interacting with the community, though this isn't hard when they remove any type of criticism from the public view.\n\nHe is also blind to the corruption of the game, allowing players (of low moral character) to perform GM duties for his game.  One of the previous counselors is actually well known for monetarily scamming money from other players multiple times via various schemes.  This player-based GM system ends up being a major issue in a full-loot game where assets and the element of surprise actually matter.  GMs scout locations for other players, spawn demons and other monsters on top of other players in an attempt to soften them up for their personal friends and major game decisions in terms of cheating, hacking, etc are made by players who have and hold obvious bias.  This is greatly apparent after the donation system where some of the largest backers have experienced some of the greatest success by having relics (items that provide guild specific buffs) dropped in their backyard the day after losing them to other guilds.  I've also seen players with high donations who were banned from their forums for breaking the rules immediately unbanned afterward.  It is pretty safe to say this occurs in game as well.\n\nBut that aside, let us get to the game.  The game's graphics look like something from 2010.  Textures are recycled unreal engine 3 type fluff.  It was excusable for a time, but not for a game attempting to make it big on steam.  I'd give them a six out of ten as the game can look beautiful at times, lighting-wise, but any close look is a mess.  It isn't unheard of to get stuck in the mesh as the whole thing is a mess and you can get stuck on something in the middle of a fight and end up losing the equipment you worked hard to get.  Thankfully, they did some work a year or so ago and this improved it in some areas, but made it worst in others.  UI is your typical fare and is reminiscent of an elder scrolls game/clone.\n\nI won't even go into mechanics deeply as it is a very touchy subject.  The game favors large numbers and zergs as they call it.  There was a long period when skill mattered and it was possible to consistently go against the odds, but those days are gone after large donators constantly complained as well as week old players.  If you play now, then combat is simple enough with directional swings and blocks, but you're best finding a guild with a decent amount of players as you'll just end up getting zerged.  If you have grand aspirations as a new group, be prepared to merge or ally into another as that seems to be the norm for newer players.  Once again, this is a full-loot pvp game.\n\nMurder system is iffy.  Five kills and you turn red which means you can't go into a town.  Some feel that is harsh, some feel it isn't harsh enough.  You burn murder counts every 8 hours.  Get under 5 and you're back to blue.  Taken from another review to give you a newer player's idea of the game, "A thief can steal from you and if you attack him he is able to kill you without getting a murder score.  There are some people on this game with over 1000 murders that have been free from murder score and they walk around in the cities all day.  This is hardly justice at all and any new player will see this as a troll game and quit once educated to this process."  Take from that what you will.\n\nThe community...Well this game features one of the most toxic and destructive communities that I've ever seen.  It is very small and includes those who would lie, cheat, and blackmail using out of game information.  Many will grief you, attempt to badtalk or insult you or even accuse you of cheating while having a recorded history of using cheatengine within the game.  Of course these players still play, which brings me to another point; bans.  Bans do not matter in this game, players who have used cheatengine, players who have duped items/gold, and players who lagswitch still play this game.  They may get caught and receive a short ban, but you usually see them again, typically after making hefty donations.  Some just because they have close associations with the higher ups.  Very sad state of affairs.  Most of these guys are so nasty, I'm sure I will be attacked by name in their reviews for posting mine.  This is the worst part of mortal online.  If you're prepared for all of this then enjoy.\n\nThe game is worth a try, but I just can't recommend it.  Even worst, these players, most of who I know, agree that they hate this game, and that if a decent replacement released, they would leave in a minute, but due to some weird stockholm syndrome type deal, they just keep putting up with it.\n\nQuick update for those attacking me in the comments (which I expected).  This game has been out for years (standalone) before being released to steam, this is why my playtime is so low.  I played mortal actively on and off for years constantly telling myself it would get better.","September 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 290 of 411 people (71%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","71","290","411","18","24"

Played for 10 minutes.\n2. Played for maybe a week.\n3. Complain because others are better at the game.\n4. Don't understand all games have bugs (Yes this one has quite a few, however this game is so good it doesn't matter since they are not game breaking, just irritating.)\n5. (Probably the worst... ) Can't handle the player community of this game.. Yes, it's probably the worst community, not going to try and ignore this.  It's a Full loot PVP hardcore sandbox... its going to bring out the worst.\n\nMe, I've played for several years, before mortal came to steam. With steam its getting alot better, and at a much faster rate. But it's brings COD fans, idiots, and immature user's who do not understand, or even like these sort of hardcore games.  I've dealt with countless bugs, the horrific community, and sadly, terrible customer support.\nBut none of this, would ever weigh heavily enough to stop me from playing this game.\n\nI've always wanted a game like this, and this is exactly it. No other game offers what mortal online does.\n\nThe combat:\n\nMelee: You have directional attacks, directional blocking, different damage types (Blunt, peircing, slashing) And armor/resisting the same (Blunt, peircing, slashing). So not only do you have a variety of how you attack, you have a variety of damage types. Once you learn the game enough you can look at another player and seeing their armor type, and materials it's made of, knowing what its weak/strong against. The combat in this game is the MOST fun I've experienced.  And the absolute best part, It's not super gear reliant. Myself and many others have defeated players with higher end gear, while being naked with a started sword known as "worn shortsword". So your not 100% screwed if they out gear you. This combat system is skill and knowledge based, not gear reliance based.\n\nWhat is there to do in mortal? Plenty.\n\nYou can be a crafter, weaponsmith, armorsmith, cook, alchemist, tamer/breeder, miner, woodcutter, extractor, refiner, butcher, bowcrafter, engineer, and more.\n\nYou can be a Footfighter with swords, axes, daggers, clubs, poleswords, fistfighter, mounted combat, mounted archery, a mage, a dominator who utilizes pets to fight with/for them.\n\nYou can build your character to be however, and whatever you want. There are no restriction besides the total skillpoint usage.\n\nAs far as the F2P, P2P, P2Win, etc. This game is NOT F2P. It is P2P with an infinite trial. However, you can play this game as F2P.. Just not as efficiently, and with crafting no one would not recommend it since you cannot make very good items without having max skills/lores.  PVE though, you can do everything a P2P player could do, if you have the combat skill,\nTo experience this game the way it is designed, and meant, then purchase a subscription, it is most definitely worth it.\n\nIf you do choose to give this game a try, don't be like the majority of others and just hang out in the starter zone. You will get angry, you will be dissapointed, and you will most likely quit playing the game. I think the starter town and how you start this game should be completely redone and reworked. But in the meantime, if you hang in there, ignore the idiots around you, then you will experience the game as it really is, and when looking at these reviews feel the same way I do which lead me to write my first game review.\n\nNo matter how bad it pisses you off, no matter how angry people make you, you will always come back to mortal online, because its just that damn good.","May 6","true","937.1"," 70 of 82 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","70","82","5","3"

This game is unlike other MMOs in that it DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND AT ALL. You wanna learn how to craft armor and weaponry? Well, go do it then! You don't know how? Well find the trainers! You don't know where the trainers are because the game doesn't have a map? Well look around then!\n\nPeople are getting massively butthurt because the game is not supposed to be easy and simplified for idiots. It's meant as a spiritual successor to Ultima Online, and so far it is in the sandbox elements at least. The game almost entirely lacks quests, too, and that is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people off.\n\nIt's a sandbox MMO. I thought people like sandbox games?

Get out of the starting cities Morin khur and tindrem as fast as possible. This is where you will find the most thieves and the most griefers who come there to take advantage of your inexperience. Avoid toxai as well since there is a well known guild that gets off at killing newbies there.\n\n2. You are going to die and lose stuff at some point. This can be frustrating but it is a pvp full loot game so become smart about banking stuff you dont need to carry around.\n\n3. This game is meant to be played with a guild. You will have a really hard time without guidance and help from vets in the guilds. This isnt like any other mmo where you can just look up a guide from newbie to vet and be fine. A good place to look for guilds is the mortal online forums guild recruitment section where guilds  display their playstyle and tell you a little bit about themselves. Join a helpful guild as soon as possible but do your homework on what kind of an outfit you are getting yourselves into.\n\nMost of all have fun with the group you play with. In any game its the quality people that i laugh in teamspeak with that keep me coming back.\nGood luck ingame","September 21, 2015","true","142.6"," 203 of 294 people (69%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","69","203","294","14","0"

It has impoved greatly since the CEO became wealthy enough to support more devs and art designers. But still it lacks bug fixes it requires to be a finished game, whilst more "content" is added over underlining issues being bandage fixed. The mechanics of the game are poorly thought out and if you want to be competitive you will have to understand the "prediction system" in the game a system that compensates for latency between players and the server and abuse of this mechanic makes the top players the "best" ontop of stamina management and positioning in fights. The truth is its a greifer game and steam is bringing alot of sheep in so it has injected more life into the game, because the game is so tedius and unpollished the steam charts have shown a decrease of 1000 active players daily down to 500. Were before steam release it was around 200(That is being generous). Not that this game is hard it has a very low skill ceiling and simple combat mechanics, the crafting system is very indepth and time consuming being the real grind of the game. It takes a few days to skill a new character and the meta is constantly shifting due to the devs incompetance to properly decide on the direction they want to take. Along side the player gms who still exist under a veil of lies stating there is no gms/hcs that are allowed to play. It is all deception in order to create the illusion there is no bias wen it comes to the people who run the game. The game has a long history of abuse by the children given power to answer petitions because Starvault can't fund outsourced or payed Game Masters and Councelors they use their comunity as a source instead. Obviously anyone can understand the issue with that. My point being if you want to get a sandbox game to fulfill your desire to full loot people and risk your own loot at the same time, this game might be for you if you can get past the curruption, hackers, duping, annoying bugs that seem so simple to fix but have been in game for over 5 years, the ♥♥♥♥ comunity filled with people who want to play a greifing game competitively then sure maybe this game is for you. I only log into to pvp its all I can enjoy to do but gl getting the resources to support only doing that. You will have to farm tedius unexciting pve content that is lack luster compared to veterans farming spots and never beable to compete with people who have 5 years of experience ontop of nearly unlimited resources.

This is an 8/10 game. If you liked Ultima Online before trammel, if you like Eve Online,  and if you like and could handle darktide Ac, then you will love this game.\n\nIt is an old school mmo, which I have missed so much. Actions have consequences, death hurts, player politics impacts the world and you! You can be more or less anything you want, BUT you cannot be everything you want. You must choose what paths to follow. You want to be a great swordsmen? You can do that, you want to be a master smith? Sure thing, but you wont be both on the same character.\n\nThe game offers tons of freedom, and with such there will be childish griefers that camp the noob spawns and pick the pockets of the unaware in main cities etc, but the freedom to do so is what makes this great. You can be a total tool, OR you can walk a more noble path and help defend the innocent from the griefers of the land. Join a guild or form one, build a house, or a tower, or a town. Change the face of Nave!... yes you can do this if you work at it.\n\nI have now been playing for several weeks and as a mmo vet of most that have been released, I find this game so refreshing.\n\nWhy then is it not a 10?..... Bugs. The game is still not 100%. There are mesh holes across the map. Getting stuck or losing a pet into such is not uncommon, though the gms are quick and helpful in fixing this. Pathing issuse occur, some of the features are not fully enabled ( like dynamic weather).   There is also a painful lack of knowledge available where I feel it should be readily available. Guild interactions, wars, Housing placement etc are all far more difficult than they should be.\n\nI also think the newb experience is very painful. Enough so that it likely scares off a lot more than it should. Players are given a short grace period of peace, but they often find themselves targets as soon as this runs out. They are given the impression that THIS is the game, and sadly quit before they can get out into the world and realize what a wealth of adventure awaits them.\n\nThese issues aside it is a fantastic game with enormous potential. If you are new, Stick with it!  Start in Tindrem as advised, it is a safer city.. and DO not let the morons that seek to scare you away suceed.\nLearn what you can, bank often, and seek friends. There are many villains out there but there are also tons of very nice and helpful players.\n\nLast thing. I was shocked and pleased to find out that there is a very decent role-play community out there.

I *never* played PVP games because of the fear-mongering of other carebears on various MMO forums and blogs. I didn't want to be 'ganked' or 'camped'  and all my precious loot stolen.\n\nI tried this game and found out that while it is hardcore and you "will" die, it is still fun.  Join a guild, hunt/gather with friends in a group, bank often. Also, if someone is camping you...just respawn somewhere else. There's tons of places to farm.\n\nI said in my last review that the suspense of the game wasn't fun.  Actually, I lied. I was out in the wild scavenging. I completed geared up, plus some, from some dead adventurers. I don't know who killed them or if they were coming back for their gear. I stole their stuff, turned gray and it was odd feeling knowing they or someone else could come back and kill me to take their stuff back.\n\nLater, I had full mount bags and inventory of caresses and other things worth many, many gold (well to me). It was my biggest, most expensive, hunting trip yet and it was a long way back to town.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceburg, but I don't know if my poor carebear heart can handle all this...\n\nCrafting is amazing. I hear that there are several potions and food combos that haven't been discovered my players yet. That was one of the things that drew me to the game.  I've read many, many "Looking For Game" threads on various MMO forums looking for deep crafting systems and this is it.  People want to make a name for themselves for being *the* weaponsmith, chef, etc.  You can do that here. There are players who have found really good recipes and guard them fiercely, since they are making a killing on the market or keeping it for their guild's use only.\n\nI really get a kick out of the fact that you kill people hard enough that their carcasses fly out of their skin. Also, I skinned a player, made a robe out of him. Then, fried his head with some mushrooms and rice. I was disturbed for a moment and subbed shortly after.\n\n8/10.

After this time, you no longer get a free pass on bugs for being indie so quit with the excuses.\n\nI’ve been along the ride from the start till about half a year ago, when I quit even playing casually because of the blatant GM corruption and forum censorship. So let’s get this going. On paper, the concept sounds amazing. Open world, free PvP, full loot, skill based progression. What is there not to like? The implementation of all those grand ideas, apparently. MO puts you into a car with a broken steering wheel, no dashboard, gear in reverse by default and then smirks at you saying "lol what, you can't figure it out?! I'm not holding your hand, how cool is that!".\n\nIt feels like the devs equal "annoying" and "time consuming" to "challenging", something that is seen throughout most of the game's mechanics. In their strive for realism they made the crafting system vast and imho unnecessarily complicated, but ended up with only a few dozen viable recipes out of thousands combinations. This approach of adding unnecessary complexity (or depth, as some may argue) in an attempt to simulate realism goes through the entire game and all its mechanics, making every task more difficult than it really needs to be. Not more challenging, mind you, as many players would argue, but simply more awkward and time consuming. Every UI interaction is awkward. Every other mechanic feels awkward. This is a small company and indie company, but again, after 6 years.. I expected more.\n\nThis quote from another player sums up the problematic dev attitude that doesn't differentiate between challenging and annoying imho: "It's a VERY annoying start, and someone in /h suggested that I just go afk chopping wood to raise my attributes. I did just that and it helped."\n\nThen there are GMs. Being on limited budget, devs recruited some players as volunteers to act as GMs in the game. Some of them were underage and most of them had ties to guilds. That went pretty much as expected – favoritism and corruptions ran rampant and any discussion about GMs’ actions such as choosing to restore a destroyed asset, or spawn assets, were censored from the forums. And that is in a PvP game. Devs showed little interest in addressing the situation, but instead, according to many, had a hand in it. According to some it got a bit better, but it already made many including me quit and I would still hold devs accountable that it even got that bad in the first place.\n\nThat being said, the concept itself is interesting. The open world and almost free building, aim based combat, rather complex skill trees. I really enjoyed the first months in the game until the novelty wore off, and my time with others. The combat is probably the only thing that is as complex as it should be, and is actually skill based (bugs aside). But the rest just feels so.. clumsy and unnecessarily complex, instead of actually challenging your skill as a player. The majority of the challenge in MO comes from how awkward everything is, rather than player skill.\n\nYou will find fans defending the game as being too "hardcore" for critics, but it's not hardcore, it's simply badly designed, unbalanced and buggy. Dark Souls is hardcore. DayZ is hardcore. People love those, but for some reason not MO.\n\nEven after six years, the game is not ready for Steam release.. The launcher options did not apply to my game, I had to rescale from within game settings. I couldn’t even log in, after seeing queue ticking down to 0 it just vanished and I was left staring at the login screen once again. After two days of trying, I finally got in, only to realize the node lag is still an issue, after six years of development, and the server can’t even handle 1k players currently playing (according to steamcharts). It’s ridiculous.\n\nThe concept itself, again, sounds very promising. But its implementation falls short and I honestly can’t recommend it. It’s just awkward and annoying instead of challenging. But if you are desperate for a full loot PvP game and love the challenge of trying to navigate the UI – go ahead and give it a try. It’s free after all, although capped at a skill limit. You’ll make a nice cannon fodder for the players camping newbie areas.","September 4, 2015","false","1.0"," 141 of 210 people (67%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","67","141","210","12","8"

Check.\nDetailed crafting system that can encompass an entire character build? Check.\nSkill based pvp/pve combat with many many varied builds? Check.\nPlayer on Player looting and thieving? I'll kill you if you steal my gold.\nMounts? Pets? Taming giant 2 ton bears? exploding heads with your fists?\n\nThis is not a game for everyone, that's plain and simple. It is very hardcore, you WILL die MANY times to both the environment and other players. This is how you learn, this is how you flourish. Mortal Online is a game that will not hold your hand and coddle you. It is brutal and unforgiving, and this is why I play it, not many other games will give you an actual thrill for adventuring, or pure excitement when you finally battle down that mob the 2 shotted you. No game but Dark Souls (on launch week for the 360 when no one had any clue what was going on) gave me the same feels as this game.\n\nImagine Mount and Blade meets Ultima Online, hardcore sandbox MMo fans you have found your home.\n\nEdit: Just to add, this game IS free to play, but I would say the f2p is more of a trial than anything else. Your skills will cap at 60 (albiet they will continue to level regardless so if you do go p2p you will level to those skills automatically to wherever you capped as f2p). The game is not p2w but there is a sub wall. I urge you to try it, and if it's your style you'll see why the people who play this are subbed. No other game, especially an MMo, gives you the freedom that Mortal Online gives you.","August 31, 2015","true","592.0"," 129 of 198 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","129","198","9","3"

And while that of course opens the door to thieves and spawn killers and other things like that, it also enables you to have a very rewarding experience if you can weather the storm.\nI enjoy the rush of knowing that training a skill outside of town or gathering things or whatever can turn into a fierce battle at any time - the risk is what makes things that happen in this game memorable, death has an impact.\nAlso beheading someone who killed you before and then making soup from their head or feeding it to your dog is incredibly satisfying :P\n\nTLDR; Very rewarding experience if you don't let deaths and loss of items get to you. It is a hostile environment but that just increases the impact random acts of kindness have when a stranger passing by saves your life or hands you a suit of armor because you seem to have lost it all. (Dont beg for things it's unbecoming and everybody hates it ^^)\n\nStrongly recommended but don't say I didn't warn you ;)\n\nCheers Wes","September 12, 2015","true","515.2"," 88 of 134 people (66%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","66","88","134","18","0"

It is unique to me because while I'm an altoholic in most other mmorpg's I'm still currently playing the character I created during initial launch. I made a name for myself as a experienced tamer and mount breeder, selling high quality mounts (mount attributes system) and sticked with it since I enjoyed it so much.\n\nIn this game you will not become just another "hero" wearing the same end-game equipment as the others spamming the same skills. Instead you can become a unique personality known to others whether it's due to your unique fighting skills (think mount & blade style of combat), knowledge (guild politics, secrets and exploration) or professions (creating the highest quality potions or equipment).\n\nPro's:\n- Open sandbox world\n- Skill based combat\n- Full loot (adding risk)\n- Territory control (own keeps, earn taxes)\n- Player housing\n- First person (adds to immersion - personal opinion)\n- Realistic art style\n- Breeding system & Mount attributes\n- Player Economy (all worthwile armor and weapons made by players)\n- In-Depth Crafting systems (Armor/Weapon Crafting, Alchemy, Bowyery, etc.)\n\nCon's:\n- The (current) focus on PvP and Territory Control (which is a pro to others)\n- Slow development (small dev team)\n- Subscription pretty much required if you want to compete with others\n- Lack of meaningful PvE\n- Bugs and glitches (though declining in numbers)\n\nA review from an active player since 2010, which alone is reason enough to give it a positive recommendation.","August 31, 2015","true","176.0"," 112 of 176 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","112","176","5","0"

I built my first town, my banker got lost every 10 minutes couldnt use bank i had to call gm 10 times in a day because they said you built on a node line. Why there is a house spot on a node line? it is not my fault please move bank because we didnt know. They said no you have to deal with that problem we dont give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo i built another town in another continent name sarducca. Again a node line. Can not build any ♥♥♥♥ in our territory because they say they blocked it. wasted like 3000 gold. they say they wont help. So why put house spots just near the node lines?\n\nI dont even talk about rotten community.

Besides crafting(armor/weapon), gathering, hunting, butchering, alchemy, cooking, fishing, mining, woodcutting, extraction, refining.... There are also players that deal in politics, transportation, gambling, or trading guilds and vast empires. You will build up from nothing and possibly be beaten back down to poverty at times. It's a rule of life in Mortal, death can be around every corner and if you die, you will drop everything.\n\nThe most beautiful part is that it's almost entirely player driven.

You swing a sword block an enemys sword or take other actions like in an First Person Shooter game.\n- Sandbox. You build, you craft, you gather and you steal whatever you can. No campaign and no level limits. If your an veteran of the game you can have yourself usable within 2 days.  Because aside from the skills learning which is very annoying sometimes. Everything else depends on you yourself.\n\n\nNow for the Cons.\n\n- The devs are very stubborn. Opinions from players are pretty much never listened to and they are not welcome either. So if your complaining too much you can be banned pretty fast and pretty long without even being told a reason.\n- The game has alot of bugs. Yes really alot of bugs. From floating objects to falling through the ground or getting stuck in walls which will result in your death and loss of everything you carried with no chance to get it back because support does not reinburse losses from bugs or anything else.\n- The game systems are very easy to circumvent which is not against the rules and thus allowing to kill others and plunder them within the city with the guards not taking any action as well as moving your mounts into safe positions where they cannot be attacked but still be loaded with stuff.  The game offers an list where the systems your not allowed to circumvent are listed. Anything not listed there is allowed.\n- The community is very bad. As the game has been around for several years before it was released on steam. And has done a very poor job on bugfixing and improvements. The most people which stayed are the guys who are used to use these bugs and systems to their advantage. This also leads to them not liking the idea of more people joining the game which results in new players being killed everywhere and anywhere alot.\n- Very very veeery slow patching and bugfixing. Importand patches only come around once or twice a year. And even hotifxes dont come faster than one or two months after an problem occured. Alot of bugs still accurate today have been there even in the closed beta.\n- Not playable with older computers or slow internet connections. While you may still login and play. You will notice very fast that you will lag around alot. Monsters attack you despite being miles away from you. And things you want to gather will tell you they dont exist because your position in the world is different from where your client tells you you should be.\nThis can be so bad that your moved back over 1km because you hit an stone or wall somewhere on the server while you client just traveled all the way to another city.\n- Freedom comes at an price. Castles and fortifications are build all around the world. Blocking content of the game or and looking very stupid where they are standing.\n- Advertised as Free to Play title. This game is an free trial. And without Premium you are useless as crafter as well as an fighter or whatever because whatever you do will be worth next to nothing.\n- Macros.... Better have some ready, they are legal in the game and the game design is laid out for their use. So if you do not use them you will be highly disadvantaged. (Pls make sure to check the list for prohibited macros first since some macros like automatic healing bots etc are NOT ALLOWED)\n\nMy advice. Get the Game for free. Take a good look for at least 2 weeks. And only after that decide wether its worth investing money or not. Because the game looks very good at start and in videos. But once you get into the actual game and start understanding whats going on around you. The illusions fades very fast and the game becomes very annoying.","August 31, 2015","false","11.9"," 199 of 335 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","199","335","4","9"

I generally don't write reviews on steam, but this one I just had to take the time to write one out even if no one cares to read my review or doesn't agree, I don't really care.\n\nSomehow I hadn't heard of this game till the steam release came out and was told just a little bit about the game, downloaded and started playing. I must admit I was one of those people at the beginning that was like "Hey, how do you form a party?" "Where's the map?" and then it dawned on me, this is not your typical game that's out now which is all just a carbon copy of itself with slightly differing graphics, plots and systems.\n\nAfter WoW ruined gaming for those of us that were around for the beginning of console gaming, MUDs, etc, I remember for years I searched for a game that let you do what you wanted to, be who you wanted to be... a game that actually deserved the "RPG" behind the "MMO" genre, but I gave up. I long awaited, searched, tried everything that looked promising and then got used to all these games that came out that held your hand through every process of your adventure and forced you take paths you yourself did not want your character to take.\n\nMortal Online does not have quests. There is the beginning tutorial quests if you start off in the city of Tindrem, but that is all. It's a few quests and then you are dropped off into the world and left on your own to figure things out. Some say you need to be in a guild to experience this game or to even like it, but I disagree. Sure, I see the pros and the cons of joining one, but so far I have not joined a guild and I have figured things out myself with a bit of help by asking in help chat when I'm really stuck or lurking the forums a bit, but mostly I ventured out on my own and discovered new areas, mobs, guild keeps, etc. To me that is half the fun. I don't know that I want people that have been playing for years to tell me exactly where to go and give me all the items I could possibly want.  Discovery to me is the most fun part of this game. I end up getting killed more than I probably should because of the play style I choose, but it doesn't upset me as that's what I choose to do right now.\n\nBeauty of this game is that it's not beautiful in any aspect. And though that sounds like an insult, it's not. There are thieves trying to pickpocket you while you're trying to buy new armor after you lost your gear and mounts to murderers coming back from a taming journey. Then you gear up, go back out to go on an adventure, look away for a second and oops you ran into a pack of cougars and they just put you down to 10% life. Now you have to rest for a while to get your HP back and then you hear the clopping of horses nearing you and oh no, murderers again. But you know what? To most of gamers these days, that might sound like a nightmare, but this is what I missed through the years. The danger, the excitement, the unknown.\n\nPeople complain about the graphics, but I don't understand why. For this game, I think it is hugely fitting. I don't want to see a bunch of pretty girly blonde elf men riding on unicorns fighting with some translucent sword that has some spinning hieroglyphics on it and all wearing the same high end purple gear head to toe. No thanks.\n\nThe crafting system is something that is really unique in this game compared to many in games these days and some of those recipes are a secret kept to themselves. Not everything is just out in the open even after so many years and I like that about this game that there may be things I may never discover. You can't just get to an point where you know it all in a week. But do not expect people to share their secrets with you that have played this game for years prior to the steam release.\n\nI think older gamers like me will definitely appreciate this game. People that want their hand held, all the guides you ever want on the forums, an in-game map, a cursor to let you know where you want to go at the top of your screen, this is probably not the game for you, but I can hope that maybe even among those players, there might be some that want to experience something different.

I have never encountered a game with as much potential and freedom.\n\nSpend hours living the life:\nOf a simple gatherer, tending to your pet dog every now and again as he follows you around.\nOf a politican, traveling town to town ushering people to join guilds, making friends, mending fences or breaking them.\nOf a craftsmen, hammering down and creating your very own unique recipes for armor and weapons.\nOf a warrior, slaying countless monsters, or people. Defend the weak, or destroy them.\nOf a wildsmen, living the land and taming all sorts of wild creatures to accompany you, or to sell.\nOf a mage, sending arcs of electricity and balls of flame into your enemies, or healing wounded allies.\nOf a chef, a sparse profession, sweating as you struggle to find the perfect amount of salt to season your 14 part dish.\nOf a dominator, using magic and intimidation to force great, great beasts under your control.\nOf a glassblower, making vials to sell.\nOf an alchemist, concocting potions to heal, or kill. Become renown for your potency, or keep humble.\nOf a racist human woman who robs and kills all non-humans.\nOf a thick, righteous half-breed who protects their home at all costs, otherwise docile.\nOf a maniac axe murderer, unable to resist killing all they meet.\n\nOf... just about anything or anyone you can imagine!

You NEED to have patience and a thick skin. When other reviews talk about the abundance of player killing, they're not lying. Keep your wits about you, even when you think no ones around. With patience, it is very possible to become self sustaining in the game, but there will ALwAYS be a player better than you. I don't necessarily think you HAVE to have a guild to get anywhere (although it helps), making friends is good enough and I've found more pleasant players than not so far. Just make sure you are making the right friends. If you die, you WILL lose everything. When traveling long distances, travel lightly and with stuff you can afford to lose. Keep items in reserve at banks in every city you come to, when applicable. (Cause you never know where you're going to die. This helps you not be completely without when entering a city) For new players: stay in help chat as long as you can. It is beneficial. I believe the new update allows it to be up for a week now. Overall, positive review here. Easy to get lost and diving in for hours at a time.","April 7","true","237.0"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

And thats what bother me the most about it, how the game feels like it's still very early in development despite the fact it's been around for years. That, and the fact it's virtually impossible to level up skills in the starting zones because people will immediately rush up to stand between you and whatever youre trying to hit, causing the guards to come after you and get you killed so they can take all your ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI can see soooo much potential in this game, and yet just like a lot of MMOs lately, fails to become what they could be. And it's essentially paywalling you from ever experiencing the full game, especially since free accounts have a maximum skill level of 60, meaning that paying players will always have an advantage over free players...which is the very definition of "pay 2 win".\n\nIt's worth a try, but I can't recommend this game to somebody who is looking for a time investment. It's fun to ♥♥♥♥ around in for a while but not much more than that, and don't let the fanboys bully you in to it with their "You're just not hard-core enough" schtick.

However, I spent all my time in this game just trying to learn the very basics only to be killed over and over, and over, and over..... All of this in the first area you spawn as a new player. Many times I had no clue why guards were attacking and killing me. Then there is an obvious culture of existing players who do nothing but target the newest players in the only areas that are immediately available upon spawn.... Its also apparent that this is an intended and acceptable practice. Basic functions are tedious and strange at best and learning many of them will take a lot of time and patients. Just about the time you think your accomplishing something, someone kills you and they are allowed to take everything you have.\n\nHaving said all that, it is a free game so give it a try but i cant recommend this game to anybody in its current state. Since this game has been around for at least several years it hard to be optimistic that there will be any improvement in these areas.

Then to find out its a small team of Delvs that has done all this its kind of mind blowing. 4-5 guys built this vs 100s of ppl on other games just to make landscape.\n\nThis game reminds me of world of warcraft 2003. before it was nerfed into the ground.\n\nA. It has one of the largest crafting systems i have seen in a game.\n\nB. The combat is unlike other mmo's and can take a few days or weeks to really learn how to fight (like CSGO vs other FPS you have to learn how to use the weapon).\n\nC. You can write books. make ingame maps/armor/weapon's/poitons. breed horses or other mounts to use to sell and so much more.\n\nD. Its a mix between Eve/Elderscrolls/WoW/ and medieval warfar.\n\nIt does have some bugs and node lines but hey i dont fall past the ground and get stuck for 2hrs like wow 2003. when the game lets out a patch it does not forget to add something i need for a month like BC. i have not seen all black mob without any color just a shape like Naxx at 60.\n\nHands down one of the best games i have found in a very long time. only thing i see holding it back it the player base both in greefing new players(something you have to get past then its not a big thing) and in the money a larger player base would bring so the Delv team could hire more ppl and roll out updates.\n\nExplore/be a highway man and rob ppl/ build huge keeps and citys/ Find something that no other player has found share it or keep it secret its up to you, this game has so many sides of play it even has fishing you pick bait,line,hooks, how deep you cast it.\n\nIf you enjoy a harder style of game with a amazing crafting system and are stick of all the pathed games being made anymore then this is for you. its a world not a 16man Q or sitting in town waiting for a Q to pop for you.\n\nOh and the game has heart it just ban a full guild AiM for cheating thats why you see so many angry posts about the game.

This game is spectacular, but it sure as hell isn't for everyone. I've played this game for 5 years since beta, and I have seen all kinds of players: they either try it and drop it, or they play it and stay forever.  If you're the first kind, you're probably going to hate the game with a passion and wonder why on earth people play it in the first place. If you're the second, however, you will be hooked. Possibly forever (like me). There is nothing out on the market that fills the niche like Mortal. Below are some more details about the game.\n\nPROS AND CONS:\n\n+ Open world action RPG with real-time directional combat.\n+ Combat is easy to learn, difficult to master.\n- Mechanics can be dodgy and frustrating at times.\n\n+ Interesting race system and a sprawling skill tree with multiple branches a la Morrowind on drugs\n+ Palpable sense of progression.\n+ Skill up by doing (like in the Elder Scrolls Series) and by reading skill books (like EvE).\n-  Can be slow and grindy.\n-  While you can make very diverse builds, only a few are typically accepted as competent, with the rest being 'gimped.'\n\n+ PvP is exciting.\n+ Can give you shivers and make your palms sweat when you enter your first large scale battle.\n+ (or -) While there are no traditional 'classes' in the game, there are distinct roles that can be filled such as 'footfighter,' 'mounted combat,' 'mage' or 'hybrid mage.'\n- There are some issues with balance and lag.\n\n+ Crafting system is neat and intuitive.\n+ Combine many different materials and parts to make new and customized armor and weapons.\n-  Proper crafting requires maxed skills, material lores and a subscription.\n-  Can take a long time and a lot of gold/materials to become a competent crafter (depending on the profession).\n\n+ PvE can be fun and unique.\n+ Action based combat with timed blocks and aiming.\n- Timing can be wonky.\n- Can get repetitive quickly if you don't like it.\n+ Some interesting mechanics in the tougher enemies such as Demons, Minos and half the mobs in Sarducca.\n- (or +) First time you get jumped by a monster in Sarducca, you might poop a little.\n\n+ The game requires extensive  interaction with the community for the full experience.\n- It's an awful community.\n+ It's a wonderful awful community.","September 28, 2015","true","53.7"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","30","45","5","0"

Really it is the perfect score. Not because its bad but because of the world of Mortal Online it self. The world is full of freedom, oprtunities and most of all merciless DEATH. With a full loot system so it is very taxing and difficult to get into at first. But if you stay strong and realize the freedom, fun and adventure this game has got to offer that possibly no other game does, you may find what you were looking for. But it can definately be to much to take for alot of people. So 50% approval is 100% of what the game and its community is intending to recieve and they got what they were after.\n\nNow for my review.\n\n(I played the game for about 6 months straight in 2014)\n\nWell first off I love that the world and the quests and the storys are not told by NPC's but by the players them selves. If you think moral decisions really mean alot in games like Fable or Fallout then you have not tasted Mortal Online. Everything you do matters to someone else. Every good thing you do for someone and every nasty wicked thing you do means ALOT to another person. When you get into a guild, make friends, get involved in the politics of the world it self; you are fighting for what ever you are for, evil or good, money or power and everything you do matters and effects someone else. And passions and tensions definately rise all of the time. Theres really no other game that i have ever played before that really felt like a 2nd life like the experience that Mortal Online gives you. So I absolutely love that.\n\nThe combat system is pretty good. Not the best ive ever seen and but definately not the worst. It is skill based and you can not target your oppenent like in other mmo's. Im not a big fan of the way you fire off magic spells in this game but eh, alot of people make it work for them and I suppose if you can you may enjoy that too. But the combat is more like Chivalry.\n\nThe crafting system and the skill leveling system really shine the brightest. There is so much depth and originality in both of these 2 systems that Mortal Online really made it their own and no other game has before or sense done anything like it and I really admire them alot. So epic. Quite possibly the best part.\n\nThe bad. The bugs and glitches can be a real pain in the a$$ sometimes. I mean really. I know the community told the dev's they should have focused on fixing the bugs and glitchs before they focused on saraducaa but they did not listen. Honostly as much as I love the game it self for what it is the bugs and glitchs kill it for actually making it on the list of my most favorite games of all time. But it is still top 10.\n\nOverall I would give this game and 8.4 out of 10. It loses .2 points for the community being alittle to a-holey to noobs but at the same time Mortal Needs those a-holes in endgame to make the world go round so hard to balance the a-holeness and it loses the other -1.2 because of the bugs and glitches. The dev team needs to stop focusing on growth and expansion and focus on pest control. The bugs need a fix for real. But other then that I ABSOLUTELY recomend this game. It is as if Ultima Online and The Elder Scrolls (not online) series had a baby with its own sense of identity and flare. And those 2 games are my favorite of all time. So for that I love Mortal Online.\n\n<3","September 20, 2015","true","449.0"," 41 of 65 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","41","65","4","0"

You basically have to hold your swing back for 1 or 2 seconds before you'll do max damage. It really slows the game down, and makes it a bit finicky because there's no animation to tell when you've fully charged your weapon. You just have to know.\n\n- As a new player you don't even have the ability to see how much damage you've done. You need a skill called damage assessment, but even with the skill you still won't be able to see how much damage you do because your skills are limited to 60. It needs to be higher than that to get an exact number. So the only way for a new player OR f2p to figure how how long they need to charge is to guestimate based on the health bar of your target. Pay to see your damage is kind of lame.\n\n- Your block doesn't drop immediately after you release the block. It hangs for a second, so you have to wait a whole second after you drop your block to respond. Otherwise you'll push your enemy instead of attack them. The community in game was very unhelpful explaining this. Some of them told me that I needed to get the block skills up to change this, and others told me that I simply had a horrible connection. I looked through the skill tree, and I didn't see anything to reduce it. So I think it's connection related.\n\n- Everything is delayed. I take damage and the game doesn't recognize it quick enough. I fell off a building, and It took 3 seconds for the game to register I took damage. An enemy swings on my screen, and I take no damage, then 2 seconds later I'll take the damage. It's just weird, and it's impossible to fight well if you don't know if you're being hit or not.\n\n- P2P characters have a meaningful damage and damage reduction lead on F2P characters. Since P2P characters can max their skills they get the full bonuses from aggressive and defensive stance, but a f2p gets very little. I asked the community about scaling, and the player base told me that skill bonuses operate on an exponential curve. So 60 - 80 does twice as much as 1 - 60, and 80 - 100 does the most.\n\n- In general it just has an odd floaty feel to it, and it isn't super interesting. You could just play chivalry.\n\nMovement\n\n- As a new player your character starts extremely slow. It's like you're scooting around as an old lady. You'll need to raise your attributes to go quicker. It's a VERY annoying start, and someone in /h suggested that I just go afk chopping wood to raise my attributes. I did that, and it was a big help in making me enjoy the game.\n\n- As a f2p every p2p character is going to be faster than you. There's no way for you chase a p2p character down, or escape from a p2p character. It's literally just it. Movement skills operate the same way as defensive and aggressive stance. You're not getting 60% of the skill bonuses when you get it to level 60. It's more like 35 - 40%. It's a huge gain for the p2p character.\n\n- There's an odd double tap mechanic. So if you double tap a direction key twice you'll do a double jump. The problem is that it's inconsistent with the sensitivity. For example, I quickly did ADAA, and it gave me a long jump to the left. Then I repeatedly clicked AAAAAA and it wasn't giving me the long jump. It's very easy to make the mistake of accidentally doing a long jump in combat, and there is also no way to change the sensitivity, so it is what it is. I think the devs need to drop the double tap and make it a simple modified action. For example CTRL + directional key should do the long jump.\n\nWealth progression!\n\n- Basically the game has a very simple progression in the beginning. You spawn in, do the tutorial, then you go to the graveyard and kill zombies to raise your attributes and collect zombie heads to sell and buy books. Once you're strong enough you go into the sewer and you kill scoundrels to do the exact same thing. It's fairly boring, and the AI was unresponsive, AND sometimes the AI has long ranged attacks that will hit you through walls and pillars. It's just not fun or engaging.\n\n- You can buy gear, animals, and food from other players on a broker. It's not really intuitive what is good or not, and the sorting on the broker doesn't really work. For example I searched weapons, and the first thing on the list was a cooking pot. Also the economy seems fairly dead.\n\n- You can also build your own house, but I don't really see the point in doing that. The community basically told me that it's "cool", but it doesn't seem like there's an ingame reason for players to have a personal house. You can do everything in the major city.\n\nSo basically you would do the initial stuff, equip yourself, buy your books, and then you wouldn't really have any use for your money.\n\nf2p\n\n- It's not a f2p game. I get the feeling they tacked on f2p for marketing reasons, but they never designed coherent mechanics around it. You can call it pay to win. If they're insistent that it's f2p then I would call it pay to win, but otherwise it's just a subscription game with a glorified trial.\n\nIt's frankly a fairly mediocre game that has a lot of content, but it didn't do anything well. I would pay to play it if it was a $5 sub, but they want $14 so it I don't think it's worth it.","August 31, 2015","false","24.3"," 59 of 99 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","59","99","0","0"

This is true PvP! The land of Mortal Online is harsh and violent. Even in starting city after few hours of gameplay you are vulnerable to other players. There are thiefs that try to steal your hard earned money. There are players who do anything to scam you out. And if you wander too far from the city guards you can be a victim of cold blooded murderers.\n\nBut within this hard world there is also unity and friendship. When the world is harsh you need to rely on friends and mates. Strenght comes from numbers. You can form guilds with your new or old friends or join any of the existing ones. There are guilds that do PvP battles, Crafting and trading, and even Thiefs have their own player guild for you to join.\n\nSo you can choose any path that you want. Be it hero or villain. Mortal online offers you the chance to play as you like.\n\nBut be warned. Be prepared to lose all your har earned loot if you are not smart enough. This game definetly brings out emotions.

Ya i know "free to play" The free to play aspect of the game lets you play but with limited skills. Which its meant that you play the game to see if you like it or not.\n\nI give this game a Positive review because its what I want out of an MMO. Its hardcore takes time but is rewarding when you do accomplish your goals (much like how Vanilla WoW was.) There isnt handholding from the game its a steep learning curve. On my list the Cons do out number the Pros but the Cons are very rewarding.\n\n\n\nPros:\nHardcore game/loot (If you die you drop all your loot on the ground)\nOpen world\nPvP\nGuilds\nTerritory control\nResource control\n\n\nCons:\nSlow updates (The development team is really small so updates are far and few between but they do happen)\nSmall player base (steam release helped game a little but lack of handholding for new players made a lot quit)\nGuild politics (most major guilds are allied and at stand stills so it limits guild PvP)\nGreifing new players\nLow skill point system (you wont be able to do multiple classes on one character to maximum efficiency forcing you to have multiple character slots)\nKnown bugs not being fixed\nNot new user friendly (took me a couple days to figure it out)\n\n","November 18, 2015","true","278.5"," 33 of 53 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","33","53","2","1"

Being solo is very difficult unless you have an extensive knowlege of the combat system and great timing. That being said with a small group or a lot of training this game can be among the best you have played since (for many of you) UO. Same skill type system, you can do everything yourself. Nearly everything is player made. Trial and error will be your friend when crafting.\n\nI never take the time to write reviews, but I feel like this game was unjustly charged a "mixed" rating. If you like the feel of the elder scrolls and the openness of a sandbox game. Give this a shot (computer allowing). Most issues players report for negative reviews are because they play on toasters that cannot support anything beyond the dated requirements World of Warcraft still supports.

Those are the only positives.\n\nWhen originally released in 2010 this game had potential, unfortunatley this potential has been squandered by poor development prioritization and an inability to bring the game's stability and playability up to a satisfactory state. 6 years on new players will notice that mortal online feels like any other game's alpha test, riddled with critical world breaking bugs that are created almost as fast as they are solved, leaving the game in a state of perpetual brokenness.\n\nThe developers will say, "its better than it was on release!" and while that is true in some aspects, now there is far more in-game to be broken and the same percentage of content is broken as was on release. Ultimatley the current state of the game speaks for itself, to illustrate: nearly a year on from the second continent, sarducca's, release, guilds on the other side of the world are assigned ownership of towns on the wrong continent, due to a simple oversight to add a new coordinate system for the new continent. Countless similar problems in the game's foundations sit well documented yet the developers press on with adding trivial scribing minigames that will likely be broken within a year and not be fixed for another two.\n\nThe excuse for this is always that their (contracted) artists cant fix bugs in their game, or that only some of their programmers can fix bugs, and yet here we are 6 years on and those artists sit bored diluting the game's original gritty swedish art style with ugly capes, cartoony spike armor, rams with spikes intersecting player models, lizard mounts, halloween helmets, and phallic player houses. It's long past time when they should have fixed their priotoriazation, for artists to be fired and programmers to be hired for the express purpose of fixing all the game's issues, yet this has not been done, 6 years on. Instead, excuses are proffered where applicable and otherwise only silence is heard.\n\nYou would think in a harsh full loot game measures would be taken to ensure when you lose everything, the game intended for you to die. Instead you will find yourself dying more often to client crashes, buggy ai, and hackers than other players(hackers who are often let back into the game by starvault only to be banned twice more). There is one area of the game that is polished enough to be enjoyed, and that is foot pvp, which is currently one of the only reasons large groups play the game. Even here, balance issues, node-wide crashes that leave dozens of people's clients crashed, and various other issues are rampant. The developers of this game rarely listen to community feedback, even when there was a dedicated balance testing team, they were largely ignored and it took teeth pulling for tiny numbers changes. The rare instances where Starvault makes changes suggested by the community, they shout it from the rooftops as if to try to paint a very different picture from the reality, "We listen sometimes!" Yeah, great.\n\nNewbies will find that their first character will likely need to be deleted and remade unless they followed a guide, as of the tens of thousands of potential race, size, and age combinations, only about 6 are viable for combat, with a bit more room given to crafting characters whos attributes simply don't matter outside of int. Most crafting characters in MO are dull to play, taking up a whole character slot just for you to sit in town yellspamming your wares, assuming you don't take the sane route and simply keep that character logged off the majority of the time until you need him. 6 is an improvement from the 2 combat races that were viable on release, but when such a huge depth of customization is available, so few choices means the race system feels arbitrary and poorly balanced. Ultimatley the game's character system does not give the flexability to players that it claims to, in fact limiting it more and more as changes such as dex tiering are made, which causes dex to only matter at arbitrary milestones (110, 93, 119, 85 etc)\n\nTo top it off, Starvault maintains immense disrespect for the small playerbase by running their official forums poorly, advising moderators to ban anyone who is negative about the game. For example, "its not worth promoting the game in it's current state" will net you a ban. The game's forums are considered extremely toxic due to moderation that shuts down legitimate discussion while allowing trolling to thrive. Website ticket support answers only once every two emails you send, and in-game support is a mixture of unhelpfulness and complete incompetence. Expect to be lied to by game masters ingame, who despite their status don't understand basic gameplay mechanics and are a nightmare to deal with. Expect to be temporarily jailed by a game master if one of their buddies complains that you must have used cheats to kill their naked character. Expect policies as amazingly stupid as asking you to "contact a gm before you kill a boss mob" just to ensure the loot your entire group worked for appears at all.\n\nClient performance is poor, settings menus are often nonfunctional, and keybinding is a nightmare unless you edit the .ini text files which also happens to carry the penalty of an in-game permenant ban, if you are caught. Why they think editing a text file on your computer should be bannable speaks to their incompetence, and also the lack of functioning anticheat, demonstrated (there is no information or guides on how to cheat, exploit, or hack in my link or linked from my link, just a demonstration of the hacking issues that plague the game) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHuS_UhTdKY\n\n\nIt's possible that some point in the future that these issues will be fixed and i have heard that population has been staying at  stable since the massive dropoff, and i will update my review if that ever becomes the case. I do find myself coming back to this game repeatedly as i muse about what may have been fixed since i last played and all the wonderful mechanics in the sandbox that might work, but every time it becomes a case of "reroll a character, max him out, find out some obscure bug makes my intended playstyle unplayable, get annoyed and stop playing."","February 23","false","6.5"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","16","24","2","3"

Their guild would be happy to move me to a safe city if I recreate a character.   The game mechanics and abilities were fun so I'm going to give it another shot and see if it works better.  More to come in a few weeks.....\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe mechanics are a nod back to traditional skill based mmos, graphics are nice and I had a decent time in the tutorial zone.\n\nHowever, it has the typical toxic player base that prefers to grief using PvP mechancis and exploits to actually playing the PvE portion of the game.\n\nIn fact, the rules that are in place to stop player killing in towns actually raises griefing to an artform in Mortal Online.\n\nMy first experience with a griefer was when they charmed an animal then then left it standing alone in a field of other animals of the same type.  Waiting until a newbie player like me attacks it (not knowing that it counts as an attack on a player if you attack their pets).  And thus I was KOS by the guards, quickly murdered and then taunted for my "newb" mistake.\n\nMy second experience with griefing came when I left the newbie zone.   There's always a "welcoming committee" of PKers waiting just a little ways outside the zone entrance to make sure you get welcome-murdered.  From talking to higher level players, it doesn't get better, just make sure you travel in groups if you want to explore the countryside OR you are exceptionally powerful.\n\nIf you want a similar game but without the PvP / Grief aspect, I recommend checking out Project Gorgon.   Won't be free-to-play, but frankly I'm tired of the model that allows a rotating door of toxic players to get banned and then just recreate accounts to come back in again.","September 20, 2015","false","4.1"," 55 of 98 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","55","98","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phailmunsta/recommended/287920/","phailmunsta","Phail Munsta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phailmunsta/","96 products in account","Let me begin by saying that I've followed Mortal Online since its conception and that I have always been madly in love with the potential/concept of what the game could have been.\n\nMeager Proof: http://i.imgur.com/SyuxQpd.png\n\nKey Overview of Mortal Online:\n\n- Firstly, Mortal Online was released OVER FIVE YEARS ago. So anyone trying to call out a negative review based off of the playtime shown on Steam is completely misguided.\n\n-The fact that it was created five years ago also stands as a testimony to how horribly, horribly directed the game has been this entire time.\n\n- It began under the development of a small group of Swedish guys who created their little independent company Star Vault, and because I have not been following it that closely, I'm not entirely sure how much they've grown since then. I'm relatively positive that the dev team is still quite diminutive especially given the scope of the game and its current state. Again, that is speculation.\n\nThis game was a project loaded with potential, but got corrupted by a small, dedicated playerbase who refused to acknowledge the actual problems with the game and kept feeding the egos of blind, prideful developers. Five years into this virulent cycle, the independent company gets to release their game on Steam to a wave of people who are unfamiliar with the long standing unhealthy cycle that has been going on for ages.\n\nSo, in good conscience, I cannot recommend this game. They need to learn a lesson. This type of independent company behavior is not okay and should not be encouraged.\n\n------THIS IS THE END OF THE CORE OVERVIEW STOP HERE BEFORE TL;DR REVIEW BELOW------\n\nI'm going to do a LOOSE FORM of a pros and cons list to come off as unbiased as I can towards this game, because, as mentioned above, I really did have the highest of hopes for it fulfilling my wildest MMO fantasies. It, unfortunately, clearly has no intentions of ever rising up to meet its potential or making the required changes to fulfill said fantasies.\n\nThat being said, expect a more descriptive list of cons as this is still a NEGATIVE review.\n\nThis WILL NOT be comprehensive at the time of writing, because I simply don't have the time and I could go on endlessly about the good ideas and the horrible implementations that this game suffers from.\n\nPros:\n\n- The world's big, fascinating, and a mystery for every new player to discover with minimal guidance.\n\n- The game's mechanics are hardcore and there is no hand-holding going on here. It's really an amazing design philosophy that I love to embrace.\n\n- The idea of a true open sandbox where you can literally be whatever you want to be is there. Trader by day, highwayman by night. Valiant defender of justice, or rapscallion rogue pickpocketing in the streets. You decide.\n\n- The concept of real time combat with responsive and individual body-part hitboxes in an MMO is astounding.\n\nCons:\n\n- Several of the systems, the mechanics, are still as severely flawed as they were five years ago at release. For instance, the flagging system. (Which indicates whether you've been a good or naughty person in the game world recently. Blue flag means innocent, grey flag means you've done something bad and you're free game, red flag means you're murderous scum and can be killed on sight) It was never refined to a logical point and I'll give the roughest example for people who haven't played the game yet. Let's say I'm killing some NPC creatures and I'm flagged blue. A person can, literally, run like a madman in between the monster and me so that I accidentally hit them. When I accidentally hit them, the game flags me grey and I become free game for that person and anyone else around to attack me since I'm now considered a criminal. I don't know the timer on it, which brings me to my next point.\n\n- There is no consistent, well documented data for... Anything really. Monsters, towns, maps, items, basic functionality. In game, it's almost nonexistent except for some vague descriptions here and some weak tutorials that are pretty much only presented within the first thirty minutes of the game. The playerbase is so small and tight-knit that you can't even find reliable, recent online documentation for things. The TWO Wiki resources have blank pages or pages that haven't been updated in years. This ties into the next point.\n\n- The game's mechanics are hardcore and there is no hand-holding going on here. While it's a really amazing design philosophy, it's not an excuse to justify lazy, badly executed design. That seems to be a go-to argument for the game's supporters. What they fail to realize is that peoples' qualms lie less so in the game being "hardcore" and moreso in it feeling unpolished or just... lazy. An example in my next point.\n\n- This is supposed to be an established fantasy world with a lore and history, but... You don't even have access to ANY in-game map? You're telling me that the inhabitants of this massive world, these people who built countless intricate cities... Never drew up maps? I'm not even asking for a marker on the map of where I'm at. I'm asking for just a simple map alone for reference. Even a map that fills in as you explore it would make more sense than this. The lack of systems, the lack of designs for these systems. It's blatant and people who defend it using the, "You just can't handle how hardcore the game is" allow the developers to get away with bad design choices.\n\n- The idea of "Free To Play" is extremely misguiding here. All the skills in the game have a cap of 100. If you're a FTP player, however, you can only level up any skill to 60. Explaining this in the simplest of math, it makes you effectively 40% less efficient than any subscriber and bars you off from doing a great many things in the game or reaching high level content. That should be absolutely all I need to say about this.\n\n- 14 dollars for a month's subscription? That's ludicrous. World of Warcraft/Blizzard earned the right to charge people 15 bucks a month. Absolutely ludicrous, especially when Star Vault's idea of "Free To Play" really means "Unlimited Trial period".\n\n- The bugs and glitches this far along... Are unforgivable. Items jumping back from your bank to your inventory when you log off. Items disappearing from the bank altogether. Cumbersome rubberbanding when fighting NPC monsters. The list goes on infinitely.","September 4, 2015","false","2.9"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","0"

It is simply p2p. Consider f2p as a kind of demo. You get to play the game and do almost everything there is in it, just nothing very well. Can you create the uber solo pvp warrior as an f2p?

In fact, there are no micro-transactions at all. This game makes it's money with player subscriptions and among those everyone is equal and nobody can buy an advantage.\n\nThis game is certainly unpolished, experiences lag, bugs and glitches but they are all while numerous, rather minor.\n\nIt makes up for it with the same aspects that are difficult to grasp for many new players, including me:\nThe players have to explore the world themselves. There is no in game map. Equiptment stats are never explicitely revealed. Players are given an approximaton of their different gear items' stats the accuracy of which depends on their skills with the various item types.\nAll of this plus the lack of quests telling you what to do next is frustrating to many expecting another game similar to what they have played before. You simply have to keep going and find a purpose for yourself in this world.\nJoin a guild and carve out your piece of it. Don't expect you and your 2 other f2p friends can just start the game and after 5 hours walk into an established guild's territory and take their stuff. If you could, something would be very wrong.\n\nGive it a try.

NOT only that starting out you have ZERO means of making money because it's a "player driven economy" and not a SINGLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPC will buy ANYTHING you try to sell to them. You could spend HOURS crafting gear that the ONLY thing it'll do is raise your skill and have 0 means of making money for yourself but have to spend money to get materials. Sure you can sell materials you gather, but their worth is miniscule and this is a 100 copper = 100 silver = 100 gold, ergo it takes 1,000 copper to equal 1 gold. Which you you'll have to keep in a bank unless you don't mind getting pick-pocketed by thieves in rags. Combat is also awkward with a clumsy version of Mount and Blade's directional based combat(it doesn't work half the time) and no option for a 3rd person view(but at least it has an FoV slider...to bad it's set at 90 degrees and you have VERY limited peripheal vision).

Oh and the basic Mafioso tactic of strongarming players into Guilds for "protection".\n\nThis game's character creation and wealth of skills is REALLY impressive but it's execution basically spits in the face of everything any gamer has ever seen in a game.\n\nPros:\n-Huge skill list and more "life-like" world compared to other worlds, involved character creation and the ability to make a character you want.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are lackluster and stutter.\n-Controls for combat are slow and clunky.\n-Making items early in the game serves no purpose beyond grinding it's related crafting skill as it can only be sold to players. And no player is going to buy low tier gear.\n-Good chance of getting griefed at all times once you're outside the safety of the cities.\n-Skills are capped at barely above 50% proficiency unless you pay money, giving subbers an innate advantage in a game that is VERY MUCH about player versus player.\n-Game supports toxic, non-social behaviour in the "elite" towards new players.\n-Game is VERY vague about values such as how much armor protects you, how many items you're using in crafting something and the damage you do/take.\n-The amount of skills is actually overwhelming as it seems like EVERYTHING is tied to a skill from gathering plants to RESTING. Yes, you can get better at resting, by resting a lot.","September 2, 2015","false","2.3"," 30 of 53 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","30","53","5","2"

Its not a BAD game persay, it has two large continents and a recent large patch which I've yet to explore much. The community is mostly made of up either guild politicts and drama or just your average rampant murderers (Which are some guilds). I like this game, I really do, though it just feels, incomplete, empty, without content.\nI'd really like to see some major updating to this game, some actual house decor and even perhaps minor terraforming? Please, let me make my little beach side cactii garden in Sarducaa. You're definitely going to want to team up with friends and even a guild to accomplish anything above farming some pigs and skeletans for your life in here.\n\nIts playable mostly, it can be quite a good bit of fun at times. Its largely dependant on the adventures you go on with your friends if anything. You can play for /free/ but are limited to a cap on your skills from 100 to 60. It might not seem like that big of a deal, though when that elf mage that's running faster than the speed of light is doing 40% more damage than yours, then you'll understand. l'm recommending TRYING it for now, grab a one month sub if you find yourself in a lovely little guild like I did. Make your own goals and ever pursue them, don't become too disappointed when you get killed and lose your items.","March 8","true","336.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jodinar/recommended/287920/","jodinar","Joda1993","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jodinar/","7 products in account","Alright, I previously had a bad review on this game.\n\nWhat can I say? The first impressions were less than great, especially when I couldn't log in the game for any apparent reason for months.\nOddly enough, the next day after posting that review, suddenly I'm able to log on. Coincidence?\n\n\n\nSo, after actually getting to play and experience the game, here's what I have to say:\n\nFirst, I'm sincerely glad I gave it another try. The experience of this game is like none other, that's the truth.\n\nThe world of Nave is a bittersweet landscape, a twist of beauty and terror. You can explore EVERYTHING, you can FIGHT everything. However, EVERYTHING is DANGEROUS.\n\nSwimming is dangerous, pvp is hell, standing in a desert or blizzard is deadly, your friends are deadly, the city guards are out to get you if you aren't careful.      This game should be titled:  50000 ways to die in an MMO.\n\nThe enivronment is gorgeous.  The land is huge, the water is breath-taking (literally), the sky is awespiring, the cities are quite regal (Though I wish we could enter more buildings than a bank.) The Music is very attractive and helps you connect to the game.\n\nThe combat system is an amazement. Some people say it's basic and boring,  I say it's quite tactical.  In WoW you can macro everything you want to do to a single key-press and spam it.   In Mortal Online, you have to AIM for weak spots with your weapon.   The combat of this game is more engaging than ANY I have encountered, even in console single-player games.\n\nThe major downside of this game is that the community is very, very toxic. I recommend finding a guild as soon as possible to help remedy this. (Shout out to my HERO friends!) After joining the HERO guild, they immediately took me under-wing, taught me more about the game and have been very patient with me.\n\n\nThere are some limitations to the game for free to play players.  However with enough skill, know-how, and knowledge of the game itself and what gear it has to offer, a F2p can go toe-to-toe with a P2p any day. It's all about reaction time and accuracy.\n\nSoon I will begin toying around with construction, we'll see how that goes.\n\nApologies to the developers for my harsh words on my first review of this game, (frankly it was deserved with 2 months of unavailable play.)  But it's okay. The game speaks for itself, and I'm glad I get to be a part of it.\n\nKeep doing what you do, StarVault.","December 2, 2015","true","206.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","3"

The usual out-of-the-gate hiccups for an unprepared development/server management team are prevalent.  Likely 2-3 weeks before stability issues are resolved - an average estimate for this increasingly common problem with games nowadays.  Early Access, I can understand, but this game has been available for some time even prior to the Steam Release\n\nIn its current state:\n\nPros:\n\n1) Some veteran players are genuinely helpful (kudos to those who are answering the seemingly endless requests for help on the very first newbie quest.)  Admittedly, it took me a few minutes to figure out what to do, This is one game where reading the quest text as it is given is crucial.\n\n2) Decent graphics.  Unreal Engine always offers a good bang for the buck in graphics capabilities.\n\n3) Free to Play - although, skill levels are capped at 60 (out of 100) and there are skills that are not accessible to F2P players (Thievery)\n\nCons:\n\n1) Getting connected successfully is (at best) random; might be better late at night when player base decreases\n\n2) Widespread reports on logging out, then attempting to login only to receive a message stating "you are already logged in"; research on the game's forums indicate this issue only goes away after a server restart - lovely\n\n3) Murdering is pretty rampant - higher level players are genuinely bored enough to travel all the way to the cities where the new influx of players are spawing just to kill low level characters just outside the city limits (that's actually a pretty good indication of how boring end-game must be, as there's absolutely no material benefit in doing this other than to just be a PK'er)\n\n4) Latency issues; again, indicative of poor initial scalability on the server-end of things, but will iron itself out over time (in the short term, because of player loss; new players are very likely to lose interest from not being able to advance their characters without getting murdered constantly by high level players)\n\nI will update this review once I re-test after a couple of weeks to see if the server issues have been ironed out.  If you want to check it out to see for youself, go for it.  It has some interesting concepts.  There's no way I'd recommend it right now - there's some things they need to get under control fast before this influx of Steam players makes their decision on whether or not to invest time (and perhaps a subscription) to this game.\n\n[Updated: Spelling corrections]","September 1, 2015","false","4.1"," 46 of 84 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","46","84","0","0"

At first it may seem very hard to get into due to most other games giving less freedom such as giving classes while Mortal doesn't. The major problem is even though Mortal is free to play whithout paying for a sub you will never be good at anything because you can't max out skills with out a sub. So if you are a competitive gamer and want to get into Mortal you should expect to pay around $20.USD and an extra $15.USD every month for a sub. Another thing is mostly everyone in Motal are ♥♥♥♥♥ so unless you have other friends to play with or you get lucky like me and find a guild with lots of vetern players to help you and try to recruit you, your not going to have a good time.

I wanted to love this game, I really did.  I love sandbox style playing but this was so unbearably painful, I wasted hours just wandering and accomplishing anything.\n\nI installed in initially and found out my computer was not capable of playing with good FPS but I tried.  After dying once, it took my 30 minutes to make it to the resurrection priest due to the video lag.  Once I upgraded my computer, I had great FPS, not that the graphics are that good, but I wanted to love this game so I overlooked it.\n\nI was invited to a guild/clan whatever and was given basic instructions on how to get to their town.  I was killed so many times that I decided to walk for hours as a ghost so that I wouldn't die so much.  I walked in the world for 2 days, real days, about 4 hours each day searching for this town and got so lost, I deleted the character and started over again.\n\nThis time I was determined to like this game by not leaving the town I started in and level up going into the graveyard.  This is where the irritation set in.  You need to kill zombies and skeletons and then hurry as fast as possible to collect your loot because people just stand around you waiting and then steal it.  When they are not doing that, they purposely jump in from of you trying to make you hit them so you become wanted and the town guards kill you.  Once you die in the graveyard, good luck walking around finding the closest resurrection priest, there isn't one very close, then you have to go back.\n\nMan I wanted to love this game, but alas I cannot.

I have probably hundreds if not thousands of hours on it... After the great game Star Wars Galaxies shut down I had searched for a sandbox game, with a unique crafting system in an open-world sandbox.  I found it here.  Mortal Online is an AMAZING Medieval Hardcore Sandbox MMORPG and will show you that not all mmorpgs are WoW-copies.  Great combat system, the greatest crafting system I have EVER seen.  A beautiful open world filled with endless adventures.  Played in first-person mode, it uses a skill-based melee combat system, block left/right/center, attack left/right/center, or use magic or bows.  If you have the attention span of an adult, you will not find a game better than this anywhere.\n\nPros: Open World | Best Crafting System Ever | Taming and COUNTLESS other features that will keep you playing for very long periods of time |  Great player economy | Great Pve | Great PvP | Territory control | City/keep building | And so much more.\n\nCons: Typically bad community.. it's best to play this with friends because many people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on this game (this is what has ruined it for me in the past). | There used to be alot of bugs in this game but they have made absolutely amazing progress in fixing the vast majority of them, however of course some still remain such as the Trade Broker being stuttery which is quite annoying to me | Steep learning curve, but if you look at sandbox survival games like Rust, alot of people enjoy that type of thing | Free to play model disadvantages free players |\n\nAll in all, Mortal Online is an amazing game that is totally free to try.

I have been through countless sieges, been with many guilds and have also explored everything worth exploring (including the new continent). I also swam around the entire continent of Myrland (the first continent) just to see if I had missed something hidden away.\n\nI do not recommend this game at all and although that may seem odd considering I have withered through the countless, yet boring PvE, Building, Sieging activities. But I have reached my limit with this game, it's community and it's company (a title they do not deserve). Corruption, Bugs, Empty Content, Exploits and Cheats.\n\nWith fond memories of this game, I can say that it WOULD have been a truly fantastic game, that put all the hardcore wannabe games to shame, but unfortunately rampant corruption, bugs and a community with a majority of muppets have continued to drag this game downhill.\n\n\nThe Actual Review:\n\n\n\nGraphics and Preformance:\n\nThe game has improved slightly but is still not even close to games in this Decade... There is large amounts of FPS lag, even on modern top-medium gamer computers. Crashing is also a major problem that gets bandaged, but not fixed. All in all... it's not too bad, but it can be frustrating and sometimes just maddening. The terrain is acceptable (on flatlands atleast) with lovely pubic hair-like trees splashed around here and there. The mountains and hills of course... is probably where you'll be doing most of your dying, are crappily made and are basically like ice ramps. However there are some wonderful scenic places like atop Fabernum Mountain, or the Myrland Jungles at night time,  etc...\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nMortal Online Gameplay differs in many ways from your usual MMORPG, there are no real AI quests, no real AI factions, nothing but a few AI towns and a pile  of Player-Made villages and Territory Control Structures (you can think of it like Rust, except taking down walls, houses or keeps takes literally hours of your time unless you have many people).\n\nThere are many things  you can do, and most likely, if you want to progress at an acceptable speed, you'd need to subscribe, buy gold/items with r/l money, exploit and dupe, etc. Their are many professions to do, alchemy, smithing, armor crafting, taming, etc... you are limited to 1100 points (normally 100 points per primary skill). Many skills are secondary so you can have as many of them as you want!\n\nUnfortunately, PVP within the game is ruled by whoever can hide a Cheat Engine better, or whoever has the best latency to the server. There is no shield against hackers, and feigned ignorance by the Player-GMs (yes... GM's are either players themselves, or have friends who play the game...). Corruption is a HUGE problem in this game and nothing is ever done except the odd Counselor/GM who will get removed but not banned (when enough evidence is against him.... PLAYER evidence -.-").\n\nNew players will probably never be able to compete with the major guilds in this game,  as all the best resources are held by the largest clans and they all "nutcup" each other. It is likely that those large clans also have what is commonly referred to as "pocket GMs" within the MO Community. Like typical MMORPGs, the nerds at the top are the ones who buy in-game content with real like money so don't compete if you pockets aint deep!\n\nComing to the end of my rant/review, I would also like to point out that whomever speaks out against corruption within the Mortal Online Forums, or to the GM/Support Staff will likely get BANNED or WARNED instead of rewarded for their efforts. Corruption in this game is insane and it's kinda like politics, whoever licks the GM's enough happens to get a pass or a reward.\n\nStar Vault censors what it does not like to hear and BANassassinates those who expose what a disgusting fraud this game really is.\n\nDo Not Spend Your Money Here... You are Better off with Another Game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBsb7tEAIqc\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La9iJyzuOqU\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHuS_UhTdKY","February 12","false","300.6"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

A mind-boggling quantity of things to do anywhere from pickpocketing and taming creatures to crafting a weapon by selecting each material its made of from the core out. Don't even get me started on cooking and alchemy, hundreds upon hundreds of ingredients to choose from with the quantity of each altering the outcome of your recipes....\nWith one massive and persistent game world, the immersion is intense not only from the game world created by the developers but also by the social and economic world created by the players. Kingdoms rise and fall, territorial borders expand or dissapear, and great warriors or mages make their names known with their skill in combat not some invisible calculation played out by the computer after you press a bunch of hotkeys. You must aim both your attack and block, with several other factors such as character speed and weapon type making dramatic changes to combat styles and tactics.\nYes this game does have some bugs, it is unfortunately the price to pay for a pioneer MMO sandbox game with real time virtual world interactions such as hit box based combat for each body part as well as constructable keeps, houses and cities. Mortal is constantly being refined and Starvault is determined to satisfy this game genre.","September 27, 2015","true","394.4"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

A game with no rails to guide you. No world-saving/destroying/modifying plot to spur you on to the next set of increasingly harder goals to clear.\n\nAn interesting concept that falls flat pretty much right out the gate. The tutorial section is a poorly designed mess. Reading and following the instructions scratches at a surface that promises fascinating depths, but penetrating the UI to find the specific thing you're looking for is an exercise in frustration.\n\nLearning new skills requires your character reading a book... the very first book I got had an 18 hour timer, and the act of standing there, watching that timer tick down improved my skill in 'reading' and after half an hour brought it down to fifteen hours. Whoop-dee-doo.\n\nI'm never one to rail on a game's graphics, for their own sake. But as dated as this game looks, it should at least boast a more stable frame rate. Instead, I had to tone the options down, and get used to the idea that "playable" would have to suffice.\n\nFinally, wandering the lands on a quest to do whatever thing you wanted to go set out to do might have been enjoyable... if you could move at a speed other than "shamble".\n\nMy experience can be best described as "Poor, with moderate hope of something better buried beneath the wreckage." a more patient player may derive hours of joy from the experience.

Dubbed "Mortal Offline" for the first year. That should tell you something. Common to joke that its still a beta(even amoungst staff). Prices are way off balance, they charge you as if its a AAA game, when really its not great. Should charge 5$ maybe / month for sub.\n\nStaff- 99% volunteer, if you have a issue(like being stuck on terrian) while they're not online, you may sit stuck for 3hrs. You needed your character? Welp too bad. "He who cries loudest gets the most help" remember this when interacting with them. They dont have strict policies, so if you complain enough you'll get more than your neighbor.(I was a Senior high counselor trust me, I know lol).\n\nBugs- Often riddled with bugs, it becomes a thing where you must know the bugs in order to try to make them impact your gameplay less. (example: logging out after war decs, thats been like that for 2 years? )\n\nIssues- they sweep issues under the rug until they become a problem. Their speed has a fundemental flaw right now in the way its calculated, as do the hitboxes(hint some settings on your game/computer effect both). They wont address it until it becomes a glaring issue\n\ndevolopment- While they try hard, they often care more for what sounds good on paper, than what would meanigfully impact gameplay(lets look at the huge awakening patch that took a year and a half to come out).\n\ncommunity - trolls mainly. Some gems in the rough, but in general its a lot of 'hey look how much better I am than you!' or 'Get owned' or people who religiously defend SV because they want the game to succeed. The fact is they had money, and lots of devs at one time. They just simply failed, and now are trying to patch up a sunk ship. Instead of patching holes though they sometimes paint the outside a new color to make players feel like the ship is awesome.\n\nBalance - horrible at balancing. They'll adjust something that is rediciously over powered/wrong a year later. Like great swords, butchery, etc. They simply dont play enough or have the game devolopment experience to properly balance things in a meaniglful way. Its like a construction worker trying to be a ballerina.\n\nEnforcement  - they let cheaters back in the game all the time. A guy jumped over your keep wall stole the stuff out of your house? Banned for a week. Did it again + showed some friends? Still playing, no problem. (both times with hard evidence, from the perspective of a GM, pm for link if you like). Dupers, and people who accepted obviously duped gold/matterials are still in game. A lot of the materials also are still laying around.\n\nWelp, go see for yourself if you like.","August 31, 2015","false","0.3"," 87 of 166 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","87","166","3","8"

I instantly fell i n love with it. Its everything I was looking for. Open world Massivley Multiplayer open World Full loot PvP and etc. You can pratiucally do whatever you wan't in the game. When I tell people about mortal I normally tell them "It's like Skyrim, but 10more content, no quests and WAY more fun, oh... and all multilplayer." You can do so much in this game and its really astonishing. But the fact that it came out in 2010 doesnt phase me, it just makes me sad that until not, the community is just stating to grow, and getting more recognishion. I feel like this game has so much potential that it will become the "best selling game of 2016". And im not joking. I love this game so much that I used to play about 6hrs every day, and me being me, not wanting to pay a dime, created not one, not two, but three Free-2-Play accounts, and for those of you that dont understand what a big deal that is, well, you can only log into one F2P account a day. But since I have 3computers its fine. If I were a new player looking for some information on how to get started in game, i'd say making a footfighter/mage first or a hybrid. That is definately the most fun way to play as a F2P. Now back to the praising, If your descision on buying a game is based on reading reviews, then get this, If you look at the reviews that have been written, just notice, just notice the amount of time they have played the game, almost everyone that has written a review on this game has probably played over 300 hrs! And if you look at the ones that are positive to be exact, some (like me) Has played over 1000hrs!!! Now why would someone play a game that sucks for 1000hrs ?? Ask yourself that question.\nTHIS GAME IS A MUST DOWNLOAD!\n\nMy IGN's so far are:\nXYT\nUltric\nGatorade","May 26","true","029.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I love the game and I like how your FREE to choose what you want to do.\n\nThe reason why there as many negative reviews as there are is because those players have been trapped in a bubble created by the other game makers. They don't know how to play these kinds of games where it takes thinking and they get frustrated and cry.\n\nI give this game the highest rating not because of graphics or how smooth it is or any of that stuff but because the game is a hidden gem and get to be creative and if I die in a harsh world then I get to LEARN from my mistakes and CREATE a new plan. Just the Theme of this game alone gets the highest rating.\n\nYou want a great game with lots of choices to do? Then you will like this game. Want a game where the developers care about their game? This game has awesome developers who communicate with the players and are always trying to make it run as smooth as possible all while continuing to grow and expand not just in game size but in features and fun!\n\n10/10 love cooking breakfast then finding a campfire and fellowship wih a few friends before going on my mid morning patrol :)","May 20","true","245.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You can progress in anyway you want to gain fortune and fame, from fishing, to crafting, cooking or becoming a PVP monster or PVE God for soloing a Ratzar Queen.\n\nYou level your character's skills in a classless way that determines how you want to play rather than simply getting stronger through grinding. This allows PVE and PVP to be geared towards skill and grouping with others to achieve success.\n\nThis game is first person only but it works to its advantage, to bring a game that's more immersive than any other MMORPG since Ultimate Online.\n\nThe community is small but this works to its advantage because everyone is in the same world, on the same server and your actions WILL be remembered by other players. If you start pickpocketing, players will remember your name and try to avoid you in the future. This also means interactions are more personal and political alliances in this game actually make an impact in the way you play, down to what towns you should avoid and who you feel you can trust to talk to.\n\nThis game has managed to implement concepts (player-created items only and a balanced player-driven marketplace for example) and take them to a level that other MMORPGs can only dream of achieving. This is impressive since the development team are only 3-4 man strong.\n\nIf you're a fan of Ultima Online, Runescape or other hardcore MMORPGs for their full loot-drop and criminal systems then Mortal Online is the king of them at the moment. Only time will tell if other games on the horizon will knock MO off its pedestal, such as Life is Feudal, Gloria Victis or Chronicles of Elyria.\n\nThe game isn't without its flaws though. The dev team is small so major improvements take a long time. There are bugs and exploits that you will discover once you really get into the game. Fortunately they're not quite enough to stop me from playing.\n\nMy biggest bugbears with the game at the moment are:\n\n* Lag spikes while crossing node lines\n* Mobs sitting on node lines being invincible\n* Blue text exploiting (Members of another guild that you're warred against can leave their guild and attack you without you knowing they're an enemy because their name text is blue instead of orange).\n* Characters or pets getting stuck in the environment. Most of the time the /stuck command will get you out though.\n* Most of the GMs are unhelpful. For example, report someone for blue text exploiting and they won't get punished.","May 25","true","444.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's the new griefing and this game is full of it.  Don't let everyone full you.  It'll be days, maybe weeks before you see any actual PVP action.  This game is all about Blueblocking, which is when you swing at a pig, skeleton, etc but a player jumps in your way at the last second and you end up hitting them, oops!  My bad bro, but no then you find out they actually did that on purpose because now you've just been labeled a criminal and EVERYONE will instantly gank you and take everything on your body, including your body (to butcher, eat, craft, whatever), which is funny the first few times it happens, but the humor doesn't last.  Usually the person blueblocking you doesn't even need your stuff.  They just want to grief low level players for no good reason (makes them feel big I guess).\n\nAnyway, until the game finds some way to remove the worst form of griefing I've ever seen I'm not playing it and won't recommend anyone else to either.  All you're going to do is end up a blueblocker yourself.

The PvP takes time to be astounding at and able to fent on your own.  The social interaction and population is fun at times, but at other times, the community can be toxic and annoying. The PvE in this game has wide-variety to different animals, or creatures, but lacks fundamental ideas of challenging an experienced opponent. PvE can take time to get use and understand it completely, but once you master PvE it can be a walk in the park.\n\nThis game will not hold your hand and spoon feed you gameplay. This game will make you get on your knees and pick the wolf brush you so badly need.\n\nIf I had to give you honestly decision whether to play this game, or not. I would recommend to try this game until you completely understand the game mechanics and gain somewhat of foot holding in Mortal Online. Trust me, There is no chance of you just hopping right into the game and being amazing at Mortal Online.

I came into the game knowing if you die with things on you, you will likely never see those things again and I was fine with that. Then I found out after playing a couple hours that a single hit from a player will kill you and that was the end of that for me. This game is not skill based in the slightest simply because of that reason and it kills the fun. Hey just spent hours farming a certain area and are now overloaded so going to drop some things in your inventory and head back? Dead, without even knowing how. Going to look inside your bank to get some things out? Dead, oh but the guards killed your killer so don't mind that you lose everything on you still.\n\nArchery gameplay is horrible, they tried to add in arrow drop to make it more "realistic' my arrow can fly a foot before it will hit the ground not to mention it doesn't even come out where the aim marker is. Taming is a really cool idea, your pets die the moment you get them so now thats gone. The world looks like ♥♥♥♥, people can say all they want "games don't need good graphics" but hell ya mmorpg really really really do. It's not enjoyable when half of your play time is spend wandering around twiddling your thumbs looking at ♥♥♥♥ untill you get to the destination. I still don't know how to revive could look it up but the fact that they don't tell me in game just tells me they don't want me to play. Why its not automatic the world will never know.\n\nIf only these survival games would stop doing the crap you lose everything if you die and just implement a player bounty system these games would be played more often, be more enjoyable, be a lot better. Anyone that bothers to tell me "you got hit in the head" I really don't care this is a game not real life you can't sacrifice mandatory game mechanics just because you want to make it more realistic. If I am unable to react to some random stranger hitting me because I die from one shot that means I am unable to play the main part of the game.","March 27","false","2.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","1"

I really do.  It has semi-retro graphics which I actually like, the progression of skills isn't handed out easily, and it really makes you figure things out (which can be a little annoying at times).  For me the game really captured the feeling of open world exploration as danger is around every single blade of grass and tree however it has been spoiled by the, in my opinion, overly amount of PKing going on.  I know it is a Hardcore PK type game.  I get that entirely and I tried to embrace it.  But the amount of blue blocking and zerg mentality in the game make it hard to believe that this is a truly believeable breathing world.  It's hard enough to time your attacks with the way enemies seem to move through your character and sometimes possess the same space, making it extremely difficult to even get a kill in without having to run and rest.  I witnessed a group of people enter a crypt only to have them get jumped by several undead (which was truly cool to witness in the retro way it is delivered).  Instead of rallying together two fought side by side while the third attempted to kill the other two in an attempt to fully loot them, while the forth ran past me outside.  And it is contagious, even I would jump on a helpless player due to the extreme lifestyle the game provides.  I even bought a second character slot for a crafting type toon to support my warrior.  So your option is to buy skill books and wait several days of real life time to pass (which does pass while logged off as well).  But I want to PLAY the game not log in, click a book, log off and wait.  It's almost like you need to wait a month offline until your toon is done reading an entire library of crap in order to stand a chance.  Guess it's back to waiting for me.\n\n\n\nTLDR version:  Awesome game, challenging and fun.  Wish the game had a PvE server for players who wished to explore the game without having to fear of high end players running them down on horseback.  The only real option to level up your skills is to purchase books and log off while your character reads them.  Really takes the "skill" out of skilling up. Combat needs improvement.  It's been out 5 years now.  It is what it is.","September 13, 2015","false","20.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

Just confusing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t names with actual class roles buried in pointless, wordy text walls.\n\nIt then has me pick my grandparents races in a rather cool race creation system accompanied by a really cool [albeit poorly animated] visual effect of your character being molded from stone.\n\nI click the next line in the creation and it undoes all the previous lines choices... W/e I click accept and once again the game goes "♥♥♥♥ you buddy!" and defaults my stats and looks, killing a really good stat role I got.\n\nI finally log into the game and am unable to look around. After a minute or two of walking back and forth in straight lines im met with a tutorial message telling me to hit "Z" to leave mouse mode. I do this and begin to walk around.\n\nAnother message pops up prompting me to hold shift in order to run. If regular walk has a speed of 1.0, the sprint is 1.09. I cant actually tell if you even go faster.\n\nThe next message tells me to hit "I" and equip a sword. So I hit "I", the inventory box pops up but my mouse is trapped in a tiny little box in the center of my screen. So, unable to use said inventory I hit "I" to close the box but im still in "mouse mode". Apparently it was too complex to automate look mode when you close dialog boxes.\n\nI decide to attempt my first quest with my bare hands. I run up to a horribly modeled and textured pig[?] and begin to punch it in what I can only assume was its ugly ♥♥♥♥ing face. It turned to me took a swing [and missed] then took a step back and reset. I repeated this about 15 times.\n\nI tried once again to equip my weapon, but the game wasnt having it.\n\n\n\nMaybe not the best idea to release your game when the first 10 minutes comes with more bugs and glaring issues than most games have in their entirety.\n\n\n\n","September 15, 2015","false","0.2"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","15","27","4","0"

( To a degree)\n\nThis is a sizable and honest List, many people will get hung up on these issues and I don't blame you, though before you cast your hammer down in judgement, just hear me out.\n\nThe Pros:\n-Sandbox - Freedom is Nice\n-Crafting Is incredibly complex ( Some Professions more than others)\n-The PvP is intense and a blast. ( Full loot adds that adrenaline, you really feel that risk of losing your hard work during the fight)\n- No Levels, just skills that are trained through use or passively by reading.\n-Interesting politcal scene. (Large groups of people, limited resources, open PvP, all makes Server wars a common thing.)\n-One server ( Diverse fun playerbase despite the bad fruit, I havent met a more interesting smathering of players. Does -playing with Aussies, Germans, Swedes, Brits, Spaniards, Brazilians, Irishmen, and Canadians all in the same Team speak sound fun. Does to me)\n-A dedicated developer who keeps chugging away ( The little Starvault that could)\n- Being a trader and crafter is completely viable (Though you'd be missing a sizable portion of the game)\n- No other game quite like it. (It's why I keep returning)\n- In the end the Games world is shaped by the players.\n- Game lore is pretty decent.\n\nDespite the games shortcomings, I've had some of my fondest gaming memories on here and have met some of the coolest people too. Sure being a new player is harsh and I reccomend you find a good honest group of people to help you learn. There are many people in the game who will make your life hell, you will cuss and scream but in the end if you work hard enough,  play smart  and make quality friends, you can accomplish some pretty neat things.\n\nTL;DR\nGames is mediocre, The expereinces you'll have playing it, Priceless.\n","September 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","22","41","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arohs/recommended/287920/","arohs","Arohs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arohs/","80 products in account","I'm a huge fan of mmo's. I've played many ranging from Ultima Online to Wildstar to Darkfall. This game is not for everyone, and it certainly warrants having mixed reviews. However, I love this game! Why? I love open world pvp, exploration and sandbox. There is no map in this game. The tutorial is very brief and no one holds your hand. If I were new to the mmo scene I'd be intimidated by the lack of direction and large scale chaos. There are 8 major cities with guards to protect you, outside of this most every structure in the game is player made. Entire areas have been won by coalitions of guilds working together to war with rival guilds. There are player made maps online with a live feed for recent conflicts and territory/resource disputes. Players can build houses wherever but these houses can be looted and destroyed by other players. When you die, your loot is left to be looted provided you're not in an area protected by guards or your allies. So you pretty much will lose everything on your person but  you can store it safely in the bank. This game is hardcore. Loss of loot, theft murder, no map. There's something called 'blue blocking' where people jump in front of your swing so you're marked as a criminal; you're then murdered and they take your stuff. So watch your surroundings and be smart. The game is first person and free to play up to a level 60/100 cap in skills ranging from taming and breeding animals to mounted combat to jump, etc. The variety of skills reminds me of runescape. I've already subscribed to have access to thieving skills and to move past that level cap on skill, because I love the game. The community is not toxic. The community is harsh and unforgiving, to an extent. Old players aren't in the newbie zones, this game has been around since 2010 so they're off yonder lost to the gossip of us newcomers. The occasional raid of murderers come through to eliminate newbies at the first mob spawns, but experienced whiteknight players step in to police the area. This game functions on your reputation and your worth. If you spend your time stuck grinding in the graveyard and think that's all this game is, you've only scratched the surface. This game is brutal but rewarding. If you like high risk and high reward this game's for you. Expect to be irritated, but be patient, you will have to invest your time. This game is not for everyone. But if you like the idea of a hardcore open world sandbox where some play fair and others don't care and everyone's fighting for what they want or their guild, get involved and learn to play. You'll have to read about where to go and what to do elsewhere, this game does not hold your hand at all. But I love that. There's the thrill of hiding from players hunting you, and carrying torches into a dark dungeon, hoping the zombies don't swarm you when you can't see them coming. Check it out. If you have no experience with mmos, you'll likely be overwhelmed. If you hate pvp, don't even play this game. You will be fighting for you and your group's survival in a world of vicious and ruthless killers. Compassion does exist though. Make friends and keep them. It's dangerous to travel alone.","September 7, 2015","true","33.7"," 29 of 55 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","29","55","0","0"

Keep in mind that as a F2P player this is my experience. I cant discuss every aspect but here are some that really got to me and made my impression of the game.\n\nPvP: lets start with PvP since its at the core of the game. If you dont like PvP, dont even bother. you cant avoid it.\n\n+ you can kill anyone and anyone can kill you. Its exciting to murder someone and take all their stuff and then hide so other players dont kill you. There is a criminal system in the game. if you hit somebody you are flagged as a criminal and the guards will kill you. The players are encouraged to kill the criminals for their loot as looting an innocent makes you a criminal. Killing criminals is fun.\n\ni havent experience group fights so i dont know how that works.\n\n- as a F2P player, its GG. P2P murderers come around kill you instantly and there is nothing you can do about it. As a F2P, your skills are capped at 60/100 which is incredibly weak.\n\n- The game claims the combat is skill based. Its not true AT ALL. The game lags so much people hit you from 10 meters away with their back turned. Timing your blocks is almost impossible as the lag makes it so you always block too late.\n\n- Exploitable. Everyone is "blueblocking" which is to run in front of somebody as he is swinging his weapon to be hit by accident, turning the victim into a criminal. the blueblocker can now freely kill the victim and take all his stuff. This is a really easy way to get gear early on. i found that almost everyone is doing it.\n\n- The rich players are some of the most rotten people ive ever met in-game, especially subscribers that you find in the beginner areas. These hypocrites will gladly defend victims of blueblocking yet the same people turn around and kill you for no reason. Avoid the geared players like the plague. Leave the beginner town as soon as you can. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ruin all the fun.\n\nPvE: the pvp is bad, surely the PvE is better right?... right?\n\n+ You can train your skills by killing pigs.\n\n- The PvE is so bad. So so bad. Monsters will hit you from 10 meters away, follow you to the other side of the map and will even swim through a river to get you. You cannot evade attacks. Monsters will always hit you no matter what you do. All you can do is attack and block the best you can. Boring and difficult. No skill involved.\n\nOpen World:\n\n+ This game has an epic open world. No loading screen, nothing. While dated, the graphics look really good and you can spend alot of time just admiring the landscape and the environment. Creatures are scattered around the world for you to discover. The world is also filled with player made cities which is really cool since it makes the world feel alive. I didnt get to explore the new desert continent, but ive heard its cool too.\n\n- i cant really think of anything bad about the game world really other that it has no map. it has that old feel to it like those weird games where you never knew where you were going because you were too young to understand how a compass works. Im kind of mixed on this one.\n\nCrafting:\n\n+ its really cool. I love that everything is player made. The beginner gear can be bought at the merchant but its kind of crap anyways. For those who like the hardcore experience, the crafting system is very complicated. just to make an armor, you need a few materials and its not clear how to obtain them.\n\n+ while getting the materials you need to craft good gear is really hard judging by the amount of campers and killers around, it really gives you a goal, something to do in the game. You want to go get your epic armor and brag about it. maybe kill a few people you know.\n\n- Good luck getting the good materials on your own. you have to find the materials which are not close to town and come back with it hoping you dont get killed.\n\nGeneral experience:\n\nThis game has a great potential. Its actually fun when you meet a bunch of people and go on an adventure. I went with a group to a different town and some guy gave all of us some really cool armor. We rode horses and overall was really fun. But these experiences are limited. you wont always find friends to do stuff. And the items you get, youll lose them to a pker or a random dude will jump in front of your sword.\n\nWhile the idea and the mechanics are really cool, this game is one of the most unpolished mmos ive ever played. The UI is awkward and buggy. The server disconnects you often and you die. People often walk through walls or walk on water. you can hit people offscreen due to lag or weird animations.\n\nI know this is a really small dev team, but this is no excuse for having a game so buggy and unpolished as this.\n\nFinal verdict: TL;DR dont subscribe.\n\ni like this game. it really has alot of potential. I tried my best to have fun and do stuff, but its really had and the F2P limitations and overall gameplay and quality this game offers is bad. Even if i were a subscribed player, the game is a mess and there is nothing to do other than kill F2P noobs.\n\nOverall this game feels like its in Beta. It was released 5 years ago and the state the game is does not warrant a 15$ monthly subscription.","September 3, 2015","false","114.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The PvP is aim-based and even tho gear plays its part, a skilled veteran will outplay a group of beginners, not because of superior gear or higher level, but from pure skill.\n\nI love how there are no levels or classes. You choose what skills to learn by actually doing them or by reading books and you can choose between hundreds of skills to build a unique character.\n\nThe crafting system is absolutly huge. You can combine almost any weaponhead on any handletype and craft it out of any material you find. Players constantly discover new weapons and armors to counter whatever is the currently most popular gear. You just might find a way to craft a better armor or weapon then anyone else has found yet.\n\nThe Full loot aspect can be frustrating if you die transporting valuables, but that means you can also find good loot from killing other players. As a veteran player I have learned a few tricks to stay safe when I want to.\n\nMortal Online is by far the best MMO Ive ever played and I recommend it to everyone. Just remember that its a hardcore game and you will need to stay on your toes every second of it.\n\nPS, Did I mention it has full nudity?","September 1, 2015","true","715.0"," 35 of 67 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","35","67","2","0"

This game has very intense moment to some very dull moments. atm the population from steam release has dropped to a sweet spot of 300 to 500 and all the problems from server restarts and long queue join times is nonexistant. there are many bugs that need addressing from random character animations (on horse mainly) and npcs being able to walk through walls and shoot you from inside of them.\nPros: hard and gritty\ngreat community(with a couple of griefers)\nfull loot drop\nmany variations character classes(build to your playstyle)\nplayerskilled based\nroleplay friendly\ncan eat own head\n\nCons:needs some rebalancing\nsteep learning curve(though i liked it)\nold engine\nglitches\nthe random and occasional griefers(when i say griefers i mean priest spawn killers or vets prerying in GY)\n\ni give this game 7/10\nits my type of game but many wont/cant appreciate the hard and grittyness of this game.\nTLDR; darksouls mmo but with glitches and a economy system\n","November 25, 2015","true","447.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

It is a hardcore game with a strong focus on player skill and pvp. Were you good at pvp is WoW? Well, almost none of those skills will transfer over.\n\nThis game's is best described as the old ultima online but in 3d (before the felucia tram split). You can be attacked ANYWHERE!!!! In towns you do have guards that will save/avenge you but it is always a risk. There is a thieving system so getting you pockets picked is a real risk. There are tamers, mages, dominators, warriors and any combination thereof. You get to decide what skills you train and what you dont.\n\nPro's\nVery hard gameplay\nVery in depth mechanics\nvisually on par with most games out now,\nDoes not take massive ammounts of hours to do anything fun,\nExcellent combat system\n\nCon's\nBugs. Some of which have been around for a while from what i understand\nVery Hard Gameplay (belonged in both because it limits who joins the game)\n\n\nThat about wraps it up. I've been playing for about 1 week and already have 92 hours into it.\n\nCheers\nJander","November 21, 2015","true","359.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

I havent spent 400 hours in the game, explored hlvl content, etc..\nI just created a toon, and tested the game a bit...\nAnd already, I can feel it wont be on my HDD much longer.\n\n1) Its ugly. Graphics are dated, thats a given. But thats just "technical". Here, its dated, but its also not very appealing. Art direction is just... Well... Meh. I guess it was all the "Medieval is supposed to look dirty and ragged" trend. But it fails at that.\n2) Its unstable. Crashed already 3 times. Lags, freezes.\n3) Two minutes in game and I already have a ♥♥♥♥♥ stealing my loot repeatedly (dont worry, I'll follow you too and steal your loot... well I would have if the game hadnt crashed :p ).\n4) Gameplay... Well, it feels clunky. I'm just swinging a sword at pigs, and it feels like... Well, like my character doesnt know the pointy end from the other, for one (but that would actually be nice if it was a feature... except I fear its not). And like I'm clicking a mouse. Charging a hit doesnt feel like anything. It all feels hollow and clunky.\n\nThere's some good too.\nI like the idea of raising stats by doing things (run and your stamina increases, hit and your strength goes up, etc.). I liked it in Dungeon Siege too.\nI like the character creation and how ascendance and things like age affect your stats. Even if its not always very clear.\n\nBasically... I'll try again, to see if its just the first hour that feels like that... If the city looks better... etc.. But I still feel like theres much better in the F2P world...\n","September 13, 2015","false","1.9"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

Seemed like something new and fun. spent a few minutes creating the account (because of the frankly bad account fields i need to fill in. Why would they need my address?) and got to the login screen. Typed in my deets and then i got a "connecting to Mortal Online Servers" for about 5-10 minutes to which it suddenly disappeared without anything happening. Keeping me at the login screen. So pressed login again, which came out with a different message. This is where it got bloody annoying as I had to spam the "cancel" and "login" button about 243 times before i got a new (exciting) message saying "loading character data". I was actually ready to play the game! but then i woke up and realised that i had spent 2 hours repeatedly clicking login to get to this one message WHICH BROUGHT ME BACK TO THE LOG IN SCREEN. so i quit after a while and came back to it. This time i logged in and it was all dandy and i quite enjoyed the character creation (although the character faces look strange) and the edition of this Ancestry thingy-majig where i can decide what my character will look like through my grandparents and parents race.

I will say if you can get past the starting area and join a guild.  This will be one the best gaming experiences of your life.  The game is very hardcore, there are a LOT of people griefing new players.  There is a reason for this though, the idea of the game is that you arent safe anywhere.  You may get killed and you might get griefed but the fact is if you manage to play the game for 30 hours or longer you will be well established enough that you will have multiple sets of gear.\n\nPros of the game:\n-True Sandbox\n-Open-World PvP\n-Crafting system is very in-depth\n-PvP is skill based\n-PvE is skill based\n-Game is actively being improved by developers\n\nCons of the game:\n-Trolls trolling new players\n-Has some bugs and glitches, but none game-breaking\n-Game is virtually unplayable solo\n-Development team can be a bit slow on releasing patch notes\n\nI hope all of you manage to get past the beginning zone and start enjoying this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heeroneko/recommended/287920/","heeroneko","Heeroneko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heeroneko/","122 products in account","This game is a good way to waste time. You might enjoy playing it for awhile but there's not much to do. Most of the gameplay is horribly designed. A lot of the textures look like they just paid for stock images. The combat is very clunky and attack telegraphing is ridiculously bad. Bugs bugs bugs everywhere, including hair textures that still, after 6 years, haven't been fixed. Movement is so slow that it's more fun to run around when you're dead. I'm not joking, when you're dead it's so much easier to move around that being alive feels like wading through quicksand in comparison. Generally speaking, this game is a chore and it's even worse if you play solo. If you decide to play, I highly suggest you join a guild so you actually have a community to interact with outside of the temporary help chat. This game is very much a sandbox when it comes to the question of 'wtf do I do'. Guilds help a lot with giving you a clear goal and providing a motivation for pvping.\n\nTo be fair, the main draw is the pvp. I haven't voluntarily participated in that much yet...by which I mean I've just been randomly murdered a bunch. Oh, by the by, there is no real penalty for murder until you've reached the lvl of a serial killer which to me makes no sense whatsoever, but hey, I'm sure the murderers enjoy it. If you want to seriously get into pvp, I highly recommend a guild. In fact guilds are one of the game's few saving graces, though there are plenty of bugs and other problems going on in that respect too. Outside of pvp however, there's the crafting.\n\nThe crafting system is passable and has some interesting aspects to it with how materials affect the appearance and stats of crafted items. However, you have to dedicate a character to crafting for it to really be worth your time. You CAN make a hybrid sure, but, because this game DOES have traditional lvling in the sense that the more you do what you do the higher your stats go, up to a cap, you will be gimped compared to a min/maxing player.\n\nStats are very important. Do not let people tell you that it's skill based and your stats don\'t matter. Stat differences determine your health, stamina, and mana as well as your movement speed, attack speed, damage, combat move speed, move speed while using armor, swimming speed, mount speed, etc etc. See a trend? Your skill as a player is limited by what your character is actually capable of. AKA it doesn't matter how good the player is when your character moves like a slug in comparison and does a fraction of the damage.\n\nUltimately it's your equipment that's most important in determining how much damage you actually do, but you CAN win with skill using crappier gear if your stats are comparible. Blocking/parrying is important but your gear and stats also affect how well you can do those too, so they won't save you against a character with better gear and stats. Damage potential is not nearly as important as movement ability. If your movement speed was determined soley by gear instead of stats maybe combat could be properly balanced, as of right now though, whoever's stats are higher and has better gear is usually going to win over skill. In that respect, this game is very much an RPG. There's nothing wrong with games that put character skill over player skill. The problem is that this game is not presented that way so you go in expecting something very different from what you actually get.\n\nAll this talk of stats brings up one of this game's main issues.  MO is guilty of one of the problems F2P games are most criticized for. It is P2W. You could argue that the free to play option is actually just a trial, but that doesn't change that there is a 40% stat difference between a free and subbed player. This game is not listed as a demo on steam, it is listed as a free to play game. Unless that suddenly changes, to say it's just a 'trial' version is a fallacy. It's true that the game is free of the cash shop aspect, techinically. Instead, players receive special items and perks if they donate enough. Sounds a little sketchy right?\n\nTL;DR\nBasically, this a fun game to ♥♥♥♥ around in if you like exploring and hardcore rping pvp, but in the long run it's not worth your time. If you join up with a guild you could definitely spend hundreds of hours pvping, rping, and exploring, but it can feel more like a job than fun times with friends. I do not recommend this game for the average gamer. It is for hardcore pvp players only. I don't mean that as a compliment. I mean that only hardcore players will be wiling to put up with all the game's crushing flaws out of desperation to find a game that provides an immersive sandbox rp/pvp environment.","June 1","false","76.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xyagom/recommended/287920/","Xyagom","Xyagom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xyagom/","85 products in account","When looking at this game, keep an open mind. ITS NOT LIKE OTHER MMOS. People will kill you, people will grief you, you will get blue blocked (Players step in front of you making your flag to turn grey allowing guards to kill you.) and there will be no consequences. Its your job to learn and adapt to the hardcore environment. Dont just give up!!\n\nThe game revolves around completely skill/timing based combat similar to that of Chivalry medieval warfare.\n\nWith a flagging system mirroring SAO (Sword Art Online) - Blue Players are lawful and are aloud in towns. Grey players have recently commited a crime and can be killed without consequence. Red players, are your average day Thugs and Murderers who have completely devoted themselfes to ♥♥♥♥ing with your ♥♥♥♥, and ruining your day.\n\n--------THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS LEVELING--------\nSkill Trees similar to that of skyrim. You have to train skills up by using them rather then by leveling up. There is a point cap meaning that you have to train your points wisely. This is how mortal earns its money, It requires membership to fully max out a certain perk. For example, if your training a swordskill as Non-mem you can only raise it to effective level 60, A member can raise it fully to 100. There is lots of arguement as to whether or not this is pay to win, but a game has to make money some how, and in my opinion you can still manage as a Non-Mem.\n\nIf your okay with these systems, and fine with extremely hardcore mechanics, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND giving this game a decent chance. You may come to find something you truly enjoy.\n-Lost","December 13, 2015","true","389.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxsusmaximus/recommended/287920/","maxsusmaximus","Valmennax Supremacy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxsusmaximus/","60 products in account","I've been searching for a MMORPG like this for few years. Until I stumble over this great game on STEAM. Alright, if you're hardcore player looking for some ultra-realistic MMO, Mortal Online is your best choice! A lot of people complain that this game is harsh, community is awful and etc. But let me tell you the truth, the community in this game is helpful, kind and always willing to lend their hands to the starter. I have to admit that the beginning town is harsh, and the community is quite toxific. But after you join a guild and get out from there, you can truly experience all the potential this game offers.\n\nSome of the features:\nThis game use a mount & blade / chivalry style combat system. Apart from that, you lost all your items on dead. This game is fixed to a FPS view, to maximise the immersion. There's no leveling system, all your gameplay revolve around your skills, and all skills become better as you use them, or read a book (remember to read reading when you start playing, lol). There's a overall skill level cap for each character, which is 1100. The purpose of this cap is to limit down the things can be done by one person and promote player interactions. In real life, you can never be a master smith and master swordman at the same time, if u focus on something, you wont be good at the other things, but if u learn everything, you wont be very good in everything. This game is not mission based, and dont expect the dev. to tell you anything, you have to discover them yourself. The only things they tell you is through the tutorial basic. There's a lot of player made village and town in this game, some with such beautiful scenario that you will thought it's a pre-made town.\n\nMoreover, the history, the society, the "politics" are written by the players themselves! This is a true open world game, a true player interactive game, all the events are relevant to players action. Maybe today, the gamers focus on the attainment and gameplay more than this. It's been a while that i find a game like this, where players will just sit down, sharing their story, tell them what they had been gone through, the place that they went to, instead of grinding and leveling, flaming , arguing like what we did in other typical MMO's today.\n\nThis game doesnt have a map, but you have a compass (luckily), and you have sun, there's day night cycle. No interbanking in thsi game, that's mean the items you save in one city will never "magically" end up in the other city, no internet transaction at medieval age bro.\n\nApart from that, there's a lot of secrets in this game, trust me. There's still a lot of unexplored areas, undiscovered secrets, like few years past then the players discovered the Kimura, the thunder eggs. The developers had put in a lot of efforts in crafting this world, and its own secrets. As well as the lost history of a civlization call Scinx-something ( it's the Atlantic of Nave, Mortal Online World). I won't tell you there's a secret village hidden up on a snowy mountain, and i won't tell you there's some huge secrets in a cave off the cliffs. I won't tell you there's a hidden formula written in Sindorian in Sator Dungeon that's still unsolve today.\n\nCome and discover it yourself! In Mortal Online, everyone write their own history! In this game, it's not like you can only be a fighter, a warrior, an explorer is a role, a crafter is a role, a tamer is a role, and there's a lot others! And all of them, being bond together and create the world of Nave, Mortal Online!\n\nP/S: Just a reminder, beware of blue-blockers!","October 13, 2015","true","94.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

BUT thats not all there is to this game. its not all about pvp, even if many people feels that way. i personally love crafting. i still havent gone into the dungeons but i want to, there are special monsters around that are uncommon, boss monsters even. i was actually suprised to know that there are actually equipment that you can only get from drops (previously thought everything was only crafted)\n\nyou dont get everything handed to you in the beginnning. there are ALOT to learn. but go into the forums and search abit. there are guides for new players, for crafting, for building certain builds. there are people that just feels like sharing what they learned that day. there are alot of nice people playing as well. many people who have faced the problems with red and grew to be able to fight them. they know some tricks and they have resources to help. find some guilds to join, there are a quite a bit of players willing to help. because it will benefit them if there are more players too. more people to play with, adventure with. slay monsters and hunt bosses with.\n\nthe hardest thing i found in this game is the fact that it really is up to you to learn, grown and develop your character and play style. you cant stay ignorant in this game, that is what kills you.\n\nim no vet, but im up to help new players. because its a nice dream of mine to lead a hunting group around, fight off some reds, go dungeoneering. bring a nice fresh air to this game that has staled because people keeps getting scared off.\n\ntry it. got nothing to lose, its not like you HAVE to suscribe. im f2p player and im enjoying myself. xP","October 18, 2015","true","742.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

After giving it a few days on a free account I have to recommend the game to anyone who likes the basic game mechanics of a zombie survival game; that you can kill or be killed almost anywhere and the "story" is up to you to make up. If you like to be kept mainly on rails and given quests you will not like the game, but if you like to just wander off and do what ever you want you will have a blast.\nIt is not however perfect, there is some lag in places (if you can cache the game in the options window), there are PKers everywhere and there is NO hand holding. Other than a very basic tutorial on how to move, tame, kill, and craft a robe you are on your own. I would suggest to anyone starting out that you read some basic guides on game mechanics so you have a better starting grasp of the game. Other than that there is not much more to tell from how little I have played, I will edit if anything changes or comes up.","September 18, 2015","true","114.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

After about an hour of connecting i finally played the game. The tutorial is very short and you quickly get thrust into questing. The running at low levels seems a bit far and stamina drains very quickly(you need this to sprint). As a scout you are given 25 arrows, these arrows do not seem to be retrievable after you shoot them and do not do much damage. After killing maybe 3 "walkers" which were the first true enemy (excluding pigs) i was already out of arrows and had to revert back to the sword i was given. I might try to go back into the game with a new character and reset and not go scout. but atm the game is very difficult and didnt seem to be that much fun. Its free so if you want try it, but i dont recommend it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you see my play time, that is the amount of time i have spent trying to connect to the game.\nI would love to speak about what is actually in the game but due to not being able to log in i cant.\nEach time i log in it tells me i have a 3 minute queue. so i wait. then it goes to 5 minutes. so i wait. then it goes to 4 minutes. so i wait. 30 seconds later it decides to close that menu and leaves me on the login page and i have to press login for the next attempt at playing.\n\nWorst queue simulater 2012","September 3, 2015","false","1.3"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","23","45","0","0"

Since i found Mortal Online i havent realy played any other Online games, maybe tryed them out for a bit but nothing held my attention as long as this game.\n\nWhat is Mortal Online?\nits an mmorpg full loot true real open world sandbox game. you can do whatever you want. you have no classes you make your own class with the skill points that are provided.\nthink of it as Ultima Online but in 3d (Henrik the CEO is acctualy a real fan of Ultima Online and you will see alot of similarities towrds Ultima Online)\n\nyou are nowhere safe even in town with guards its possible if your smart to kill you, or yes steal stuff from people what they have in there inventory. you got free house placement in the world. no instances just one huge world!!!!\n\nthis is not your typical theme-world game where you point click bash your keyboard and hit nrs to win. your skill truly matters, you need to block, and acctualy hit the person with your weapon.\n\nso kinda like skyrim if ultima online doesnt ring a bell.\n\ni want to point out they are a indie company, so it does have bugs but trust me since iv played it alot of people who might have quiet came back because there is truly no other game out there like this.\n\nanother thing is please do not say its pay to win, this is a game where you have to have an subscription, but it gives you the option to TRY THE GAME OUT FOR FREE FOR AN UNLIMITED TIME!!!!!\n\nyou are a bit restricted when it comes to skilling your toon so instead getting 100 in a skill you can only get 60, while once your pay to play it will go up to 100. if you decide to take a break its no problem, once you resub all your skills go back to 100.\n\nif you want a true skill game where you can do whatever you want, acctualy aim and fight like in skyrim and dont mind full loot (whatever you have on you when the person kills you its theres) than this is the game for you.\n\ni also want to point out to people who might think ehhhhhhhhh what?!!! i will loose everything i have one me?!!!!?!? nooooooo, never!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nstuff to get in this game is not as hard like in other games for example World of Warcraft where you have to grind hrs just to get 1 certain armor part. once you have your gold its no big deal if you loose stuff, just remember take with you only what you need.\n\nits really a game you havent seen before try it!!!!","August 31, 2015","true","030.2"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","25","49","0","0"

The short version: If you're into MMOs, this game is definitely something you should give a go, if only for its uniqueness. It plays like an Elder Scrolls game with a feudal Eve Online twist. As objectively as I can, I'd rate this game 85/100.\n\nThe Game-play\nThis is where Mortal Online shines.  The best Genre Tag to describe the game would be Hardcore MMO RPG. You can be killed anywhere by anyone. You'll drop everything you have on you when you die. And the best part? There is almost no hand holding for the entire experience. Mortal forces players to learn everything by trial and error. And I'm not only talking about game mechanics like how to fight or gather resources. I'm talking about things like crafting recipes and interaction with the game world. For one thing, there are no crafting recipes like you would expect in other games. There is no giant icon that tells you what item you will get for what resources. Not only can you craft the same thing with different materials, but you can use different amounts of those materials. And both of those things affect the final item stats and looks. That is to say of course, if your character even has the ability to tell the quality of your craft goods... Which brings me to my next point.\n\nCharacter Progression\nThere are no set classes or character levels in Mortal Online. The experience of your character is defined by the skills that he has learned. There are several hundred skills in the game. Skills are generally graded anywhere from 0 to 100 and they're also classified as primary and secondary. Every character has a maximum of 1100 skill points to use for primary skills. Secondary skills don't cost any points. Now the skills themselves influence everything you do. Your ability to run, to fight, to block and jump. Your ability to comprehend how good some armor or sword is. What the affects of a potion are. What nutrition a food item has. How much you can carry while swimming and still not drown. What animal you can manage to keep under control. The list goes on. There are literally HUNDREDS of skills. Your character even has a skill for breathing. No joke. And you can train all of them! If you can find a combination of skills that works for you, congratulations, you have your own "class".\n\nWorld and Game Content\nMortal Online has been out and available for several years. Its only had one expansion in that time. And yet its had a consistent and solid player-base the whole time. Do you want to know why? I think one of the main reasons is because nobody has "finished" it. That's right. In the years that the game has been out, not one person has gone through all the content the game has to offer. That's a very refreshing thing to hear, considering that other MMO that shall not be named has to keep releasing expansions every year just so its players have things to do. I can guess what you're thinking. "Oh, its probably a horrible grind-fest". No. Almost any one skill can be leveled to max in a day or so. The secret is that Mortal Online relies heavily on player knowledge and skill. Your own skill, not your characters. Did you ever read or watch a show about some magician or alchemist, that spends years locked away somewhere researching potent new potions that the world has never seen? Well, now is your chance to do exactly that. And please please, if you figure out how to get mana potions that don't kill the mages, I'll pay you everything I own for the recipe.\n\nThe negatives\nOutdated payment method. The game runs on an "forever trial" with a possible monthly subscription fee. F2P is only good to check the game out. The limitation is that skills are capped at 60 instead of 100. This is a huge limitation. You hit the ceiling after about a single day, and this prevents you from playing the game competitively. Otherwise, you are completely free to see and do anything you want. Skills caps don't stop you from doing anything, it's just that other players will be better at it.\nBugs. The game is too complex for its own good. The sheer amount of intricacy makes it near impossible to not have issues pop up here and there. Fear not, the bug report forums are quite active and the developers are, in general, responding to player issues.\nSteep learning curve. This is an enjoyable part of the game for me personally. There is something nostalgic about the game telling you very little and you having to figure stuff out by trial and error. However, the "modern player" might not see it this way, and thus the lack of things like minimaps and directional arrows on the screen will be seen as a negative for people.\nSlightly dated graphics. Once again, this is only from the perspective of your average current day player. Many people don't realize that when you can literally look around for miles, you can't expect to have photo realism. Having said that, the game doesn't look ugly. Its retro. Embrace it.\nNot to finish on a low note, I'd just like to make it perfectly clear for everyone: given the chance, Mortal Online will raise your bar for all MMO's you play after it. It's completely unsurprising that there are people who haven't played anything else since. And I'm really upset with myself that I didn't find out about it sooner.","September 1, 2015","true","140.6"," 26 of 51 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","26","51","0","2"

No skill caps, house creation, etc,.\n\nIt doesn't seem like much, but for a first person sandbox mmo, to declare itself as free2play, it should have all features unlocked, with some features limited in what they do.\n\nExample - House creation should be unlocked for EVERYONE.

While there still are bugs and some issues, the game is playable to a point where you can easily look past the bugs and minor things that occur due to the enjoyment that comes with playing this game.\n\nThis MMO is unique. It has a steep learning curve, 1st person only view, full loot, no safe/PvP zones, large world to explore, Great indepth alchemy/cooking and crafting system.  As a new player you will die a lot, this is a hardcore game where you can die anywhere, anyplace, so just soldier through the hardships, skill up your character and immerse yourself in this game, once you get past the rough beginning you'll start to see what this game has to offer from different land scapes to large scale PvP/sieges, to small group PvP to indepth cooking and crafting and different types of PvE content.\n\nWhile the NPC guided quest end at the tutorial, there are secrets to explore in the world and little missions that are like quest, so PvE content is there to explore and have fun with. You might have to kill some giant bug and collect its eyes for a rare book or kill a boss mob for a key to unlock a chest etc This game is not like your normal "theme park" mmo which will hold your hand almost through your whole experience, you will have to adapt to the new change of style in this game.\n\nThe community, Outsiders see it as toxic due to the hardened nature of the players. This community is small and everyone knows everyone, so competitiveness and trolling amongst the players is common as we know each other and maybe in rivaling guilds or be past enemies.

It's basically SAO / Morrowind / Rust. It's the game I've always wanted.\n\nEveryone who is being deterred by the negative reviews, please take some things into consideration before making your decision at face value.\n\n1 - have a look at the hours played by most of the negative reviewers. This is a hardcore sandbox game, can you really have any right to post a negative review after only playing a few hours? They've probably seen 0.001% of the game...\n\n2 - To the negative reviewers who have played it a bit more, please notice that they are complaining primarily about the freedom allowed to the "toxic" players. Let's think about that for a moment. They decided to play a open world sandbox mmo... and they want less freedom... Logic?\n\n3 - You control your experience in this game, in true sandbox fashion.\n\nNow, let's talk about number 3 for a moment.\n\nMy MO experience has been a rollercoaster of emotions. From developing PTSD brought about by the presence of possibly murderous surrounding players, to being given a full kit of armour by a kindly knight, this game is always smacking me in the face with surprises.\n\nI once partied with a fellow in the crypts underneath the Tindrum graveyard, and spent the entire time wondering if he was going to turn around and stab me in the back. Lo and behold, he actually saved me numerous times, and protected my loot when I had a clumsy death. I felt like I made a real connection with this dude. In a sea of murderers and vagabonds, I found a buddy to help weather the storm. This wasn't some random idiot who I had been forced to party with for some dumb dungeon quest for some dumb storyline that I don't give a crap about, this was a mateship bonded in a need to survive, and forged with our skills as players. There are plenty of other great experiences I've had, and the good ones far outweigh the bad.\n\n\nTLDR:\nYOU CONTROL YOUR EXPERIENCE. This game is your opportunity to play the way you've always wanted. The best part is, the game doesn't just give it to you... You must earn your right to thrive, and damn, it's satisfying when you do.","September 6, 2015","true","122.9"," 46 of 91 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","46","91","2","0"

So after i died i had no money, no reagents and all i could do was scavenge from the undead corpses.\n\nOne thing that made the best experience of the game so far was that i joined a group of people traveling to a city (one of them was streaming the journey) and then i got mauled by a dog and then the dog mauled everyone else.\n\nSo yes it can be a lot of fun but it can be one of the most frustrating and annoying games that you might ever play, but with a game like this its all a part of the experience and it is free after all so i would reccomend getting a few of your friends to download it with you and start playing as a group. :D Because it can be one of the best games you will play and will be a memorable experience\n\n\nPros:\n\n+Freeform sandbox gameplay - The game is what you make of it\n\n+Wide variety of skills to train (Up to 60 for free to play players)\n\n+Player driven Economy\n\n+Ability to craft a unique weapon out of so many different materials\n\n+Requires dedication to learning how to play the game\n\nCons:\n\n-May be confusing for new players at first\n\n-can be extremely frustrating due to griefers\n\n-Alot of planning must go into your character builds to get the most out of your character (you only get one as a free to play)\n\nImportant Note - The game is an unlimited trial rather than a true free to play experience.","September 6, 2015","true","19.1"," 52 of 103 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","52","103","2","1"

It's nice that developers are attempting a modernization of the Ultima Online style "living world" gameplay, but this is a very amateur attempt. The game itself is a clunky mess that no one with any shred of intelligence or standards in how they spend their time can envision playing for more than a few hours. It's so bad you'd swear the game was made in like 1998, and yet Ultima Online a game that came out around that time, actually runs better. The best thing about this is that you can play it for free to get an idea of how bad it is, but also inspire you that someone will eventually get the concept and the execution right.

A browser pops up and you type it in manually.\nAfter youve done that, you log in your account. The serverstructure is unknown,you join a server after you created a character.\nAs i mentioned before, the buttons are not responsive. I created the character and pressed the button to finalize, but it didnt let me.\nGoing back,i found my character suddenly standing there.\nAfter 3 attempts of login-errors, the game started. It loaded very slowly,took about 5 minutes.\nThe game wasnt taking any graphic-settings that i set in the settings of it before starting the game.\nIngame the framerate dropped after a few seconds to 1 picture in 5 seconds. I put everything on the lowest settings, still nothing (and this game is old unreal engine)\nI exited the settings, and suddenly my mousepointer of the menu was still in the game. I was disabled to look left and right.\n\nGameplay Aspects!\n\nWhile creating the looks of your character (a few hairs, a few colours, nothing adjustable, all preset)\nyou can also select your race beforehand. (they all have the same player model, one is a little thiner, one got a beard, one has some more skin details, one got a scar over his eye).\n4 Races total.\nThen you pick what your grandfather and grandmother were, to get some additional stats. Theres huge lore about it, but not really straight up what it does in the game.\n\nNice for a f2p. but only as a fun-mod i suppose. Some people create that for other games in their freetime.\nNot worth the effort.","September 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 30 of 60 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","30","60","2","0"

No explaination, no base skills, no help really at all.\n\n3: Players are trolls, all be it its a sandbox, but people are ♥♥♥♥♥ with no force protecting newcomers.\n\n4: In general it just doesn't feel right and I feel like it hasn't changed at all since I last played it (which was way back in 2010).\n\n\nIf you want a hardcore sandbox sim, go to Eve Online.\n\n10x better.

I understand it's been out for like...a day on steam but there's no excuse for how much ♥♥♥♥ I have to give this game. The tutorials are crap, garbage. The community is toxic as !♥♥♥♥! This game ALSO has a subscription base, which I failed to see before downloading but\n$15.00/month.....\n\nWAY TOO MUCH. THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. W\n\nWurm Online is much more worth it than this game. Much more fun, very friendly community(pve) and it's "subscription" can easily be paid for through in-game trading. People are very willing to give up $30 for a huge shipment of bricks in Wurm.\n\nI could not believe how unorganized and trashy the game felt. The devs are working in Social Communications....helping new players with stupid questions and keeping people "in check"  This is something they could of easily avoided, if they had more servers and better tutorials. There are NO NORTH AMERICAN servers at all right now.\n\nthe mechanics are anything but flawless, combat is strictly based on a person's connection to the server...... flat out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t if you ask me.\n\n\nTo those who love this game, I say...enjoy wasting money on this. The only reason it's mixed reviews is because the people who started playing this game before it came to steam are "loving" it because they got such a headstart in the game for #1...But I haven't played enough to see how THEY...the people who've been here since 2010  like the fact that it's on steam for free now...\n\nIt's attracting a lot of US players.

A browser pops up and you type it in manually.\nAfter youve done that, you log in your account. The serverstructure is unknown,you join a server after you created a character.\nAs i mentioned before, the buttons are not responsive. I created the character and pressed the button to finalize, but it didnt let me.\nGoing back,i found my character suddenly standing there.\nAfter 3 attempts of login-errors, the game started. It loaded very slowly,took about 5 minutes.\nThe game wasnt taking any graphic-settings that i set in the settings of it before starting the game.\nIngame the framerate dropped after a few seconds to 1 picture in 5 seconds. I put everything on the lowest settings, still nothing (and this game is old unreal engine)\nI exited the settings, and suddenly my mousepointer of the menu was still in the game. I was disabled to look left and right.\n\nGameplay Aspects!\n\nWhile creating the looks of your character (a few hairs, a few colours, nothing adjustable, all preset)\nyou can also select your race beforehand. (they all have the same player model, one is a little thiner, one got a beard, one has some more skin details, one got a scar over his eye).\n4 Races total.\nThen you pick what your grandfather and grandmother were, to get some additional stats. Theres huge lore about it, but not really straight up what it does in the game.\n\nNice for a f2p. but only as a fun-mod i suppose.

I gave this game a good hour and a half. I like the concept of the game. That being said, that is all I like about the game. Where to begin.\n\nGM's, you would think they would be helpful, but they are not. I asked for help on how to craft a robe (because the tut is total garbage) After the 4th time of asking in help I was banned from help chat, for asking for help (GM said I was spamming) But I only re asked the question because no one would answer in help, they were all too busy fighting over weather or not the game was worth 15 dollars a month (Its not)......\n\nGameplay, well, once you've tried to run around for 10 minutes, you will quickly recognize something is amiss.. You feel like you are running through a field of molases weighed down by 100lbs... FPS is good, but it feels like you are lagging when you really arent.\n\nCommunity, toxic to say the least. And thats putting it nicely. And GM's do try to stem the tide of complaints and fights, but they arent effective in the least.\n\nBasically, this is a game from 2010, that they are asking 15 dollars a month for. Yea you can play for free, but lets be realistic here, the perks you get form subbing make this very close to a p2w game if not completely.\n\nMoral of the story, stay away from this game, and its greedy devs, who obviously only released this to steam in an attempt to milk some money out of the community.","September 3, 2015","false","1.7"," 30 of 60 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","30","60","5","4"

I reinstalled the game after the dev modified the account creation.\nYour information is only needed if you're getting the subscription outside of Steam.\n\nNow, onto the game itself.\n\nFirst loading it up, and the game...looked rather poor, despite my World and Character settings being as high as they go. There is a horrible head-bob that I did not see a way to turn off.\n\nI did the tutorial (unlike 50% of the people in help chat), and found it lacking. It told you the BARE essentials to playing the game. Walk, kill stuff, craft basic thing, tame little animal. After the tutorial, you are left on your own devices to wander around wherever you started. And when I say wander, I mean wander aimlessly, lost, as there is no map system, and very few landmarks to use as orientation.\n\nSkills require you to learn them from tutors, but good luck actually finding them. They have no indicators showing you can learn from them.\n\nNow, the combat. While trying to kill the pigs in the tutorial, I felt rather motion sick. The camera swings wildly when you attack. It didn't help that I was experiencing mouse and input lag (I would press a key, and about 1/2 second later the game accepts the input.)\n\nThe community, at least in the help chat, are either people screwing around, or people who didn't do the tutorial.\n\nAlso, if you don't want to die, don't jump off ledges, don't kill things with blue names...and after one hour of play, avoid all players. The game is focused around PvP, so strong players can murder anyone they so feel like, and when they do, you lose ALL of your items and hard work.\n\nOverall, it feels like this game was made very long ago, and so I must say no, I don't recommend it.","September 2, 2015","false","1.3"," 34 of 68 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","34","68","2","0"

I reinstalled the game after the dev modified the account creation.\nYour information is only needed if you're getting the subscription outside of Steam.\n\nNow, onto the game itself.\n\nFirst loading it up, and the game...looked rather poor, despite my World and Character settings being as high as they go. There is a horrible head-bob that I did not see a way to turn off.\n\nI did the tutorial (unlike 50% of the people in help chat), and found it lacking. It told you the BARE essentials to playing the game. Walk, kill stuff, craft basic thing, tame little animal. After the tutorial, you are left on your own devices to wander around wherever you started. And when I say wander, I mean wander aimlessly, lost, as there is no map system, and very few landmarks to use as orientation.\n\nSkills require you to learn them from tutors, but good luck actually finding them. They have no indicators showing you can learn from them.\n\nNow, the combat. While trying to kill the pigs in the tutorial, I felt rather motion sick. The camera swings wildly when you attack. It didn't help that I was experiencing mouse and input lag (I would press a key, and about 1/2 second later the game accepts the input.)\n\nThe community, at least in the help chat, are either people screwing around, or people who didn't do the tutorial.\n\nAlso, if you don't want to die, don't jump off ledges, don't kill things with blue names...and after one hour of play, avoid all players. The game is focused around PvP, so strong players can murder anyone they so feel like, and when they do, you lose ALL of your items and hard work.\n\nOverall, it feels like this game was made very long ago, and so I must say no, I don't recommend it.","September 2, 2015","false","1.3"," 34 of 68 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","34","68","2","0"

However, in the few years I have played and been a part of this community (Pre-Steam) I have yet to see any guild or players with good intentions last long. Combining exploitable mechanics such as "Blue-Blocking" to kill players without repercussion and, at least for awhile, corrupt moderators that would largely help their guild with said powers, and some donation bias, it is easy to see why this general attitude could have sprung up in the community. However, if you can find a solid group of people and deal with the sometimes....rather incompitent developers, this is one unique MMO I would suggest to anyone. It's PvP is fun, and over the patches can be either well balanced to entertainingly broken. (I'm looking at you mounted archery) The crafting system and player driven economy have the potential to be amazing, with flexibility in the materials and styles allowing players to make the epic items most other MMO's have premade. Again, the biggest thing inhibiting all this is the community, though. It is quite popular to keep the best weapon recipes a secert from the general public, and much of the robbery and attacks on the guilds in the game happen when the guild is largey offline. (In the style of Ark: Survival Evolved, Rust, etc.) Overall, it is worth a try, but you need a strong resiliance to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to make it anywhere.","February 3","true","13.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It's a bit like Wurm Online (the game Notch made before Minecraft for those unaware) but has active combat and not a block/grid-based environment.\n\nFirst person only can be a little bit of an issue for some people especially when it comes to trying to hit with the proper part of your weapon - if you have a hard time with this use swords and you will be fine, axes and spears can be more difficult to strike with their heads. If anyone's ever played Mount & Blade in first person before, you can expect about the same experience here.\n\nHowever the Steam launch has been a little bit much for their server and during peak hours there have been several crashes and periods of downtime. Give the devs time to sort these out and come back to this gem. Be prepared to subscribe after a couple days trying it out though because the free to play restrictions are geared more toward being a demo than anything else. Nothing wrong with that in my books.","September 6, 2015","true","286.9"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","28","57","0","0"

I would recommend this game exclusively to players who seek before mentioned features and are ready to master its mechanics with minimum of handholding. Its gameplay shall make much greater challenge than in any other MMO and accepting great chance of being killed by other players or mobs and losing some of the belongings in the process, but with much greater reward at the end when one masters the play. I note that to be competitive one must be ready to buy a subscription.\n\nWHY KEEP ON PLAYING MORTAL ONLINE?\n\nDespite all the flaws and issues, all the sandbox features creates vast choice for overall fun gameplay. One can choose to participate in PvP where combat system is truly skillbased and fun most of the time. During group fights, teamwork and personal skill plays a keyrole, outweighting gear quality, unllike in other MMOs. On the other side, personally I enjoy being a crafter, since crafting system gives great variety of item types to be crafted and competing with other crafters in selling weapons to players is fun personal challenge. I could not find any other MMO that offers so many crafting and trading possibilities. Other activities like refining materials, alchemy, taming and trading the vast choice of items is fun to do since player can devise different strategies to get rich out of it. Finally, to explore huge open non-instanced seamless game open world brings its own kind of excitement and immersive experience unlike any MMO that I played, since there are no loading screens or artificial limitations. Game features various environment types like forests, planes, mountains, deserts, jungles etc. Across the world goodies are distributed in form of locked chests and free to loot urns/crates.\n\nGENERAL PLAYING EXPERIENCE\n\nPlayer can choose to start playing through Tutorial which will make introduction to basic game mechanics like basic combat, taming creatures and crafting armor. When finished, player can choose a starting item kit for desired class archetype. Character does not have classes, instead player just levels skills where the total limitation is 1100 for primary skills which can be redistributed any time freely. For mid-game, Mortal Online has no quests, but the main goal is to advance your personal and character skills, make your own material wealth (gain best items, build a house etc.) and participate in community (in guild or solo).\n\nPickpocketing other players is possible, but there is a way to counter it easily. Game forces first person view, which creates strong sense of immersion. Player can try to attack anyone anywhere, but most of the NPC towns have NPC guards that can kill any criminal really fast, but a strong group of players can kill these guards. To regulate criminal activity, there is a flagging system. Outside of towns any player can attack any other player, especially if there are no guards to help. When a player dies, all the stuff that one currently carries is dropped on a ground, being lootable by anyone, friends, foes or by returning to own corps. Still, all the valuable stuff can be banked for free in NPC or Guild towns for 100% safe keeping.\n\nPlayer can engage in PvP and PvE. Combat system is realtime where player has to aim a swing or an arrow to hit other player with realtime blocking also. This system is a true aim based realtime system without autotargeting, same as in The Elderscroolls serial. Practically, players personal skill really matters and often happens that unleveled skilled player can defeat fully leveled players that lacks PvP skills. Still, combat system is not without flaws where network lag can lead to undesired unfair outcomes, but overall the system works well. As for PvE, there are dozens of dungeons to explore which all are uninstanced. World AI still could get some improvement, so PvE is one of the worst aspects of Mortal Online. On the ground level, many challenging mobs exist, but dungeons are more rewarding and challenging.\n\nCrafting and trading is one of Mortal's strongest points, where players can craft almost all the items in Mortal's world, all except skillbooks and mount equipment. On the other side, 90% of available viable weapons and armor are player made. Variety of possible versions of item type to craft is vast, but in practice a few are viable, a few but enough for a rich market. Besides direct player to player trade, all the items and resources can be sold through the trade broker NPC which serves as a stock market, only locally with buyout and buyorder sections. To get required resources for crafting players can mine and refine materials to get metals or other minerals. To get animal materials, there is a butchery skill (one of most boring trade in Mortal), to get potions there is alchemy and to get food there is cooking skill. To get pets and mounts, there is taming skill, but animals can also be bred at NPCs to get better offspring of already tamed animals.\n\nFinally, building territory structure is one of most impressive features of Mortal. A single player can build their own various type of houses in predefined spots. But guilds can build other structures wherever they like. They can build many types of structures, like keeps, barracks, banks, market stands, mines, taverns, libraries... and walls to protect themselves. Overall, guilds can create their own fully functional town wherever the like in the world.\n\n\nDOWNSIDES\n\nMortal Online features serious issue experienced from the start of playing. UI is overall a bit clunky and design is lagging behind modern MMO titles. Handling core game mechanics like extracting and crafting can be clunky and quite time consuming to work with, with some minor irritating bugs like items are not placed into slots, or item stacks won't split as expected. Game overall lacks ingame guidance, so the learning curve for new players is just too steep. Due to thievery feature and free to hit combat, starting experience can be just too harsh for new players, leading to many griefing attempts. Further, trade broker user interface features huge technical lag which adds to frustration (screen freezes when loading item entries). Pet and mob AI is not good enough to avoid really strange behaviour during PvE (mobs hit and shoot through walls. Even when traversing the world with pets carrying mined materials following, they could just disappear with valuables due to a bug. Crossing server areas on the world (nodelines), can lead to unfair situation during combats due to a lag or just a bug. Considering crafitng, overall mechanics are not designed to be fluent and lead to many time consuming actions e.g. to butcher a full stack of carcass it takes 45 seconds of just standing at the butcher table. Similar is for extracting rocks, refining etc. Weapon and Armor Crafting UI is also impractical. List of these small but frustrating issues goes on. At last, there is no mid-game and even end-game content that can drive a player to keep playing. There are no ingame challenges to beat, besides personal challenge of getting overall better ingame.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nUnique and truly functional vast sandbox featuers of Mortal Online that are unique on market barely outweight the vast issues. For a player seeking a true open-world sandbox MMO, Mortal Online is more than good enough to enjoy. At least until a closely similar MMO title appears.","September 5, 2015","true","8.2"," 25 of 51 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","25","51","0","0"

Every system in-game, from the crafting, extraction, combat, cooking, alchemy, taming, etc etc is incredibly fleshed out, with TONS of room for experimentation along the way.\n\nAll the best gear and items are player-crafted, resulting in a player-run economy. The Crafting is incredibly dynamic, with countless options. The world is harsh and unforgiving, where you always need to watch your back, and any other player coming across you could be your doom...\n\nNo other game has scratched the itch that Mortal does, and I'm glad to see it finally release on Steam.\n\nThe free-trial is never ending, so if you'd like to get a taste of the game, download and try it! Just be aware that as a trial-account, you won't be competetive in PVP or crafting against people with Full-accounts. You can try almost everything, though, so there is that. People will whine that's Pay2Win, but it's far from it.

A little tip for anybody who tries to play this game. The first thing you should do when this game loads is turn off the sound. You spend the first hour or so listening screaming pigs. You're supposed to collect up some skins or something, I dont know, I never could get it to work.\n\nTo be honest, after reading the description, getting me to like this game was going to be an uphill battle anyway. I've never understood the movement MMO's have made away from classes and races. Its all skill trees now, so the world is always full of healer-knights. The game only has four races... light-skinned humans with or without pointy ears & dark-skinned humans with or without pointy ears. Theres a couple of paragraphs about each one, but they all looked the same to me. The game attempts to make up for this by letting you cover your toon in tattoos. bleh.\n\nThe game does give you a ton of options about the background of your tattooed healer-knight though. You can choose which countries your grandparents came from & this somehow affects your stats in ways that will probably be hugely important later on. The free account only includes one character slot though, so as soon as you figure out which stats are important you'll be deleting your character & starting a new one.\n\nThe descriptions for this game go on & on about how important crafting is... indeed the tutorial zone seems to offer little else except an explanation of their crafting system... which makes it all the more puzzling when the in-game tips remind you of how important it is to buy a -campfire- from the local NPC vendor before you go off into the wilderness.\n\nMaybe its a great game once you get into it... i got tired of chasing pigs & uninstalled it.","September 3, 2015","false","1.1"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","20","41","2","0"

Full loot open world HARDCORE game. Not for the feint of heart, or the easily frustrated. So far I've died to random mobs and lost all my stuff, been ganked several times and lost all my stuff, had my mount killed and lost all my stuff, and I attacked someone by accident and got owned by the guards and lost all my stuff. The only thing that's easy in this game is dying, and that's what makes it so much fun to me.  It's like that ex-girlfriend who treats you like crap, sleeps with your friends, and disappears for days, but she's always a blast to be with when she's there.\n\nFor those wanting to give it a try, I challenge you to play it for a few hours. Once you get your running skills up, and learn to ride, and get passed the gankers in the graveyards, the game is huge open world with zero safe spots. You can die at any time anywhere and it's EXCITING. Specialization is the key. Join a guild that's helpful to new players, there are vets that like helping new players out. Sure there are douchenozzles in every game, but it really feels to me like there's less of them in Mortal Online than other hardcore full loot pvp games I've played. For every one of the former there are 10 vets who will take time out to help you if you ask.\n\nThe free to play aspect of the game makes it really easy for new players to decide what to spend their skill points on with hardly any limiting factors other then effictively capping the skills at 60. Your points still go up to the 100 cap, but need to be unlocked with a subscription plan.\n\nThe combat is feels similar to Mount & Blade to me, but with a little less reliance on being mounted all the time. The creatures are plentiful, and better still, very dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. Plenty of adventures abound, and exploring is massive fun.\n\nI reccommend this game fully.","August 31, 2015","true","377.4"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","0"

You can put a price in someone head, YOU can do whatever you want to do, be whatever you want to be.\nThere is some bugs, and things like that, but you get used to some things and its nothing game breaking.\nAbout PVP, is totally Skill based, more than any other medieval game, like chivalry or mount and blade warband. I have seen things like a naked man with only a steel sword beat an heavy armored man (then like 4 guys killed him xD). It is totally skill based, you need to defend in the right direction in the right time, you need to watch your stamina, be careful to not make some friend fire and more...\nCrafting (armor, weapons, shields and bows), alchemy, gathering, mining, you will see all these thins in MO and more, in MO world every piece of information is gold, if you want to make steel you need information, if you want to make potions or something like that you need information and this information can be really expensive. All these things where discovered by players during this years of mortal online. The Devs said that there is a lot of things undiscovered yet.\nAnd there is a lot of things that I didn't mention, like house building, base, castles, dungeons, horse breeding, taming, engineering, sieges, beast domination...\n\nIf you like to play a true Sandbox MMORPG I recommend you Mortal Online.\n\nOBS: English is not my primary language XD","August 31, 2015","true","179.3"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","0"

It is a truly hardcore game akin to the glory days of Ultima Online. It is the only game I have found that makes me feel the way UO did so long ago. There are real consequences to your actions in game and, while this may be seen as a negative by some, I feel it is the only thing that makes an MMO worth playing. The world of Nave is constantly changing as politics and large scale server conflicts radically alter the game world around you. Your allegiances and your behavior truly matter in this game and the people you play with will not forget.\n\nIf you are the kind of player who enjoys a challenge and can withstand a little punishment, Mortal Online is the game for you. It has a steep learning curve at first and can be a little discouraging when you lose your hard-earned posessions, but it is a truly rewarding experience once you figure out what you're doing.

This is not a traditional MMO. If you want quest bubbles and some hermit telling you to gather 100 carrots so you can feed a donkey, and then expect to do this a thousand more times, in a thousand different ways until you level to 60, please don't download this game. Mortal Online is not for children nor is it for the faint of heart. This game feels like an RPG with a devoted community. If you loved Morrowind: The Elder Scrolls, then you will remember what a game like that feels like. If you want epic challenge, free romaing adventure, gore, crafting, hunting, taming, PVP, cooking, combat mastery and uniqueness in character; and might I mention some of the deepest lore ever written, then you must try this game. The lore in MO is on the level of the Elder Scrolls; in fact I wish ESO did their game sandbox style like this; if they did maybe people would have stayed.\n\nThe game is older so the graphics are not in today's standard, yet the world is beautifully crafted. The combat system works, it is intriguing and while it is challenging it is also fun. Even riding a mount takes skill, so you can't just hop on a horse or donkey and go; you need to learn how to ride, make sure you are not too fat or you will fall on your face in front of everyone. The economy in this system is unique in a sense, that even though you can see everything in the realm at the broker, you can only buy stuff in the city you are in, so it makes things challenging: if you want that armor or weapon you need to travel to the desert lands to retrieve it, from that particular broker, if you can survive the bandit players.\n\nI think open world PVP in 1rst person, is the most feared, yet realistc experience in fantasy gaming.\n\nMany of us got spoiled with 3rd person and I was one of them. At first, I was not sure I wanted to play a game in 1rst person, but as I got into it, I found myself 36 hours in. Then there are those who are afraid of getting killed and losing everything. I will say this, fear is good sometimes, it keeps you on the edge. Once you get killed and lose everything you will be smarter, wiser and learn to only carry the things you really need. And if you need to gather more things, keep a good relationship in the local cities so you can visit your bank; and always have back up resources so you can be prepared for the monster/creatures, theives and red players who have nothing better to do but make your life miserable.  All we need now is more Roleplayers to stop fearing PVP and come to this world. The opportunity to do what you want, go where you please and build a house, village or city, anywhere is well worth the risk. Or you can play ESO and waste your life in a tavern. I rather be rping with friends who want that edge, knowing that they can die in this dangerous world, but gaining strength, will, intelligence, dexterity, constitution and valor; to defend ourselves and the weak. We need more good players in this game.\n\nWE need more Roleplayers, who are up to facing this challenge.\n\nWhy don't you join us!\n\nFor help or guild information join this community\n\nhttp://www.mortalonline.com/forums/\n\nFor guides see this wiki\n\nhttp://www.mortaldata.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page\n\nFor a map which you can use in game at any time by pressing Tab+Shift see this link\n\nhttp://www.mortalonlinemap.info/\n\nAs always, Characters Welcomed. ~Serverus","October 25, 2015","true","736.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

The only issue is that new players must realized this is an ANYTHING GOES sever. Unless there is hacking involved, pretty much everything is fair game.\n\nWhich means you can make a living however you want. Whether its farming NPCs, being a bandit, soldier, baker, blacksmith, tamer, and just about anything you can think of. Even a thief or a mugger. Which, for me, is simply perfect.\n\nI also love the lack of 'classes' and 'levels'. It feels dynamic and realistic in how your skills work. Even in when creating your character, your age is a factor in what your starting stats are.\n\nIf you are tired of all the WoW clones out there and ready to try something new, even if it is hardcore, then simply give this game a try.

It's free so ♥♥♥♥ it. I was unfortunate enought to try on a day that the 1 server they have was ♥♥♥♥. Then my friend unfortunately ran into every bug you can experience in the first 5 minutes of the game. Hopefully it was just for us.\n\n*Queue Time Kinda Fixed, Skip This Part & Read The 2nd Attempt*\n\nInstalled and registered.\n\nGame started running and I'll admit, it was beautiful from the second it launched.\n\nLogging in required me to wait a full 15 minutes, which I assumed was a queue of players. A little annoying but when I enter a game, I'm on for a solid streak. 15 minutes is nothing compared to the grinding session I'm about to begin.\n\nI begin creating my character. While the customization isn't very extensive, it still offers a few unique mechanics that you won't find anywhere else.\n\nWhile struggling to find a worthy name for my champion, the game suddenly sends me back to the Log In screen, informing me that I've lost connection. I check my internet and find nothing wrong. I had a stream running at the same time which was not interrupting, reassuring me that the error was not on my end.\n\nI log back in.\n\n15 minute Queue.\n\nI'm a bit frusturated at this point.\n\nThis time I fly through the character creation. I no longer care about the toon because I just want to play the game after this unproductive 45 minute session.\n\nI enter the the tutorial.\n\nThe game is running great. My movement feels smooth. A little different but smooth. I run through the first couple tasks and I'm about to make my first set of armor when I see a notification in chat that the server will be resetting. This is instantly followed by the complaints of other players.\n\nServer goes down. I lose connection.\n\n15 minute queue.\n\nI have now spent 45 minutes of my 1st hour ingame WAITING to play a tutorial.\n\nGame looks great. But somehow as someone who loves to grind hours away with stupid ingame tasks, I've lost patience.\n\n\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nWatched my friend play. He logged in after a 13 minute queue and experienced no server issues. He then experienced a few glitches I did not.\n\nThe tutorial mission stalled on him. When you're supposed to butcher the animal parts for its leather/hide, you drag the parts over to the butcher skill. He did this and received nothing but "Work Bench is not available" or something along those lines. Don't quote me on that.\n\nI knew this wasn't supposed to happen because I personally had passed this part of the tutorial before being disconnected.\n\nBefore he could log out and endure another queue just to complete the first step of the tutorial, he found that he was rooted to the ground. Unable to move, jump, or rest. We sat there laughing about it until he lost his "fledgling" status. At this point another player approached him and started attacking him.\n\nI watched as he calmly exited and uninstalled the game.\n\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY?\n\nGave the game a second try, and the queue time was a bit shorter... But then the game glitched out.\n\n4/10 still can't play through the tutorial without having to relog whether it be because of glitches or server restarts.","September 8, 2015","false","1.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","4"

Was fully prepared to give this a good strong effort, and accepted that I'd get killed quite a bit.   However, what I've come to discover, is that this game seems geared more towards the griefer than the PvPer.  In my 9 hours of play, not once was I killed by a player, but I was guard killed Many Many times by little 'traps' left behind by players, things that use game mechanics or deception to allow players to get other players (expecially newer players who don't KNOW all the little mechanics) killed without penalty to themselves.\n\nWhile this might be the game for some, the learning curve and ease with which a player can be tricked into dying and losing all their gear, simply puts this game outside of my interest.","October 12, 2015","false","111.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

Try to learn the game mechanics which are difficult but enjoyable from what i did manage to accomplish, but try to figure out how to play and u get veteran players killing u or one of their alts jumping between you and your target making u a free kill. I cannot give a full review of the game because i am not able to experience the full game.  In simple terms a game is supposed to be fun, and until you learn a game you cannot really play. Above that it is the players who make any game fun or ruin a game and from my minimal experience the core base of players are hateful, spiteful and toxic to the extreme. The developers of this game obviously want new players which equates to new money(business is businees). On the other hand the old players have made it blatantly obvious they will do anything they can to put people off the game. The only way i would recommend this game is if there was a new server which would be more inviting to new players, yes old players would have a knowledge edge but not the ability to ruin the experience everyone else.

This means that, to play effectively, you need a seperate character to gather resources, then a seperate character to use those resources.\n\nEffectively, this is a demo, because it's 100% impossible to engage in PvP properly in this game without having those additional sources of resources.\n\nAdditionally, to play a mage, you need a constant source of metals, so mages spells just WILL NOT CAST without a consistent source of metals.\n\nAll this wouldn't be so bad if they charged a reasonable price for things like slots and sub time, but it's 15EUR for a single month!\n\nLong story short, the game is not only inferior and more grindy than most MMOs, but also considerably more expensive to play.\n\nDon't waste your time, it took hours for the veil to be lifted and for it to be made clear the time and money you need to invest in this game to function.\n\n\n\n(OLD REVIEW)\nThis game does not have a learning curve.\nThis game does not have a learning cliff.\nThis game has a learning mobius strip.\n\nIt will punish, and tease, and grind you to the bone, but if you invest the time and effort to explore and learn, even for a small period, you'll find a game with depth beyond depth. Think Skyrim meets Dwarf Fortress.\n\nSadly, this has hurt it's review score, but I honestly think that the learning curve is the only real reason for negative reviews, as on the whole this game has great production values and quite frankly, an awesome development team. Having worked with Unreal Engine, I have some inkling of the effort they've gone to to make this work.\n\nIf you think you've got the patience and control, I beg you to give this a go.

Before I explain what happened, I have to say how the criminal system works, if someone attacks another player, he will be targeted as a criminal, if a guard is near the area, the guard will kill the criminal. Other players will be able to attack the criminal without being flaged as criminal. Of course some people will abuse of this system.\nWhile I was killing some skeletons at the 'safest' capital to buy the last part of my armor set from the auction house (which were sold by players), a random player put himself between me and the skeleton (which was dealing a lot of damages). So to not be targeted as a criminal, I had to aim to nothing which was successful. Funny thing is, npc are not attacking with skillshot like players but simply deal damage when in range to its target. So while this griefer was standing between me and the skeleton, the skeleton was continuing to attack me. Of course as expected, I tried to kill fast enough the skeleton to don't have to deal with the griefer, but I touched the other player when he was beside the skeleton and the attack touched the player when I wasn't even seeing him. To be short, I was then killed by the player. Ironny here you come, when I checked the auction house after, my items which I bought from the same auction house were in store.\n\nThe main counter-argument is "yeah but it's a hardcore pvp mmo, blabla", problem is, the mechanics of the game encourage griefing, and bad manners. Just look at this post on the official forums which is tolerated: http://www.mortalonline.com/forums/threads/rpk-vs-noobs.123362/\n\nAnyway, the game was launched in 2009 and some flash mmorpg back in 2004 had better graphics than this ♥♥♥♥.\n\n10/10 I will never touch this garbage again.","September 7, 2015","false","5.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"

So you have to perpetually pay just to play the game you already paid for last month.  These kinds of pay models goes against my gamer code of ethics.  It's a scammy way to run your business, you don't really get to keep what you pay for.  But if you don't mind supporting dev's who keep supporting these pay models, then by all means perpetuate the problem. There is one other thing that made me wary of this game is that the experienced players will literally tell you not to talk about bans, or the banning of your friend or really anything to do with banning, because if you do you will get banned yourself.  Just thought it was really weird and got the feeling the dev's have mistreated players.  But it really is a great game and I was really enjoying it but after finding out the pay model I decided against it, due to principle.\n","November 11, 2015","false","22.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","11"

Don't expect timely answers, literate people, or politeness from the game's staff. They seems just as toxic as the community, seeming annoyed to have to help you with an issue, and never doing anything about it. Be prepared to die, A LOT. You will lose everything A LOT. People will intentionally make you hit them so you turn into a criminal so they can legally kill you and take your stuff. This is a huge problem with the flagging system in game and the continue to just say it's "hardcore" when it's just bad mechanics. This game isn't hardcore, you keep all your skills after death, most people who kill you have way better gear/mounts leaving practically no room for a challenge. How is running around killing new players and taking their stuff hardcore? This game isn't what it claims but it is still fun. For a game that calls itself hardcore, it makes it pretty damn hard to pickpocket and caters to killing theives (and it requires subscription to be a theif... way to encourage subscriptions...). If this game were really "hardcore" there wouldn't be such rediculous rules on stealing stuff, and murder would require a witness. In Mortal, you can be the witness to your own murder after you're dead! How hardcore is that?! Speaking of death... Be ready to have 0 frames per second when you die if other players are nearby. Overall this game has garbage support and the most toxic community I've ever seen. Yet it's still entertaining, but aside from personal approvals this isn't a very great game to start playing. It's a few years old and suffers the same problems as it did years ago.","September 20, 2015","false","132.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

I really, really wanted to get into it and I even had gone into it with a group of friends. The combat system seems dull and the graphics really aren't very good. There's no guides I couldn't even figure out the basics of building up a character, it seems like there's just random skills that are randomly leveled up and you have a maximum number of skills so things like being good at armorcrafting reduce your combat effectiveness. The last time someone tried something like this was SWG, but SWG was way, way, way more intuitive about the costs and what benefits of various playstyles. Maybe it's just too open? Maybe I've been spoonfed by other games since forever and only like the idea of an open world MMO?

I've had this game for years before it got its steam release... that was supposed to happen years ago. That's this game in a nutshell. This is the worst game with the worst community on any MMO. Yeah it is for hardcore players, meaning you have to be a scum lord IRL and in game. Save yourself the time and effort to commit to this game. Let me give you a long story short... There isn't anything community related in game, EVER.  The game itself is ran by egotistical veteran players with hankerings to ruin the game for new players and ruin the game as a whole (yet they think its just part of the game). The devs also do their own part in ruining the game by never promoting community events, get togethers, or boss events.. This is the epitome of a great game gone all the wrong ways. Let me blow your mind though, THE DEVELOPERS FIRED THE COMMUNITY MOD BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING FUN WITH ALL THE OTHERS HAVING FUN; "He wasn't taking his job serious enough." ... and that was the last thread of hope this game had. Don't forget PvP will never be fair, you will be zerged, the beginner zone is the only place where you'll see players. Everywhere else is a barren wasteland of nothing and they'll never focus on player experience. Final thoughts: This game has potential to be the greatest mmofps sandbox ever, but sadly it will never be because the community and devs have united to ruin it.","September 12, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

The game does not hold you hand for anything and just troughts you right into it. Howerver ones you get past all of the beginning dilemma and the bugs you see how cool this game actually is. I find my self constantly coming back to it just because of all the cool consepst that it has. this is the only game where I find my self think whether I should take a shortcut trought a alley or not as a murder could be there in the shadows waiting to kill you, things like this and other stuff like the sense of discovery that you get when you find something in some remote part of the map really gives a unique experince. This game really haves a Huge amount of depth to it that you get to see ones you get pass the beginning. But like I said before to get past the beginning you need to find a good guild , to if nothing else , at least show you the ropes, however dont look for a small guild with 3 people .look for something in the forums that has it self stable in the game already.\nIf you trying starting this game out by yourself with no help I promise you quit in less than 3 days just because the game can get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when you dont know what to do. People that you dont know can get really toxic and a good amount of the time will go out of their way to screw you,server can be super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ some times and problems have arise with corrupted support system, thought that has decrese a bit. game is full of bugs that you learn to just circumbent or sometimes even love, thought I know this is not excuse as the game has being out for around 6 years. but ones you see past this problems you find a really unique game full of cool things to do just because it gives you so much freedom , you want to build a house in a cool looking place? do it, you want to wall off a section of the map as your back yard? do it, (be ready for consecuenses) you want to go up to people in the wilderness and offer then the choice to give you their stuff or die? do it, you want to be a thief and steal stuff from players inventories? do it, you want to explore the wilderness and dungeons for cool weapons? do it, you want to scout the land for rare magics? you soon be able to do it.\nThings like this and more really make this game something of a gem for me, a flawed gem but a gem non the less. I really do recommend people to give this game a try, and If you do REMENBER TO LOOK FOR  A STABLE GUILD RIGHT AWAY other wise you WILL NOT enjoy this game. a good tip for this would be to look at the map if the guild has a keep they probably know a thing or two and once you ask to join then they must likely will help you","March 2","true","195.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Definitely not for the casual softcore player. I've been playing for the past three years probably over 1000 hours played. For someone who finds the most enjoyment out of sandbox full-loot games with skill based PvP this game takes the cake by far. I am yet to find a game that I have ever been able to dump as much time into as Mortal Online. If you don't like full loot pvp and don't have the patience for some minor bugs (small development team with a ton of heart and dedication) then you may not like this game. This game definitely has its niche which is why it is still around today.

First things first! We need more skill points and i cannot stress this enough to you...more and new weapon updates, Better updates more frequently. I do like the point system for levels in the game though it reminds me of skyrim witch is nice and i loved that game, the "pk-ing" is nice i like to kill once in awhile and steal the items the other players drop but!!! you will become a murderor at 5 player kills meaning...anyone on site can kill you and steal everything and not get into trouble by the guards, and the guards and kill you and they will i feel Red status aka murderor status should be taken off i want to pk more but i cant. and the priest needs to revive quicker and the timer should be lessened when you commit a crime and die so you can reivive and start having fun again. but yea pretty dang decent game if you stick to it and rpg fps games are you thing give it a try you'll like it.","March 7","true","95.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The more you know the more you can do & this race to know & do all the aspects of this game is ever growing. Having played since 2009, the ever changing world has gone from a simple sanbox game to a complex knowledge based game that demands hard work and virtual labors  to achieve skills as well as the first game i have ever seen where reading books for knowledge lores was not only possible but had a real time aspect that allows for offline study as well. The  banking system is town based and the only real safe place to store any loot as the game is complete loot drop upon death for every player making the PvP not only interesting but a reason for bandits to hunt other players However the guild based system makes regions of land in the game player owned and can be ruled with an iron fist or a laxed bandit mentality depending on the players. No place is truely safe in the game but with strength of allies and engineering the player built fortresses can be a safe haven away from common bandits but is no means completely safe as other guilds and players can siege at any point they are able to afford the manpower and resources to  attack the structures & this is becomming easier with time to achieve for even the single players however the group aspect of this game makes most solo adventures suicide or a battle of fierce tactics & combat guile, this does not stop the veterains with all their knowledge lores from roaming and killing every player that moves in the wild & some times even in the towns where the bravest of the murderers still wonder in & kill people and ride out even with a hord of guards on their tale they still manage to evade capture & death with swift & fierce malice to others. beware the others as they are the the greatest threat & strength in this game & practice on the PVE & earn your skills to take rank in the guilds of your choosing, But remember that we are all "Mortal" Online.

Plent to do. I do, however, have a few minor complaints. Firstly, it is poorly optimized. Secondly, each additional character slot is $9. I cannot afford this. Third, once you log in as a f2p acc, that account is locked in for the day. You cannot switch accounts so you can use other characters. Additional character slots cannot be purchased through steam and require your credit card info. And finally, subscriptions are 15 EU/month. Being subscribed doesn't give you any additional character slots.\n\nFinally, for some good things. The community. I hear alot of complaining about it. It's really not too bad. The game is difficult.

While the second one either spent max 2 hours at the graveyard or actually never saw it, as they left the starting city and are experiencing the real game right now.\n\nSadly its that first group of players who have filled the steam review page, with some salty ex-players.\n\nThe world of Mortal Online is harsh and brutal, theres no denying that as you will die, and I mean alot. But why would anyone try to deny it? Its the beauty of the game. Alot of people exaggerate things in their reviews. Like "The whole community is toxic, they all hate you and kill people at the tutorial areas all the time", while reality is pretty much the opposite. Theres one, yes I mean ONE, guild in the entire community that openly kills only new players around the starting cities. Rest of this "toxic" community has teamed up together to protect the areas. Some people cant handle the crashing which is happening few times a day right now, and while I can see how it irritates, I dont see how it does any real damage. You dont need to sub to play the game, and with each crash they get more information about the cause which then makes it easier to fix it and further increase the amount of players they can let in, making the queue even shorter.\n\nI have played the game on and off since beta. I have lived through the most horrible bugs and the game breaking issues. Yet I have stayed. Why? There is simply no other game that make me feel like Mortal Online does. To expect the unexpected. Is that person in the horizon trying to kill you or not? Or are you planning to kill him but is he alone? Is the keep owner in this area friendly or not? Can you survive this transport or not? Will you survive this dungeon? You fell into a hole and find yourself in almost pitch black dungeon, how can you make it out alive? No matter what you do in this game, gather, pve, explore... theres always danger around. To tell you about the politics would require a whole article alone. Wth new blood its just going to get more interesting, as new blood is what the politics have needed for a while now.\n\nMake a favor for youself and join a guild as soon as you get past the starting tutorial gates. Theres plenty of guilds advertising on the official forums, in game chat and in game boards, so you can surely find one to fit in. If you have a group of players who instead want to create a guild, then make a post to the forums that you are looking for temporary mentor/teacher. Theres also alot of people willing to guide new players in the official IRC channel and the (un)official teamspeak server.\n\nIn MO you learn by trial and error, and this is something many people do not seem to accept, they want everything handed to them. The beginning is only as hard as you make it, see some effort before you start and its wholly different experience.","September 6, 2015","true","593.7"," 46 of 94 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","46","94","3","0"

Subscribing to this game is worth every penny!\n\nWhat about Mortal do I love? Why you might like this game!\n\n-Forced first person skill based MMO (When you swing you can hit the arms, legs, head etc.) Combat is not simple like most other games, there is no aim assist or TAB and button mash. A skilled player with less player attributes and worse gear can truly destroy a lesser skilled player with better attributes and gear.\n\n-Sandbox. There IS a brief intro quest and that's it. You are free to explore, hunt, craft, learn. You are not bound by a quest system. There is no need to grind quests.\n\n-The crafting! Never have I seen a game with more in depth crafting. You don't just go out and find iron, bring it to a bench and craft a weapon. You must go mine rocks, (they are everywhere) bring them to an extractor (crusher etc) which gives some basic parts, burn them in a forge, and refine them with other parts, this is the most realistic type of crafting I have seen in a game, ever. I could go on and on about the complexity and how rewarding it is but you get what I'm saying hopefully.\n\n-FULL LOOT and NOWHERE IS SAFE! This is awesome. Are you the "good" guy that strives to kill only red (murderer) players and defend the peace? Are you a "bad" guy that wishes to kill everyone they see and take what they have on them? Either way this game caters to it. Yea there are blue cities that the guards kill red players but even so anyone can attack, they will turn grey and the guards may kill them but it's not truly safe even in the big cities.\n\nIn a nutshell, I love this game.  It's not going to hold your hand, it will test your patience at times. The rewards are great, nothing beats that feeling of knowing you could die, but you made a long trek to the next city with your valuables, ETC.\n\nThe game is not perfect, but for an indie development team they have made a hidden gem of a game. They are not going away and they are always improving the game.\n\nAfter Mortal Online, other games feel tame and useless. (Other games have little or no penalty for death and therefore are not rewarding to me).\n\nThumbs up if this review was helpful.","September 1, 2015","true","187.8"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","1"

Kinda suck... even running everything on max, details only show when your right up to something. Optimization needed. Gameplay? Not bad really. There is a lot I want to so badly love about this game. Here are my main complaints: everything is so spread out you spend hours just trying to get to the other of a town. The terrain and world itself is just plain boring. Combat is fresh and unique. The game mechanics are great, just crippled by everything else. The F2P is nerfed pretty badly and the community is largely against new players. Veterans will literally go to new zones and kill new players out of sheer boredom I would assume. Combine that with the full loot system means they will kill you, destroy what you've spent hours obtaining for no reason at all until they run out of newbs and finally move on. Just so another one can come in. And all that is yours to experience IF you can get logged on in the first place. For something thats been around since 2009 you think they would at least have figured out a stable launcher.

Skills work like they do in Oblivion, and it's incredibly satisfying watching yourself progress.\n\nGame looks beautiful, it plays (mostly) well except combat which is a little touch and go. I wish there was a 'neutral' review as after conversing with a Dev. on the forums they seem very reasonable; so I have no choice but to sway slightly positive. What started off as a giant rant by myself about the game, turned around to a civil conversation which I assume neither of us imagined. Overall the game would be much more positive with a different community.\n\nThe game has potential, unfortunately I've been saying that for well over 6 years now. Some things need to be changed drastically to improve gameplay, and the primary reason the game is failing is due to the community.\n\nIt is plagued by elitists and trolls. People who believe because they can dupe, exploit, and min/max whatever mechanic is broken at the time that they have the right to treat people however they want. Wander somewhere a clan deems as 'theirs' and try to gather? Have fun getting spawn killed for hours at a time until you give up and log out.\n\nThe crafting system is absolutely stunning, but again the elitists have full control over the market. There are no 'recipes' so everything is trial and error unless someone else tells you what is required. This leads to game breaking potions and other items only a select few know about and will hold onto their secret like it's "the one ring".\n\nPeople are so scared of challenge, so terrified of someone being on their level they will do everything they can to prevent you from accomplishing anything in the game.\n\nYou will be 'blue blocked' and killed by guards, I imagine more times than you can count in your first days in the game.\n\nIt's free, so it can't hurt to try.

I was hoping to try this game out, but I'm not going to wait in a 20 minute queue, just to get put back in queue because it timed out.\n\nDecided to give the game another shot today, still can't connect, I sit in queue for 3-4 minutes, then some error I don't have time to read flashes on the screen and then I'm back in queue. I can log into the website with my account just fine.\n\nI was finally able to connect to this game today, what a disapointment, the game looks and runs like crap, there was a 'toturial' where I was instructed to kill some pigs and skin them, zero explaination on how to do this btw, after taking nearly 10 minutes to kill a pig, which was hard because there doesn't seem to be a way to lock a target that's easy to find in the UI and the hit boxes and attack boxes are all kinds of wonky, and on top of that the other playets kept swooping in and killing my pigs if I got them low, good community, I spent another 10 minutes trying to figure out how to skin the thing once i finally managed to kill one and then gave up, what a sad waste of my time. 15 years ago this game would maybe have been good, but too many better modern MMO's exist to bother with this crap.","September 8, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","6","14","2","3"

The game elements are easily identifieble and like any other MMORPG this one is 'pay to win' with the free accounts serving as a permanant trial, being unable to progress into a situation where your character has any chance against: guilded players marauding the countryside, lone horsemen murdurers, pick pockets, 'low level' griefers, fatigue free hostile animals and many more, I find it difficult to find the positive in a 'full loot' environment where 4+ hours of grinding can be erased with a stroke of another player's hand (or a mouse click rather)\n\nThe combat system is clunky. The animations are delayed on both attacking and defending making the victor 'he who has a lower ping' combined with 'he who has managed to attain a powerful weapon'. Stamina is easily depleted and forces the player to stop and stand in place, or submit to a static animation (sleep or sit) and 'ranking' it up requires well thrice more investment in time spent training one specific skill. (or multiple skills) and similar goes for the majority of the other 'skills' that I've learned about. Certain portion of the 'skill tree' seem redundant- for example, the multiple different kinds of anatomy studies acquired when skinning different animals, or the variation of wood type lore which all feel like a weighted shackle on the road to adventure.\n\nThis MMO failed to deliver me with a unique immersion and like other similar (LIFYO for example) it funnels down to a grinding game, which completely beats the notion of Role Playing to me and leaves me questioning the purpose of an anarchy situation. Are they hoping that the players create the story? And if so, how could they if they are always busy killing each other? - With guilds involved I was speculating this might be the answer but to my disappointment the guild scene is a closed clique party with most guild towns being locked under passowrd or a sassy toll.\n\nIf you are expecting an immersive story where you might create your character and bring it into a story based adventure, this is not your stop. - If you are, however, just looking for a grinding & power building game, this is it!\n\nAs far as the technicalities go;\nThe game world is detailed compared to other MMOs i've seen recently. It is however not as large as I've hoped it would be. (in 7 hours i've explored most of the main continent) The tutorial which grants you some basic items and skill knowledge is very to the point and fluid making it easy for everyone to understand. The time divisiion is quite fair, with night time not being too dark and day time not being too bright and the over-all scenery is very nice with how the moon is possibly the planet and the game world being the moon in this setup (speculation only).\n\nIn short, I feel that this game focuses too much on statistics, attirbutes and other red tape rather than the immersion of adventure and discovery which is why I feel it's less RPG and more MMO and I would not recommend it at this point of writing.","January 30","false","7.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"

Too bad that the rest of it is so inexcusably amateur and poorly planned/executed.\n\nThere are many valid points being made below for and against this game, and a few of them are actually true.  The main problem with this title is that it is so difficult to log into the game. Whether you are a p2p or f2p player, you will not be able to play whenever you want, Period. Every session is a gamble. One day you can log on and the next day you can't.\n\nAll of this boils down to an amateur dev team and amateur leadership directing them. I just can't believe some people are actually paying subscriptions to this. I would never pay for a game that only lets me log in 3-4 times a week.\n\nI didn't even go into bugs and issues with the game itself yet, of which there are PLENTY. Mortal Online is literally, the first clear example of a game concept so good that it didn't matter if the execution missed every single develpment target.\n\nYou will definitely enjoy this game if you like spending more than an hour trying to log in 5+ times EVERY SINGLE WEEK. Today is a US national holiday, so don't even think about trying to log in. It's 6PM and everyone trying to log-in after 10AM still can't get in.\n\nNOTE TO OTHER DEVELOPERS: THIS GAME CONCEPT IS A PLATINUM SELLER, BUT THIS COMPANY FUMBLED IT HORRIBLY.

If you love PvP and like a challenge, then I would sincerely suggest you give it a try.  The artwork is very detailed, but the graphics are not like those found in most modern games.  Also, the idea is to try and figure a lot out for yourself.  Here is one example of what I mean.  I have one character that is an alchemist.  I can look at previous recipes others have figured out and were willing to post.  However, I spend a lot of time with that charater gathering and testing various items to see if they produce anything viable.  That character cannot fight.  She cannot do anything but alchemy.  When she finds viable recipes, she can make money.\n\nA person could make a decent hybrid if they cannot afford to pay for the game.  A mounted archer is one possible hybrid.  The system is fairly complex.  You get 1100 points to use for primary skills and an unlimited number of points to use for secondary skills.  The catch is that you can't always open a secondary skills immediately.  Sometimes you need a certain number of points in the primary skill first.  50 in endurance allows you to learn some secondary skills, as an example.  You can lock a skill at any point.  You can reduce a skill you don't want and allow it to increase again later.  My alchemist has some survival abilities, but she is using most of her 1100 points for alchemy related reasons.\n\nHere is a little more info for those interested:  The fact you can change your character at any point is wonderful.  Just make sure your stats will work with your new combo.  However, the world is cruel.  You are never 100% safe.  It is basically an open field and anyone willing to risk death by a guard can still attempt to kill you in town.  Some towns have no rules.  Some are player owned.  There is no map in game.  Anyone can loot your corpse if you die.  Although to loot an innocent, results in your character becoming a target for 2 minutes.  Outside of town, you either have a way to defend yourself, roam in groups, hang out with guild buddies or prepare yourself for an eventual death.\n\nStill interested?  If so, I am guessing you like the idea of world PvP and game that requires some thought.  Just be prepared to die a lot at first.  There is a definite learning curve.\n\nI am not the gamer my husband is.  However, I have definitely logged enough hours over the past many years to call myself an experienced, old-school gamer.  This is probably only the second time in all those years I have written a review.  That is how much I love this game.

Well, I started up again a few days back after finding out that this game has been out for 5 years and there is still content yet to be discovered. It's not that it can't be done, it's not out of laziness, it's the fact that this game is so vast and does such an amazing job at making you feel small that you can't possibly see it all by yourself. I recently spoke to a veteran player that hasn't gone into an entire section of the map due to the guilds that control it... he's been playing for years and has no idea what's out there (besides what he can see on the wiki-map).\n\nThat's something else, guilds control areas of the land; it's not just monsters that you will be fighting, there are frequent hunting parties. Some are friendly, and others will murder you just so you can't have those rags and sword you started with. If you're smart, however, you won't be killed and eventually you may win a few fight, or all of them.\n\nI've only just started the game, but I will say, it is absolutely amazing. The combat is fun, the world is HUGE and beautiful, and there's an adventure everytime you want to go back to town, get some wood, or want to kill a few bears.\nI highly recommend this game, 9/10 (it still has some hiccups, but the devs are top-knotch).\n\nMy first adventure:\n\nIt was day 2 and I was feeling great about my big, scary mace and armor made from my friend's skin, so I decided to venture out of town. North, that's where I would go, there's snow, trees, bears, and who knows what else! Off I went, down the tiny path that soon opened up to a giant plain dotted with buffalo, houses, and dogs with giant nuts. Venturing forth, I kept my distance from the scarier creatures, and ducked into bushes or behind rocks if I spotted a player.\n\nAbout an hour into my exploring I came across a lone horse with giant saddlebags standing next to a bridge. With no player in sight I slowly made my way up to find a naked man splashing around in a stream; he seemed stuck.\n\n"Do you need some help?"\n-no answer-\n\nI went to his horse, which was offering no help at all, and I'd had my experiences with water before. Then I saw his pick, the poor guy was so weighted down with ore that if he paused to speak or discard anything he would sick and drown. I sat with him for several minutes as his torso slowly went under.\n\nI thought to myself, "If he has all this ore, and his horse has those huge bags..." then he started making progress, and I did what anyone would do in my situation. I crept to the riverbank's edge, and blocked his only hope of getting out of the river. Several more minutes went by, the man slipping deeper until, finally, he either gave up or his stamina depleted. He sank below the surface and down to the bottom and soon drowned. I didn't want to meet the same fate so I hurried over to his horse. Can I take it? No.... damn... So I drew my mace and started beating the animal to death. Apparently this man never thought his horse would be attacked and kept it set to passive.\n\nSoon, the man and the horse were no more, and I had a saddle worth more gold then I could dream of, and supplies for a horse of my own. The bags, alas, were empty, but the saddle more than made up for that. Off I went, I found a horse, tamed it, equipped it, and rode on into the North where I was mauled to death by two rhino things that a player sicked on me from the back of his donkey.\n\n10/10 would passively murder a man over the course of 20 minutes again.","October 1, 2015","true","385.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","1"

It's basically what ESO should have been. It's an MMO with first person only and enough stuff to do that some players have been playing for years and never been bored. You can tame numerous creatures. Build your own city. Band together all your friends and go murder wanderers or even guards if you're brave.\n\nTL;DR amazing game. Amazing environment.

The entire system is pretty much based on the fact that you have to rely on the help of others to do anything, or figure things out on your own. Not 15 minutes into the game was I killed by a player(s) because I hit another player for stealing from me. There is a mechanic to call a guard, and many times did I try and no guard came. I could not figure out the issue so I hit the player away from me, he ran away and I was immediately swarmmed and killed, losing all I had, and therefore making me never want to play Mortal Online again. If this was my fault in the end for doing something wrong, I would at least like to know how to do it properly next time, yet the help features available were no help at all. The game is long, drawn out, and not friendly to new players, even in the starting town. I think the game could be good, but they have not done enough to make it good, nor have they fixed what seems to be broken. Not a fun game unless you like grinding resources for hours at a time only to die because someone out in the world finds you and kills you. And you won't get your items back.

If you love PvP and like a challenge, then I would sincerely suggest you give it a try.  The artwork is very detailed, but the graphics are not like those found in most modern games.  Also, the idea is to try and figure a lot out for yourself.  Here is one example of what I mean.  I have one character that is an alchemist.  I can look at previous recipes others have figured out and were willing to post.  However, I spend a lot of time with that charater gathering and testing various items to see if they produce anything viable.  That character cannot fight.  She cannot do anything but alchemy.  When she finds viable recipes, she can make money.\n\nA person could make a decent hybrid if they cannot afford to pay for the game.  A mounted archer is one possible hybrid.  The system is fairly complex.  You get 1100 points to use for primary skills and an unlimited number of points to use for secondary skills.  The catch is that you can't always open a secondary skills immediately.  Sometimes you need a certain number of points in the primary skill first.  50 in endurance allows you to learn some secondary skills, as an example.  You can lock a skill at any point.  You can reduce a skill you don't want and allow it to increase again later.  My alchemist has some survival abilities, but she is using most of her 1100 points for alchemy related reasons.\n\nHere is a little more info for those interested:  The fact you can change your character at any point is wonderful.  Just make sure your stats will work with your new combo.  However, the world is cruel.  You are never 100% safe.  It is basically an open field and anyone willing to risk death by a guard can still attempt to kill you in town.  Some towns have no rules.  Some are player owned.  There is no map in game.  Anyone can loot your corpse if you die.  Although to loot an innocent, results in your character becoming a target for 2 minutes.  Outside of town, you either have a way to defend yourself, roam in groups, hang out with guild buddies or prepare yourself for an eventual death.\n\nStill interested?  If so, I am guessing you like the idea of world PvP and game that requires some thought.  Just be prepared to die a lot at first.  There is a definite learning curve.\n\nI am not the gamer my husband is.  However, I have definitely logged enough hours over the past many years to call myself an experienced, old-school gamer.  This is probably only the second time in all those years I have written a review.  That is how much I love this game.

However, the inexusable part is the terrible modeling done by the designers. The textures/models  are so heavily reused.. they need some variety and stop painting the world with the same generic rock terrains.\n\nA simple example was the frill grass poking up from the starting towns fountain.. just raise the base height to hide the frill. That's just lazy modeling by the developers. It looks terrible to have the grass poking out of the middle of a stone fountain.. (Which used the same stone texture without any shaders.. Very ugly to look at - Ingame is far uglier than the screenshots)\n\n2) Combat was ok.. The fact that archery hits are calculated client side on the archer's machine is a bit annoying. It doesn't account for leading or latency.\n\nI admit that I didn't give it much time to get into deeper aspects of combat, but I can't get past how ugly the game is..\n\n3) Min/Max builds only - It seems the game has only a few viable builds, though it offers numerous skills. So, this leaves most people with a cookie cutter planner for maxing their toon.. It seems you end up with a minimum of three characters to experience the full gameplay  - One PvP, and two crafters.\n\nThis was off putting for me.. I have a full schedule, so leveling / managing three characters is not appealing. I prefer to have one character that I can spend building up.. I really don't want to waste time switching characters just to keep the cash flowing - that seems like just a time sink to avoid creating content.\n\nIf you enjoy hardcore pain.. (Such as drowning in a fountain, lol) You might like this one, but if you are like me and want to play a game that is less work and more entertainment, then stay away. The full loot and heavy PvP lured me in to give it a try.. but ultimately, it was just too ugly to give it much of a chance.","December 28, 2015","false","3.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

Play if you want a case of "what could of been" or if you want to experiance what it's like to bribe people.\n\n\nMorrowind: the MMO, with crafting, building, open world combat and a hardcore death system, along with systems that encourage a diverse community with people filling in all the rolls that NPCs and loot drops would normally fill (which it does really darn well. Hireing someone to make a suit of leather armor out of my corpse's own skin was both cheap, and humorous. I protect myself in ways few others can).\n\nThat sounds so ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, which is why this is probably one of the biggest disapointments to come out of an MMO.\n\nWhy? Well, you have the crime system for starters. When you hit a player, you become a criminal, and anyone can attack you, free of any reprecussion. Fair enough, A very good system on paper. Problem is, it's easy to abbuse. you have plenty of people who purposly run into your attacks as your fighting something else, causing you to become the criminal (usually in a hevally populated grinding spot not terribly far from city guards that will now attack you on sight) and with you being swarmed by players who now have a free kill to swarm and loot. The devs know of this flaw, but when asked they just tell you to adapt as apparently making a hardcore game means that they have a free pass on ignoring exploits. Do I agree with that? No. Do I think it's an easy fix and worth the effort? Not necisarally... It's kind of complecated.\n\nWant more? Well, there's the subscription service. This, I don't consider quite as bad, but it does make free to play players walking targets. See, as a F2P, you have a lower cap on your skill levels then others. I'm sure you can already see what this means but in short, you could twice as hard as someone with a subscription, and still fail do to the signifigant level difference, losing all of your superior equipment and time and effort to a person who, really, may not be as good as you. Is this a big problem? Not exactly. It's fair that there's something that players paying get that f2p players don't. Do I think that this system is worth changing? Yes. Yes yes yes a million times yes. Never split your community like this. Ever.\n\nThe worst part? Well, players can buy stock in the company. Are the devs above the bias and favoretisem that this could bring about? Nope. Nope not at all. Due to this, some guilds are untouchable, with you risking a ban for sucessfully standing against them. If some players break the rules, they will hear said rulebreaker's case over yours as they pledged more money to the company. Yea. That's kinda a big issue, and unless there's a change in management that decideds this old game is worth trying to save from years of corruption and failings, it's not going to change.\n\nBut underneath all that, is this game good? Yes. Yes it plays like morrowind and I love morrowind's stupidly overcomplecated combat. Play if you want an MMO like that to the point where you're not above bribery and an empty bank account.","March 12","false","20.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Ya that will do it, so many ♥♥♥♥ lords there crapping on games, what do I find? let me tell you....<----\n\nFew channels,but! Awsome channels. Gamers who have never played the game, completly loving it. What else did i find, game devs there hanging out answering question with the same passion I remember almost 7 years ago when i first found the game. Too boot!! Henrick was in the chat channels talking with us, being one of the dudes.\n\nMy dream game is finaly here, wish I could say I supported the game as long as it has been around, wish I could say I had faith in SV, wish I could say i was right. But I can tell you I have never been so extatic to be be proven so wrong. MO did it!!!!","September 6, 2015","true","190.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Since then they have fixed the que and the system actually gets you in immediatly usually if you are subbed, and within 5-10 min if you are ftp.\n\nThis game although oldish for an MMO, has been refreshed by steam and is now seemingly getting updates with future plans in the works for more.\n\nI don't reccomend this game if you want rules and classes and quests and levels but if you want an anarchy do what you want play style where you do what you want somewhat remminicent of Eve Online then this is the game for you. I like it as an alternative to games where you are overly restricted to levels and classes.","September 13, 2015","true","144.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Yes, I know the game kinda has a high system requirerment but that shouldn't know you from trying. If you really wanna get a feel for the game you need to first find a guild that has played for a while to help you get a better grip of the game. This is a sandbox type of game so there is no sense of direction cause you make your own quests and adventures. There are bugs but if you can get around it, It is a great game with awesome potential to be the best game. They are little to no games like mortal cause it is a First person only MMO that takes skill to get anywhere. People who are sub have an advantage but I have seen F2P that have beat pay to plays to the ground cause they have more skill than others. It has good graphics and amazing places if you step out of town you can find, For example the sator dungeoun or Mino, demon circle and risar dungeoun it is all one of a kind. The small dev team has done an outstanding job at this game.\nSo Remember or things to know:\n-Find a guild to get a good stand point from the game and get expereince to build your own guild one day.\n-There are grifers at all towns so don't be discouraged if you do get ganked, Its mortal guys xD\n-Grind is hard but satisfactory when you reach your goal.\n-Everyday will always be new.\n-Last is a hardcore full loot PvP open game, You can be killed anywhere and I mean anywhere.\nI may have missed some things but check out Jaseace's review cause it gets into more depth but this is all that I can say from playing for 3+ years So come on in you plebs and have some fun!\nSo do you have what it takes to be a Mortal or will you fall?","September 1, 2015","true","869.2"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","1"

I am involved in a tight niche of this game where you kill for your stuff. It has the greatest player envolvement in the landscaping of any MMO. The grudges are held eternally, and your reputation is notorious in this community.\n\nThere is something for everyone but the game is very hardcore. Death is brutal, items have actual value, and the grind is merely surviving the world and its denizens.\n\nThe bugs and the indy dev company can be frustrating at times, but the satisfaction of accomplishment is bar to none in any other MMO. This is more hardcore than Darkfall. In MO you don't kill someone, you murder them. You cause them grief, and killing is a political, ecnomical, and tactical action.\n\nGood luck on your endeavors in Mortal Online, I will have my crew ready to murder everyone that joins in.

I've quit and came back to this game at least 10 times. I hate it but I also love it, it is a strange relationship i have with this piece of software to be honest. Now that I do not have a proper internet connection service, I can't really play but I'm trying to solve that problem and jump right back in.\n\nNow this game is full of bugs, unstable server issues, a griefing population in cities, unfair flagging system and many other issues but let me explain what this game is offering, why is it different from other games?\n\n-The most important thing is the players' influence over the world. This is not a semi-mmo with 100s of servers with only 40 people in it. This is a real breathing world with people who have different goals. There are political conflicts, rpk guilds playing the role of bandits, hire swords, trading guilds, player made cities for new players and sometimes even world wars that changes the whole game for everyone.\nThis being said MO is not a very solo friendly game. Even if you have all the characters you need, sustaining yourself while having fun turns into a job more than a game. You might follow this path, dont get me wrong it is entirely possible however I would not recommend it especially to a newbie.\n\n-Exploration is a great aspect of this game. You have a wast land to wonder around and experience. You do not have a map in game so learning the terrain is important. Learning the safe routes, hidden places and farming areas would give you an advantage. Also there are different things that you can explore than the terrain and the world. There are tons of combinations that you can try in alchemy, crafting, cooking.. etc. There is no stamina or mana potion still in the game as far as I know, you could be the first one to invent them and make a fortune out of it!\n\n-Combat is different than you would find in other mmos. First person view changes everything, I might be biased in this are because I love FPS it gives the most realistic feeling, forces you to be more careful about your surroundings and to me FPS helps me bond with the game by putting me right inside of the world.\n\n-Mortal Online might not be the first game with the open world combat, without battlegrounds or instances but this game has a more tactical fight or flee type of combat once you get into it. For example having the high ground might change everything or herding your enemy to an open area with mounted fighters can change the course of battle. So the terrain is an important aspect in combat, knowing your way around it might save your life. This is not much of a difference you to other games you might think but with the full loot, knowing that you will lose something and hurt your/your guilds reputation if you die makes a whole a lot difference.\n\nI'd say try it for yourself. As most of the people say here, it is not a game for everyone. But if you like it chances are you will not be able to quit it entirely as long as there is no other game like MO.","September 10, 2015","true","39.8"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rodrigar/recommended/287920/","rodrigar","TheChance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rodrigar/","37 products in account","Alright. It says I played this game for 40 minutes, but it was actually closer to 10. Why? Because I spent the first 5 minutes making my character, and the next 20 or so minutes rebooting the client until I was able to -log in- to my character. Forum posts seemed to indicate that this has been going on for about 5 years, and the most recent thread I found also warned me of two things: there is no free-to-play model for this game, just an unlimited "free trial", and the game has suffered for years from an awful starting experience chasing new players away ("I don't know why they didn't fix that before launching to Steam", one player wrote. Uh oh.)\n\nWhen I finally got in, I was presented with instructions to run 120m and talk to an NPC (standard stuff). My character's "sprint" speed, however, was scarcely faster than his "walk" speed, and I'd have to stop every 20 paces to let his stamina recover. I am given to understand that run speed and stamina both increase with use, like in an Elder Scrolls game. That's fine, but it started out a little extreme. Strike two against MO.\n\nThe NPC told me to kill pigs for leather, and the game taught me to equip and brandish my sword. Cool beans.\n\nAfter slogging running over to the pigs, I did a big ol' Elder Scrolls-style wind-up, swung... and missed, even though the pig was standing motionless in the center of my screen, with the reticle right on its back.\n\nI decided to settle for chopping away, and after it took 6 hits (10 swings) to kill a pig, I was done. Strike three.\n\nHere's the thing: I'm sure this game is -great-, if you can get past the oppressive introduction. However, if the game is going to -require- a monthly subscription for the full experience (and not even present a way for other players to sell me my subscription for in-game currency), I should not need to "bear with" the game to start enjoying the experience. In 40 short minutes, only a few of which were even proper game time, this title has managed to chase me away for good.","September 5, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

The world outside of the main cities is pretty lifeless.  You can run for 20 minutes and come across the same trees and rocks you find in the city, which the city is in theory safer.  In reality you are more likely to be murdered in the PvE graveyard within the city than out in the wild.  Most likely this is because the murderers are so bored in the open, empty world the only place to kill is the starter zone.\n\nThe combat is clunky, and feels extremely out of date.  Movement is horrid.  Eventually developers may realize that only making sprint feel like a decent speed to move at, and then adding a stamina bar to limit sprint, is not very fun.  I found myself sprinting until out of stamina, resting for 5 seconds to refill the stamina, and then running again.  Overall it would probably be just as fast to go at walking speed, but that just feels too slow.\n\nThe skill system at first seemed interesting and deep.  Then you realize how pointlessly deep it is.  I'm not sure much is added to the game by having a skill for each of the following Zoology>Arthropoda>Chelicerata>Arachnida>Scorpiones, just to know about scorpions.  And unless you want to pay the monthly subscription, you're going to be capped at 60% compared to those who do pay anyway.\n\nSave yourself the 10+gig download and skip this game.","September 9, 2015","false","15.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

Mortal Online is the most true to genre hard-core, sandbox MMORPG's I have ever played.\n\nNow I have played many RPG's, you could probably name any game and I have played it. This is a first in what I hope to be more games like this.\n\nNow to start listing qualities:\nMUSIC:\nThe music in Mortal Online is really inriguing. As a musician myself I always like to listen to the music in a game and think of the time and effort put in to making it. Now I don't know if they hired an orchestra or simply used midi files but it sounds pretty good.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe graphics aren't too shabby. Although not comparable to a game like GW2, or Skyrim, they are more comparable to RoK. Although the graphics are not the best of the best, they do their job and show the in game content and crafting system, (which is the strongest part of the game).\n\nCONTENT:\nThe most exciting part about this game is its content. The publishers really mean this game has a great crafting system. Since there are no real questing in this game, you the player has to create all of your gear from scratch. This truly sets everyone at the same level from start to finish. This also makes the game more based on skill and amount of time spent creating your character. Mortal Online also supports a subscribing system, since the game doesn't have 2 types of in game currencies, the only way to support the game financially is to have a sub system. This DOES NOT BREAK THE GAME. No one subscriber gets insanely amazing benefits from subbing. Subscribers get a few more skills they can enhance and a few other things. This makes it fun and playable for f2p gamers.\nBONUS CONTENT: They have a nude setting which I find to be hilarious...\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe overall game play isn't too bad. The mouse settings though are either TOO sensitive or TOO slow, there just doesn't seem to be an in between. Movement is alright and everything seems timed just right. Draw back, there is only first person viewing while playing the game. This goes hand-in-hand with the "hard-core" aspect of game play.\n\nOverall I give this game a 12/10 for nude setting","September 3, 2015","true","56.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Mortal Online also supports a subscribing system, since the game doesn't have 2 types of in game currencies, the only way to support the game financially is to have a sub system. This DOES NOT BREAK THE GAME. No one subscriber gets insanely amazing benefits from subbing. Subscribers get a few more skills they can enhance and a few other things. This makes it fun and playable for f2p gamers.\nBONUS CONTENT: They have a nude setting which I find to be hilarious...\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe overall game play isn't too bad. The mouse settings though are either TOO sensitive or TOO slow, there just doesn't seem to be an in between. Movement is alright and everything seems timed just right. Draw back, there is only first person viewing while playing the game. This goes hand-in-hand with the "hard-core" aspect of game play.\n\nOverall I give this game a 12/10 for nude setting","September 3, 2015","true","56.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

You can be a warrior, a thief, a mage, a do-gooder, or a murderous prick.  You can also be a crafter and make armor, weapons, potions, food, and tame animals and rideable mounts.  You can build houses, castles, entire towns and cities.  The game is first person only.  The combat is a hit based detection system, the melee has directional attacks and blocks that must be correctly timed.\n\nNow remove the NPC quests.  Also toss in some resurrection priests for when you die.  Now make the game online only, with one server for the entire community to play on.\n\nThat's pretty much it.  What to do?  Kill eachother!  Imagine running around in Skyrim trying to kill mobs for loot, then having another dude sneak up on you and murder you.  Just like in Skyrim, you would lose everything you had on you.  You're in a town, and a thief steals your money--same as in Skyrim, but now its another player doing it to you.  The entire drama and story of this game is player created, which means it doesn't end, and everything you do can have real consequences in the form of alliances, wars, etc.\n\nIt's made by a small developer, and therefore can be buggy and slow to update.\n\n8/10\n\n\nTHE LONGER REVIEW OF THE GAME:\n\nOk, so here's a much more detailed review.  I've played this game subscribed on and off for close to 2 years (since fall 2013).  I have multiple accounts, am in one of the larger guilds in the game, but busy life/work schedule keep me from playing much these days.  With that said, here's a non-rage, experienced review by someone who has tried just about every profession, and tried much of what can be done in this game.\n\nThis first person MMO is the closest thing to ultima online out there, and for being committed to that level of freedom, full loot, sandbox experience, in itself separates this game from everything else out there.\n\nThose same things that make this game great also make it difficult to learn, and often frustrating.  The learning curve is steep, and level of time required to become proficient and competitive (in the PvP sense) is high.  I honestly would say it takes a couple months just to really figure the game out.  But I appreciate a challenge, and the combat system is more skill based than most other MMO I've played, which I find far more exciting and rewarding when you win (especially when you nab a kill on someone with good gear or transporting gold--no farming needed today!).  There are very detailed crafting systems, in which discovery and experimentation is incredibly important.  For example, there are NO pre-set recipes for alchemy or food, you just start extracting and refining ingredients from foods (or crazy materials you would never imagine putting into a potion or food) and start mixing and mashing things together and see what happens.   The best weapons, armors, potions, etc, are all tested and figured out by the player community.  There are some things which people have kept secret and even I don't know how something is made / done after playing for years.  The creativity from the game community is impressive.  The politics in this game are also incredible (and sometimes hilarious) to witness, as there is no active PvE story or questline.  Instead, the conflict and story of this game is constantly created due to nothing other than the butting heads of the egos and personalities of the players--sometimes leading to an entire server war lasting weeks or months long.\n\nMy only advice -- group up, get in a guild, or play with a group of friends.  In my experience, this game is not for those who like to go solo.  You will become bored, usually get chased down by roaming bands of veterans looking for easy kills if wandering on your own, or just be outnumbered in most cases.  Even though it's a harsh game, being friendly and meeting others is how this game is best played.  I warn you though, with a full loot sandbox like this, there is a strong troll presence.\n\nI would only recommend this game to those who are patient, mature (can handle murderous griefers trying to ruin your day) and want a challenge - this game will not hold your hand, and neither will I. If you enjoy a complex, full loot persistent world that can be incredibly rewarding.  Whether you want to rush into battles involving dozens (or even hundreds) of actual players trying to bash each others skulls, or discover new alchemy potions that no one else in the world knows, or set up as a merchant and crafter trying to obtain wealth, you get the complete freedom to choose how you want to play the game.  The game mostly revolves around fighting, which is fine by me, but those looking for a deep PvE experience should head elsewhere.\n\nAlso, I would recommend subscribing to the game.  I think the only viable free to play characters would be foot warriors or foot mages, you will be gimped on mounts, and crafting is crap on free to play accounts due to the skill cap.\n\nAs for bugs, over my time in this game they seem to be improving, but you can still have the the occasional glitch that drops you through the world, only to kill your mount and lose your gear, or your mount will suddenly stop following you and run off into the game world.  Or you will be riding along and get stuck on a cactus and someone sees you and kills you, and you can't do anything but watch.  At least they have a very active admin system that can respawn you and your gear and mount for most instances where the game screw you.  Post-steam launch the admins almost always respond to me within 5 minutes or less, which is far better than other MMOs I've played.  Remember, this is an independently developed game comprising a small team.\n\nSo I think this game deserves high praise for everything it has done right, especially given the small team and the limited resources.  They also deserve praise for not selling out and becoming another boring, safe MMO for the sake of trying to bring in more revenue.  I would recommend Mortal Online to anyone who enjoyes a challenging and persistant world MMO.   But, if you just want to jump into some action, and the full loot system just causes you more stress than enjoyment, I would move on to something that provides more immediate action and entertainment.\n\n\n8/10","September 7, 2015","true","754.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The idea of the game sounds great, you live in a fantasy world, doing basic quest, that so far have no sign to show you they're quests. When you first play, you're kind like in a safe mode, where you can't hurt anybody or steal anything, and nobody can do the same to you. But you'll see other players who don't have safe mode, and they just get killed over and over by Higher geared players. You'll read it's a dog eat dog world, but really it's more of, you make a character, you get so far in it till the timer runs out, and then anybody can kill you. If the game worked more like DayZ where you were just tossed into this world and you make your own path, I could understand that, but it doesn't do that very well in this.

There is nothing to do. PvE is a Joke, NPC's are completely boinked. To counter this they gave them the ability to knock you down and render you unable to defend yourself for a few seconds. Unless of course you drop 100 points into a skill that has no use to you besides defending against those knockdowns.\n\n2. Obtaining gear is a huge grind. You need 3 characters to support 1 combat character of your own. Characters that a new player doesn't even know how to build without help from others or extensive research through the forums.\n\n3. Gathering the resources needed to make those characters is mindblowingly tedious for a new player. You will be killed on site by the majority of other players who will also kill your mount(required for gathering) and delete your haul because they themselves probably can't carry it.\n\n4. Min/Max builds, nearly everyone aside from roleplayers are the exact same race/skill build. This varies from month to month as they change aspects of how skills affect things like damage bonus and combat speed. So If you want to stay truely competitive prepare to reroll that character you spent hundreds of gold & hours on every couple of months.\n\n5. Two vastly empty continents, aside from the rediculousness that is Terrority Control. Ride across a wasteland of randomly placed AI that yield nothing of value to you, unless of course you dedicated an entire character to butchering their carcass. Wow look at that huge palisade a player has built, lets see if they are inside, nope! No incentive to login for these players at this point, they are gathering safely while offline thanks to Territory Control.\n\n6. How is your ping? 100, no that will never do. Connect through your phone's wifi or start some torrent downloads as some packetloss and 400 ping will serve you better(Yes people really do this). Watch as your opponent seemingly stands in place attempting to hit you, while you run circles about him with your polesword dispatching him and his friends.\n\n7. Broken weapons, better be packing a polesword(reinging champ) or flanged mace or you are about to get your ♥♥♥♥ pushed in.\n\n8. In-Game staff & forum moderation. These "helpful" fellows are pulled directly from the sesspool that is the Mortal Online community itself. Be careful who you decide to interact with, because chances are they have a friend in high places.\n\n9. Henrik, the CEO. For years we have pleaded with this guy. The entire community is up in arms about the above listed issues, yet he acts on none of them. He is either blind deaf or dumb. Maybe all three.\n\nThank god for steam, otherwise this would have been another deleted post in the MO forums.","November 6, 2015","false","136.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","4"

It breaks the game economy making this a pointless game to spend money on. The game is far from balanced, even though it tries to suggest it is. Archery attacks are crap at best and not accurate at all for damage, speed, or accuracy. their version of mages must be bogged down with having to carry all these encumbering items, so that you fall easy pray to melee characters, and magics must be charged like a Dragonball z  where everyone is annoyed it took 2 epsiodes to charge a attack. The game, due to players and mechanics, revolves around stealing and killing each other, and considering it takes most 30 minutes to a hour to make 1-5 gold, even though there is alot of pve to earn said gold, ( pay players, and only pay players have the ability to steal), steal it from you waiting in droves around the banks so you can not save it,  and bank it, and if you don't bank it, they kill you and run off the moment your not visible to a guard. Making it so players are too scared to leave cities, and keep them in a eternal loop of being robbed, and killed over and over, to generate money for subscribers, bascially if your not paying, it's not worth playing, and it's not worth paying for, cause they can just take what you pay for too. horriable player community. IF you attack them, the guards will kill you, and then the vultures descend on your items. Every crime is punished by death. Without having a paid account your skills will never get high enough to defend against them and run away in time. The only part I liked was the melee combat which is much like Chivilary. Too bad you can't keep gold to get decent items, like melee weapons, armor etc, and if you get lucky enough to keep it, they do soemthing that occurs so much it has it's on nick name, dubbed blue blocking, where they run infront of your attacks on pve to make you hit them, to get the guards to kill you so they can legally steal your stuff. No other language other then english is allowed in their so called help chat either, which isn't even Gm's its the players I just mentioned, help chat is only 48 hours long, and there is a ednless amount of long time players who create alternate characters just to ploy new players into being gulliable so they can take your stuff as well.  They need hcanges and help if they want this to go anywehre and become mainstream. I can not forsee any future in which this game will make the company alot of money since the desgin itself of the economy structure is self deficating, probabaly why most never heard of this 6 year old game, till it came to steam.","November 11, 2015","true","197.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","3"

Got some loot after grinding then went to gather some water and my toe hit the water and it sucked me right in and I drowned then I went to a priest to revive and after that I went to get my loot back and water had sucked my loot into a void and I couldnt get them back. The community is pretty toxic aswell. My friend got blueblocked then killed and I asked: "Why did you have to do that?" and he replied with "Because he deserves it so do you ♥♥♥".\n\nIts a okay game if you have no life and just want to grind and grind after dying and dying.\nNot a game for me but maybe you will find it interesting. Afterall its a free game.","January 15","false","5.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"
