Not only that, but a lack of control customisation leads to a very un-natural feel when playing. If the controls were able to be customised, and gamepad support was properly added (No real option for it, so there's a lot of guesswork with what does what) then this game would probably feel much better.\n\n\nI hope this game gets improved upon. Although to me, it feels like a more budget version of Spelunkey with controls that aren't as good.\n\nIt is charming, though, and I think it has potential (As stated before)","March 16","false","4.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I suffered 2 different crashes within minutes of playing it, the character movements just feel bad(you have no control of how high you can jump so you always jump max jump height which is often much higher then the space you are in so 90% of the time jumping causes you to bounce off of the ceiling above you like and idiot.) and the basic attack/digging range is terrible. Pro tip: Don't make a characters attack radius smaller then the characters head. Worst of all it just looks really bad and has an uninspired art style. Better pixel art characters could be made in minutes with little effort.\n\nJust a flat failure and it will take a complete overhaul to improve it. I don't understand how people have apparently enjoyed this game so far.","May 20","false","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

All of my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I pick the good ones\n\nDig, climb, craft, explore.\n\nShut up and dig is a rogue like adventure game with procedurally generated levels where you dig your way through levels to find gold and also items to craft better equipment. Game has a high difficulty curve as you only start with two hearts at the beginning and one or two mistakes will spell the end of your run. I think this game could use a more detailed tutorial and also store the recipes we discover.","November 10, 2015","true","5.0"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","21","39","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artozis/recommended/414070/","artozis","Artozis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artozis/","1186 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSUAD он же Shut Up And Dig - это достаточно сложный 2D роглайк платформер от отечественных разработчиков, вышедший в раннем доступе Steam. Базовая часть проекта, по сути, завершена. Основная механика игрового процесса создана, осталось добавить больше разновидностей уровней, чем разработчики в данный момент и заняты. Игра получилась отличной, если не брать в учёт кое-какие недостатки, которые, возможно, являются как таковыми лично для меня.\n\nЧто же такого нам предлагает Shut Up And Dig? Классическое управление платформера и огромные уровни, генерируемые при каждом новом прохождении. Главный герой игры – это милая маленькая эльфийка с розовыми волосами, но пусть её внешность вас не обманет, она очень умело владеет киркой и может её использовать не по назначению. Вы можете избирать путь так, как пожелаете. Хотите копать в левую сторону, чувствуя, что там вас ждёт нечто ценное? Ваше право, а может, хотите вниз, вправо или вверх? Пожалуйста! Только будьте осторожны, шахты наполнены различными ловушками и монстрами, которые с радостью помогут распрощаться с жизнью неаккуратному шахтёру. Кроме голодных врагов и смертоносных ловушек, в шахтах вы можете найти различные предметы, которые помогут вам в прохождении, пока вы не допустите хотя бы одну ошибку - игра не прощает ошибок.\n\nНа данный момент, в игре готов один мир, который рассчитан примерно на 10 часов игрового процесса. Автор обещает нам пять различных рандомно генерирующихся типа мира на релизе игры, и, примерно десять секретных мини-миров, каждый из которых имеет своих уникальных противников, игровой процесс и саундтрек. На данный момент игра выглядит очень мрачно и гнетуще, в хорошем смысле. Стиль у SUAD очень привлекательный, спрайты персонажей, противников и мира гармонично сочетаются. Саундтрек и общая звуковая составляющая на уровне, но ничего особенного и запоминающегося вы здесь не услышите.\n\nИгра действительно очень сложная, как и по геймплею так и по освоению в целом. Для того чтобы понять как всё здесь работает, придётся потратить несколько часов, это точно. Множество различных предметов, противников, особенностей и не понятная на первый взгляд система крафта заставят вас с непониманием смотреть в монитор и думать «А что же это такое и зачем это здесь вообще?». Управление в игре, мягко говоря, неудобное. Игра не имеет толкового туториала, нет, она его, конечно, имеет, но после его завершения, лично я ничего не понял и не усвоил, может быть это я такой, не знаю. В отзывах в Steam многие жалуются на неудобное и непонятное управление, возможно, в этом что-то есть?\n\nРазработчики активно занимаются игрой, пытаясь добавить в неё новые особенности: персонажи, эффекты, предметы, а так же исправляют баги. Если всё то, что обещано добавят, в игре можно будет с удовольствием провести несколько десятков часов. В данный момент контента в игре мало, но он качественный. Играть приятно и интересно, неудобное управление не считается.\n\nВ целом, игра хорошая, если вы любите сложность в игровом процессе, в данном случае – хардкор. Действительно, всё очень и очень сложно, казуалы – мимо сразу. Главным достоинством проекта является полная нелинейность игрового процесса, каждое прохождение – уникально и зависит не только от вас, но и от фортуны. Стоит ли в неё играть? Скорее да, чем нет.\n\nИтог: 5/10\n\n*Для ознакомления с игрой ключ предоставил издатель. Этот факт никак не влияет на моё личное мнение об игре, мне за это не платят.\n\nОбзор составлен автором кураторской страницы - "Game Reference"","December 2, 2015","true","6.6"," 19 of 42 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","19","42","4","1"
