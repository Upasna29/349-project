This makes it prone to network errors like never before. We all know Duels 2013 & 2014 had network problems. Now get ready for that, but about 5 times more than before. Not exaggerating.\n\nOrganising a 2HG game with just 1 friend is a complete and utter trainwreck. Try to play 4 games of 2HG with 1 friend; you will give up before you make it to 4. Now try with 3 friends. You'll want to stick forks in your eyes.\n\nThis is how bad it is:\n* Sometimes you finally manage to start the game and your friend has been put on the opposite team.\n* Sometimes you finish a game only to realise your friend hasn't finished. .... You weren't even in the same game, and you didn't know.\n\nWait.\n\nWhat?\n\nYes.\n\nReally.\n\nHow is that possible? How can you play a whole game and not realise your teammate is AI?\n\nThat's how bad it is! Because here's the utter brilliance of Stainless Steel's game design: they didn't just remove chat entirely, they also removed AI names upon AI takeover, so if someone's not a human, you can't tell. At all.\n\nAnd the beautiful part is that you don't even know. How many games have you played with a random human teammate?\n\nNow.... how many of those games were actually using an AI teammate? You don't know, do you?\n\nIt gets better.\n\nIn 2HG, if someone leaves, a message appears to tell you, then disappears. This message disappears automatically, and very quickly. So let's say you look out the window for 2 seconds, and someone leaves.\n\nYou have no way of knowing.\n\nBut wait. Let's say you look out the window for 2 seconds and someone _doesn't_ leave.\n\nYou still have no way of knowing.\n\nAnd then it dawns on you. If you ever, for a second, look away from the screen in 2HG, you're done. You're in the dark for the rest of the game. You honestly, no-lie, can not tell if players are human or AI. You are completely cut off; there's no way you can communicate anything to figure out if you're even having a game with a human. Years later, you still won't know.\n\nSo why aren't people making more of a stink about this? Because they can't tell it's happening. It's that legit. The only way I discovered that this happens is through Steam. If I'm playing with a random teammate, I will simply never know.\n\nAnd now I'm telling you, in 2016, this has still happened twice in one night. Scary, isn't it? This is literally starting to sound like a conspiracy theory, it's that idiotic.\n\nThe next 2HG game you play, you will wonder. And once you start wondering, you will realise just how bad it is. You have no way of knowing. You will never know.\n\n\n3 & 4 player FFA, gone.\nHold priority, gone.\nAI takeover toggle, gone.\n\nUn-confirming attackers or blockers if your teammate changes his attackers or blockers, also gone. Yeah that's never useful is it, especially when you can't even chat. If your teammate has already confirmed, you can't tell unless you confirm, and then it's too late.\n\n\n\nLike many others have said. Wizards, get rid of Stainless. Get some college team to do a better job than their crap, which just sheds features every year to the point where I feel like Will Ferrell saying "I'm not even mad, that's amazing!"\n\n\nBecause when I just now had a game where I couldn't chat to my team-mate in order to ask him if he was a human or not... I had to laugh. Stainless, you're amazing.\n\nWhat a fail.","July 30, 2015","false","138.7"," 1,134 of 1,347 people (84%) found this review helpful 183 people found this review funny","84","134","1","183","81"

They did NOT do that, they have missed every expansion release.\n\nWhen Stainless (the developers) missed out the MTG expansion 'Oath of the Gatewatch' completely (it wasn't late, they actually missed it), they tried to pass it off, they said instead of releasing this expansion, they would work on all the bugs and problems in the game, and then bundle that expansion with the next expansion 'Shadows Over Innistrad'.\n\nNow that Shadows Over Innistrad is here, we are all very disappointed,  the game has become almost unplayable.\n\nMTG has TWO main phases, if you have abilities on the board and/or instants in your hand, this client REMOVES both of your main phases.

This is the FIRST and ONLY time that Stainless has managed to release the game on time, and it is nearly unplayable.\n\nMTG is complex, you have to play around your opponent, now, you have to play around the game client as well.\n\nAs I type this, the Reddit Forum for this game is an orchestra of complaints.\n\nI love MTG - I want to love Duels, but, in its current state - I cannot recommend MTG Duels","April 9","false","497.4"," 254 of 313 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","254","313","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hybel/recommended/316010/","Hybel","Couchfighter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hybel/","236 products in account","General Impressions:\nUpdate 23/10/15: Just published a video review/letsplay/rant about the game also that can be viewed here, for anyone curious: https://youtu.be/XJrmefG17aw\n\nFree to play Magic: The Gathering presented in the style of the earlier 'Duels of the Planeswalkers' games.  No exclusive content that can't be earned with in game currency. The game uses a selection of cards from the latest 'Origins' set.\n\nMagic Duels is plagued with bugs, ranging from inexplicable launch errors preventing many from playing the game, to infinite loading screens and some instances of cards not following the rules.  There is also an unreasonable DX 11 hardware requirement which is plain sloppy programming, Duels could easily be software rendered.\n\nPlaying Duels online can really push my patience to its limits sometimes.  Matchmaking fails most of the time, I often have to search 5+ times before finding an opponent, and getting into a match of 2HG has been 100% impossible.  Players can avoid losing rank from losses very easily, making the whole mode a joke.  Also, people playing this better enjoy battling poor AI opponents, since whenever you play a person in any mode, if there's a slight connection hiccup of any kind or the server acts up, your opponent gets replaced with the AI.\n\nI can't in good conscience recommend the game to anyone in its current state, it is simply not release ready and I'd strongly discourage anyone from spending real money in the game until drastic measures are taken by the developers to improve just about all aspects of the game.  Those desperate for a decent F2P MtG experience (such as myself) may be willing to forgive a lot of the shortcomings and problems this game suffers.  It is frustrating, there's potential for a lot of good MtG cardslinging with this release, but it needs SO much work to be considered a good game.\n\nUnfortunately I have little faith of Magic Duels recieving any of these much needed improvements simply because of the track record of the developer, Stainless Games, which despite imaginative boasts on their website are responsible for a lot of bad releases, from the recently released Carmageddon game which is a complete wreck (in all the wrong ways) to all the previous 'DotP' iterations, which ALL have had bugs and problems of varying magnitude that were never fixed.  The amateurish online functionality in particular is something that has plagued all the earlier versions of 'DotP' and never seen improvements.\n\n\nThe Good Stuff:\nFree to play MtG is in itself a very good thing.\n\nTutorials, while annoying for experts, do a good job of teaching the basics of MtG for new players and also provide a quick shot of ingame currency for booster packs.\n\nInviting interface, easy to play with either mouse or a controller.\n\nWhile you typically face certain easy to make deck types in online matches, the card selection is varied enough to allow for many diverse decks.\n\nVery fair monetization.  Collecting currency for booster packs is easy, and there are no direct advantages offered by paying real money, other than saving yourself time.\nThe Bad Stuff:\nBugs, bugs, bugs.  Cards become invisible, graphical glitches making either the table or your cards turn invisible or black, bugged cards that don't follow the rules.  Many can not launch the game, instead greeted with black screen or a crash.  Interface bugs, not allowing menu elements to be used, or making them flash up nonstop.\n\nThe online functionality is a complete mess.  The worst I have seen in a long time.  1v1 ranked matches often take 5-10 attempts before successfully finding and loading a match with an opponent, and getting a match of the popular 2 Headed Giant mode is even worse.  In a couple hours of repeatedly trying to play the mode I have not managed to get a single damn match going.  When I do get a 1v1 match going there are often lag spikes or constant lag, which can make you misplay cards or not be able to pause at critical moments to use instant abilities.  Servers are, still, very unstable and it is common to see your opponent get dropped from a game, very obvious when they suddenly drop out when they're just about to beat you.\n\nIn online matches, a bad AI takes over whenever opponents either get dropped, quit or concede from a match.  This is an insult, if my opponent scoops out I shouldn't have to keep fighting a second opponent, the match should be over.  No excuses for this.  Defenders say it is to prevent exploiting ingame currency farming but .. no.  Just, no.  It is extremely dull to so often have to battle the AI, and feels like the winner of the match is the one getting punished when the opponent quits.  Not to mention if the AI pulls a miracle and does a comeback and wins the match, the remaining player also loses gold and rank, an extra slap in the face considering the very real possibility the opponent quit the game with an exploit to prevent himself losing rank.\n\nThe online ranked structure itself is a complete joke.  Players start at rank 0 and climb/drop 1 rank per match. Rank 40 is max.  That's it.  So little thought went into the online structure it would be comical, if it wasn't so sad.  The ease of exploiting to save yourself from losing ranks further remove any semblance of accomlishment or prestige from climbing the ranked ladder.\n\nVery unreasonable hardware requirements.  Magic Duels requires both a DirectX 11 compatible video card, and a sound card to run, for no logical reason.  This is lazy programming for a simple looking turn based card game that could easily be programmed to be 100% cpu rendered.  The sound is also something many will just turn off, requiring a sound card to run the game is.. really weird.  On top of that the game lists as being Vista compatible, which it has been proven to absolutely not be.  (Vista users might want to think about updating soon, tho, just saying)\n\nDuels can be played on PC, Xbox One and Iphone/pad, but has no cross platform multiplayer, and not even a way to use the same account between the platforms.\n\n\nBut Couchfighter, why do you have so many hours on this game, or even play it right now if you don't like it? You silly goose!\nI'm so glad you asked, here's two reasons!\n\n1.  I still wanted to complete the current card set, and gather up some coins for the next release, in the small hope that Duels recieves the many improvements it needs.\n\n2.  In those cases when you actually get a working match without lag/bugs/crashes, Duels can be rather enjoyable indeed for a casual MtG enthusiast such as myself.\n\nDoes that make up for the myriad of big problems the game has, that some like to pretend don't exist? No, I'm afraid it doesn't.  If and when Duels gets the many fixes it needs I will be the first to turn that review thumb pointing the other way but until that happens, as a whole, I do not recommend Duels.","August 22, 2015","false","572.3"," 438 of 563 people (78%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","78","438","563","19","39"

Therefore, it may be invalid for (returning) veteran players.\n\nMagic Duels: Origins (a.k.a. Magic Duels) is the digital version of famous TCG (trading Card game); Magic: The Gathering. Unlike previous digital versions of the game, this game is designed as free to play (f2p). There is in-game coin and booster pack store. Booster packs can be bought with coin. Players can earn coin by winning, completing daily missions or buy it directly with real money. I find the store and amounts earned fair enough, because TCGs are based on spending money on new sets and booster packs by nature. Also, all cards are unlockable, so spending money is not mandatory.\n\nGame’s most noticeable part is its tutorial. It has an extensive tutorial showing the player every rule and beginning level gameplay of Magic: The Gathering. Its design is also nice. Unlike showing all aspects of the game in one go, it teaches the basics at the beginning and sends the player to the story mode. During story mode, if a situation arises such as a new type of card or an ability on a card, a notification asks the player if he/she wishes to play tutorial for it. Playing that tutorial pauses the current game and starts the tutorial. After tutorial is finished, interrupted game continues. It is possible to skip these tutorials and play them later from the menu. Every tutorial also gives a small amount of coin, so it is a good idea to complete them all.\n\nFirst “basics tutorial” and first story mission are kind of mandatory. Because most features are locked until they are finished. After that, the game sends the player to create his/her fist deck and lets the player to have a solo battle. When solo battle is finished all features are unlocked. This way of unlocking the features is not a problem for newbies. Actually it can even be considered a good choice to prevent newbies from losing in multiplayer too much, resulting them dropping the game. But for veterans, it is a big problem. They already know the game and want to jump right in multiplayer with their custom decks.\n\nOther than the story mode, game has solo battle mode which is against AI, versus mode which is against another player and two-headed giant mode which is 2 vs 2 mode against either AI or other players (The player needs to invite his/her friend to able play against AI).\n\nSolo battle can be played against 3 different difficulties. Interestingly though, “Hard” difficulty feels the easiest. These battles give coins depending on the difficulty (5 to 15 coins).\n\nVersus mode can be played against either a friend or an opponent that is ranked the same as the player. The rank of the player changes depending on the result of the matched battle. Battles against friends and AI don’t affect ranking. Also battles against friends don’t give coins. Matched versus battles gives 20 coins.\n\nTwo headed giant mode is the only multiplayer mode where more than two players play together. 4 players split into two teams of two players and battle. Team players share the life and a player can block an attack against his/her teammate. A Player’s teammate’s hand is visible but interacting with it is not allowed. This also apply cards on the board. Players can’t use abilities on their teammates cards. Two-headed giant mode doesn’t affect ranking. It also doesn’t give coins.\n\nUI is good and clear. There are no unnecessary animations or information bombard. Most of the in-game actions (such as attack animations of the cards) can be toggled in the settings. That said, I read veterans don’t like this UI. Until “Magic 2014” it was different, and indeed there are big changes. When I checked 2014 version myself, I realized that both button locations and general information design had big differences. For a newbie, it won’t matter. Actually I like the new one more. In the old UI, it felt weird not to be able see how many cards my opponent had in his/her hand. For veterans though, it will feel like switching from Mac OS to Windows.\n\nIt appears that previous editions had also chat feature and it was removed in this version. There are mixed opinions on this subject. Personally, I don’t think it is a must have but it certainly could be useful, especially in two-headed giant mode. it is impossible to talk to teammate if the player is playing together with a random player. That said, if the player is playing with a friend, he/she can use steam chat to overcome this.\n\nBooster packs contains 3 common cards, 2 uncommon cards and 1 rare or mythic rare card (total 6 cards). Also packs can’t drop the cards that reached its deck limit so eventually every card is unlocked. Every booster pack is 150 coins. Winning against hard AI gives 15 coins and winning against a player gives 20 coins. Daily missions and weekly mission give 40 coins (there are up to 3 daily missions and one weekly mission). It is said that about 80 booster packs are required to unlock all cards. But there is a daily coin limit (400 coins) so players can’t grind coins (note that daily missions are not counted towards the limit).\n\nDuring my gameplay, I came across one serious and one minor bug. Serious bug was that during my solo battle against the easy AI, it played 5 of the same card which is clearly against the game rules. (Note: a developer responded to my screenshot of this issue and wrote that they were going to investigate it). Minor bug was that the coin amount was not being updated after completion of the daily missions. It required (and still does) a restart to be fixed.\n\nI didn’t have any issues finding opponents in both versus mode and two-headed giant mode. Also my test for steam friend invite worked without any issues (I need to note that I tested friend invite with only one of my friends, so it might be just luck).\n\nPros:+ Extensive Tutorial: This is very good for newbies to Magic: The Gathering game.\n+ Same Drop Limit: Thanks to this limit, all cards are eventually unlocked.\n+ Simplistic: All menus and buttons are cleverly put together in a clear and simple manner. (Although, there are big changes)\n\nCons:- Mandatory Single Play: This is only a con for veterans. As a side effect of the tutorial, some single play elements must be finished before multiplayer modes are unlocked.\n- Daily Coin Cap: Normally this is not a very big issue. But because of the ability to buy coins with real money, this creates a “pay to win” side.\n\nVerdict:I can safely assume that Magic Duels is designed to make new players interested in Magic: The Gathering title and not as a solo product to make money. Due to its extensive tutorial, it is very easy to learn the basics of Magic: The Gathering. As a newbie to the title myself, I can recommend this to everyone who wants to learn (or at least try) Magic: The Gathering.\n\n\nP.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide (Note: this game is f2p but has in-game shop to buy coins so the rule still applies).\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nEdit: Fixed some typos","November 18, 2015","true","34.1"," 191 of 235 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","191","235","7","9"

I cannot recommend this game either now, or when I first reviewed it.\n\nIMPORTANT N.B : This game, as of the latest patch(April 2016 - Shadows Over Innistrad) is borderline unplayable, due a severe bug having been introduced concerning the way that priority and turn progression are handled in game(the game will automatically skip main phases, if you only have instant speed plays available). The bug in question has broken many of the game's available cards and mechanics. Players with some prior experience with Magic The Gathering might find the following links particularly interesting, as well as new players who are keen on learning how to play Magic :-\n\n- Wizards Announcement about Priority Bug\n\n- Devs--this is why your new priority system does not work.\n\n- Hold Priority Bug Is TOP PRIORITY bug fix guys!\n\n- New Priority Passing was a design decision\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCNrlVjzBfk\nPlease take a moment to contact Wizards directly by email and report this bug to them( wizardscusthelp@wizards.com ), Facebook( https://www.facebook.com/magicduels ) and Twitter( https://twitter.com/magic_duels ). Please also contribute to the debate on Duels' Subreddit and here in Duels' Steam discussion group. Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nMajor Problems I have encountered with this game so far :-\n\nAfter using my gold to buy boosters to complete sets, I was not given the boosters I paid for. This was made worse by the fact that I paid for my gold with real money.\n\nNumerous cards have been bugged or broken with each release and have been left unfixed for 3 or more months, which has been the frequency thus far, at which the developers release patches.\n\nThe game has a tendency to randomly hang mid-turn when playing vs matches against human opponents online, requiring you to either concede and lose rank, or terminate the game's process and restart the game.\n\nThe game on occasion prevents you from stopping the phase transition clock, which can prevent you from casting spells.\n\nAfter the last patch(April 2016 - Shadows Over Innistrad), they broke all decks players had built prior to update, in such a way that would leave the game hanging indefinitely whilst loading solo A.I. matches. This required players to delete all their decks and rebuild them all from scratch.\n\nTrying to connect to a vs match against somebody online usually takes between 5 and 15 minutes, with the game either repeatedly disconnecting for no reason, or hanging in an unrecoverable way that requires the player to terminate the game's process and restart the game.\n\nAnti-aliasing and shadow casting in the game has been broken since launch. This makes the edges in game geometry(e.g. cards) jagged and shadows appear as solid black blocks.\n\nThere are also many minor problems the game either has, or has had that are too numerous to list here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game's development and release cycle thus far :-\n\nThey released the game at the end of July 2015. The game was due to receive the Battle For Zendikar update late September, Wizards announced on release day that the update had been delayed indefinitely, they didn't provide a future date. The Battle For Zendikar update was eventually released late November, they didn't announce its release, they simply announced the game was going into extended maintenance and went ahead and did it. The game was due to receive the Oath Of The Gatewatch update mid to late January, but the update was delayed until April to coincide with the Shadows Over Innistrad release, the game received no bug patches between November and April either. Both the Oath Of The Gatewatch and Shadows Over Innistrad updates were released early April, this update introduced more bugs than it fixed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Analysis :-\n\nAlmost every update released for this game has been delayed, bug patches have been infrequent and low impact.\n\nThis game violates multiple rules of paper Magic The Gathering. Turn phases do not work the same way, there is no upkeep phase for example, which renders some spells less effective. The game does not permit 4 of any non basic land card to be played in a deck as per constructed rules, instead, card count is restricted by rarity. 1x Mythic, 2x Rare, 3x Uncommon, 4x Common. This causes severe balancing issues to occur, because all of the cards featured in this game, are designed and play tested around the common rule that up to 4 copies of any card may be played.\n\nSet releases are incomplete, they do not release every card in each set, with between a third and a half of each set excluded, this further causes balancing issues and substantially reduces the quality of the content this game has to offer, as many fun, low impact cards are excluded, as well as some of the more popular cards each set has to offer.\n\nThe game features a collection of starter box cards from many past and present sets and because these cards have not been balanced, or developed alongside recent set releases; which consist mostly of current Standard legal cards, they can and have caused severe balancing issues that are left unfixed for months on end between updates, this can make the game tedious and repetitive to play. This problem would be substantially less severe, if they invested more time into analyzing the impact the cards in question are likely to have on the format and/or if they more frequently patched the game.\n\nWizards of the Coast, who own the Magic The Gathering franchise, are notoriously averse to investing in or committing to products that deviate from their core business, which is paper Magic The Gathering. Because of this, Magic Duels does not presently have the resources either financial, human or otherwise to become the successful, feature rich digital trading card game that long term players such as myself know it can be, and until this changes, this game will not fulfill its potential.\n\nThere have been recent indications(2015 / 2016) that their attitude towards digitizing their game may be evolving to a degree, but as things presently stand, this game seems to have only minimal support of its owners ergo, its long term future looks bleak, which should be foremost on your mind if you intend to buy content or invest substantial amounts of your time into collecting cards and building decks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion :-\n\nHaving devoted nearly a thousand hours of my time to this game, I am regretfully going to have to walk away from it, at least until they fix the Hold Priority bug introduced in the latest update(April 2016 - Shadows Over Innistrad), which has caused widespread malfunction throughout its cards and mechanics.\n\nOn the whole, I cannot recommend this game, either to players who are new to Magic The Gathering, or to experienced long term players. I would especially advise players looking to use Magic Duels to learn how to play paper Magic The Gathering to steer clear, because the two are significantly different.\n\nBottom line... Keep an eye on this game, its owners may well get behind it at some point in the future and if they do, it'll become truly great, but right now(2016) your time would be better invested elsewhere.","April 13","false","067.1"," 98 of 108 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","98","108","12","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/recommended/316010/","verticalcleave","landwhale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/","831 products in account","By some miracle of ineptitude, Magic Duels somehow manages to be worse than DotP 2015 across the board. In terms of game design, gameplay content, the cash shop, and even down to the card selection, this is by far the worst work by Stainless Games yet. Wizards need to seriously re-evaluate their digital presence and either needs to find a new studio to work on these games or stop making them altogether.\n\nGone are the extra game modes, challenges, and even campaign deck construction of previous years. Instead, we have a 20 mission campaign (with unadjustable difficulty) with tutorials sprinkled throughout that can only be played with uneditable decks that get "upgraded" after completing missions. How are they upgraded? It's hard to tell, since most of them are very bad from the start and the game doesn't tell you what changes it makes to your deck. Gideon's deck is the most playable and even that is just dumping your hand and turning everything sideways. I get the feeling that they thought that cramming the challenges of old DotP games into this game's campaign would be a good idea but it really doesn't work. This campaign is (once again!) a terrible introduction to MTG for new players since it ignores deck construction, has a locked difficulty, and has many purposefully unbalanced fights.\n\nOnce you finish the very short singleplayer content, you have the incredibly deep and rewarding online play to look forward to. 2-Headed Giant is back! ...But you can't get coin rewards from it. There's a ladder system and matchmaking system finally! ...But server/game crashes and disconnects will give you no rewards. You can quickly play games through Steam invites with your friends! ...But there's no rewards. Playing MTG is fun and all but its frustrating when everyone is playing with the same trash and new boosters are hard to come by because of the stingy cash shop system. Even if you do decide to sink some cash into this game, you're only getting SIX cards per booster! Physical MTG boosters, while in all honesty are meant to be played in Sealed or Draft and not solely to be cracked for value, at least have 15 cards in them for a MSRP of $4. At the worst conversion rate, you're looking at spending $2 for a six card booster. At $39.99 for 7500 coins, you're spending roughly $0.80 per six card booster... but at this point why not spend your $40 on actual MTG cards (or a new video game)? The worst part about this is that even if you do get the most bang for your buck with the coins, you are still gambling on boosters and aren't guaranteed to unlock every card.\n\nOpening overpriced boosters might be acceptable if they had anything worth playing inside of them. Origins is the worst core set I have ever played with, full of worse version of old cards that are purposefully designed to be weaker and/or bad. This set has the format design of MM2015 (which was also terrible to actually play with and people just rare drafted it) and the mechanics design of Theros (Renown is an obvious leftover from Theros's crap keywords). Do not waste your money on physical or digital boosters of this product.\n\nIt amazes me why Wizards hates money so much. I understand they want people to dump their money into either physical product or the digital variants available on MTGO, but then why release a barebones mobile game every YEAR then? These games make the MTG brand look bad (because MTGO is poorly advertised) and with every annual release, the DotP series is on the front of everyone's desks. Did reviewers see the improvements to MTGO's UI and layout during its last upgrade? Not really, because MTGO has been out for 13 years. Did reviewers see Stainless drop a complete turd the past two years, with more content stripped from each annual release and with more cash grab attempts built in? Even if reviewers haven't, the playerbase sure has noticed it judging by Steam reviews.\n\nWizards needs to wake up and find a new dev to work on these games. Stainless has been dragging their ♥♥♥ since the beginning of the DotP series; releasing cookie-cutter annual rehashes with slightly different cards every year, and with recent years actually removing content. Even with being a free2play CCG, this isn't worth your time because of the cut content, lack of polish, always-online connectivity, and incredibly stingy rewards for online play.","August 2, 2015","false","10.1"," 556 of 770 people (72%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","72","556","770","37","28"

Since then it's been going downhill. True, you couldn't make your own deck from scratch; but atleast some of the cards implemented were interesting. The most interesting thing I could find in this game was thopter spy-network, imo, and even then.. I dunno, to me it just seems like the games are starting to lose the point of what I thought about was fun about mtg in the first place.\n\nI have a deck in physical form, which, among other things, contain the card Mindmoil and the card Niv-Mizzet the Firemind. This basically means that I cycle through my entire deck, casting random spells and deal dmg all over the place to enemies in all directions. Odd combos like these are what makes magic fun and interesting to me.\nDuels 2012 had some of the same aspects. I remember equipping Basillisk Collar onto a pestilence demon, accidentally clearing the entire board and gain over 100 hp in the process. Events like these seem neigh impossible with the current cards implemented. It's all just very... Tedious...\n\nDoes this mean you won't appreciate the game?\nIf you can enjoy competitive play no matter what kind of deck you're playing and if you can actually get the game working, sure why not?\n\nBut I can't recommend this to you.\n\n","July 30, 2015","false","3.7"," 301 of 412 people (73%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","73","301","412","13","0"

There are a lot of drops when trying to connect with an opponent, which is quite annoying.  I have not encountered, but have seen reported, a slew of other connectivity concerns,\n-In game bugs.  While somewhat consistent, there are times when the game bugs out pretty severely.  I had an issue where I got locked into a zoom in on a card which caused me to lose a game.\n-While I have not encountered this issue, there have been reports that cards have disappeared from collections, including from purchased packs.\n\nAnnoyances (less major issues):\n\n-Opponent concessions.  When your opponent concedes the game, they are then replaced with an AI opponent.  If you happen to lose to that opponent, you receive a loss and drop in rank.  When an opponent concedes, this should be treated as if you have won the match.\n-Daily quests.  All the quests I have encountered reward 40 coins, which is a fine reward for most quests.  However, some quests require twice the number of wins as other quests, sometimes with the same parameters.  For example, yesterday I had two quests that both rewarded 40 coins.  On required me to win 2 games with a Blue Red deck, while the other required me to win 4.  The coin reward for these more time consuming quests should be greater.\n-"Archetype" quests.  Quests ask you to win with archetype decks.  However, these decks cannot be entirely of your own design.  Instead, you have to work your way through the aided deck construction generator which, while great for beginners, is pretty limiting for experienced players.  This is especially the case due to the fact that this deck generation only works on the cards you already own.  So, if you have a quest for a color combination for which you lack strong cards, you're in a bad spot.  I would rather these quests allow all the cards you own and individual deck creation or pull from additional cards that you do not yet own that make these archetype decks a bit more consistent.\n-Deck construction UI.  Minor concern, but it is a pain to make decks in the advanced deck creation UI.  The inability to sort cards once they've been added to the deck is annoying.  I'd like to be able to lay my deck out, or at least get more statistics about my deck before I finalize it.\n-Land selection. Another minor concern, but the art on your lands are essentially randomly assigned.  If you'd like to have only one design on your lands, you're out of luck.\n\nLike I said at the top, there is a lot of potential in this game, but I don't think it's worth spending any real money on just yet.","August 9, 2015","false","27.0"," 135 of 176 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","135","176","8","0"

As is would not recommend at all.  Some examples:\n\nUI:\n--  UI is laggy.  When leaving a menu you have to wait several seconds before you can actually click anything.\n--  When popups with choices come up, like those for Desecration Demon, the selection screen blocks the play area, and there is no way to move it aside or peek at your board.  Once you make your choice there's no going back.\n--  No voice acting or sound in the cutscenes.  Very awkward.\n--  Clicking the text for an option does not work.  It has been standard in games for years now, that clicking the text also clicks the box.  You don't realize how annoying not having this is, until you play a game like this one where it's gone.\n--  You can't separate the opponent's land to see which ones they have.\n\nGameplay:\n--  The AI is bad.  It will do stuff like Languish it's own board when you have no creatures.\n--  They want to charge for cards, but the deck restrictions aren't the same as magic.\n--  There's no way to see what's in your deck when you start a story mission.  Very annoying.\n--  The reaction interface is very bad.  Most games let you skip to next turn, skip to next main phase, etc.  This one has a 5 second timer and then it plows ahead.  It's not clear whether or not you are reacting or if you're in one of the main phases.  The order battles are resolved is arbitrary instead of standard magic rules.\n--  Large AI slowdowns for seemingly simple play states.  Not sure why sometimes it takes the computer 30s to decide what to play on turn 2.\n\nGraphics:\n--  Very ugly presentation.  Small cards on a large bland playmat.  No colors or customization options.\n--  Minimal interface, but no unifying theme or artistic direction.\n\nOverall a very poor implementaiton of Magic.  I'd recommend the official MTG client over this.

Almost all dual lands are given to you at the start and foiling all copies of a card only costs 5 gold (regardless of rarity). Buying boosters costs around 1-2$ per pack depending on the rate and exchange ratio.\n- Expect decent content updates: it's promised that this version of the game will be constantly updated with around 70-80% of the cards from each new block of card releases (every 3 months).\n- AI has access to every card so there is / will be massive variety even with single player play, and the AI's deck you play against are randomized every time you play.\n- AI is proficiently programmed in regards to most keywords (more on that below).\n- Two-Headed Giant is back.\n- Full deck building: Want to make that Penta-colour deck filled with bombs and flavor of the month? Now you can!\n- A very good tutorial system: The tutorial teaches you the basics through game play, when new keywords pop up during a campaign, you are often given the choice of jumping into a short tutorial scenario (half a minute to a minute) for the keyword to earn some free gold, or you can just skip them all together.\n\nThe ambiguous:\n- Rarity restrictions: 4 commons, 3 uncommons, 2 rares, 1 Mythic. This restricts the potential power and consistency of decks and requires different planning of cards, but also in a way reduces the potential Mythic bombs and makes the disadvantage for newcomers smaller.\n- Two-Headed Giant and duels with friends grants no gold, understandable from a F2P perspective.\n- AI takes over for players if someone concedes.\n- A basic campaign that's atleast better than most I've seen from online tcg's, with a story, custom artwork, and a cutscene at the end.\n- UI is mostly functional but also lack customization options.\n- 30 deck slots.\n\nThe cons:\n- Attrocious launch, disconnects, and bugs for alot of people.\n- No trading.\n- No cross-play between platforms.\n- Always-online requirements.\n- Chatting is gone (though some might consider this a positive).\n- Lobbies are gone.\n- No FFA / 3v3 / 4v4 / additional formats.\n- You have to finish the game against the AI after someone concedes if you want the gold reward.\n- The AI programming is flawed when it comes to dropping creatures on second main phase even if it has an ability that impacts the board prior to combat phase.\n- The deck builder could be improved upon with more sort and filter options.\n\nAll in all I see alot of potential in this title as the card pool increases and bugs get ironed out. For me the full deck building aspect, decent amount of card slots, decent solo experience, and the F2P model was enough to sway me over to bear with the launch server problems and other bugs.

There is literally nothing to do apart from grinding your teeth in 1v1.\nLadder climbing is yet again pointless and not rewarded with anything.\n\nGrind fest.\nYou must pay (~60$) or play 5 hours a day for a month to purchase all cards for gold thanks to gold earned per day limitation.\n\nCard base is tiny.\nWe have only ONE BASIC set. Avalible cards yet again are poor compared to what we could expect leading to the fact that we are limited to like 3 competitive deck techs from one archetype. That's unacceptable and boring.\n\nStupid deck limitation.\nYou can put 4 commons, 3 uncommons, 2 rares and 1 mythic in a deck. Feels like entry level tournament restrictions towards experienced players and towards overall entertainment from the game.\n\nQuest system is awfully implemented.\nFirst, 40g avg. per day feels way too low when 6 random cards will cost you 150.\nSecondly, you get credit only if you constructed deck via manager. And yes, you won't get any reward for playing with a friend.\n\nInterface is utter ♥♥♥♥.\nYou can ez skip your attack because of poor implementation. You need to confirm almost every step. UI itself is built for consoles and feels pointless when playing on PC.\nThere are some annoying flaws like you need to chose your deck every time you want to play it. Apparently it's hard to save player choice in 2015.\n\nLoad times are terrible.\nEvery time action take place there is a few second wait time. Can't see a reason behind such a time waste.\n\nCampaign is short and boring.\n25 duels with almost basic decks is too much. Let's take Jace campaign. You will play 5 matches with mill deck in a row which is utterly boring considering 2 matches are mill vs. mill!\n\nYou can't skip tutorial.\nEven if you're pro. Even if you're played MTG for more than 10 years. You just can't. On top of that I highly doubt it will teach newbie something apart from point and clicking where the pointer is.

There is no confidence in not having such issues in future.\n\nSummary:\nAvoid this product. Play MTGO or DotP 2013 (even Shandalar 1997 from MicroProse is way better) if you're a fan of MTG. Especially if you're planning to spend money for cards.\nIf you're new to the genre and want to give your brain some practice, have a look on Heartstone.

A short campaign in this game is fine in my opinion but if you want some sort of replayable long campaign, this is not the game. Also after your first run it does not give you anymore coins making it a waste of time, if you could still get some sort of income from it, i would of replayed it a few times. Some of the individual stories are good, and the charactors actions make sense and i can see someone reacting that way to the situation, but some parts seem a little random/forced and it's obvious they didnt put too much thought into them, but i don't think anyone plays magic for the campaign/story so that's not too bad. Also during one of the stages of the elf campaign there are cards that are in the game but you cant see or unlock them any where else meaning they are holding back content from launch, which is something that literally anyone, ANYONE would tell you that is a really bad thing to do that no one likes, but because of the lack of cards this could be due to balance as those cards are OP compared to all the current cards ingame, but seeing as how they were in past games if they just had all the cards from those games they wouldn't be OP beacuse they were balanced in those.\n\nOn to the Multiplayer, the removal of lobbies is one of the worst things they have done to the Magic games, it makes 2v2s with a friend almost impossible, either one person gets an error or both do or an endless loading screen. Now when i say they removed lobbies, that's not exactly what they did, they made it so you don't have an option of hosting a game, or joining one and it just instantly starts. If it makes you host one (happens beyond rarely) it works 95% of the time, the other 5% you are on other teams (how does that even happen?) and when it tries to make you join a game the person you invited will have to reselect his deck and somehow that breaks it and he can no longer join, and the person who invited him either gets a loading screen for 20+ seconds that ends with an error or he gets put in a game with a random person on your team that you are either forced to play with or dodge the game and make him play with a AI (which makes me feel bad doing that) talking about playing with a random person in 2v2s, you can't see their deck before the game starts so you have no idea if you guys will be a good match together until the game starts (No chat doesnt help either), and if you aren't it's too late. Also because theres no true lobby, there is no way to rematch someone which is bad in a versus game based on RNG, some people would like to play the same person again because they lost cause of a bad draw, and wants to see if their deck is actually better in a larger sample size. In the older games you could change your deck and fight the same person again which was also great. Another thing is there is no chat box. I can understand not having voice chat, but no chat box? Having no communication in a multiplayer game like this is beyond silly, especially in 2v2s, talking to your teammate is a really good thing this game should have, the multiplayer is so incomplete and bugged. I don't understand why they didn't think to add those features and how those bugs even got pass one day of testing.\n\nSo 2v2s are impossible to play over 95% of the time, this is so broken i have no idea how they did that, seriously.\nThe 1v1s are perfectly fine and work as it should, so atleast thats something.\n\nNow we'll talk about unlocking cards and content ingeneral.\nI really, really don't like the lock on how many coins you can get a day, it's a really hard cap too. Instead of having a cap they should have had a lesser percentage for the day based on how many coins you have gotten, i'd rather them have\nnothing but they wont do that cause they need to make money somehow (boosters), they are a business so you can't expect them to not have some sort of money grab in a f2p game. Speaking of boosters, i feel like they should have color themed Boosters but i can see how that wouldn't be necessary as of right now due to the lack of cards which is a bad thing, moving onto that...\nI don't like how most of the cards in the previous games aren't in this one, i don't get why they would do that, but intime im pretty sure they will all be back, but until then that's a huge, HUGE thing that's horrible, game's should not remove core content from previous games, it's devolving and just not right. Now the gameplay is great, if you like the way magic works, you'll like it, it's simple really, it's a shame the rest of the game isn't good enough to match the perfectly good gameplay, it would make this the best sorce of playing Magic.\n\nAlso a little bug that i think is worth mentioning cause i really hate it when games do this, if you have lowered the in-game sound it does not change the opening game sounds and keeps them at full, this is very, very annoying as it is really loud compared to other sound sorces on my PC when im just on it doing my regular stuff. (teamspeak, twitch, background music)\n\nConclusion, this game can be, and hopefully will be good. But as it is, it's way too buggy and missing a lot of things for me to recommend it to anyone unless they understand what they are getting into. I'm going to rate the game itself and the gameplay differently, cause the gameplay is so much better compared to the rest of the game that it would raise the rating of the whole game overall but i don't think it should because it's so broken, and if i rated it too low it wouldn't be fair to the gameplay.\n\nMagic Duels: Origins - 2/10,  Way too broken, and a pretty bad economy with removed content from previous games, and missing a lot of features that have become standard in most games, i would not play it AT ALL if it was not for the core gameplay.\n\nGameplay: 8/10, Would be perfect if not for the lack of cards or when you are alt-tabbed the timer bar gets frozen and that no one knows that they should turn off battle effects (Please turn them off, it makes the game smoother and quicker making the gameplay overall a better experience) and that the game has poor controller support, which is weird seeing as how it's on console too.","September 6, 2015","false","101.7"," 91 of 125 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","91","125","0","0"

It is (has become) very rewarding, the powerlevel is fairly balanced, I really enjoy the dailiy quests, you won't get reduntant cards in your boosters once you hit that cards total, it is very beginner friendly and a great way to learn the game while still being enjoyable for experienced players (apart form the auto skipping)\n\nThen why the negative review? Because the game HAS TO REMOVE the auto phase skipping, this is a signal boost.\nAgain, I do understand the reasoning behind the change but then at least make it OPTIONAL for experienced players to end phases manually.\n\nIf the developers actually cared about speeding up Gameplay please do so by removing the option to watch damage effetcs. THIS is slowing down the game, not the manual phase skipping.","May 10","false","192.3"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","42","49","2","1"

I am a very good and experienced magic online player and I have over 300 hours of gameplay in this particular free magic variant so my review will be a critique as opposed to a casual opinion. After 300 hours of gameplay, I decided to write the longest review I've ever made about my experienced opinion as I have strong feelings that my review is 100% accurate. If you disagree with anything I have said, leave a comment before you rate and I will happily counter discuss with you.\n\nReview\nThis card game is functional versus the AI and one online player but fails to be consistent in 2 headed giant mode[2HG]; the most prominent part of the game for many gamers where up to 4 players are supported. This is because match-making in this game (and all previous magic games) is utterly terrible with endless error messages and a host system which doesn't work 50%~ of the time. Teaming up with a friend is a nightmare; half the time you don't get a friendly match made or your friend is on the opposing team which causes lots of players to leave out of frustration, thereby ruining this game mode.\n\nI don't recommend this game if you like playing with a friend on your team as it's a big hassle endlessly inviting friends in the hope that you will get a game eventually. However, if Stainless hire more competent programmers, they can potentially have a good multiplayer experience card game but as it stands.....the 2-headed giant multiplayer experience is a nightmare and it really shouldn't be.\n\nThis is the main reason why I don't recommend this game to everyone, especially those who enjoy playing with friends like I do.\n\nAssuming there are no error messages in this game (which is rare), many other aspects of this game work fine outside of 2HG.\n\nPros\n1) Free magic card experience\n2) Decently good card sets\n3) Nice card art\n4) Decently good single player experience\n5) Most card interactions work as they should\n\nCons\n1) 2HG matchmaking system.\n2) 2HG host system, error messages and network errors.\n3) Earning coins to buy booster packs is a long and tedious grind.\n4) No rewards for 2HG. How pathetic... Fixed.\n5) Minimizing or tabbing out of a 2HG game will force other players to leave after a small amount of time which forces you to play versus the AI which is utterly stupid.\n6) Unfair advantages can be gained by anyone who buys coins to get better cards and therefore better decks. I'm not saying this is a pay to win game but it certainly helps the buying player.\n7) Deck organisation is terrible; it should be a 1 click process to pick a deck...\n8) The AI frequently makes very silly decisions which reduces the difficulty for advanced players like myself.\n9) No ranked 2-Headed Giant game mode.\n10) No 1v1 or 2HG leaderboards. (If you do implement it, at least make it work this time please)\n\nConclusion\nStainless Games simply have bad programmers! This problem has been going on for too long and the game developers need to address this massive problem as soon as possible if they want to keep their fan base.\n\nWizards & Stainless Games could have a great card game if they addressed these aforementioned problems in my review but as it stands, it's severely bugged and suboptimal. A better name for their company, given their track record of highly bugged games would be Stainless Magic Bugs!\n\n11 May 2016 BUGGED CARDS Review Update\n1) Jace, Vryn's Prodigy does not exile cards on -3 ability.\n2) Kozilek's Return will deal 5 damage to all creature even if you press no..\n3) Abbot Of Keral Keep does not let you cast from exile many of the new cards.\n4) Disciple Of The Ring's tap ability does not work.\n5) Fevered Visions deals 2 damage to opponent's planeswalkers ?\n6) Abbot land casting will not work if you don't have a land to play in your hand or your partner has nothing to play.","February 16","false","510.9"," 188 of 287 people (66%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","66","188","287","29","26"

I also played through the tutorial and got my first story quest/mission done. I really liked the heartstone vibe they gave the game. I have some cool information I was able to gather while I played and can share with those waiting for the game to be fixed:\n\n- When you start the game you can get a free starter pack at the store that gives you 20/22 cards of each color to make your own decks and lands to go along with them.\n\n- Right now there are 18 pages of 12 cards each ingame... so around 216 cards to collect and make decks at launch.\n\n- First Boosters are called Origins Boosters and are priced as follows: 1x150g, 2x300g, 8x1200g, 20x3000g. Each booster has 6 cards.\n\n- You can foil cards for 5G and it foils all cards of that type you have.\n\n- You can get Gs ingame... first tutorial quest gives you 30g and first full main story campaign gives 150G (that's the only one I have unlocked sorry)...\n\n- You can get Gs online by playing against other players or against bots: 5g vs easy, 10g vs medium or 15g vs hard. (I couldn't play against other players)\n\n- The game has an option to play with a fully custom made deck or it has a deck wizard that helps you make the kind of deck you want with the cards you have (that I found quite good)\n\n- Pricing for Gs on the store is as follows: 150g x 2us$ (1 booster), 500g x 5us$, 1250g x 10us$, 3750g x 25us$ or 7500g x 40us$.\n\nI never played too much Magic before but I really liked what I saw here... not too flashy animation wise but functional... I hope game gets fixed as soon as possible so all can try it. Right now I can recommend this game, it looked fun and  free... gold didn't seem that difficult to get too and there are lots of carts to start.","July 29, 2015","true","1.5"," 115 of 170 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","115","170","0","0"

Doesn't matter if you are a new player who wants to try MTG or an old ex-player trying to scratch that MTG itch.\n\nGOOD\n+ It's free. You get a set of basic cards and earn gold for playing campaign missions, duels against the AI or online against other players. You can buy gold for real money to speed up the process of getting cards but it's not necessary.\n\n+ The tutorial is very good. First it teaches you the basics so you can start playing the game as soon as possible. Then while playing the campaign, every time a new mechanic appears the game pauses and asks you if you want to play a mini-tutorial about that mechanic or skip it.\n\n+ Deck creation: You can make your own decks using any cards you may have, unlike old Magic games on Steam where creating new decks was very limited.\n\n+ Growing pool of cards. When the game was launched the card pool was very limited, but now with 3 expansions in addition to the original set the pool is getting big.\n\nMEH\n~ Deck creation interface: With the card pool getting bigger and bigger, creating a new deck takes more time than it should. The deck creation interface needs a rework.\n\n~ No chat. Would be nice to be able to talk to the other player. But then again you avoid the flames and you can always talk through Steam when playing with friends.\n\n~ Game won't run on some (old?) integrated graphic cards. Black screen on my old laptop, seems to be a common problem looking at the forums.\n\nBAD\n- The latest major patch (April 2016) introduced a change on how the priority system works. The devs have explained it's to make the game faster and easier to understand to newcomers, but it doesn't make any sense: the game won't hold priority for instants and automatically skip phases. This means if you only have instants the game won't allow to play them in certaion situations where you should be able. This doesn't make the game simpler for newbies, exactly the opposite, they won't understand what the f*ck is happening. EVEN WORSE; this change breaks the amazing interactive tutorial in a way that some parts of the tutorial can't even be completed anymore. The game is still worth it and I recommend it but hopefully this change will be reverted sooner than later.","April 17","true","234.7"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","41","50","0","0"

I dislike ones that are long winded.\n\nFirst off, I love Magic the Gathering even tho I'm far from running on the pro circuit.\n\nI'll start with the positive:\n\nThe game is fun, and a lot of enjoyment for someone that is not playing with $200 decks for paper cards.  There are some good cards in game for the casual player that work well off each other.  If you play Magic on the kitchen table with some friends, then there are fun matches to be had.\n\nThe cons:\n\nIt's a grind and wasted time.  The booster packs you can buy with coins (in-game money) cost 150 coins and you get only six cards per pack.  I believe the pack break down is three commons, two uncommon and one rare.  Early in the game you can earn some boosters to add to your collection after running through the story mode and the free cards they give, I have only 254 cards.\n\nOnce the story mode is completed the main way to earn more coins is playing against other random players and if you win you will earn 20 coins.  I'm fine with that, the game is free so I don't expect to earn coins too quickly.  Here is the kicker, if you lose then you earn nothing.  I've played two matches online and between both of them I spent an over an hour and earned zero coins because I lost.\n\nYou can also play against the AI with three difficulty setting easy (5 coins), medium (10 coins) and hard (15 coins).  So this is even a slower way to earn coins.\n\nLastly there are "quest" to complete.  They are things like "attack with five creatures at a time, five different times" or "counter 20 spells."  for what I've seen they net 20-40 coins each.  But the quest may be for deck you don't enjoy playing, so you may not enjoy the game when running certian quest.\n\nAlso you can buy coins for real money and here is the break down in how much money will get you coins to buy a certain amount of packs and the cost of each pack.  That's a hard read but there it goes:\n\n$1.99 = 150 coins = 1 pack = each pack cost $1.99\n$4.99 = 500 coins = 3 packs = each pack cost $1.67\n$9.99 = 1250 coins = 8 packs = each pack cost $1.25\n$24.99 = 3750 coins = 25 packs = each pack cost $1.00\n$39.99 = 7500 coins = 50 packs = each pack cost $0.80\n\nAnd there are no trading or selling of cards in the game.\n\nIf  you want to learn Magic, the game does that very well.  If you are a causal player, there is some fun.  If you are an experienced player this will not be the game for you.","August 4, 2015","false","72.9"," 150 of 231 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","150","231","9","8"

Pieces of the Puzzle does not work on Instants like it should but only on Sorceries and 2. Visions of Brutality has a wrong text that says it can't attack, but actually it can only not block (german version).)\n\n-3 times so far, the game crashed to desktop with the error message "Unknown error".\n\n-uncounted many times so far, joining a friend's game is impossible unless you restart the game.\n\n-When Co-Oping with a friend, the Twoheaded Giant Mode can not in any way be played against humans. Only bots.\nYou can, formally, search for Twoheaded Opponents, but it never ever finds a match. And if it does find one, it is.... [surprise!] against "Opponent and Opponent(1)", the bot names. Yes you read me right. You will find the normal Bots in matchmade multiplayer matches just as if you would have clicked on "Play Against AI"\n\n-The game itself is somewhat a skinner-box. It feeds you small amounts of coins to buy boosters now and then, triggering a habit in your brain to want more coins, so that you will pay money for them.\n\n-Speaking of boosters, you find only 6 cards in the boosters. Yes. Six. 3 Commons, 2 Uncommons and a Rare. After about 20 Boosters from a single Edition, there are still Commons from it that I dont have a single one from, and I dont have any 4-card-playset of Commons that can be pulled from boosters. After about 20 Boosters from a single Edition. A Booster costs about 1,70 € or 150 Coins, which is essentially 5 won multiplayer games.\n\n-Aaand speaking of coins, when battling a twoheaded game with a friend, you dont earn your quest rewards. To get the quest rewards the game FORCES you to play alone. I guess they went for a community that has a reputation of antisocial awkwardness...\n\n-The Main phase gets removed completely if you dont have any cards in hand that can only be played in Main Phase. Sounds good but it isn't, because some instant spells and abilities can potentially put mainphase cards in your hand. "Vessel of Volatility" gets totally annihilated by this, because the mana gets removed instantly if used incorrectly, because of how the game is programmed. There is no option to turn this "feature" off.\n[UPDATE: They announced to fix this "intended bug" as soon as possible.]\n\n-Often, you don't see the whole table when you need some info from it, and that is when you need to choose the effects of some cards. For no reason at all, the whole table gets blurred when choosing effects. Annoying but no gamebreaker.\n\n-Two times now I died due to an Attack Phase or Block Phase not existing. I had enough untapped, non-summoning-sick creatures to kill the enemy but I had no Attack phase. Enemy plays Mass removal. gg","May 3","false","93.9"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","45","58","5","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperKamiGuru/recommended/316010/","SuperKamiGuru","Falcon4242","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperKamiGuru/","25 products in account","As someone who never played Magic before, I thought of this game as a good place to start to learn the game.  This game, unfortunately, is a mixed bag in its current state.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great, simplistic tutorial\n\n-Good atmosphere\n\n-Promise of expansions\n\n-Free to play\n\n-Campaign mode that helps you learn the pros/cons of the different colors\n\n-All cards are available through booster packs without seperate "premium" currancy\n\nCons:\n\n-Always online.  Any gold you earn offline will not count towards your total gold count.\n\n-Servers are very unreliable.  Thankfully, you can reconnect after a duel and still get your gold (usually), but this isn't a good launch for the game\n\n-Campaign can be unfair at times.  One match in particular has your opponent drain your library until you lose.  He  puts up defending cards that aren't even purchasable by the player.  You can win this match (and about 4-7 others) by pulling a single spell card from your pre-made, uneditable deck, but since you'll usually lose before you can draw it or it gets discarded, you'll have to restart a lot\n\n-Only the winner of online PvP duels gets gold from the match.  That means if you're on a dry streak, like me, you can't earn gold, which means you can't buy boosters, which means you can't upgrade your decks, which means you continue to lose.  And AI duels give you next to nothing as a reward (on Easy mode), so you might as well not bother unless you're testing a deck.\n\n-You can still buy gold with real money, so the game isn't as free to play as it makes you think.  Yes, the cards are still random when you buy boosters, but that doesn't mean someone with a lot of money to burn doesn't get an advantage in this game.\n\n-In fact, the only way you can earn gold by playing this game is by playing the campaign for a one-time bonus per mission, between 5-15 gold for AI battles, and 20 gold for ranked 1v1.  Want to play with friends?  Sorry, no gold.  Want to play random 2v2?  No gold either.\n\n-Also, if your opponent in an online duel concedes, you still aren't garunteed a win.  The player will be replaced by an AI, and if you lose then you still won't recieve your gold and be you'll be dropped in rank.  If my opponent gave up, why can't I recieve my rewards?\n\n-No communication available between teammates of Two Headed Giant mode (that I've found).  If you're a game developer for any card game and include a 2v2 mode, how can you neglect to include a communication system?  It's hard to figure out your teammate's strategy and attacking/blocking setup if you can't communicate through voice/text.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThis is a fun game to help you learn the ropes of Magic and play with friends but due to the lack of server consistancy and earning nothing from duels unless you win, it's hard to call this a suitable game for anyone but the curious, the grinders, and the hardcore Magic fan.","August 1, 2015","false","31.0"," 114 of 173 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","114","173","6","6"

Any game that requires me to be online and then punishes me because the developers don't know how to program gets an automatically downvote.\n\nWhen the game works, it isn't as bad as the last Duel of the Planeswalkers.

A few single player campaign matchups still seem to be designed to frustrate. (The black sacrifice deck with no creatures with power more than 2 against a green deck built around getting counters by other creatures dying seems like a very odd choice to introduce new players to Magic.)

In truth I doubt any digital version of Magic will ever completely replicate all the nuances that people enjoy about the physical version\n\nHowever,\n\nIf you are like me and are looking for a fun way to get into (or back into) playing Magic with out the hassle and expense of cardboard magic then look no further.\n\nWhy?\nWhile the card selection is not 100% complete, it is certainly more than decent enough for many interesting deck building possibilities and the F2P business model for acquiring the cards seems very generous relative to other digital cardgames *cough*Hearthstone*cough*.\n\nThere are guides on the forums which can help newbies create viable starter decks out of the free cards that are initially granted after the first set of tutorials and the rest of the card selection can be unlocked at a fair pace for free by playing the AI and other players (I probably got the currency for half my boosters just by testing the various decks I've built against the AI). Still, don't expect to unlock all the cards in one day with out laying down some cash; though it can be done in about a month completely for free if you are an avid player.\n\nA few notes:\n\n-The game has had server issues, though they seem mostly cleared up at this point. I haven't run into any trouble playing in the past week or so.\n\n-Some people report bugs with certain hardware configurations, I've had none. Your mileage may vary.\n\n-Some complain about the lack of features, I agree. More features are always better however the developers have said they are committed to adding more cards/features and refining the interface in the future. Specifically, new cards are suppose to be added on the same time table as they are released for the physical card game, so that is cool.\n\n-Some people complain about a lack of in-game chat and other interface qualms, personally I can do without it during matches. Though an in-game lobby would be cool to discuss the current metagame and strats etc...\nIf the devs and Wizards tend to the investment they have in this piece of software then I am sure things like this are on the horizon as they would better flesh out the already enjoyable experience that this game offers.\n\n-Personally I wish there were more cosmetic things available to purchase in the store (avatar pictures, card table backdrops and stuff like that.) As of right now it is just booster packs and it seems like a waste to me to spend more than a few actual dollars on them as if you play regularly you will eventually unlock them all in pretty short order anyways. *shrug*","August 18, 2015","true","205.6"," 152 of 239 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","152","239","7","8"

If that person spent enough real money to put together a fast, functional deck, you're not going to win, which means you've just wasted ten minutes of your life for nothing. Playing against the AI is about the only hope you have.\n\nYou get 5c for a win, and it costs 150c to buy a booster pack of 6 cards, most of which won't help you build whatever deck you're enjoying playing. So you have to win 30 games with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cards to get 6 new cards you don't want, and go on playing with the deck you already had. Each match takes 5-10 minutes, so assuming you won all thirty games in a row, you've been playing for about four hours or so... for -nothing-.\n\nOh, and you won't win all 30 games in a row. You're going to do a whole lot of conceding, restarting, and eye-rolling in the meanwhile. If you win 50% of your matches, you're at it for 8 hours. How's it feel to waste a whole day playing Magic with a starter deck, with tons of pauses and holdups, nothing but the same droning music, and the knowledge that your opponent just flat-out has a better setup than you do?\n\nThis is -terrible- game design. Absolutely insultingly terrible. Game designers, heads up: If you build an economy and then don't encourage me to participate in it, I'm not going to. MtG plays far faster in real life, and I can play with people I actually like, rather than the bank accounts of strangers. If you aren't going to build a system that ensures that losing players are eventually competitive, the losing players are going to stop playing entirely, like I am now.\n\nA word on story mode: The AI always has a better deck than you, the matches take forever to load, and the AI never misses a tactically advantageous move. Ever. This is boring, one-sided gameplay. To win, you have to get lucky on your draw, AND the AI has to be unlucky on theirs.\n\n0 / 5 stars. This game doesn't even get credit for the pretty art, because it's lifted straight from the real cards.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cuam/recommended/316010/","cuam","cullam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cuam/","51 products in account","This is without a doubt the worst game that I have ever played. Don't take such a statement lightly; this is no hyperbole.\n\nFirstly, the launch was outright pathetic. On release, roughly half of the people who wanted to play it could not due to two different crashing errors on startup. Additionally, there was major server instability. This had two major consequences:\nsince all progress requires a connection to their server, it was impossible to gain and keep gold.\ndespite 1, the game still checks for local data when it doesn't have a connection. Accidentally choosing to use local data (the consequences of which are not explained to the player) will overwrite all of your data on their server.So, within the first week many people could hardly play and/or were losing all of their gold/packs. People who didn't fit into this category couldn't even boot up the game successfully. Once the servers became more stable, the game was still riddled with hundreds (probably thousands) of bugs. Here's a short summary of a few:\nIf your opponent leaves while searching their library, the replacement AI never picks anything and you essentially softlock.\nSometimes opponents cast spells that they simply don't have the mana for. Whether this is hacking or a bug is sometimes hard to discern, but the devs don't seem worried about it either way.\nThere are a number of cards that straight up don't work in the way that they read. Under very different circumstances this would be more reasonable considering the complexity of MTG.\nTwo-Headed Giant, the whole reason I wanted to play this game, is all kinds of bugged out. More often than not it will just fail to work and you'll have to retry. Sometimes it will try to load five people into the game and kick your partner as a result. Sometimes you'll start the game and your partner will be on the opposing team. I'd say about 1 in every 30 connection attempts is a successful one.\nThere is a limit on gold earned per day, this is fine. What is not is that its reset seems to be dependent upon a way in which you talk with the server in an unrelated way. As in, it's fairly unpredictable. Sometimes I'll log on after a week of not playing and see that I've just hit the cap.\nThere are a lot of minor bugs that I'm either unaware of or I don't have time to explain in this already-lengthy review. Trust me, even these pile up whilst playing.Worst of all, the communication with the "community" has been completely awful. More than a week after release someone finally said a fix for the crash on startup error was in the works. This is the first we heard the devs even hint that they were WORKING on such a fix!  Fast forward a few days later, and the same person reported that the fix would take longer than expected. LOL!  Some other game-breaking bugs haven't even been acknowledged by the devs. As for all the other bugs, hell will likely freeze over before they even have the time or patience to care. Perhaps after two more years of development time this software could be passable for a game...\n\nBut hey, you're reading this in the future, right?  Let's say in this hypothetical world that will likely never exist, every bug and performance issue in the game has been resolved. Hooray!  From now on I'll be reviewing the game as it was "intended."\n\nOptionsUnlike other MTG games, there is no option to confirm that you have nothing to do at the end of someone's turn. This can be especially frustrating when you want to play an instant at the end of your opponent's turn, as you have a very small window to play it or stop the timer.\nThere is no option to manually tap lands for mana. Considering the AI for this is idiotic and will tap all of one color before tapping another, this is a much-needed option.\nControl mapping is absolutely awful. There are two main buttons in the game, one for Continue/Skip Attacking/etc. and one for Timer/Attack with All/etc. You can only change the hotkey for the Continue and Timer functions of these buttons. The other functions remain the default selection no matter what.Graphics + VolumeThe graphics quality in this game is fairly horrendous, even for a simple card game. The quality settings don't seem to do anything, as on Ultra settings I still see a lot of jagged lines. The game performs equally slowly in all manner of settings.\nThe resolution settings are pretty damn horrendous. There's a tiny number of different resolutions, and to run on my HDMI TV I had to manually change the resolution in the config.ini file. When I ran this resolution in fullscreen, my game would consistently crash. Additionally, there is no windowed borderless option for the game, I had to install a third-party program that would give this function.\nThe cinematics are laughably bad. I'm actually counting this as a positive thing, because at least this is something you can laugh at.\nSome sounds in the game aren't affected by the volume parameters you set. For example, I still hear intro music at full volume (LOUD) until it loads the settings and fades away. The volume for the cinematics is so quiet that you're basically watching a silent movie.Quests + F2PThe quests for gold in the game are all extremely lazy. Most are archetypal quests, where you have to win x games with a deck of two varying colors. The catch is that you can't build these decks yourself, they must be built by the deck wizard. The deck wizard makes some pretty bad decisions, like putting every single type of special land you have into your deck for no reason whatsoever.\nTwo Headed Giant, one of the most exciting things about this game, doesn't give any gold. 2v2s generally take longer than 1v1s and certainly take longer than 1vAIs, so it would be bad even if it gave equivalent gold. Essentially, if you want your card pool to progress you can't have fun.\nOne nice thing (probably out of laziness) is that you can't get extra cards in packs. That is to say, once you have 4 commons, you'll never see that card in a pack. This makes it so that there's a certain number of packs you need and you'll absolutely have all the cards. This is refreshingly deterministic for such an awful game.Card RestrictionsRather than normal MTG where you can have 4 of any card, there are restrictions placed based on the rarity of the card. This is good for F2P players, but bad overall: it's impossible to build decks around rare cards.\nThe set is very small and has a lot of holes: counterspells, draw and removal in some colors.\nCard Collection MenuWhile the menus in the entire game are pretty bad, the card collection menu is where it's most frustrating. There's no way to search for keywords, so you have to manually filter through cards to do so. The act of putting cards into your deck is tedious and annoying, there's no decklist, you can only put any search parameters if you're building a deck, etc etc.\n\nUI+GameplayBeing able to stop the timer and do things in various phases is an extremely important part of MTG. Unfortunately this is stupidly difficult in this game. The actual window of time you have to pause the phase is unchanging, whereas various animations (even animations for which phase of the game you're in) will bleed into that window.\nIn games with other human players, whenever a player concedes they're replaced with the AI.\nYou can stop the timer indefinitely to BM your opponent.\nGameplay is just...not smooth. Once you've clicked on a card, you have to play it. You can get stuck looking at cards during the timer, etc.\nThey evidently didn't expect people to have more than eight types of things in play, because things overlap and look disgusting.Just...DON'T PAY MONEY FOR THIS GAME.","August 23, 2015","false","64.6"," 92 of 140 people (66%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","66","92","140","9","3"

Wizards of the Coast defined the genre, and none of their competitors, in video games or paper, have managed to match the depth of their game. Just look at their biggest competition, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Hearthstone. All extremely simplified versions of the TCG genre.\n\nI can at least admit that this is a good intruduction to new players. Even a veteran like me is forced through a tutorial that holds your hand every step of the way, but like all of the "Duels" franchise, there's only so much to hold your attention on the other side, and it's severely lacking.\n\nIf this were a franchise that were slowly expanded upon over the years, it might actually be amazing by now, but every year something nice from the previous version is missing. 2014 had 2hg and sealed matches, but otherwise you only had a few premade decks. 2015 let you build your own decks, but got rid of 2hg and sealed.\n\nWith Magic: Duels, WotC told us they had listened. They brought back 2hg, and were going to make all the new cards available, with new boosters being available every new physical set, but why even bring back 2hg when you completely remove all ability to communicate or even see the name of who you're playing, apart from the first 3 seconds of a match. You no longer have any idea if your opponent rage/quit and you're playing the AI. This means you can't play with your friends, or make friends in the game.\n\nI feel WotC is afraid that if they made a game on par with other modern f2p games, they would lose paper customers, and I'm sure MTGO is too ancient to be able to move all those customers and all the cards they bought into a modern game. It reminds me of the way Microsoft has treated PC gaming for the sake of Xbox. Make the experience as painful as possible, and they'll buy your hardware.\n\nWell, Wizards, you got me, I still buy your "hardware", but all your software is garbage.","July 30, 2015","false","93.8"," 67 of 98 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","67","98","3","0"

Only 3 can play it, since all the others have the game crashing with "unknow error" when they launch it. And, of course, they can do nothing about it (and yet we have no answer from the developpers). I wanted so hard to go play 2v2 with them, but since we're only 3...\n\nSo we tried to play with strangers. And the real magic appears ! The matchmaking is so bad, probably due to servers bugs. I mean, first you have to invit a friend to be part of your team. It loads, it's not instant, so you wait. Then you try to find some strangers to fight against, and 3 out of 4 times it bugs. And when it bugs, you have to reinvit your friend, and wait again. When you finaly reach the point of playing with strangers, one of them or one of us crashes, so you end up playing with or against a bot. Boring.\n\nStill, the 1v1 is good.

Story Mode is fair since AI uses real libraries with random hands unlike it is in Magic 2014, for example. Unfortunately, there are poorly designed decks like the one in infamous Liliana's campaign. As for common duels, progress with collecting cards is extremely slow and too luck-based if you don't buy gold for real money. If you play with AI, the choice of difficulty doesn't affect your opponent's library, so you might easily win on Hard but encounter an opponent with four mythic cards on Medium when you don't own any for your deck. There are archetype decks which are much easier to build out of the starter set than the others, but it quickly becomes boring to farm in-game gold with the same strategy. In personal quests, you often get tasks like winning 4 games with a weak deck and winning 2 games with a decent one, and both have the same award. Community quests that last for several days are usually completed within first 24 hours and then just occupy the slot uselessly. Sometimes there is an impossible goal to achieve, and once there was a quest that didn't work at all, having 0 in its counter for the whole time being. Developers just didn't give anything to care about it. Also, there is no in-game chat (even in two-headed giant games), no any awards for two-headed giant victories, and network games just get stuck from time to time.\n\nI highly recommend playing real MtG and maybe spend some free time in Magic 2014 to have some practice.

MTG by itself still has a soft spot in my heart and in a way this game works better than the previous clients done by WotC. Just the fact that we're now allowed to make our own decks is big improvement. But has the gameplay itself improved?\n\nUnfortunately no. Game is riddled with bugs. I've had my combat phase completely skipped a few times and sometimes I am not allowed to activate abilities or stop the clock even though I normally could.\n\nAnother thing is the connection issues. Searching for a game is tedious because it seems that if either player disconnects (which seems to happen way too often) the matchmaking will just stop. Who thought this was a good idea? If there's a disconnect, just reset the matchmaking queue and let the player wait for an actual match, no one wants to press that find opponent button all the time after queue failing.\n\nTechnical issues aside, let's get to the game design. User interface is a joke! Why is the stop timer, the most important button in the game, in the lower right corner when I need to keep an eye on the centre of the game? Furthermore, if you game designers put the important UI buttons in a bad place, at least have the decency to force the steam notifications to top right for example... In the genral the UI is pretty bad (menus etc) but the actual action buttons are horrible. Keybindings are necessary in this game so thank goodness for those.\n\nWhy do I have to finish a game when my opponent leaves? Frustrating and time consuming, tedious is the key word here. And why is the matchmaking so horrible in general? I get matchmade with lvl 9 accounts when I'm 1.

Since you don't build your own deck in the main story, it often felt like all that determined whether you won or lost was what you drew in your opening hand(in other words how many times you restarted until you got a good hand, after which you simply roll over your opponent).\n\nThis game has potential, but like many other Free to Play games, they released it before it was ready and it will probably not last long as a result.","August 16, 2015","false","86.5"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","34","47","0","0"

Another flawed MtG product from Stainless Steel. I've already skipped 2015 version. Would have skipped this one too. But now it's free to play, so i've tried it.\n\n* Boring story campaigns (5 fights with the same underpowered generic deck in every campaign).\n* Quests not working (or they only work with the decks that are created with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t wizard).\n* Achievements sometimes doesn't register with Steam and you have to redo them.\n* Network part again falling apart no matter how many patches they release. Still no propper lobby, just a random search for players. Too often not finding anything.\n* Many visual annoyances (though they've got rid of that awful menu system of 2015 version, at least), like Block or Combat icons obstructing view. Little pointing arrows telling you what to play. Glow around a playable card nearly invisible when you hover over it. When you play online you see same glitches when you attack like 5 years ago. It's the same engine with a few tweaks over and over again.\n* Same flawed RNG which stacks same cards together (whether lands or multiple copies of one card)\n* Stupid automatic land tapping (yeah, yeah, you can press that button, wait, which is it? to manually alter it, but com'on, so many years and they can't tackle that)\n* 2HG is back, but there is no CHAT..\n* The game will occasionally crash (almost two months after a release, forums are filled with reports)\n* Will be not surprised if this game has the same bug with disappearing steam cloud saves as with all games in the series (so i have disabled steam cloud for this game right away).\n\nI'm still playing through campaign to find out all the Origins story line and trying to entertain myself by completing few achievements. Have built one deck, but the pool of cards seems limited. Will probably try opening few boosters with the coins i have earned in the campaign (not spending any real money on this). So, after the campaign it is only MP. MP is fun occasionally (with some sort of communication), but i prefer playing offline against AI, completing lenghty campaign with some deck and seeing how it compares to other decks. With only MP i will uninstall it soon.\n\nMissing 2012-2014 versions, with lots of decks to unlock, huge campaigns, some sort of a unique game mode.\n\nP.S. latest patch introduced automatic skipping of phases when you have no creature or sorcery to play. Makes it pain in the ♥♥♥ to play with instants and some intricate abilities as you have to constantly hit pause all the time. They say this should speed up games.

Unfortunatly, it fails to deliver in many aspects that I feel like it could have easily fixed\n+ Is free (technically)\n+ brought 2 headed giant back\n+ Keeps the fun of deckbuilding and custimization\n+ optional tutorials for newer players that are not forced on older players\n+Story mode that ACTUALLY goes into the lore of magic (for once)\n+ FINALLY allows you to use planeswalkers card types\n\n-Can be pay 2 win as people who buy boosters will probably have more cards and be able to win more (thus getting more gold and getting MORE cards)\n-for the momment, very limited card pool to chose from, allowing very limited style (and limited power) decks\n- a lot of disconnect issues, although hopefully these will be fixed soon\n- if not paying for packs, getting gold to get them can be VERY grindy, and some of the quests dont even work to give you your gold\n-types of cards avaiable basically force you into differn't archetypes based on your colors ( if your black green, based on the avaibale cards, its probably going to have to be G/B elves for example)\n- Can be diffcult to find opponenets in multiplayer, particularly for 2 headed giant.\n\nOne of the biggest issues I have with the game however is that in the story mode it specifcally shows you differn't cards that certain characters will you against you (such as Alhemmerat using fog banks to protect himself to use mill cards on you) However can you use some of these cards to help amplify your decks or give you differn't styles of decks? Nope, in fact the cards are nowhere to be seen, which makes about as much since to me as this game has in general sometimes. Why bother programming the cards to use for a SINGLE campaign level, to then never be touched again, and then just decide to not let players use them? Want to use jace's mill deck or cards? Or how about the eldrazi cards that are used in Nissa's levels? Whelp sorry, even though we programmed them and their here, you cant have them.\n\nThe only reason I can think the above statement is the case is if wizards is saving those cards for future expansions and wants more $$$, which honsetly with how this game is, I could see being the case. Although this game is fun, and is technically free, I wish wizards would just go back to the design team for M14 and use that, becouse THAT was a great game, and had tons of fun features and decks to choose from compared to this. Even though this is getting a negative review for many reasons though, I will say that its still something to try out with a friend or maybe even just to play the campaign to learn a little bit of the lore of magic or something.","August 2, 2015","false","33.8"," 98 of 161 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","98","161","2","5"

For now though, I suggest skipping this game and picking up one of the other magic games on steam despite this one being free.\n\nPros:\n-Great Deckbuilding! It is really awesome and you can build a deck from scratch with whatever cards you acquire!\n-Lots of new cards not in the previous games, but also some returning ones that I couldn't live without.\n-Two headed giant is a lot of fun to play. I love the teamwork based strategies that you need to use.\n-It's still magic. And magic is... well... magical. Play it if you haven't before.\n\nCons:\n-Matchmaking/server issues. This is a gamebreaker right here for me. The servers are extremely unreliable, which I wouldn't even mind if I could play the campaign while they were down! But you can't. That's right it blocks your progress and gold you made in the campaign if you can't connect to their servers. So that Liliana duel you've spent ten hours on trying to beat and then finally beat it, might just count for nothing if you randomly get disconnected from their servers. *Pro TIp* you will.\n- Extremely small amount of gold earned outside of the campaign. Yeah I get that this game is F2P and they need to make their money somehow, but at least let us earn gold in two headed giant, and make the gold gained based on how long your duel takes. Because getting 20 gold for both an hour long duel and a 5 minute duel seems a little unbalanced.\n-No chat function. At all. Like seriously. Where is it? How am I supposed to tell my scrub-lord teammates not to sacrifice all of our creatures now. Or even applaud them and give them super high fives when they do something so awesome that helps us win the game? It's definitely not as fun without chat. Magic is a social game... why take out the social aspect of it?!\n-UI. The UI is okay but needs to be polished up a lot. I keep seeing cards upside down, damage and defense numbers sideways and floating off the card so I can't see them, and even a couple of errors in the game where cards do not do what they're supposed to do.\n-Damage animations. Half the time I spend dueling people online is spent waiting for them to finish watching the damage animations. Please disable them for online play.\n-Not necessarily a con but being able to customize your playing field with different backgrounds would be very nice and add some much needed variety into the playing field.\n\nSummary: How long have they been making magic video games now? 4 years? I'm suprised they haven't figured out how to improve on their last games yet. It almost feels like they went backwards with this one. If they fix the little bugs and server issues this game will be very fun for a long time. It would be really great to see them continue updates for this and always be adding new cards/game modes/ etc. My final verdict on this game is to play it if you've never played magic before because it's free, and you can't really go wrong with a free game if you're just trying it out. But if you have played magic before and you're a fan of the series, stick to one of the old ones.","August 2, 2015","false","45.2"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","34","49","2","1"

Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game.\n\nAt its core Magic the Gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the Coast seems to have forgotten this. IF YOU CHOOSE TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS YOU CANT EARN GOLD, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a DAILY CAP, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to Play for Free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards. With a daily cap I'm not sure why you can't earn gold in 2HG mode or even Free4all with buddies. YOU CANT EVEN LOBBY UP WITH FRIENDS.\n\nMagic Origins wants to compete with Hearthstone, show it who rules the roost of TCGs. Too bad it can't without an overhaul of the system. If you play magic on Steam, you can't play your account on IOS, PS, or XBOX. Meaning you will have to START ALL OVER ON EACH PLATFORM. Another month or two of grind, or cold hard cash. This could be a greed driven decision by wizards, or ineptitude, either way it's bad. Plus Magic is BUGGY, broken cards, broken mechanics, broken leaderboards, and connectivity issues.\n\nMagic for some reason seems to hate letting you build decks with any kind of consistancy, limiting the number of rares you can own to 2-3 and ultra rares to 1. With a total of 256 cards you would assume to see the same cards u see dropping for the paper release. This is not the case. You're stuck with a ton of bad filler cards from past years and then rounded out by a few of the actual origins cards. I hope this isn't the case for upcoming expansions.\n\nIn my opinion Wizards is just plain afraid to make a decent digital magic game. Afraid that if they do it will hinder the sales of its real life counterpart. To that I say, warning Wizards. Magic the Gathering is the OG of TCGs, but unless the OG adapts to the present, the young bucks like Hearthstone will bury it. Have some confidence in the franchise and produce a digital game you can be proud of.\n\nBelieve it or not I'm a huge fan of MTG, and can only hope that Wizards will update this game. Solving the issues addressed here and adding content like Drafts, Sealed pools, Archenemy, Planes Chase, and Commander/EDH. Most importantly the ability to make a lobby and play with friends. WITHOUT FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH, MAGIC CARDS ARE JUST PRETTY PICTURES.","July 29, 2015","false","83.0"," 154 of 268 people (57%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","57","154","268","12","3"

ANY POSITIVE EXPECTATIONS WILL BE DESTROYED.  It is clear that the developers didn't do any testing at all, since every aspect of the game is buggy and poorly-designed.\n\nI would describe this as less of a game and more of a prison.  Installing it is slightly confusing, as it's listed under "Demos" rather than "Games".  However, it's only once you get into the game that you realize just how much the developers, Stainless Games, hate you, and you realize how low their opinion of you must be.\n\nFirst, there's the tutorial, which is required before you play a single game.  Even if multiplayer weren't locked, it would still be required, as it rewards gold to get more cards.  So, you play through the five missions of the five planeswalkers.  These missions range from easy to impossible, entirely depending on your opening hand.  You have no control over your deck and can't even see what cards are in it, so you just have to mulligan until you get a start that beats your opponent.  This basically boils down to luck:  If the computer gets a good hand and you get a bad one, you have no way of turning that around.  There is very little room for correct or savvy play, rather you just grind until you get a better opener, get an unsatisfying win, and collect your gold.  A couple of the missions are kind of fun, but overall it feels like a chore that you have to take care of before you can play the game.\n\nActually, I lied.  VERY first, you hear the opening music at max volume, then click Play! and hear a resounding BOOM, again at max volume, no matter what your volume settings are in the game.  A minor but all-too-telling error.\n\nNow that you have some cards, you can build a deck.  So, let's say you're a total newb and you use the Deck Wizard, which gives you a range of archetypes to try.  You pick a feisty, red-white aggro deck, planning to chip away at your opponent a little at a time with your early creatures, burning a path for them with red spells.  Unfortunately, the Deck Wizard doesn't understand that you want your "All-Out Assault! " theme deck to be mostly made of things you can play with less than 3 mana, so when it chooses what cards you can pick between (you get 5 options at a time), it will most likely be full of 4-drops.  Furthermore, even if you do get low-drops, it's entirely possible that they will require a heavy commitment to the wrong color, e.g., you're building a mostly-red deck and the options are all cards with WW in the casting cost.  Finally, when it comes to adding mana to the deck, you have no control over what lands are added, and the game always adds the same number of lands, in the same format.  In this example, 18 Mountains/Plains (appropriately portioned), 2 dual lands that don't come into play tapped, 4 guildgates that do come into play tapped.  So, 24 lands, 4 of which come into play tapped, into every deck.  This is a serious hindrance to an aggressive deck that wants to draw maybe 3-4 lands tops for the whole game.  To avoid this, you can build your own deck, but I'll get into that later.\n\nSo you have a deck now, and you're ready to face an opponent.  You have two choices:  play against humans, or play against the AI.  Both of these guarantee gold when you win, with humans giving slightly more gold than a Hard AI.  So you decide to pit yourself against another real opponent.  You click the button, choose your deck, and hop into the queue.  But, your connection drops and you're back at the main screen.  "The session was full", says an error.  So you try again.  No dice, same error.  Well, so the game was just released, it's a little buggy, alright.  You try again, this time it says "The server timed out".  You keep trying, and on the fourth or fifth try, you manage to find a real opponent.  Great!  Time to play some magic.\n\nYou draw your opening seven, you're missing one of your colors but hey, no problem!  You get a free redraw of seven cards (which I like)!  That hand works out and you're ready to lay the beatdown.  You play your 1-drop.  Your opponent plays a land.  You play your two-drop and SWING!  Your opponent loses a life, they play their land and a 2-drop, go.  You burn the two-drop out of the way, hit face again, and so on.  After a couple more burn spells, your opponent's out of real plays, and you still have a couple cards in hand, so they concede.  Woohoo! you've won your first game of Magic Duels Origins!  NOT SO FAST.  "PlayerX has been replaced by the AI", the game tells you.\n\nEven if your opponent concedes, you still don't win.  Again, it's all-too-telling.\n\nOkay, well, by now you've gotten your toes wet, so you're ready to dive in, build your own deck, and start cranking out that sweet, sweet gold.  You check your Daily Quests, which you know exist because they're presented to you on log-in.  You have two "Archetypal" quests:  "Win 2 duels with a RW or GW archetype deck", and "Win 4 duels with a UB or UW archetype deck".  They both reward 40 gold.  Well, 2>4, and they both reward the same amount of gold, so... time to make a rushy white-blue aggro deck with lots of fliers.  It goes well enough, you don't have that much beat-down but you also have some bigger threats for when the game goes long.  You don't have cheap countermagic, but all-in-all that's probably for the best.\n\nSo you slog through the matchmaking process and find yourself a match.  You beat your opponent (woohoo! +20 gold!) but your quest doesn't update.  Why not?  Well, it doesn't clarify in-game, but when you go to the reddit you find out that "archetype deck" means "Deck Wizard deck".  So basically every day, you're required to play with what is almost certainly a worse version of a deck you could create.  Since it's a requirement in order to progress, this means that you waste no less than half an hour of play-time every day throwing together an archetype deck that is as aggressive as possible and then zerging down the AI, because you're never going to win a game if you play that deck against other people, and it'll take your ranking down if you lose.\n\nI should spend a few words on the ranking system.  Here's how it works:  When you win a game, you go up a rank; when you lose a game, you go down a rank.  Your rank caps at 40, no matter how good you are.  Rank barely matters anyway, because you're liable to face anyone within 10-15 ranks of you anyway.\n\nWhatever.  You keep playing, because you're optimistic that, once you get more cards, you'll actually be able to build some pretty fun, pretty powerful decks.  Six cards at a time, you're completing your collection.  (I do like the way this is handled, by the way:  Once you have the maximum playable number of a given card, you can no longer receive that card in a booster.  This means that if you play long enough you are guaranteed to have a complete collection.)  You've been at it for a few hours, rising in rank, when suddenly you finish a game and don't receive any gold for it!  This is because you've hit your gold cap for the day.  You can no longer earn any gold, except from daily quests.\n\nThat pretty well puts a damper on your ladder aspirations.  If you're not earning anything by doing it, what's the point?  If you rise in rank you'll theoretically be facing harder opponents, making winning more difficult, so you're shooting yourself in the foot a little bit by continuing to ladder.\n\nIt's as if the game is saying, "Stop playing me!  Go away, do something else with your time!"  Fine.

If you're curious as to why this game has such a low rating, I can boil it down for you pretty quick here. It's not a bad game overall - in fact it's essentially the same as every other year - but Wizards has made two pretty aggravating mistakes.\n\n1. This is an online-only game, and the online servers are not very functional. They work *much* better now, but at launch there was simply no playing this.\n\n2. The story mode (which was the main draw for many players, as it fleshes out some lore elements that have been mainly untouched for a couple of years) is pretty awful. You're given a pre-built deck, to fight another pre-built deck, and you do this twenty five times. All "fifty" decks involved (most are variants on eachother) are just bad decks and games routinely run into the 30-45 turn mark, sometimes taking almost an hour apiece to wrap up. Wizards tries to spruce it up by adding matches with a twist (alternate win conditions, the semblance of fighting multiple enemies, even one where you're supposed to lose, which was very frustrating to find out as a player who knows how to track a game and hit "restart" a few turns in advance when a loss is imminent) but I have to stress the fact that the pre-built matchups are exhausting and poorly balanced, so you'll be sitting through a headache.\n\nThe rest of the game is fine, it's serviceable as a quick MTG fix but if you're here specifically for the stories, just read some forum materials and the relevant Uncharted Realms content. Take it from a several year Magic player, that's going to be a better way to get the story.","August 4, 2015","true","10.0"," 52 of 87 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","52","87","4","0"

I'll start with what works well.  And by that, the entirety of it is the fact that my friend 300 miles away can play Magic with me.  That's great.  Beyond that, there are entirely too many issues to make this game worthwhile.\n\nFirstly, the gameplay is solid on the surface, but suffers when complex combos come into play.  For starters, if I play something that costs one swamp and we'll say one colorless, it will automatically tap two swamps, prohibiting me from using that second swamp for another card.  As well, the instant abilities (and by this I mean activated abilities on creactures or enchantments), only sort of work.  I played a game recently where I attempted to use the Nantuko Husk's acitvated ability to avoid losing it, and it was akin to swinging my arms around and hoping something stuck.  These are just a couple of examples of how the rules have been poorly translated to interactivity.\n\nThat being said, if you are hard up for some Magic, this may do the trick.  But I want you to know, going into it, that in addition to the above, the matchmaking is subpar at best, and oftentimes, if you and a friend try to play a match, it will kick one of you and insert an AI opponent.  This game does the trick, only in the sense, that you and someone else can play Magic.  That being said, it's not necessarily, or even often, an enjoyable experience.  I hope that there are significant improvements to matchmaking and simple instant-level gameplay (and by this I include activated abilities) in a very-soon-to-come update.\n\nI want this game to be a good one.  I simply cannot in good concsious say it already is.","September 11, 2015","false","12.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","2"

Unfortunately Magic Duels takes the opposite approach. You need to actively pause a timer in order to take an "instant" action. You also have to wait for the timer, you can't fast forward. This decision made playing games feel too long.\n\nIf you play an hour and that doesn't bother you, then this might be a good game for you. You can fairly easily earn gold to buy packs and you can play against humans or AI.\n\nJust because I personally don't like the interface doesn't mean it is a bad game.

Just because I love Mtg and I had hoped that it would bring me some pleasure.\n\nWRONG.\n\nThis game was basically made by sadistic developers, who decided "hey, you know what? Giving players a fair challenge would be way too easy. Let's make them suffer!". Basically every match in that so-called "campaign mode" is a pure hellish experience, that makes you want to strangle nearest person. Or a cat. It doesn't make a difference, really. Just strangle.\n\nBasic concept of a game is "to be fun".\n\nWRONG AGAIN.\n\nThe "fun" aspect was cut out by really unballanced decks. Of course that you HAVE TO PLAY with PREMADE decks in campaign with no sideboard option (devs, ya heard about sideboards?) and no way of checking what was added to your deck in any way but restarting the next duel - which you obviously will, since it takes at least 10 tries to draw a hand that would in some suprising way be a good hand against a sadistic I-am-really-prepared-for-only-your-deck deck. On top of that, the name, "sadistic I-am-really-prepared-for-only-your-deck deck", is not a coincidence. Those soon-to-be-devouring-you premade decks of opponents are made only to frustrate player, prepared to counter your EVERY move. Not the other way around, which would be good for new players.\n\nSpeaking of newbies getting into MTG: Don't, I repeat, DO NOT download this game. It will make you hate this beautiful game. Besides few matches in campaign that teach you basics, you will get thrown into the pit of hatred, which is stirred again and again, causing you to raise your eyebrows and asking: "how the hell could anyone enjoy this?". Let me tell you, why: There are people who like to eat spiders and walk on shattered glass. This happens.\n\nBut it is nnothing compared to this "game". I wasn't even able to play online, but from what I've been told by not majority, but EVERYONE who played it - it is not worth it. Sure, you can play with your OWN decks, but it takes around an hour for a match and most times, if you know how to play MTG, you will soon be facing a bot who finishes the match for your opponent, who leaves furiously because of loosing. Fun.\n\nTo summarize: Magic Duels is NOT a free game. You pay with your sanity and, if you want to, your money. I may be masochistic enough to finish the campaign just to be sure that this "game" is not worth downloading. To be fair, I did not finish the game because of a crash (that's right, previous hellish encounters had nothing to do with that), when I had around 30 health, 8 creatures and ready-to-die opponent (I think it was 2nd clash in last deck's campaign). I highly doubt that last 3 matches, should I win, would miraculously enchant me to the point where I'd suddenly like this satans' spawn of a game.\n\nAnd yes - this review is quite angry, because, to be honest, MD gave me nothing but pain, suffering, anger and tears rather than joy and fun. Everything that I never found playing MTG in real life.","August 5, 2015","false","10.0"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","22","33","2","0"

And Magic is an awesome trading card game!\n- Its's free!\nSooo.. there is no reason why you shoudn't download this game and try it out. :)\n\nHowever, I can save you the time. :/\nCons:\n- The Cards you start with are crap. Surprise surprise. But there are even worse than you would expect. If you start playing Magic in real-life, you usually start with a starter-deck for ~10€, so you have sth. that is playable. Here, you have just a bunch of random cards, and almost no good ones. You simply won't be able to get a good deck together the first week you play this game (3h+ a day).\n- The whole content seems not be able to support some decent possible deck, since it's rather common (30% of the matches) that the AI (which has access to all cards) does not play a creature before the 5th turn.\n- Surrendering Players get AI'd, so you can still lose the match or you don't feel to have won a match against a human. So the key element (PvP) is obsolete since the AI-matches give you almost the same amount of gold (15 vs. 20) while beeing so much easier.\n\nConclusion: After playing a longer time, and grinding myself to death (due to the 6-Cards-Booster this takes forever) I have no good deck, almost no progress and no fun.\nBut thats just my opinion.\nThere are some reasons however, that are not so easily to dismiss.\n\nBugs\n(there are tons of them reportet, but I will only tell about those I had to notice.\n\n- Finish a quest and getting no reward.\n- An opponent managed to play 2 Lands in his first turn (without card-effects)\n- Card-effects that are bugged (rarely, but this is a no-go)\n- Sometimes priorities and the stack won't work like they should according to the rules (Effects are resolving at the wrong time, not always top to down)\n\nWell.. its like an early-access-game. Little content, bugs, pay to win, no, pay to have fun and I will not pay nearly as much for a virtuel card as I would for a real (6-cards-booster for 1,70€ vs. 10-cards-booster for 3€) in a game that isn't even working properly.\n\nDo not support this game.","August 20, 2015","false","32.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matsuringo/recommended/316010/","matsuringo","Matsuringo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matsuringo/","133 products in account","Absolutely unacceptable and irredeemable.\n\nOne would hope Stainless Steel/WotC learned a little bit about last year's Duels fiasco, but it seems they have a learning disorder. Please note that at this time, MTG Duels has many connectivity and technical issues; I am not even going to take those into account, as that is typical of a launch, plus I didn't experience much of it myself.\n\nThis game's biggest sin by far here is greed. For now, let's put aside the whole gold cap/microtransaction bit and focus solely on one thing: the god damn cards. They're all HORRIBLE. They refused to use the entire Origins set and instead opted for the most unplayable garbage filler cards. One can only assume this is so people will continue to play paper MTG or MTGO, however this does not make for a fun game. They cannot afford to half ♥♥♥ this when Hearthstone has such a firm grasp on the online TCG market; they really need to step up and be a viable competitor and axing out all the good cards from your set does not make a good game. I can honestly see this being a strategy in order to make their first expansion addition sell better; they simply make the base set ♥♥♥♥, make the expansion amazing and bam, people want to buy the cards NOW to get something decent. I wouldn't even mind if some of the cards were decently playable, but they're just not. You get ONE blue counterspell that costs FOUR mana, two black kill spells that both cost FIVE mana, a white exile that costs FIVE mana, red burn spells worse than SHOCK and absolutely no good green beasts worth mentioning.\n\nLet's move on to the gold system and the rest of the game. There's a daily gold cap, which I understand quite frankly. Unlike Hearthstone, there are no excess cards here. You just get cards until you have them all, so packs need to be more limited by that nature. However what isn't fine is pretty much every facet of multiplayer. There is no chat with opponents, no lobbies with friends (something previous DotP had), and no gold to be made playing with said friends. Gold acquisition falls squarely on random matches against online players you'll never interact with, a one time run of the story, and fighting hard level AI. This makes earning gold time consuming and unfun, a clear push towards purchasing and another check mark on the greed list.\n\nEven as a single player game, this game fails. The story mode has absolutely nothing on nearly every other DotP entry in terms of variety and length. Their existence is there just to pad out more time in order to frustrate you into buying gold. The single player opponents have well put together decks that you simply cannot reliably match with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ card pool. They will win and you will be forced to draw an absolutely perfect scenario in order to win. This makes victory less about skill and more about pure luck, which is a horrible thing to do to MTG players.\n\nI can't think of a single positive thing to say about this game. The music sucks, the font is harder to read, the buttons in combat are placed poorly, there are no special modes (archenemy, plane chase, etc), playing with your friends doesn't allow you to progress, the cards suck, the AI has unfair advantage, WotC is extremely transparent about wanting my money and despite taking longer to launch on PC, the client still has issues.\n\nWotC needs to get in touch with reality before seriously attempting to step into the digital TCG realm.","July 30, 2015","false","2.3"," 36 of 59 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","36","59","3","1"

Not all the bugs are fixed. Card pool is very diverse and the meta is great. We need some big fixes but other than that the game is fantastic.\n\nI don't usually do reviews. But this one deserves one as it is F2P and the tweens have come out in numbers because we have had a few days of connection problems. Other problems from the manchild fanbase amount to the game being too hard, grinding being too hard, and all kinds of other ridiculous things among a few valid concerns. Some problems do exist but they are pretty minor, and I will get to them later.\n\nPersonally, I have grinded only a bit and already am steadily winning matches and easily unlocking many good cards. I think the key here is this game is complex. You need to be able to build decks correctly and if you can't well you are going to have to learn. This isn't Hearthstone, so if you prefer a much easier and less complex game there is always that for you.\n\nAnother thing is the constant moaning about unlocking cards through gold. The game is FREE. Once they sort out community challenges and patch a couple of bugs the game will be very smooth. The so-called veterans complaining this isn't as complex as "normal" Magic are full of it. This game has all you need for a Magic veteran no longer interested in paper. I don't have time for paper, have little in common with those kinds of people generally, and prefer digital by a long shot. This is the only Magic game I will ever need. Now onto the game....\n\nTo start with, this is easily the best and most functional game Stainless has ever made. Period. I haven't run into too many major bugs that affect the card play and nor do I have any connection issues anymore. My hours attest to this. I am sure there are a few more problems I have not spotted, but so far the game isn't even CLOSE to the disaster of connection issues that 2013 was. 2014 was still a buggy mess at times and had a very terrible deck tier framework to boot.\n\nThe deckbuilder in Origins is great, if a little streamlined and lacking some options people might want. You can duplicate decks, make any deck you want fairly easily, and you can also narrow down your searches of the card pool with options to parse. It's not perfect but what is there works very well. You can also name your decks and select an avatar and background for each, which is a nice added touch. I do wish we could see the deck names people make for their builds in the versus screen.\n\nThe modes they do have in the game are pretty much normal for a Magic game. I have no problems here. (I refused to buy 15 on account of 2HG missing). The campaign is fun and short like other years, and should prime newcomers to the game quite easily. I enjoyed the short stories of the planewalkers and actually had hoped there were about ten matches for each character. A bit of a letdown there, but only because it was fairly well done if a little low budget. Make sure you select a good round of cards to begin the game or it could end up being pretty tough in some matches.\n\n1v1 and 2HG are there for you and friends to play, although you do not earn gold with friends as of this review. 2HG is finally back and it's not perfect.... but it's friggin' back!. I was mainly a 2HG player in 2014 and down because I hated 1v1 with scripted decks, but now we have 2HG again and it's pretty great. Chat and some connection issues need to be ironed out, but I can't be mad that they put back in the mode we all protested for.\n\nAnyway, the most important part of the game is obviously the cards and the balance of the cards. And this is where the game shines. To start with the look of the cards is fantastic, eclipsing by a great deal any other card game on the market. Hearthstone looks like a child's game compared to the beauty of Magic and its artwork and card layout. Period. Not even arguable. This year looks the best out of all of them. You can read all the information you need about any card in the deckbuilder and in the game. A welcome improvement from 14. The board itself we play on is a little plain and I do hope in the future we get a couple more boards to mix up the dueling.\n\nEach of the planeswalkers has been granted a set of cards that is not only balanced but very workable, and you obviously get one double-sided planeswalker card to play in each deck. These cards are quite fun to mess around with in game. In 2HG they really seem to make a difference at the right time. A nice little addition to the series for sure.\n\nDual and Tri-colored decks are easily made within a few booster packs after the campaign is completed. Each color is more balanced in itself and against others more than any other year of Magic, especially the years up to 2014, which were horrifically imbalanced to the point of deck tiers being so out of whack it was unreasonable. To me the card pool so far has been fantastic, with some old favorites melding perfectly with newer cards to create a welcome and diverse array of creatures, lands, artifacts, enchantments, and spells. I especially appreciate the dual colored lands in various setups.\n\nThe boosters for gold work well within the context of leveling up and paying for the game. You can buy gold as wel if you want to spend money for the collection of cards instead of grinding. You don't have to pay, but then you will have to make some good decks and win a lot of games to acquire said boosters, which have 6 cards each. All in all there are about 80 of them to have the full collection on display. And what a great collection of cards it is. Superbly balanced for possibly the first time in ages, though, I did not get around to playing 2015. The inclusion of 2HG alone makes the game that much better.\n\nThe bugs in this game are there for sure. But it's hardly worth mentioning them, as I will mostly just have to update the review when they are fixed. The community challenges briefly mentioned above are a bit buggy. 2HG could surely use another patch or two. And there are limited number of cards that don't always seem to work correctly. But all in all I find these things a minor headache. And this is coming from someone that protested 15 and never even bought the thing, even on Steam sale. I am very satisfied with this game up to this point. It remains to be seen what they do with expansions and further patching. I will update the review when needed.\n\nIn the end, Stainless certainly seems to have learned from some of their mistakes at least. But a few things remain to be included in the platform here, which is still a very solid foundation. These things include more modes, 2HG gold, chat, bug fixes, and possibly an option for things like hold priority and more UI tweaks. Yes, the game is not complete. But this is just the start of Magic in the new DOTP realm. It's hard for me to understand why so many people are writing with extreme anger all the time when their game doesn't work for a few days or hours. Find something else to do! You didn't pay for this game. It just came out. They had servers fixed within a couple days.\n\nAll I can say is don't trust these reviews too much or their hyperbolic opinions of the game. Trust longtime Magic players who are usually not people that tend to massively overreact about small problems. I too have hated on Stainless a fair amount, but I feel I can give them the benefit of the doubt here.\n\nAs always, new players need to remember to cut your decks to about 60 or 61 cards with 22-24 mana on a normal dual-colored deck for this game. Make probability your friend. Think abstractly and play a lot of games versus the AI at first before you enter against seasoned players with great builds. If you persevere I see no reason you cannot win and succeed at the game.\n\nIf Stainless can fix the small amount of problems this is easily the best card game on the market. Hearthstone can eat its heart out.","August 5, 2015","true","573.5"," 45 of 76 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","45","76","3","7"

Unfortunately, I have to say that this game has been a huge disappointment. Aside from all of the glitches/technical problems that others have mentioned, I have found the story mode to be unbearably boring and generally not fun. My main issue is that, in DOTP, you could choose the deck you like at the beginning and then gradually unlock cards that you can use to modify it as you go along. You could also unlock new, better decks as you work your way through chapters. In Duels, however, you get stuck with a new, terrible 'intro'-level deck for each chapter of the story. These decks are not possibe to modify; when you unlock new cards, the game just throws them in there without consulting you. There's nothing fun about playing with a deck entirely composed of crappy 2/2 creatures with no discernable combo opportunities. It basically just boils down to replaying each incredibly boring opponent over and over again until, eventually, you can widdle their life down to zero. This might be an OK model for people who are just now learning to play, but people who actually have a moderate grasp of the game will probably just feel like it's a huge waste of time.","September 6, 2015","false","5.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

In this case, it's the best possible scenario: you pay only for the cards - but it's not mandatory. You can earn ingame gold (required to buy boosters) by playing through campaign, by winning battles againts AI or other players or by completing daily Quests.\n\nYou can really enjoy it as a true "free" game, without making any investment, and actually play the game for the thrill of getting new cards ("what's in the new pack?"). And still, even with less than optimal deck, you still have a chance with online opponents, because you will be matched based on your rank.\n\nPros:\n\n+ complete freedom in deck building (the biggest change to the old editions, which allowed only to unlock some cards and customize pre-defined deck)\n+ F2P model works well - you can invest to get the cards quicker, but there is a lot to enjoy even without ANY investment. If you commit to invest, you only pay for the cards - it's as fair as CCG can be. No game features are locked behind the paywall and no artificial restrictions (you don't have to pay for additional "deck slots" and stuff like that)\n+ good (and often challenging) campaign\n+ ability to play against randomized AI\n+ beautiful artwork\n+ clean, well-designed interface\n+ very good tutorial\n\nCons:\n\n- rare occurances of game instability and connectivity problems\n- ingame pop-up's","May 2","true","53.3"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","26","41","0","0"

Now lets go into the negative side of things. Devs what the hell are you thinking? You created a new matchmaking system where it places you into like a queue. It was a good idea, if the ♥♥♥♥ worked. You stopped the lobby system.... but why? The lobby system actually worked. So why change something that didn't need fixing.

The overall powerlevel of the cards available seems to be better than the "scrub" we had in Magic 2015 and it is also possible to play 2 Headed Giant once again. After playing this game for some hours and finally managing to build an ok deck from all the stuff I unlocked I have to say that this game is quite bland and not that much fun for a guy like myself.\nI'm the sort of guy who enjoyed playing the old DotP(Duels of the Planeswalkers) games where you had a bunch of premade decks to choose from. The cards available were both fun to play and powerful. Many good decks based on simple and effective themes such as lifegain, tokens, removal spells, milling, tribal theme and burn.\nThe combo's you could pull off and the different styles of gameplay were quite numerous and complex.\n..sorry Wizards, you do not impress me with this new simple magic game. To me it has a very flat and bland feeling with a very limited cardpool. I was hoping for a fun and quick to get into game, but unless you want to pay extra for boosters you will have to grind forever until the cards you need are unlocked. I really dont recommend this game.. one good thing about this game is that it is free to play. I would prefer paying a little bit for a much better game though.","August 13, 2015","false","21.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

When are you guys going to learn this game type sucks? Everything about it just sucks, from the limited card selection that makes building a synergized deck impossible, to forking over obscene amounts of money for randomized booster packs. As in, pay up and you might get some good cards. The whole freemium pricing model in general makes me and my future children's children weep.\n\nVirtual MtG's strength lies in the creativity of its developers, who are at their best when making their own decks for players to use and tweak. If someone wants to build a deck from scratch, chances are they're going to invest in the actual paper cards, instead of this nickle-and-dime operation.\n\nWizards/Stainless sees the wild success of Hearthstone and thinks "Aha! So that's how we do it! Just charge for everything separately!" And so now we enter a dark age where 'free' content is sold to us through micro charges, subscriptions and payment plans. This will eventually culminate in an Orwellian nightmare-verse, where we are forced to wear bomb collars in the form of license agreements for our games.\n\nEither let players grind out the cards or think of ways around the Pay2win philosophy, like making cards tradeable (other than Infinity Wars, this has yet to be done in any CCG I've played so far). It would enable better in-game and real-world economy, which would then maybe branch into its own card-swapping community. All it would take is some simple software to set up trades between players and might even encounrage them to buy your blasted boosters in case that trend isn't going away anytime soon.","August 12, 2015","false","16.0"," 36 of 60 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","36","60","4","1"

Hasbro has a reputation of not funding magic products appropriately or otherwise short-changing or whoring out the franchise. In that regard - they do not dissapoint here. They live up to the hasbro name. This game is ready for a technical alpha - it should not be released atm. There are many issues from crashes to bugs- some more annoying bugs might be the inabbility to earn more than one fifth of a single booster pack in a day because the game cannot accurately keep track of how much gold you have earned.\n\nI do not expect this product to be properly supported at all. This is not the type of game which will recieve regular patches and updates. It is the type of game which hopes you buy a bunch of boosters and suffer through buyers remorse when one content update occurs a year. Do not fool yourself into thinking the game is or will ever be more than it is currently.\n\nThis game is a cash grab. It does not hold a candle to hearthstone in any way. It has less cards, it doesn't reward ranked play (hearthstone pays dust and gold cards based on monthly rnaking now), it is covered in bugs, it has irreputable companies involved which are not known for good digital products, it hasn't recieved a single update since I have played. There are no plans for the expansion of this game; there is no information available for any direction it is supposed to take. This game is not supported in any way (no future, no lore, no story, less than 5 paragraphs on the damn wizards website). Hasbro should burn to the ground for what they have done with the magic franchise.\n\nThe game is a complete let down for me. Heartstone will continue to lead the trading card game market into the future and hasbros share of the market will continue to shrink compared to the mamoth blizzard entertainment. It is evident they do not want this game to succeed; but stingy lazy hasbro will pretend this was a good effort and pat themselves on the back as they sink.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/esperflame/recommended/316010/","esperflame","Esperflame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/esperflame/","73 products in account","So as an old MtG player and a Duels of the Planeswalker player, this is by far the worst version of MtG to date. This game has tons of bugs which have been around since the launch of July 2015. The progression system is purposely slow to encourage you to dump actually money to unlock cards. They also removed the option to manually progress each phase which can cause problems as the game will sometimes completely skip a phase even though you have a legitimate action to take.\n\nIt used to be in Duels of the Planeswalker, you could grind bots for your cards. Each game versus a bot would get you 1-3 cards depending on the unlock. Now you earn 6 cards after 15 games and no I'm not counting quest coins because half the time the quest rewards bug out and refuse to progress. This isn't the worst part though. They have also restricted the number of gold you can earn each day which you use to unlock cards. Each pack costs 150 gold with no price deals for buying multiple packs and a cap of earning 400 per day. This is all to wear people down with a crazy grind and tempt/force people to spend actual money to unlock cards, but it gets worse. It used to be when you spent actual money to unlock cards, you would spend $5 to buy a key which would unlock all the cards assiciated with a particular deck which would usually involve 30ish cards of which about half were rares or better. Now $5 gets you 500 coins which is enough to unlock 3 packs and have 50 coins left over netting you 3 rares or better, 6 uncommons and 9 commons. Thats a considerable drop to what you used to earn overall on all fronts of unlocking cards. This s clearly purposeful to milk players of cash.\n\nThey have removed the option to require players to manually progress each phase. I have on several occasions had legitimate plays stolen from me because the game would skip the second main phase and go immediately to end phase. I've also had the game deny me legitimate plays when I stop the timer at end phase. For example, I have a black/red steal sacrifice deck. If I use all my mana to steal your creature, because I have no mana left the game assumes I want to end my turn before I can sacrifice your creature to my Nantuko Husk so you don't get it back. Sometimes it even glitches out and when I stop the timer in my end step to try and do this, it removes the highlight around Nantuko Husk now allowing me to sacrifice the creature while the timer is stopped which means my only recourse is to start the timer again and as quick as I can activate the sacrifice ability and if I mess it up somehow and the timer finishes, they get their creature back. MtG isn't a game of rushed responses, it's about making tactical descisions which this game doesn't seem to like.\n\nAnd finally theres the bugs which have been in this game for almost a year now since the launch. The Quest rewards don't work half the time and the only work around is to play with a deck made using the Deck Builder Wizard which sure is decent if you have no clue how to build a deck, but to those of us who have been playing MtG since Legends/Dark/Antiqueties, the pre-made decks are a joke. Also there's a bug in the store when you buy coins that can force you to have to deal with customer service to get what you paid for. Finally, there is the in-game mechanic bugs. When I play 2 headed giant with a friend of mine and go to activate fire breathing on my enchanted flame-kin, half of the time the ability just completely bugs out. It will activate but then sits there with the timer almost in a frozen state. After the timer ends it will use only one mana completely wasting my time as I do this 5 or more times without once popping up the menu that asks how many times I wish to pump up my creature.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't recommend this game to anyone as to me it feels like a giant buggy game designed to scam you out of as much money as possible.","May 17","false","58.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

It doesn't award coins for playing against friends or playing two-headed giant.  I think they are fixing the 2HG issue, but it still seems dumb that I can't earn even 5 coins for playing against a friend\n- The amount of cards and card sets available to play with is fairly small right now.  It has plenty of gameplay possibilities just with what it has right now, but it's hard not to want some more of the vast number of card sets available in the physical game\n- For such a relatively simple game graphically, the performance is generally a little slow both in connecting to the network and in gameplay\n\nConclusion:\n\nUnless you are already a Magic afficianado, this is simply the best way to get into and play Magic which is the best collectible card game around.\n\n9.5 / 10.0","January 28","true","82.9"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","39","66","3","2"

This is magic the gathering. So why the thumbs down?\n\nWell, for starters, the campaign is short, gruellingly annoying, and so stacked against you its replayability is simply waiting for the AI to be land or creature screwed so you can win. Half of the cards you are give NOBODY would EVER use. They are the most terrible decks you can build, and then the AI you fight has a deck specifically designed to counter yours. Its not hard, its quite litterally impossible. (Unless the therefore mentioned land or creature lacking hand)\n\nThis isnt what magic is about and the developers of this game should be ashamed to have created this pile. I dont even want to get into the numerous cheaty bugs the AI have pulled. Attacking without tapping without vigilance, card effects without the prerequisite action happening, and sacrificing a creature after its dealt its damage and received fatal damage for its effect.\n\nI would love to see a hard but fair mtg game in this, but simply put, its designed to make you grind it to win. With 15 land cards being pulled in a row, or you have 1 land and 12 useless cards in a row. While this happens yes, it doesnt happen every hand. When you do finally get a good hand, and your deck plays as well as it possibly can, the AI always has the perfect counter that not only shuts you down but kills you. Like a 7/8 flying trample on turn 4..... Against a water deck with NO COUNTER SPELL....\n\nAlso just found out, you can not build a deck with fewer then 15 land, period. (When you have land draw and mana providing creatures less then a dozen land is a valid build) You ( or atleast I ) can not play against people as the game either times out one side or the other.\n\nImho, you want a good magic game, welp keep looking cause this aint it.","October 6, 2015","false","10.2"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

However, with such a simple design, you would expect being able to play with others should be simple and easy to do. You can find an opponent but the game will spend ages trying to connect the two of you only to get a message saying they cant do it. Two headed mode is also a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can invite a friend to play but you cant decide if you play together or against each other. Instead of making the game playable the developers want to release new content when the current content is broken. Nobody wants new broken stuff. It also has a pay to win mechanic. Either you spend money on the broken game to get a chance of having decent cards or you have to grind through an unplayable game which exits randomly in the middle of a card game regardless of it being AI or human. You dont get to complete. You only get rewards for a win. I do not reccomend this game to anyone because even if you pay for lots of booster packs, you cant use them anyway. With the recent expansion you can clearly see which way the developers are going as no bugs were fixed and im sure many new ones have appeared instead. Releasing new content to make you open your wallet without even bothering to fix the game is utter disrespect which is a problem with game developers as of recent times.","April 8","false","98.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

It was free, and consisted all standard decks with good lore in the tutorial, very easy to get a hang of. In fact, contrary to the other Magic games, this one actually gave you a vanilla liberty to create your own deck.\n\nBut as I grew accustomed to this game, I noticed how AWFUL this game is. Here are some points that you, as Magic player, really need to be aware of:\n- You are not granted full deck-creating liberty. The developpers have excluded many cards from the sets (like Stasis Snare or Stone Haven Outfitter).\n- On top of the point above, they are disallowing you from using more than 3 uncommons, 2 rares or one mythic each type of card. That's absolute BS.\n- They will not add any cards Pre-Origins. Even cards from high-demanded sets like Modern Masters, Tarkir or Ravnica, are not going to be in there.\n- The start for experienced Magic players is extremely frustrating. It takes a lot of time (-or money) before you finally get a good card for your deck.\n- The matchmaking in a game is horrible. Here you come with a few matches played, with your 90% starter deck, expecting to be able to fight a rank 18 player with a full custom deck.\n- The worst, worst, WORST thing of this game, is that crashes are EXPLOITABLE. There LITERALLY is a way to make the other person's game crash (or permanently stall), and the developers have STILL not fixed it! People can make you lose deliberately if they were on the losing end. I can't believe the developpers are not seeing this!\n\nThis game is absolutely broken. It's either grind- or pay-to-win, the game is horribly easy to abuse/exploit in terms of making the other person instantly lose by letting their game freeze/crash, this game has SO many no-go's in what a game should be like.\n\nI had my time done on this game.

Especially since it's FREE! Getting through the tutorials and can be a little annoying; however, the gameplay is solid.\n\nNoteworthy things!\n- Deckbuilding could use a tweak to allow a player to see more than, like... 6 cards at once; if not all cards; they have filtered since there's a zoom function. Without something like that implemented, it feels... "squeezed" together. I'd go so far to call it "claustrophobic".\n- Card Selection on the main menu will show you the cards you have/don't have so it's nice. Apparently, uses only the Origin set. Hence, the title. But from the description, more sets will be added.\n- Story mode is neat. Pretty cutscenes (for the styling) tell how the planeswalkers came to be.\n- The forced wait time... Just... No.\n- The Easy (Goes to Medium and Hard) mode AI will kick your butt. Just sayin'. At least there's a challenge! Have yet to play past Medium mode cuz, well, let's face it... need 'dem good card combos.\n- You can get every card entirely for free. However, there's an option to pay for the in-game currency; which if you have a problem with spending habits then you probably shouldn't play this.\n- THERE IS TWO HEADED GIANT (Team game, for the new folks) and 1v1 mode. Free for All was overlooked though. Dunno if it'll be added or not since the game's new. Hopefully it will be! I've played the Two headed Giant mode a few times, and it seems to work without issues thus far. If a player drops out, they are replaced with the AI.\n- So far, one crash after playing for several hours in the AI vs. mode. It didn't reoccur.\n\nI'd recommend this if you are new to Magic. But, experienced players can have some fun out of it too. Just remember there are gameplay options that, if disabled, make the game more like the TCG (Things won't automatically happen).\nFirst game review ever, too. Jeez. Guess that tells you how much I like the game, eh? :)\n\nAfter playing it for a few days, I'd rate it 7.5/10.","July 31, 2015","true","22.4"," 65 of 118 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","65","118","3","0"

After finishing games and quests, I don't seem to receive gold half the time. Sometimes it jumps up the next time I log in, but I'm sure there have been occasions when I haven't received gold for quests at all. I'm also not receiving new daily quests at all at the moment, which is annoying as I wanted to build up a few more cards before properly playing in versus mode. Hopefully they have fixed the connectivity issues now, but I've lost gold several times due to losing connections with the servers after finishing a match, which is also very irritating.\n\nFor the actual gameplay, I feel that the layout and the way games are played works well enough. I think there have been some really bad decisions made for the campaign and quests though. The campaign is supposed to help new players learn to play the game, but even though I've been playing for a few years now I had to repeat a number of the campaign missions over and over again. The decks you are given aren't very strong against the decks you are facing, and as you can't change them you just have to keep starting over and over again until you draw a perfect hand and then draw the cards you need for most of the game.\n\nI also think the deck wizard is terrible. Any decks I've built with it have been really weak, and you aren't able to amend them afterwards. I don't understand why they didn't stick to how it was done in the previous duels of the planeswalkers games. Duels 2014 was the first of these games I played, and it was a much better way for new players to learn. You got given several pre built decks, with a few extra cards you could add or remove, and as you unlocked more cards you could make bigger changes. That way, you started out with a decent deck, and could fine tune it as you played with it to make it fit your style. I think this game would have been much improved if it just had a template deck for each colour combination, and let you add to it and take cards out as you unlocked new cards.\n\nWhat I hate most about the deck wizard, though, is that you have to use decks built with it to complete the daily quests where you have to win with a certain colour combination. As half of the fun of Magic is building your own decks, I don't see how they thought this was a good idea. Every new quest you have to build a new deck, with the wizard withholding cards you know you want in the deck and making a mess of your mana curve and lands. I pretty much only play these decks against the AI on easy, because they just aren't good enough to play any other matches.\n\nWith regards to the cards in the game, I think the decks you can build are fairly balanced, nothing is going to be too poweful, and I don't feel the game is pay to win. I haven't played a lot of versus mode games, but I've never felt I was beaten because the other player had cards I didn't have.  The problem with it is that they seem to have done this by removing any interesting cards and leaving less powerful cards. After looking at the cards you can collect, there don't seem to be many at all which are over 6 mana. I guess it means that you can't keep buying packs until you get game winning high mana cards which other people don't have, But I always felt a lot of the fun in this game was managing to play your expensive and very powerful cards.\n\nI think the game does have potential. But even though I was looking forward to this for weeks before it was released, most days I just can't be bothered to play it. The bugs are annoying, the daily quests are boring and grindy when they actually appear, and there just doesn't seem to be much interesting to do with the cards available. Without any kind of communication with the other player, the versus mode is a bit dull as well, and half of the time players will drop out after drawing a bad hand and you play the match against the AI anyway.\n\nOverall, I think the game could be decent in future, but at the moment the bugs and weird design decisions make it really difficult to just have fun while playing it.\n\n\n","August 22, 2015","false","306.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Giant oversights.\n\nGood potential but this game hovers between borderline unplayable on a good day to infuriaring frustrating on a bad day.\n\nFirst of all, it's been plagued by connectivity issues since the first day. The developers offered some coins recently to make up for it and have made some strides to fix the connectivity issues, but they don't make up for the multitude of lost matches, lost coins, lost progressions, and simple inability to play two head giant with your friend.\n\nSecond of all, the UI is atrocious for the PC. It's clearly a port from the mobile versions that came out before the PC edition, and there has been little to no attempt to take good advantage of the mouse and keyboard a PC player would use.\n\nThird of all, there are many, many glaring oversights. There have also been countless times where either an oversight or glitch has caused the match. If you didn't turn off easy targeting in the gameplay options, and you're running a deck with black cards or that involve sacrificing, you'll find (at the time of writing) that easy targeting doesn't allow you to attack yourself or heal an opponent (valid strategies for the more advanced players). There would have been no mention of this until you tried it out in mid battle. There have also been countless times where the game has skipped my main phase (usually the second one, but also the first) or my battle phase. I've been unable to choose my blockers after having pressed the pause timer button and resuming.\n\nAll the pros to this game are due to the card game itself. There has been no time where I thought to myself, "Wow, that was a really nice implementation of the card game." In case you're wondering about the hours I've put in, keep in mind I've played the physical card game before as well as played the iOS version when it first came out. All of the glitchiness that version had when it came out got ported right to the PC version, and all the complaints I've mentioned have come from the PC version. I was hoping the PC version would have had the time to fix a lot of these issues, but they haven't. It's actually worse off, because at least the UI makes sense for a tablet not a PC game.\n\nThe game implements the virtual currency in exchange for real world money or time that all f2p and mobile games use. If you don't like that in mobile games, you won't like it here.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. It's too buggy with many oversights on the basic fundamentals of the game. The few good times I've had do not make up for the intensity of the frustration of losing a match due to a fault entirely on the game itself and not due to your skills, or going through an annoying campaign mission only to find out that the game lost internet connection (on an always connected PC) and none of your progress will be saved. A lot of people I know have complained about the lack of cards, but I'm more worried and upset about the very bad foundation they've set up to worry about any future card expansions. I would recommend to wait until they fix these fundamental issues.","August 13, 2015","false","174.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It is a great FREE way of playing Magic when I am stuck in a place where I don't have anyone to play traditional Magic ( you know...the cardboard variant ;) ) with.\n\nI feel like it gets alot of hate from people for the lack of different things and bugs and so on. But most of these I haven't experienced myself. With a good, stable internet connection it should be fine, and I feel like bugs have gradually been removed. And if we are lucky they might add more things as time goes since wizards hopefully stick with this game for a while.\n\nIt can be a little boring in the beginning learning how magic works ( as a irl magic player I knew it already, but you got coins for the tutorials so...) but it is explained really well for a beginner and Gideons storyline gives a more interesting approach than just basic tutorials. I do wish there were an choice i the beginning where you could choose if you where an already experienced player or a beginner though, but you can't have it all.\n\nThe gold earning in the game is fair for a F2P game with the possibility to buy coins if you WANT to.\n5 coins for an easy opponent, 10 for a medium, 15 for a hard and 20 for a player vs player win (with the bonus of an extra 20 for your first win of the day against a player) on top of the quests and the gold you get from the storylines. I have never felt that I needed to buy coins, some diligent playing and deck building experience will make it easier to earn after a while. (It goes ALOT faster than heartstone in my opinion!!)\n\nSome people say that the AI is sometimes too good even at easy, but as always in magic a good hand is a good hand no matter if you are an AI or not. It is a game of luck in some sense, as these games usually are.\n\nSo my final conclusion is: Magic Duels is better than no magic at all. And as a F2P I think it is an OK one! :)","January 19","true","234.1"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

And I will be honest, as much as hardcore MTG fan, despite all the positive rating on main page, this game is BARE BONE at the moments. It is so small it makes Hearthstone look like World of Warcraft. There is very little content available, for example, there are only around 200+ cards, which is a joke compare to other TCG, ex: Hex, Hearthstone, or even Classic Magic Online. Two Head Giant mode (2v2) is back, but what is the point if half of the players could not start the game and it takes hour to find match.  And let's be honest this pc game playerbase is not large either.  You can't even manual set 2v2 with AI teammate like Duels of Planewalker either. That is about it, there is no additional mode like Planewalking or Archenemy.\n\nBottom line, they took out more contents than they add.\n\nAgain, I refuse to spend any money until i see some SERIOUS bugs fix and please, very please, for variety sake, please ADD MORE cards.","August 11, 2015","false","237.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The story mode is atrocous and requires you to play perfectly, draw perfectly and the computer to draw horribly to win anything past the tutorial. The enemy decks are perfectly suited against the deck your playing and the amount of mana in your deck borders on ludicrous. The deck building is awful and unintresting.

I thought.\n\nI thought so bad.\n\nAfter testing the game... story mode is not so bad. But the game IS a cash grab, even more worse than Hearthstone, which Magic Duels claims to have followed the same model. I'm sorry, but in Hearthstone... you actually have SOME GOOD CARDS to start. On here, it's just awful.\n\nOh, and getting boosters (By defenition, a Magic the Gathering booster pack is 15 cards, but on here it's 6 cards, so who cares!) is a drag. Battle mode easy AI are equipped with cards you would DREAM to have - but won't until you play 60 hours of those.\n\nPlaying versus players is simple - either you are against people who paid 50$ to get 32 boosters (which is 192 cards... i think i'll buy real life cards, they cost less, thank you), or either you are against the same people as you - which means 20 turns games... for pocket change.\n\nAs the game is now, you lose either way.\n\nOh, and there's daily quests to get coins! Yay.. or not. Because it requires ARCHETYPES deck - so you can customize it A BIT.\n\nHonestly, i'd rather pay 10$ like for Magic 2015 to get the same type of unlocking (get a booster after clearing a story mode mission OR winning a ''random encounter'' in a plane) than this.\n\nOnly good point : It was free to test.\n\nAs the game is, I CAN'T and WON'T recommend it.\n\nEDIT : After giving the game a second chance, i found out that sometimes, when you manage to do those hassles that are the quests... the coins they give is not always given. Just to add to the list of cons already big enough...\n\nUPDATE (As of 2016-01-27) : Six months later, is the game better?\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- Still not getting the right gold amounts from daily quests, or it simply erases what i had saved up to now and gives me the ''correct'' amount. Must have lost like 600 gold this way up to now.\n\n- Hard AI as NO diversity (I do not play against Easy and Medium now.. i mean, 5 or 10 coins a game is so few). By that, i mean : Always splashes white, always play control, as soon as you know which cards do what (Looking at you, Gideon's Reproach), hard is... well, it's 15 coins. When it doesn't bug out.\n\n- Both me and a friend opened a ''phantom'' booster. It shows the cards you got from buying... then no cards in the card collection. Kinda mad since i had finally a Kiora...\n\nI can't believe such bugs still exists many months after the game's launch. Seriously.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n- Battle for Zendikar added some diversity AND some good cards that are actually usable.\n\n- That's it.\n\nYes, i played about 55 hours because i had faith it could become better. The people managing this game (if there are any other than ''Mod_Chris'', because game content updates are as rare as black lotuses) could probably do much better... or just change the people managing the game. A passionate community managed to do over 3000+ cards over a few months that are all working, why can't a game company paid to do so can't?\n\nAnyway, still not really worth it. Try it if you want though, it IS free-to-play, but i won't ever consider paying them a penny for the game as it is.","August 18, 2015","false","74.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The gameplay and story weave nicely together to create an interesting and exciting campaign.  The graphics and sounds are mostly great: not much artistic or technical prowess is needed for a digital card game, but the few cutscenes definitely could have been more polished.\n\nControls work well enough, but some elements of the game's earlier mobile design leak through.  For example, many gameplay controls are placed in the lower righthand corner where a quick thumbpress is perfect for some hardware, but rather clumsy for others.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem with Magic Duels: Origins lies in its value.  While certainly worth playing for the story, Magic Duels has so little worth beyond its campaign.  Every card could be collected given enough time, but in-game transactions speed the process tremendously.  Why spend the money?  To reach the top rank of this year's beginner program?

First impressions are Bad.\nPros:\n1. It's Magic: The Gathering. If you like that, or similar games, you'll probably have fun with this.\n2. There's plenty of tutorials which seem helpful (If a little heavy handed at times) to help new and unfamiliar players.\n3. It's FREE!\n\nCons:\n1. The servers are terrible, and you will be frequently disconnected, or offline.\n2. The game is effectively unplayable while offline.\n3. Number of cards available is relatively small.\n4. Prepare to grind in order to get more cards, unless you're willing to fork up some cash.\n\n\nAt the moment, I would not reccomend this game. The biggest complaint I have about the game is the fact it requries you to always be connected to their servers, even for the singleplayer content. This would not be nearly the issue that it is, if it were not for the fact that the servers go down very frequently at the moment. The game allows you to "play" while offline, however nothing that is done offline will be saved. Progress in the campaign, singleplayer matches against Bots, and even decks created while offline will not be saved. You will also not be rewarded in anyway for wins while offline, even if the game was connected when the match was started. This can be very frustrating when you find out a hard earned win will net you nothing because of the servers.\n\nBesides the connection problems, so far the game seems relatively stable. The deck building "wizard" is a significant improvement over the one from Magic 2015, and you start with a lot more cards available at the start of the game. However as a Magic player, I'm disappointed by the relatively small pool of cards overall. Like Magic 2015, there will be a lot of cards which are in the game, but that you cannot collect and add to your custom decks. Annoyingly, the bots you play against in singleplayer matches, and the decks you use in the campaign will have cards which are unavailable to you for deck building. Also, those who have played Magic 2015 may of remembered that you get a booster pack of cards whenever you win a match. That has been removed, in favor of a coin system. The downside is that you can't buy booster packs from a particular set, and winning a single game will not net you nearly enough coins to buy a booster pack. Expect to be grinding a bit to find your coins. However, to counteract this, they have added challenges which you can complete to get extra coins. However, like everything else, you need to be connected to their servers, and any progress towards completing a challenge will not be recorded while offline.\n\n\nIf you're interested in playing Magic Duels, I would at the very least wait for them to fix the servers, or for enough people to give up so that their servers can handle the load. Otherwise, I'd suggest looking somewhere else to get your deckbuilding card game fix.\n\n\nSidenote; I will be updating this review as I am able to put more time into this game. At the moment, the servers are down too frequently to get a clear picture of the game as a whole.\n\n\nAfter some additional playtime I found this:\nIf the game does lose connection to the servers during a story mission, you can attempt to reconnect. However, even if you do successfully reconnect, it will not save that you completed that story mission, and the mission will have to be completed. Strangely though, it still gives you the coins and upgrades the deck as if the story mission had been completed. This seems to be a bug.","July 30, 2015","false","28.0"," 47 of 85 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","47","85","2","1"

I felt it would be fair to give Stainless and WotC the extra time to produce a passable game.  Sadly, this has not been the outcome.\n\nMagic Duels is a game that has so much potential, that it fails to even approach.  Free to play card games are generally well recieved in the video game market of 2016, and the amount of money that well made ones make is staggering.\n\nHowever, for some reason there seems to be a lack of desire or funding on the part of WotC or Stainless, or both, to put together the nessecary resources it takes to produce a functional video game.\n\nMagic Duels has the shell of a great game, but once you look inside you see the blemishes.\n\nNumerous bugs still permeate the play experience.  The netcode is slow and frequently does not match players correctly.  The game does not allow players to accomplish things that they should be able to do in a game of Magic (such as Transforming a planeswalker with an activated ability in the second main phase).  The shuffling algorithms seem off.  The game doesn't even teach the correct rules of Magic, instead making stupid conscessions in the name of simplification that instead only serve to misinform.\n\nI really, really, really wanted to write a positive review of this game.  I was waiting for the March update and resting judgement until they had a chance to get it released and tuned up.  I have given WotC and Stainless every chance to remedy this buggy mess of a game.\n\nUnfortunately, considering the current state of the game, I cannot reccommend anyone play this game, unless you are completely desperate to play Magic on your PC and you don't have the money to play MTGO.\n\nNot recommended.","April 14","false","244.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I have played the magic card game for about 11 years and nearly all of video game versions they have released over the years. Not only is this version the worst one yet, but also a game with terrible design trends. It's like they looked at their Competition in the market and tried to copy them without thinking why those aspects were implemented in the first place. Hearthstone has booster packs with 5 cards, now so does Magic. Hearthstone uses a daily questing system and gold rewards, now so does Magic.\n\nIt makes me sick, it’s just lazy game design. The tutorial as well is horrid, even for this series of games. Ever wonder how trample worked?

Considering the last installment's was slow and unresponsive, this is a good thing.\n+Plot is kinda cool, everybody like planeswalkers\n+It’s beginners magic, so that could be good\n\nCon’s\n-Tutorial is terrible. Like really, are player’s not supposed to read cards anymore to figure out what they do?\n-The cards they give you in the starter have very little synergy for play, resulting in extremely basic decks.\n-The actual games of the story missions are fairly dull and pre-set. They are more challenges of ordering and playing cards correctly, than a real game of magic.\n\nI have had some issues connecting to their servers as well, but that could simply be up to chance. It should also be noted that there really aren’t too many improvements since the last game. The odd thing about this is that some features that were good have been taken away. Any video game player would know the feeling of a rushed production, and this game oozes it.\n\nHopefully this brief break down helps some people out in understanding my frustration with an overly simple and uninspired game.","August 1, 2015","false","6.0"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","31","55","5","1"

I played though each line and I must say that they help flesh out each character, Jace, Chandra, Nissa, Gideon, and Liliana. It's also the initial way to earn coins which can be used to purchase boosters.\n\nSomethign else that is a bother, all the cards in teh story decks stay in those decks. You will not have the chance to add those cards to your personal collection, nor can you modify the decks. In this case, every in per story releases more cards for that story deck.\n\nWhen I actually get decent cards maybe I might try multiplayer. But for now, there's little much past the story mode.\n\nI have to say compared to the previous games, the UI is slightly imrpoved, but when the UI zooms the table out when there are more cards on the field, I admit that I feel a little insecure. I laugh at this, but it's an effect that I just don't care much for.\n\nI love the music. I do bemoan the fact that the soundtrack for this game is not available. The main theme is catchy and tends to be stuck in my head for hours on end.\n\nI won't do multiplayer in this game at all, because any game that is Pay to Win is just not worth it in my book. earning you first 1000 in coins isn't too terribly hard, but after that, you;re all on you own. You either have to grind or play against other people.\n\nBut this is where the game is more like the real one. Honestly, even with the real cards, it is pretty much Pay to Win. However, with a terribly limited selection and the fact that I invested heavily in the previous interation, I find myself terribly reluctant to drop money on this one. Especially when packs are selling in this game slightly more expensive. A pack of 5 cards sells for $1.99 Real cards sell 15 for about $4.50. You'd do better to buy the real cards and play with friends.","August 13, 2015","false","235.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The decks you are forced to play are poor (in both design and mechanics) and the main story quests are badly unbalanced. The annoying, un-skipable, pop-up, interrupting tutorials are boring, un-necessary and deeply irritating (especially when you are forced into one mid-game). I have thoroughly enjoyed all the previous MTG games, so this was a huge letdown.  In what appears to be a badly mis-directed attempt to be more like Hearthstone they have created a badly structured game, with an awful appearance, slow clunky behaviour, frequent crashes, badly flawed deck design and an obvious thrust toward extorting as much cash out of the player to make the game even semi-playable.  Whoever is responsible for the design and implementation of this abomination should be thoroughly ashamed of the disgrace of a game they have produced.  Utter and complete tripe.  If it were possible to give a lower mark than 1/10 I would definitely do so here.","August 12, 2015","false","4.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

It seemed to me that I did not receive money for those because I skipped them (been playing MtG since Tempest) and a player doesnt seem to be able to go back and do them for the reward.\n\nI have to say I like the pace of the game, that's probably the strongest feature here, but the client is unbearably flaky. It crashes every day or two, completely freezes requiring restart every twenty to fourty minutes, and the client will minimise randomly. It often minimised for me at key moments when I'd have liked to stop the timer to play an ability or spell in response to my opponent. (Sucks pretty badly losing your regenerate creatures when you had approximately a million untapped land and nothing else to do with it! :c ) I've also noticed that it sometimes takes an age and a half to get into a random two-headed giant match because somehow the game you were connecting to is "full" or some such nonsense, and so is the next one, and the next one, and...\n\nI'd like to give it a neutral rating, as it's definitely not a bad game, but a lot of that has to do with it being MtG and not the implementation of the game. Sadly, I have to vote for a no at the present time. It's close to being mediocre or even above par, but just I can't abide losing to silly game system hiccups.\n\nDo take note of the time this review is posted when reading it.

The cost for this, however, is a punishingly slow unlock structure, that is made even more frustrating because of the low power levels they stick you with at the beginning.\n\nAs an example of how slow you can expect to unlock things in this game: I've spent 4 hours and have earned enough in-game currency to purchase 3 packs, i.e. 18 cards.\n\nThe Story mode is an attempt to fill in some of the back story of the various Planeswalkers, but it is generally an exercise in frustration. You are forced to use deliberately underpowered decks against competent AI with access to far better cards than you, which translates to you praying heavily on RNG for a chance to progress. I hope you enjoy trying to use Lilian's Black Cats to fend off an army of opposing Angels.\n\nAll in all, there is very little to recommend for this.

Only recommend for particular kinda of use.\nFirst of all, I haven't experienced any of the technical issues reported by many other users. (GTX 970, 4th generation i5 and 16GB RAM on Windows 7.)\n\nNow, on the good bits: they've finally got the interface to work well, unlike in previous renditions. It's clean, easy to use and easy to understand. (Both with and without a lot of the gameplay automation.) The tutorial system is excellent, and its monetization system is very fair (10 wins per pack just playing hard Bots + loads of money from story mode and skill quests.)\n\nBUT: the card pool is VERY limited, and the options you're given in the story mode are kind of misleading. A lot of fairly simple cards, like Lightning Bolt (3 damage to player or creature for a red) which appear in skill quests and story mode, don't appear in the game itself. This makes a lot of archetypes rather difficult to play, and restricts deck building options to the point where there seems to be little point in playing quite yet.\n\nTL;DR Overall, I wouldn't recommend this for longterm players, or anyone who already plays MTG. I would, however, recommend it as a free learning tool to get newbies into Magic.

Online there's only a handful of people and even though I consider myself a pretty good player there is almost no way to win from high level people that have either earned or bought better cards. It is really unfair because the people that have already build up a good deck will have a super easy time playing online, I regularly got matched up with lvl 10-15 even though I was level 1 myself.\n\nSo the only other way to earn credits to buy more cards and improve my deck would be singleplayer, which I've already finished and got pretty useless cards for in the boosters I unlocked. So now there's only AI matches which are frustrating but doable (see update). The AI cheats. I get consistently mana screwed every match and there's just no way you'll win if you only have the 3 mana in play that you got in your opening hand. (my deck has 24 mana)\n\nEither fix that or let me earn coins for playing a duel with my friends or in two headed giant because now all I can do is grind which is just awful! :(","October 16, 2015","false","141.7"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","25","44","4","10"

The only problem? It's so much a Pay to Win scheme that it's sad. I mean I have no issue with the pay option to get boosters, but the rate to acquire them are just plain atrocious. If facing against AI opponents, a victory garners 15 coins, a booster pack is worth 150. That's an average of 10 duels for 6 cards. Really? You guys couldn't just give us more to work with? The AI are jacked with decks with strategies that clearly outclass you in various degrees. Maybe it was my luck, but playing the same AI through story mode 10 times is not what I call thrilling or enjoyable.\n\nBut I will say there is one aspect I deeply enjoyed, Planeswalkers. Finally, it has only taken so many years to get this point. The custom deck builder is fun and user-friendly, but not the deck wizard, it's an abomination of a deck building alghorithm for new players.\n\nNot only that, these Quests (which are like daily things) where the Archetype ones involve using decks from the deck wizard are utterly annoying and not fun at all. But they give you free coins if you can just grind through them. It becomes a chore especially when they are using color combinations where you have not so great cards in those areas.\n\nThere is also one other feature I really was ticked about, in the older iterations of Duels, you could stop and pause the clock as an actual setting feature for every phase. Now? They got rid of it. You literally have to have the spazziest hands on this planet to hit either the Space Bar or the Mouse button on the hourglass icon. It's upsetting and while I understand that it streamlines the experience it really takes it away from the more experienced players who want to not worry about missing a chance to react to an effect or spell.\n\nI know I do not have alot of hours logged into this game, but that's because I play physical MtG. And this game does exactly that, it frustrates or inspires players enough to actually buy real booster packs and play the actual game. It's sad when you know that at the end of the day, that's the true aim and goal of this game's current incarnation. I just wish they had actually done some more material with actually more card options besides just Magic Origins. It's a good game to teach new players, but to keep tormenting yourself for enjoyment?

Otherwise, or if you're a veteran of the game at all, probably best to stay away and stick to the cardboard.\n\nPros:\n- Free.\n- Easy matchmaking (although buggy atm) to allow you to play a game whenever you want from home. Convenient.\n- Not heavily Pay to Win. Feels a lot like Limited with a new Cube.\n- It's Magic (...buut, read on.)\n\nCons:\n- Game loves to help you out, by skipping steps when it sees you can't play anything in your hand, and not skipping when you can. This telegraphs that you do or do not have something to the opponent.\n- Game loves to help you out, by assuming that the sometimes-critical upkeep step is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and skips it entirely unless there's something already on the board that has to be done.\n- Each step gets the same amount of "response time" regardless what's happening. Play a tapped land on turn one: Takes just as long to progress as when your opponent plays a boardwipe when you have a counter. Now you can pause whenever, but you have to be on your toes or you might miss it (A real-time reaction speed "skill" that should never be present in MTG). Amounts to anything from a boring nuisance that you can't go faster to a real kick in the nuts when you lose the game because you're not lightning fast with a mouse.\n- Lack of any priority whatsoever. You want priority? Click faster than your opponent.\n- Artificial card limit restrictions based on rarity that appear nowhere in any regular formats of the game.\n- No chat.\n- If an opponent concedes, you don't win yet. You have to waste your time playing against an AI. If you happen to then lose, both of you end up losing rank and nobody wins in-game currency.\n- Card pool consists of a static starter box and the non-overlapping origins set that you get through money/playing. Static start results in a lot of similar decks and some rigidity to customization.\n- 2HG sometimes puts your friends on the other team. Doesn't really matter though because unless you're connected with another program, you can't chat anyway as already mentioned.\n- No FFA or other multiplayer modes beyond 2HG.\n-  Rank system appears to be a linear win/loss counter. That's alright though because there's no way to view leaderboards anyway.\n- Bugs and connectivity issues. Hopefully these won't be a long-term thing.","August 2, 2015","false","48.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

You have to play with a premade deck vs decks that are only there to counter your every card. Best example is in the campaign of Nissa where you get a new treefolk card, only to have the enemy deck contain a card that specifically and exclusively kills treefolks.\n\nThe artistic design of the game is very lacking, you play every game on the same boring metal plate background. Everything except the cards is also just looking very boring.\n\nYou can build your own decks as you please, but the card pool is very tiny and aquiring new cards via gold feels more like doing chores.\n\nOne of the biggest issues though is the connectivity to the servers and to other players. Servers will randomly decide to be offline whilst you are winning - thus nullifying your victory. Also i will never understand why if a player concedes in a PvP versus battle he is then replaced by an ai - where if you lose, it will count as a loss and you will lose your rank and not get any money. Why should the game continue of my opponent gave up? I dont want to play against an AI if the other player just quits.\n\nAlso the game is expensive if you want to "pay to win".\n\nI can only see total beginners playing this game since it is free, but i fear they quickly will just become bored with it.","August 12, 2015","false","10.5"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

After awhile the bonus's of this free game started to fade.  Here's why I can't recommend the game.\n\n1. They have no chat system in place and as far as I can tell they don't plan to add one. Major downfall. Some times the games are slow and boring and at times you can't tell the difference between a person or the useless AI.\n\n2. They limit your decks. Once I built a deck of cards that cost 2 or less and it was a one color deck. The game wouldn't let me have less then 17 mana. Even though I had the 60 cards required. They have other restrictions as well.\n\n3. No reward for playing two headed giant. Why they discourage you to play with your friends is ridiculous. It also has no FFA. It's 1vs1 or Two headed giant with no reward for winning.\n\n4. The biggest reason of all, in 20 plus years they still havent fixed the issues of getting mana screwed plus or negative. It's an ancient flaw that they seem to ignore.\n\nIt's free so it doesn't hurt to try but I think it's a lost cause.

The story decks are utter garbage (especially for single colored decks) and the game pits you against perfectly constructed decks which can very quickly flay you apart when you are relying heavily on the next draw. The boss decks are sporadically difficult and non-difficult.

Like, really all aspects. Starting from small visual glitches (like 'unsynchronized' pictures shifting in lines) and menu inconveniences (like 'frozen' loadings until you click) and ending with things that actually hurt gameplay (below). I even thought it's 'Early Alpha Access' (this new Steam category which allows developers to sell Alpha versions to players x)) and went to check - no it's not. Just THAT many things are not done / done poorly, it looks like game was done in a rush.\nMenu is constantly throwing same promo dialogue windows welcoming you to visit the shop. When you visit shop and/or buy a booster you get same promo dialogue window about new set, EVERY single time. Every time you visit deckbuilder, you get another window. Every time you visit 'versus' menu you get a window that you should probably play campaign first (when obviously all campaigns are finished). Since some windows can redirect you to other menu sections when you click 'OK' (and you can only click 'OK', obviously), once I was literally 'lost in menus', since one menu window was constantly redirecting me to the page where other window was redirecting me back. I had to ALT+F4. Hilarious. But that was probably the only fun moment in here.\nDeckbuilder is realised as badly as one could possibly do. Cards are all stacked in two rows (top row - cards not in the deck, bottom - cards in the deck) with no possibility to even sort! You can only watch through those rows by dragging them with mouse. Filters are all grouped up in a single button on top of the screen, which opens fullscreen filter menu. And OF COURSE there is no search by name. Because WHO THE HELL IN THE WORLD WOULD BE SO STUPID TO SEARCH A DAMN CARD BY ITS NAME.\nIn game things. Camera can't be controlled by any means. It is locked to isometric from your POV. When the table is full of permanents camera moves further away on its own. Turn phases are skipped or not skipped unpredictably. Even with all settings set to 'full control' (that any MTG player should do: free targeting, asking about 'may' abilities, skipping), I can't say how many times I skipped attack phase just because game already skipped first main for me. There is a 'mana tapping' hotkey yet I couldn't get it working every time - in some cases game actually lets you choose mana, other times just "lets hope my grey land with tap ability doesn't tap for mana now". Choosing blocking order just doesn't work, since blockers are shown on top of one another, and you can only click the top one. Turns to "check out blocking order that game came up with, by clicking on every blocker (mandatory)" :D. Searching for cards in library have 2 buttons: 'finish' and 'confirm', guess which one is correct, otherwise you won't get your forest (happened few times :D). There is a 'closeup card' hotkey, but it only works on card under your cursor or the card that WAS under your cursor last. So when an opponent plays something you have never seen, you must stop timer before it resolves, catch that card (which is flying from middle of screen to his side) with your cursor, then press 'closeup'. Also, if you accidently clicked and slightly dragged a card in your hand, you're done. There is no possible way to cancel the cast if you are 'holding' that card with left mouse button, not a single other key (ALT+F4 maybe, didn't try that one :D)\nBattle 'animations' (that came untouched from Duels Of The Planeswalkers) still feel as stupid as they were. I don't even know if a single player uses this feature, it just sounds like a parody.\nCampaign 'storylines' look like pathetic stumps of actual MTG stories (which, by the way, lie in the range between 'intriguing' and 'extremely complicated') and are used to show us how Gideon, Jace, Liliana, Chandra and Nissa got their planeswalker sparks, plus 1 Zendikar campaign to unite 'em all. Each consist of 5 missions of playing boring precons against boring AI (first half are also filled with annoying tutorial things). At the end of each campaign, you are rewarded with short cinematics with HILARIOUSLY outdated graphics. Like, really from previous millenium, really. And then there is a huge sound mistake too - cinematics are made in very low volume, comparing to everything else, and after they end there is this annoying 'win' piece of music (the same you hear at the end of every single match). Straight after, no pause. So when you watch the video with amp and good speakers, at the end you will scare the sh*t out of your cat and all other humans in the house, 6/6 times, I guarantee you that.\nNon-campaign AI opponents have terrible decks with, seemingly, random cards and no deck ideas. For example, this colorless Eldrazi and allies are in every deck even where they are not fitting. Also maniacally overfilled with lands. So be ready - bots will have constant undeserved manafloods. Those duels with AI are not bringing you any MTG experience, at all; yet you will have to grind them for dailies at start when you have no cards, since you only have poor starter pack (with good dual lands 2 of each color combo, but 0 other rares) and ~7 boosters after you finish all campaigns and tutorials. That is, booster is only 6 card here (1 rare + 2 uncommons + 3 commons). At least basic lands are free and unlimited :D you can't choose art though.\nIn PVP duels if your opponent leaves the game, you did not win yet. AI will take his deck and keep fighting you! And probably win :D But you won't even know you are facing AI, since there is no message or anything. Well this is.. strange decision for CCG.\nNeedlessly saying, there is no card trading market. And shop is completely empty except for boosters.\nOh and there is Two-Headed Giant, but with no chat. Yes you can't talk to your ally, sorry about that. Since I never actually enjoyed 2HG in real MTG I didn't have courage to try it out here.\nThe good thing - foils don't drop randomly in boosters (at least I didn't see any :D) - instead, you can foil cards you have for small amount of gold, really cheap. There's no animated arts though (wink).\nAnd then, all those annoying and bad things are forgivable and I would probably play the game, if not for simplicity.\nSee, we have a basic set 'Magic Origins' and 'Battle For Zendikar', and I'm not even sure they are fully copied from actual sets. So from the whole ocean of MTG's diversity of mechanics, keywords and abilities we get just a couple to play with. Enjoy.\nClass: II - Crap\nVerdict: No\nReviewed: 13.12.2015\nApproach: Steam - PC\nTime: Several Dozen Hours\nDeeds:\nAll Campaigns\n35% Achievements","December 13, 2015","false","349.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","3"

They instead removed most efficient spells at common or uncommon, replacing them with complete duds. I'd like to slap the person who thought Siege Mastodon would be more interesting to include than War Oracle. Ugh.\n\nHad the game given, say, a single card for each victory, then grinding for cards would have been tolerable. Even playing only ranked matches (ignoring quests, which require you to use the incompetant deck wizard to vomit up something for you to try and use) will give you a pack of six cards for every 7.5 victories. Victories. With a 25% loss rate (still decent), that's ten games of Magic for every six cards, which may or may not be of use. Playing against the AI will take ten VICTORIES for a pack of six cards. Again, this grinding might be tollerable if there were anything worth pulling in these packs. There generally isn't.\n\nHad the game even worked as WotC intended, it might have been barely passable. Instead, it's as if Stainless is trying to emulate the stability of MODO servers. Not a good plan.\n\nThey even stripped the ability to chat with online opponents, making the distinction between playing against a person or a bot almost meaningless.\n\nIt saddens me that, while many of the mechanical aspects of the game itself are decent, and it is still FTP Magic, I can't recommend Magic Duels to anyone other than complete novices (who will find this a decent, if completely patronizing, introduction to the game) or people with far too much free time on their hands. The only reason I've kept with this is that I fall into the latter camp currently.\n\n\nTL;DR: While this certainly is one of the worst DOTP games in recent memory (even falling short of the 2015 installment due to a completely bland card pool), Magic Duels is still Magic. Magic at its worst is still a decent game, despite Stainless's valiant effort to prove to us otherwise.

It also felt dumb to me that I had to then click mindlessly through their "skill challenges" in order to get more free gold, since they were basically just more incredibly dumbed down tutorials. What ever happened to the real challenges in these games? You know, the ones that actually made you stop and think about what to do in order to win? These ones are a complete joke.\n\nAnd the story mode? Complete garbage in my opinion. They give you incredibly basic decks for each of the famous planeswalkers, which you are then supposed to use against the much more powerful AI decks. Seriously?! It's complete BS. This is not even a matter of skill here - the decks you play against are simply way more powerful than yours. I even noticed that a lot of the match ups are against cards with abilities that you have NO answer for in your deck. You basically have to restart until you have a perfect starting hand, then hope that the AI draws as poorly as possible so that you have an equal chance of winning. How is this balanced or fun at all? Also, the fact that you have no idea what cards were added in between missions is incredibly annoying. How am I supposed to know whether or not I even have an answer to something the AI uses against me until I have seen all the cards I have in my deck?\n\nBut what REALLY ended the joy for me, was when I was completely robbed of my booster packs that I spent 8 hours forcing myself through the story mode for. No kidding. I decided that maybe I would have more fun if I just simply built my own decks and played against the AI in solo mode for a while, so that I could get enough cards to eventually make a semi-competitive deck for online play. But to my dismay, immediately after spending all my hard-earned gold on booster packs, I was shocked to discover that I was never given ANY of them. That's right, all my booster packs were mysteriously gone right after I spent my gold on them. No new cards in my collection. Nothing. Restarting the game didn't miraculously bring my missing booster packs back either.\n\nThe fact that this happened after my initial experience with the game has turned me off from it forever. Do NOT waste your time with this free to play POS. It is literally just a waste of time. You're all better off playing MTGO or the paper version instead.","December 9, 2015","false","8.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Migelino64/recommended/316010/","Migelino64","Migelino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Migelino64/","148 products in account","I'd like to immediately point out that if you are looking for a way to learn the rules of Magic: The Gathering, and happened to spy this title in the free-to-play section and think to yourself, "A free way to play Magic that teaches me the rules and is intuitive? Yes please!", or if you're a veteran Magic player like myself and saw this thinking, "Oh boy, Wizard's released their new DotP game! I hope it's just like DotP201X and a far better improvement on DotP2015", then steer clear; you will be sorely disappointed at Wizard's newest "game" in the series.\n\nLet me highlight the good point first and give credit where credit is due.\nA deckbuilding system that is fairly lenient and pretty creative. Yes we had this in 2015 and it was one of the only good things from that game.\nA storyline that is somewhat fun and interesting to follow. Though the cinematics were a bit lackluster and can't hold a candle to Warcraft III cinematics from 2002, the lore following each planeswalker is a nice touch to add backstory. Then again you can look it all up on the internet, so that doesn't count for much.\nOrigins Cards and Planeswalkers. For God knows how long people have wanted planeswalkers in these games and we finally have them. Also a mixture of Origins and non-standard cards makes for some interesting decks, if you have the time to unlock them.\nEnjoy that little list of good stuff? Alright. Now let's bust some balls.\nBuggy interface and connectivity issues. This was inevitable. All DotP games have had some form of interface problem or online connectivity issue. Most usually get patched out fairly quickly. But needing to consistently reconnect to save coin progress? Enchanted creatures not displaying correctly after zooming? Spells and abilities mistargeting? Players disconnecting mid-game or having games hang? You'd be better playing MTGO.\nDeck construction limitation. This garbage again. 4 commons, 3 uncommons, 2 rares, 1 mythic. An attempt at balancing deck construction, but ultimately restricting our creativity with decks. I'd much rather have DotP2014's system of unlocking cards for specific decks, and have other decks as DLC packs.\nArchetype Quests. Apparently decks don't identify as a two-colour deck unless you use their deck building "Wizard". In short, you pick a card out of 5 shown to you. It then uses the cards you've picked to suggest other cards, place them in front of you, and you pick one. Not only does it feel like you're building decks in Hearthstone, these decks are horrendously underpowered in comparison to what a person with basic deckbuilding skill can create in the full deck builder. ~But you can't earn coins from quests unless you use the deck wizard~\nCoins and Boosters. DotP2014 had you pay to play Sealed, but that was fairly cheap and you got 6x 15 card packs. DotP2015 Had you unlock cards through campaigns on specific planes, but they were 15 card packs, and there was an option of some premium cards. What does this give you? 6 cards per pack, at $2 per pack Yep, if you don't want to play God knows how many games to save up 150 coins to buy 1x 6 card pack, you can pay $2 to get 150 coins to buy that pack. So it now becomes 3x slower than normal just to unlock the commons for my deck. And if I'm building a particular colour and the pack has nothing good for that colour? Oh well! Try playing more duels and saving more coins for another pack! Or buy coins to get the cards faster!\nThis game is a disaster. There are just so many issues with it; so many things that should not be. Had they just made a $15 game like in the past with pre-built decks and unlockable card pools for them, maybe everything would've been fine. DotP is supposed to be a fun way to introduce players to the game with interesting decks, and chaotic matches combined with unique game modes like Archenemy and Planechase. This is just a money grab, and a poor attempt at it. You shouldn't be paying for a collection of cards like this unless they're physical or on MTGO. If you're looking for a DotP game that is serious fun, I would lean towards DotP2012, 2013, or 2014. This doesn't deserve our time or attention.","August 1, 2015","false","11.4"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

Finishing the last quest for the introductory Planeswalkers' Story mode awards you currency and 3 Boosters. Battle mode allows you to play against randomized AI with 3 difficulty settings, where you get currency according to AI difficulty. There's a quest system in place which you can win currency with, along with a weekly community quest.\n\nOverall, it's a solid Magic the Gathering game, and in my eyes, for the hardcore MtG fans, the better alternative to Hearthstone.","August 1, 2015","true","8.1"," 66 of 125 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","66","125","6","1"

But now since all these sets are coming faster than I have time on my hand I cannot recommend this game. If you notice, I have a good amount of hours on this game and I have Origins,BFZ, and maybe 1/3 Of Gatewatch and SoI unlocked. I Was lvl 50 in origins and BfZ 1v1 rank and had 3000 coins which only unlocked me maybe 40% of SoI. This game really makes you feel overwhelmed and bogged down with money and lack of content. You could buy the packs if you wanted, but what would be the point of buying cards that will be flushed out and have no value unlike MTG:O. I'd recommend this game to players who are new to Magic, but they too may see the Grind too overbearing and the amount of cards that aren't synergistic to be confusing. I think I'd rather them have all cards unlocked from each set rather than 60-70% of the set of all cards of the past 3 sets. This isn't the only game I play and its hard to keep up with the cards since I use this as a casual sit back version of magic for me. The restraint on the game is just too High to maintain fun. 6 card booster packs for $1.99 when you can only unlock 1 mythical, 2 rares, 3 uncommons and 4 commons is just too restrictive. Though I wouldn't mind it if there were more Synergy amongst cards. But now there are 4 sets in the game at this update and you'd have to unlock 60-70% of one set to make a decent deck. I cannot unfortunately recommend this game.

I played this game for free and I still feel ripped off.\n\nIf you want to play a card game online for free, there are tons of free Yu-Gi-Oh card games online. But I hear already,\n'This is Magic, not Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu-Gi-Oh sucks, Magic is better blah blahgblahbshas'\nThat doesn't matter, what matters is that any of those free games have Thousands of cards to choose from, and this pitiful piece of trash has cards from two sets. Those other games also give you all the cards, so you can just play. I hear more complaints,\n'But I want to get the cards, I don't want them handed to me at the begining, that way is for cheaters.'\nYeah, but at least it starts you with something! The starting cards in this game are a joke, and you cannot build a half decent deck out of them. Whatever you do build, will be on par or worse than the easy level ai, and with how you get cards (with coins, 6 or 8 at a time) and how you get coins (by winning, 10 at a time) you have to grind the easy bot before you can get the cards that synergize with each other enough to go onto the medium bot, so you can grind faster.\n\nThis wouldn't be too bad, maybe if the game wasn't so clunky and slow. Activating instants during the blocking phase is a chore, and during the damage step, physically impossible. Enevitabilities that you could just get over with quickly take what feel like eons when you have no cards to play and have to wait 20 seconds each turn to play a land and do nothing, while the opponent has a creature and is swinging at you for 2 until you die.\nTrying to retaliate with instants that require timing is next to impossible, and the way the game sometimes auto taps lands can really screw over a plan, especially when the system to choose which lands to tap (in the rare times it does that) has no explination on how it works and results in pressing every button on the keyboard until it taps the lands that don't screw you over. The quests can give you an extra couple of coins, but its still a tedious grind to open random cards that may or may not help make a deck that synergizes better than "this creature gets +1/+1 if you have an island."\n\nNo good cards to use at the start.\nBoring grind to get cards that don't suck like a lung.\nClunky and slow gameplay with various greivences.\n\nDon't touch this game.\n\nEdit: I forgot how awful the sound is in this game, but I have to mute my computer every time I play and when I went to go play something else it reminded me why after I unmuted it, everyone was still talking pretty quitely.\nAnd why is it that when the enemy quits, AI takes over for them! I play one game against a real person, and they leave so the AI can summon a 6/6 five drop and a planeswalker after practically boardwiping me.\nWhich makes me wonder about the matchmaking, since every single one of their cards wass foiled, they had a lot of cards I hadn't seen, and a freaking plainswalker, and I have jack crap in my entire collection. Bad matchmaking! What can they mess up next?!?!","February 19","false","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's nice to see the Duels franchise come to a natural evolution of being a platform rather than a yearly iteration, it's free, but that's kind of where the good things about it end. It is very clearly designed not to compete with Wizards own MTGO with things like number of card limitations, the fact that it won't in fact add whole future sets, and to insure the grind gives 6 card boosters rather than the 15 that anyone who has ever played MTG would expect.  It still has server errors which seem to bar you from making progress, it takes me an average of three attempts to connect to the servers every time I start the game.","August 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I play the game constantly and this isnt a bad way for an unexperienced player to start out, the tutorial is excellent and covers all of the basics.\n\nBut now for the bad...\n\nThe grind the grind the grind.  Seriously outside of "Story Mode" (which is pretty cool) there is no viable option to get cards. Its great that the "base" game is free-to-play, but honestly myself, and I think most others, would have preferred to drop the standard $10 to get a reasonable card base.  I actually did drop $10 to get some coins, enough to get me 8 packs.  Considering that there are only 6 cards per pack my $10 got me a whopping 48 cards!  Hows that for value?\n\nListen, its great that they added Planeswalkers, its great that "most" of Origins is available to unlock, but at this rate I'll never see them.  How about giving us the commons and make us grind for the rest?  How about add some cards from the thousands of others in the standard block?  It just seems like this game could be so much more, but for the 2nd year in a row it seems to have fallen on its face.\n\nHopefully the devs will read some of these reviews and make some valuable changes to the game, if so I may update my review, but as it stands I cant recommend this game outside of the story.","August 5, 2015","false","27.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I will hopefully change this to a positive review once the devs get their collective heads out of the singular ♥♥♥ it is shoved into at this time.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say at this time is that it is a bare bones MTG game which allows for new players to understand the most basic premise of the game.

The actual cardset that you can use is frustrating especially with the cost of the booster for 6 cards. The game seems to lul you in with a false sense of fun and then quickly smashes you over the head until you fork out money to get enough cards to build a functional deck that isnt a load of derp. The daily quest system is nice but the requirements are ironic as some of them ask you to win 4 games with 2 colour archetypes but ALL, yes all, of the AI decks are tri colour pains in the backside. Overall, its as bad as it can be and nowhere near as fun as it should be.","October 6, 2015","false","8.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It's only one set of cards, so they make the currency grind way slower than it needs to be. In the F2P market you need to keep my attention and not giving out SOME currency for EVERY game type and giving out SOME reward for a loss is just wasting the player's time.\n- There needs to be more options to speed up the animations and combat.

Your starting cards in the Scenerio games include a black deck that is all 1 or 2 attack creatures that have no real abilities. add to that instant and sorceries which have a high cost when you include the fact almost all want you to sacrifice one of your creatures. All your decks they give you have the worst of all the creatures available. I played blue, white and black scenerio's and only the blue had any creature above 3 power and they could be killed by being the target of spells and abilities.  I didnt just play 2 or 3 games and decide it was a waste of tiem even for a free game. I gave it a chance and it is horrible. Seriously, there are much better games to play out there.

After a short spell of being servers down, I must say I was most impressed with whole thing.\nThe first of all, we have a real freedom in deck-building. Anyone can manage your own deck using cards from pool that he/she already own. All cards are free to players, but, at first, you should collect them.\n\nThe way to expand your own collection is to by boosters which include three common, two uncommon and one rare or mythic rare card. There are six cards in each booster, and you never become overloaded with any card. The cap for commons is four cards, for uncommon - three, rare - two, mythic rare - only one. So, when you reach a maximum level for any specific card, you will never receive it again. Hence, sooner or later you collect whole set. Card booster you can buy with in-game currency, which you can receive just for playing the game or buy with real money. To buy at least one booster per day is not hard task.\n\nGame have comprehensive tutorial and it would be easy to lean all basis for everyone. AI is sufficient to make a challenge, moreover, it is hard to run into the same deck when you playing against AI, because they are randomly customized at the beginning of each battle.\n\nHowever, game have several cons. The first, the graphic in videos is really obsolete. I think, developers should have made a slideshow rather ugly video. The second, and the most essential problem is deficiency in communication with other players. There is no opportunity to send any message to other players or to invite them to be fiends. Lack of feedback is unpleasant, because chatting with an opponent is an important part of fun which we want to receive from board games.\nOverall, this game deserve a high marks, and I believe it would be improved soon.\n7/10","September 8, 2015","true","326.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

My review is still a non-recommend for this game. I just played the story mode for a few hours... Please save yourself the pain. The enemy has finished decks and you have unfinished non-counters to their deck styles... yet you can not pick your own deck. So they force you to be gimped while their npc is O.P. The second level of the story mode is more about getting absolutely lucky with your draws while the enemy get highly unlucky... so get ready to start your matches by chosing a new hand and when it penalizes you by not giving you 7 cards accept the hand and restart duel. I had a blue deck that was focused on making the enemy discard cards... but the deck seems to have at most 6 cards that have anything to do with discarding cards... I really do not feel like rambling and fully explaining. All i can say is the game just for me was not fun at all. I love magic and have played it for many years. This will not be something I play. It just seems like the devs are either way off base with the customers or they are way too elitest in the set up of the game. either way when it comes to me and probably a majority of the demographic I come from I can play magic in real life and from many other games forms.\n\nBTW your game does not play full screen windowed so i enjoy greatly not being able to play this absolute headache of a game fullscreen with part of the bottom of the picture cut off when using 1920x1080.\n\nI will review what I experienced. I was excited about the change to play a Magic: The Gathering game... I added the game to my library, Loaded it up, and got a beatiful view of the games Magic symbol. The screen then went black for about 20 seconds. With a woosh I was brought back into the light from the black screen to my normal desktop. In a confusion I looked around the screen trying to figure out what had happened... "Oh wait what is that?" I wondered. The game is opened and shows its symbol at my botton screen taskbar. I click it thinking it will open the game. "Oh wow the screen went black... the game is opening! WooHoo!" I said with happiness. To my surprise about 20 seconds later yet again the black screen goes away and brings me back to my normal desktop. This journey of Deja Vu was done multiple times and attempted over longer than needed periods of time. The happiness faded and now all I have to say is I do not recommend this game. It does not even look like anyone really replies to forum posts about this game breaking issue. I do not like it when a company does not reply especially on issues such as this. Sooo I do not recommend this game and if the way the company is handleing this issue shows anything I do not recommend this company. Sorry, but not sorry. Maybe if you fix your game in a timely manner I will be happy to play it and change my review to a review about the actual game and not your unplayable game.","August 18, 2015","false","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While Duels certainly looks cleaner than MTGO and isn't full of rude people, the support it seems to be getting from its publisher is pretty pathetic. Constant delays, incomplete sets, poor communication from the developers, no apparent mechanism to lodge bug reports or file comlaints... given that this barely feels like more than a reskin of the previous annual computer releases, the overal product is quite dissapointing. It's easy enough to play and they've increased payouts significantly lately, presumably to retain what players haven't been scared off yet, but given the competition games like Hearthstone provide these days, the most venerable CCG could--and should--have done way better.","March 12","false","253.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My first impression of the game was that it looked great, very catchy to the eye, so I decided to give it a try. I am not a Magic the Gathering player, so the tutorial was really detailed and fun in my opinion. I got hooked... I played it for a while, grinded a little for coins, got some nice cards eventually, and made a decent white-green elf deck. Sounds great right? Well it was for some time, but eventually some serious flaws with game became obvious to me.\n\nFirst of all, grinding for coins kills a lot of the potential this game could have. Each victory against another player only rewards you 20 coins from the 150 required to buy just 1 booster pack, and each booster pack only gives you six cards (mostly common or boring rare cards unless you are very lucky). When you star playing the game, you get gold from tutorial quests and story mode. There are 5 campaigns on story mode with 5 missions each, and if you complete one the game rewards you with 150 gold (a booster). This is good and all, but you can complete all of this in a single all nighter. Which brings me to the last way in which players can earn gold in-game: Daily and weekly quests which can give you 20-40 coins depending on their difficulty and your luck.\n\nYes, you can buy coins and not grind  at all, but I am adamant against  it at the momment,I don't know if want to be playing this in the future yet.  Months from now I might completely forget about it, so why spend money on a game that was just released and I am not so convinced about its play value yet? So I played and tested it out a little to see if it is worthy of the time and money I usually spend on games that I really love to play. My conclusion on this matter was: No, or perhaps not yet. Stainless games and wizard of the coast need to improve 3 fatal flaws in order for me to recommend this game:\n\n1) Most quests I mentioned before can only be completed with decks created through the deck wizard feature. For those of you who do not know anything about this game yet, you can create your decks in two manners: Full Deck Builder, a beautifully crafted feature that allows you to freely configure your deck while you can sort and filter your card collection, and Deck Wizard, a godamn-awful-restricting feature that I can't ever imagine wanting to use it! So why make it so that you require to use this feature in order to complete the archetype decks quests? I cannot complete quests with my carefully crafted green and white deck, I have to use the green and white deck recommended by the awful deck wizard feature. This wouldn't be so horrible if there werent so many archetype quests, but I got three of them in a row (and remember you only get 1 daily). You can still complete these quests if you play against the easy AI, but it is just awful to create a deck to use twice for a quest and disregarding it afterwards.\n\n2) The game needs to be more rewarding and varied, it is awful to have to win 8 battles (sometimes against people who have paid real money to buy cards which is okay but admitedly harder) to buy a single pack which will likely have cards that you won't use (either because you don't like them or they simply don't synergize with the cards you already have). Yeah, the quests help, but after you complete all campaigns and tutorials it all feels so slow... Two Headed Dragon, an awesome game mode which let players go on 2 vs 2 matches doesn't give you anything when you win... It is the only alternate game mode and it is not rewarding to play it, fun at times, but doesn't help me improve my collection at all.\n\n3) The bugs and glitches... I know that it is new a game and that they already admitted on their twitter page that they are still working on these, but the game gets stuck from time to time. Yes, this third point is understandable in my opinion, they didn't have a beta testing as far as I know, but it is an issue. I had games as good as won when for some reason it doesn't let me play my cards and gets stuck, this glitch happened twice and has made me concede games when I am winning (The other opponent had 2 of health and no monsters at the beginning of my turn ugh). Also, game sometimes gets stuck on the loading screen, I had to restart my laptop once, As I said, it is a new game so I try to be patient; nonetheless, it is still a flaw that needs to be pointed out  until it is solved.\n\nAs it is, this game is just a tutorial for new players and a clever commercial for the physical and the online complete version of this trading card game. Not rewarding enough and slow paced at times. It feels like the more you play it, the less enjoyable it is. They need to do something drastical if they mean to flip that curve.","August 10, 2015","false","109.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It apparently hates people who like to bluff or change their minds, considering the moment you pick up a creature or untargeted spell, you can't put it back in your hand; it'll be played once you let go no matter where the cursor is and you can't go back on it.\n\nThe servers?

Playing against a bot, pays so little you're beter off selling your sperm to buy gold with cash.\n-No reward for playing against friends or with friends against bots... you know, the most fun thing to do in magic? Playing with friend, testing out decks, playing together.\n-A huge grind since boosters are expansive and only give 6 cards. in my experience, of the 4 boosters i bought, i got 4 cards of the same type. So 1 of the 6 cards, were always the same card i will never use.\n-You can do quests to gain a little gold... but most of them are the ''Win 4 match with a B/G or G/W deck'' So if you don't like G/W  or B/G decks.... ♥♥♥♥ you!\n-HUGE server instability\n-No sorting options for yur hand.\n-Deck editor interface is awfull.\n-Cards lack variety and most tactics are pre planned.\n-Wait till you see the cinematics! Will make Diablo 2 look like Crysis!\n\nPros\n\n-Excellent tutorial for new players. Voiced and detailed\n-Simple controls\n-Full deck building ( Finally... )\n-2 Headed Giants is back!\n-It's magic... so it's still fun i guess.\n\nWhat it needs\n-CHAT!!!!!!\n-More cards ( duhh )\n-Archenemy\n-Multi man FFA\n-Some sort of gambling minigames or anything that would make gold a more maniable resource.\n-Minimal gold for friends on friends matches. Seriously, even 5 would be acceptable. An easy bot gives 5, it's hard to lose to an easy bot. And even if people farm and abuse, you ask 150 gold for 6 cards, which has duplicates you already have. It would still be a boring grind and would at least make it worth for people like me, who hate playing Magic online.\n\nFinal Verdict\n-Wait a couple of months... this could be a fun game... if they listen to the comunity, and add wanted features.","August 5, 2015","false","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The textures worked fine throughout the tutorial stages but as soon as I got to a level where there was not one, background under the cards became gridded and grey and would flicker every time the mouse would move. I adjusted the graphics as much as the game would allow, which was much. It has an option to turn graphics from low to high and change resolution, but there were no ther graphics options.

Rewards works... well sometimes but not completely and there is a limit but you can't know when. I do not know what was the goal of that game but I'm pretty sure it hasn't been achieved yet...\n\nPros:\n- Magic the Gathering in Free-to-Play form. (No pay-to-win but patience is required)\n- Smooth game flow, animations, and sound effects.

(even truer when doing a double-headed giant)\n\nI don't recommend it yet unless you're okay with ALOT of swearing (note: there is no in-game chatting function so it will come from your own end).\n\nWaiting for it to be fixed...","August 20, 2015","false","77.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As it is now, DotP 2014 is a better game, and I would recommend you play that instead of this. I hope that the devs will put in the work needed to make this game live up to its potential.\n\nEDIT: 1 month later, still cannot recommend.  The list of significant bugs is massive, and to date there's only been one patch that addressed a small list of things.  To give you an example of a major bug present from day 1 with no timeline for a fix: One "day" is 2-3 days - you'll get a "daily" quest every 2-3 days, and have your "daily" limit on earning gold (400g) reset every 2-3 days.  6 cards cost 150g, a win gives 20g, and there are 480 cards... this makes earning cards agonizingly slow.\n\n*** The Good ***\n- Free to play: In game currency is earned at a fair pace, and, unlike Hearthstone, you will unlock all cards in a set number of booster packs (once you have the maximum number of a given card in your collection, that card will no longer appear in your packs).\n\n- Noob friendly: The tutorials are simple, modular, and reward large amounts of gold. They do a good job of teaching the basic rules of the game. The overall power level of cards is low by MTG standards, and there are strict limits on how many powerful cards can go in a deck, which puts people with small collections on a somewhat even footing vs people with large collections.\n\n-Persistant client: This game will continue to grow in terms of features and card sets. While you'd think this is standard for a video game, it is certainly a new and welcome concept for the DotP series.\n\n-It's MTG: The artwork is beautiful and the cards are well designed. MTG is the king of card games for a reason.\n\n-Interface: Although I still question a lot of the design choices (why is the perspective not top-down so that we can easily read the cards? Why are the enemy's cards upside down from my perspective? Why is there no history bar like in Hearthstone so I can review a confusing play the opponent made? Why do the in game decision pop ups completely obscure the playing field, which you need to see in order to make an informed choice?) the interface is undeniably cleaner and snappier than DotP 2014s. The auto targetting system is also quite good, almost always recommending the correct play\n\n*** The Bad ***\n\n-No chat: In what little promotion that they did do for this game, Wizards focussed on the fact that they brought back the much loved 2v2 mode, 2HG. What they didn't tell you is that there is no chat in this game whatsoever, making playing with other people lose all of its social value. Worse, it's super frustrating to be playing with a teammate in what boils down to a strategy/puzzle game, but not be able to coordinate strategy or puzzle solutions with that person. Fire the person who made this design decision - it wrecks the game in the short term, and without a community, your game will not last in the long term.\n\n-Atrocious launch: No communication from devs about release date, server instability repeatedly causing progress to be lost, frequent periods of extended, unexpected downtime. The number of bugs I've discovered is what I'd expect from a game's beta, not the full release. For example, the cutscenes are silent - no music, voice acting, or SFX - which is awkward and embarassing. If I paid money for this I'd be furious.\n\n-Stupidity: Offline progress in campaign and tutorials cannot be saved - you can't farm these for gold, so why require server connection? No cross platform support - if I want to play on my iPad, I need to start a new collection from scratch for iOS. No game lobbies means that you can't play against your friends in 2v2 mode. 2v2 mode does not award gold. 2v2 mode, the best part of the previous games, is not fun without chat. The 1v1 ranked queue often fails, requiring you to press buttons to requeue - I should be automatically requeued if matchmaking fails. It often takes FOREVER to get a 1v1 match because your first 10 matches fail to load.\n\n- AI: The AI makes really really really bad mistakes. I suspect that it is worse than the previous DotP games. For example. it often attacks with all of its creatures, even if it cannot win and will lose next turn by doing so. It feels as though I only lose to the AI because I had a bad draw or because its deck is made from stronger cards than I have access to.\n\n-Campaign: Overall, I enjoyed the campaign. Unfortunately, you can't create or edit a deck for the missions, so whether you win or lose is very much luck of the draw - this is frustrating and unfun. I get that they wanted to give you a feeling of starting from a weakling and becoming all powerful, but the hilariously bad cards in the early decks just get in the way of the fun. I think that next time we should be able to craft our own decks from a restricted pool for each mission.\n\n-Long wishlist: Once the devs fix their servers, fix the bugs, and fix the stupidity outlined above, they need to add chat and lobbies back. Then we need some kind of sealed format (every f2p card game has sealed) and tournament support. Then I would like to see fun modes like Commander, Archenemy, Emperor, and Planechase.","August 5, 2015","false","186.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not convinced? Continue reading.\nAs a player of Magic 2014: Duel of Planeswalkers I was interested in any sequel or DLC's to game. When I saw this game on Steam I though "That is what I was looking for. And it is for free..." Well, now I know why.\nFirst of all, game is unplayable due to bugs. A lot of bugs. If you remember The Witcher 3 or 2 version 1.0.0.0 - this game is even worse. You can get error/crash/disconnect at any momment of the game despite is far away from v.1.0 and gameplay variety that can Witcher provide. The most annoying thing is when you are about to win and game lost connection or got desyncronized. Sometimes (each time) it feels like developers have written some code to not let you win (and get coins) if you haven't donated real money to the game.\nSecond problem is game syncronization. How bad the code should be that in such a step-by-step game (not real time shooter or whatever) I expirience hight latency and often desyncronization? When you press on any card to play it - it takes about 0.5-2 seconds to actual cast animation. That is very much affecting gameplay, especially when your deck is full of instants or flash creatures.\nThird one is social part of the game. There IS NO CHAT! How should I communicate and cooperate with my partners in Two-Headed Gian game? Also there is no room-browser (or server browser as you wish) when I can pick host to join to. It is searching automatically and always throws errors: "User left the game", "Unable to join", "Session might be full or unavailable" an so on. Even if you are lucky enough and you found some nice people to play with, added them to your friend list and now able to cooperate... Heh, not so fast. Turned out that create game and invite friend is also a challange in that game. Only after couple or game restarts you can successfully play with friend.\nSo, are you convinced now? No?

The tell short stories about the popular planeswalkers gradually evolving their decks. While this is a step back from previous duels games it's still nice to play. The short tutorial turns are a nice way of introducing basic mechanics to new players. Overall the gameplay hasn't changed much since the previous installement and is pretty well polished. It's fast and smooth once you get used to some gimmicks. The introduction of unlimited deckbuilding brings us closer to magic proper although the card pool feels rather small, but that will change with time.\n\nSo why the negative review? Well:\n* The interface is basically designed for tablets. The player has to scroll through rows of cards, icons, etc with 'swiping' moves to do anything. It's tedious and irritating and does not suit mouse controls.\n* The multiplayer is kinda meh, no interactions (ways to congratulate or taunt your oponent) makes the experience dull. To top it off there seems to be no penalty for idling which is often exploited by oponents. Also when an oponent ragequits the AI steps in and you still have to finish the game.\n* Some campaign missions basically require you to restart until you get a decent hand because they're practically unbeatable otherwise. Not a big pain, but still looks like a balancing issue.\n* But the worst offender is the deckbuilder. No way to search your freaking library in any meaningfull way! What the hell? It's so frustrating to build a deck when all you get are color and cost filters. If you want to find anything you have to scroll through rows of cards with 'swiping' moves. There's also no way to see your whole deck at once which is ♥♥♥♥ if youre trying to build anything with some sort of synergy. It looks like no thought was put into designing any of it which is inexcusable in a pc game, and frankly a game where deckbuilding is the most fun. 0/10\n\nTo sum it up, the game shows potential but until someone steps in and fixins the UI and multiplayer issues you're better off playing hearthstone.","August 6, 2015","false","8.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've looked forward to what the developer could do with the next iteration.\n\nWell, this developer has done a poor job. As others have mentioned the series has regressed, losing features. The series is obviously mimicking Hearthstone but doing a bad job of it.\n\nMy main gripes:\n\n15g per win (20g vs online opponent) and 150g to buy a booster pack of only 6 cards. No discount for buying packs in bulk. Plus a weak card pool (not just the rares, but even more importantly the commons and uncommons) for every archetype (aggro, midrange, control, ramp, combo). This means a long and rather uninteresting grind.\n\nA frustrating beginner experience because of the above. Its not much fun to use a very limited, weak, and uninteresting pool of cards against more interesting decks played by the AI.\n\nThe AI has not improved in this series for over four years. It doesn't seem to have been worked on.\n\nRemoved different gameplay modes and challenges from the campaign.\n\nCan't get gold from 2 headed giant games? So you put in a feature and penalize players who enjoy that feature. Again, these players already have to slowly grind for gold. How does that make sense?\n\nCan't save account/game data across platforms. Their excuse for this was lame. Hearthstone can do it and its been out for a while. Who cares if its out on iPhone, iPad, Steam, and console if you have to create an account for each one? Discourages players from long term play and investing $$ in the game for gold and packs. This is a major, major flaw.\n\nCan play a 30-40 minute game against an online opponent, right before winning the opp quits/disconnects and you lose connection to the game and will not gain any gold for the win. This just happened to me. The payout is bad enough without this disconnects.\n\nSolutions:\n\nIncrease the amount of gold per win to 25g.\n\nQuests should give at least 75g each. These massive worldwide coop quests should be even more. A worldwide quest today has a 40g reward. Not even 1/3 of a pack.\n\nIncrease booster packs to AT LEAST 8 cards  per pack, but preferably 9-10.\n\nDo whatever coding you have to do to make it cross platform compatible.\n\nHire a new developer.\n\nGive free packs to all customers for all the grief with the servers and all these letdowns. This costs you no money but makes the customer base feel listened to and happy. Happy and loyal customers is a good thing.","August 6, 2015","false","249.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I play casual Magic in real life very often, I am familiar with all the rules to a high degree and have played approximately 1000 online matches of the Duels of The Planeswalker games in years past.\n\nAlthough it had some weird drawbacks--namely not being able to remove any unlocked cards from your deck--the first iteration of this game was awesome.  It got me back into the game: here was something that was easy to play, had a good mix of different card and deck types, and was just a really streamlined, accessible way to play casual M:tG games without having to get a group together and worry about deck balance.\n\nThe next two (or three, I forget how many now) were similarly excellent.  Rudimentary deck editing allowed seasoned players much greater control over how they played, and was a much more managable way for new players to learn the ins and outs of what makes or breaks a deck.\n\nMagic 2015 and this new Duels have just taken huge strides backwards.  Forcing players to build their own decks without actually providing any information on why and how the old archetypes were constructed makes the gap between pros and newbs that much wider, and makes for a much more narrow metagame than previous years.  Add in the lack of extra modes, the inability to skip a patronizingly hand-holding tutorial for advanced players, and a cap on how much you can progress in the game ON YOUR OWN TIME to further encourage spending extra money on the game, and in my opinion you have the worst game Stainless has put out yet.\n\nObviously I haven't played it very much, and I may go back and slog through the intros to sink my teeth in a little deeper, but this game is exactly what no one was asking for.\n\n"The ones who just don't get it are the ones who scream the loudest."  I've heard WotC say players have been clamoring for open-ended deck editing for years, so that's why these last two have looked like the did, but look what happened:  the worst sales and reviews of the series for two years straight.\n\nWotC, Chris, whoever reads this, take note:  GIVE US BACK DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS.  Your company already offers platforms that meet the needs of people who want open-ended deck editing and microtransactions, what about those of us who, for three years in a row, happily paid $20US for a main game and also several expansions that allowed casual players a fair and streamlined platform for playing M:tG?\n\nTL;DR - It's free so you might as well get it, and there's certainly fun to be had, but by comparison DotP:2014 is the cream of the crop, offering 21 different 100 card decks, 2HG and several other modes, and, if you buy it on Steam, unlimited modification options.","August 6, 2015","false","18.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I played a good deal of the game casually, for about 11 hours, but could only make it about 2/5ths ot the way through liliana's campain before i gave up.  After that, I tryed 1v1 PvE.  out of the 25 games or so that I played, I only won 1.  I tryed making a better deck, but that one, which acording to the game, it was better than the first one I made; played about the same number of games and didn't win once.  Now, you may be wondering how was i able to finish about 50 games in about 8 hours, seeing as the average game of magic in real life takes about 1 hour. I'll tell you how because it only took the computer 10-15 minutes to beat me, a magic player that has played this game for nearly TEN years now. first of all, i must congragulate Stainless games for making the world champion, magic-playing, dream-crushing AI that is this game's EASY MODE! They call it easy mode because its supossed to be easy not ball-crushinglly hard. Hell this reminds me a lot of ALL my legendary playthroughs of Halo because this game has made me press the restart button more times than i can count. This game is so hard, i dont even think my deck, my Magnum Opus of a magic deck, the deck that I have been shaping since 2006, could win a match in easy mode!

I really love this game.\nBut there are huge problems: The AI loves to cheat and the deck building assistant is somehow useless.\nFor myself I still recommend it to me, because I love ist. For others I wouldn't recommend it because of a high frustration level after some time.\n\nI'll start with the big problems in my eyes and attach the pros at the end.\n\n1) The AI:\nI built a deck destruction deck mere to check which cards the different difficulty level uses. Mostly the easy ones and they're the biggest cheater. Normaly they use 3-5R and maximum 1M, nearly half of the hard AI. But the last duel showed me again that they're even worse.\nMy last duel in short: 23 cards played: The AI got red, green + black Planeswalker,  Erebo's Titan,  Gae's Revenge, 2 Gilt-Leaf Winnower and Evolutionary Leap! ( 4M + 4R )\nMore R and M than a hard AI in less turns. As if that is not enough: the AI also gets the perfect destruction and takeover skills just in time.\n\nYou want to finish your dailys with easy AI? Bad Idea. Use medium AI instead, they tend less to cheating.\n\n2) Deck building assistant:\nWell, it's good for beginners. It's a good variety of play types.\nBut if you in possession of nearly all cards the final deck is getting worse. Why? The game tends to give you a selection of your best cards you have, but not the best for this type of Deck. At the end your deck contains strong creatures and spells, but they're expensive. Also good cards for combinations you can't use because the 2nd or 3rd part of the combination is missing.\nThe product makes it harder to win against the AI and finish your dailys. Even with a restart (bad hands guaranteed!)\n\nBut like every game there are a lot of good things.\n- good graphics and the paintings of the cards are always good!\n- the devs promised: time to time new cards\n- insights of the story of the planeswalker\n- a good reward system (not to much or less coins)\n- smooth animations\n- well-balanced variety of cards in the beginning\n\n\nI hope the devs will use the huge potential of this game and rebalance the AI controlled features so it wil be MORE Awesome.\nBut to recommend it to others who may be new to this kind of game it's not enough. it'll definetly scare some people off. There are also small issues I didn't mention because I know the devs will fix them.","September 25, 2015","false","52.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The tutorial is a good way to learn the rules if you're rusty or new, and long time players will appreciate some fan-favorite planeswalkers as your campaign heroes.  The interface is relatively intuitive in games, there's little need to micro your lands or other inane things like that. Smart-targeting is pretty spot on.\n\nBut the bad is so much worse.\n\nFirst, because of the single-expansion run, combinations and deck builds are prohibitively railroad tracked.  "Oh, that player is using a forest and swamp. GUESS IT'S AN ELF DECK."  Many of the colors are only partially-flavored.  White doesn't really have a good angel deck option, Blue sky-dragon decks are possible, but pitifully weaker than just going for grindstone, Red burn decks will be waffling for an effective combination of spells unless you've completely maxed out your collection, so you'll probably go with an artifact heavy combination deck, and so forth.  So while there is enough that you can sample what each color usually offers, generally speaking it is only that: a sample, not intended for using in solo or pvp play.  As a deck builder who loves to design decks based on "roleplay", this is a serious strike against the game.\n\nSpeaking of deck building, the helper tool is atrocious. And yet you MUST use it to get credit for the daily quests (or, perhaps that's bad luck on my part, but getting to that later).  Usually the deck builder establishes "core" and "synergy" categories, which are of course, the smallest categories.  The general category, making up the other 50% of your cards, is totally random from your collection of the matching colors, and you cannot cycle the options it gives you.  Shoehorned into an elf deck with a bunch of creatures with a mana cost <6? Tough nuts on you, deal with it.  Playing an artifact deck where you're only using six artifacts? Sorry you can't pick more, but you only have four cards to choose from at a time!  In the attempt to make it more accessible, the deck wizard is arguably BAD for you, teaching bad habits and making decks unnecessarily frustrating.\n\nDeck shuffling is just broken. Truly and honestly.  Most decks will need to run 24-28 lands to beat the RNG, which is absolutely ridiculous. Lifespring-Wyrm decks never needed that much. But if you don't, you WILL stall with dry spells. In an elf deck with 25 lands, I once got through 30 cards with only 4 lands drawn. That is the extreme example, but these kinds of games are the rule, not the exception as you'd find on tabletops. You are just as likely to encounter the opposite problem as well, dropping 15 lands but only drawing 4 spells while your opponent steamrolls your couple creatures and you sit on a useless sorcery. Again, these matches occur in tabletop MTG, but not to the frequency you'll have to deal with here. This compounds with the deck-building problem as you are not given the control to manage your average mana cost.\n\nOther minor problems are the AI being generally overtuned, and the fact that the daily quests will just up and decide that your deck doesn't ACTUALLY fit the colors its asking for.  My experience has also been that custom decks do not count towards the daily quests, but it's possible that I just keep getting the bug every time I try.\n\nIn a year, with a few expansions under its belt and hopefully the kinks worked out, this game might be fun. Until then, avoid it. And good lord don't spend money on it.","August 28, 2015","false","42.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

In previous installations you'd get 15 cards for beating a real opponent and in this game you get about 0.8 cards for beating a real opponent.  Even this wouldn't be so unbearable if they started you out with more than a very limited pool of remotely usable cards.\n\nThe end result is like fighting to the death with foam swords... hundreds of times just to unlock a fraction of the set.  It's so frustrating because the game is otherwise good.  I expect that "earning" the cards rather than buying them would take at a minimum hundreds of hours.\n\nThings they did well:\n-Theoretically far more diverse than older installments--I just refuse to pay 45 dollars to try out that feature\n-Plays better than previous games\n-Skip-able snippets of tutorial that explain both the card game itself and specific points pertinent to the digital version.\n\nI only (very barely) recommend this game because it is the current installment and so is most relevant to a player that might be wanting to pick up the physical game (which by my understanding is the entire reason these games exist).","December 21, 2015","true","349.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

However, the actual style and quality of this experience is pretty much every bit as good as the other titles, with the benefit of being free.\n\n\nYou will quickly discover that it takes a long time to build up a decent collection of cards to work with, as the play-to-unlock approach is very slow.  This mostly doesn't matter, but there comes a point where the game decides you've played enough, and starts equipping the AI with high end chase rares in all its decks.  At that point you will need to either just make your decks more optimized (the AI is ok, but not smart), or switch over to playing more against humans for a while (who likely have decks like yours, except for the occasional paid guy with a ton of chase rares).\n\n\nThe card set is quite limited, but does offer a decent range of potential strategies.  Once you do unlock some cards, you'll have fun making a few decks.  I am guessing this is meant to be some sort of MtG starter experience.\n\n\nIf you enjoy MtG, then give Duels a play for some free quick enjoyment.  If you enjoy CCGs but haven't played MtG, then if you haven't already disappeared in a puff of broken logic, play it for a nice tiny taste of what MtG can be like.  And, if you don't enjoy CCGs, then don't bother, you won't like this either.","January 12","true","80.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The experience I've gotten out of this game so far has been dismal at best.\n\nThat day one grind\nTo initially earn some gold to purchase a few card packs a player will naturally start with the story mode.  In story mode there are some instances in which fights at the beginning of a character's story are considerably harder to win than the fights at the end of their story.   You will be completely at the mercy of the RNG gods and they will frown on you numerous times.  Then when you win a particularly difficult battle you may find yourself being told to reconnect which 50% of the time will result in your win not being recorded, you receiving no gold reward, and you having to repeat that battle if you want to progress.\n\nWhen you move on to playing real people you will be a level 0 player with barely more than the base set of cards and will find yourself being matched up with players as much as (and possibly more than) 15 levels higher than you.  They will have all the advantages you would expect them to have (greater card diversity, better combinations, higher value to mana cost).\n\nThis is not the magic you play with real cards\nYou are not able to pre-shuffle sort your deck.  This means you cannot follow the common practice of spacing out your mana across the deck and as a result you will find yourself either drowning in mana but starved for cards to cast with it or drowning in cards to cast but starved for mana more frequently than you would playing the real game.  You will of course also not be able to place relevant cards beside each other in hopes of increasing your chances in getting a good shuffle.\n\nFor fans of drafts this game has.... nothing.  There is no drafting at all.  Even if it's implemented in some way in the future consider the following:\nThe effort and time required to grind the cost of playing will of course be designed to encourage you to pay rather than grind.\nIf you do decide to but cards then you'll find a 6 pack is $1.99 USD. That makes the per-card cost for these virtual cards more than the per-card cost of real physical cards.  Unlike the real physical cards these ones have absolutely no resale value, no collectors value, and can't be traded with other players.\n\n(TL;DR)So basically...\nIf you've never played magic before, this can teach you about the basic phases of a turn and about different card abilities.  After which you may as well uninstall it and check online if there are any game stores near you that host Draft nights for the real game because:\nIt will have a greater return per time invested ratio.\nYou won't spend 4 hours grinding out the same amount of cards that an hour of going to work can earn you.\nCards you actually pay for will cost you less money.\nYou will learn more about strategy and deck building from talking to the other players at a draft night than you will from playing this game.\nYou will be able to trade cards with other players.\n\nAnd finally....\n\nIf you eventually tire of it you will be able to sell your cards and recoup some or all of your investment (if you pull some rare/valuable cards from packs you might even get back more than your initial investment).\n\n\n\n10/10\nWould fight a battle with the odds stacked against, finally win after over an hour, find out I've been DCed and the results weren't saved, and then go play hearthstone again.","August 13, 2015","false","11.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I feel very ripped off as a matter of fact. I'm not even referring to all the glitches you will read about in the other posts. I was able to put up with that telling myself "It's new, they'll work out all the bugs" That's not the problem at all . . . Let me explain the problem.\n\nI was SOSOSO excited when I first started playing thinking that I would get back into magic again. LIke start purchasing paper cards ect. My thinking was that I could use this program to test out different type two decks and then if I made a deck I thought had a chance in a tournament then I would go buy the real cards to make the deck. This concept would have gotten TONS of old school magic players back in the game. Instead they ruined the whole game!\n\nLet me tell you why it's ruined. First of all it's not like tournament rules where you have the 6 latest expansions and a core set. I was lead to belive that they where going to release all new expansions in Magic Duels so eventually it would be like real magic. IT'S NOT! If you are looking for a way to play MTG online RUN AWAY! This is NOT IT! First of all - You don't even get all of the Magic Origin cards. Second of all - Even the cards you do get: You are limited to how many of each card you can have!!! D: I have never in my entire life put 3 of a card in a deck. Either it's an ultra rare like 6-7 mana card so I only have 1, I like it a little bit so I have 2, or I like it a lot so I have 4. I DO NOT PUT 3 of a card in a deck. Why are so many of the cards limited to just 2 or 3? If you are going to make a deck revolved around doing dmg with the rogue to draw extra cards WHY ON EARTH would you only put 3?\n\nI finally understand the point of Magic Duels. They created this joke of a game to get newcomers to try (because it's f2p). teach them the basics with all the stupid skill drill things, then hope they advance to Magic Online or paper magic.

I am not a Hearthstone fan, but it is ok if hearthstone does this because it appeals to people who never touched a tcg before while magic can too it is mostly veterans who are going to play this game so give these people the option to turn that off.\n\nPoint two, not enough diversity:\nYes this game is partially there to promote the last coreset but come on. I for myself play mostly modern and for a player outside standard this game is a huge letdown. Since the time MTG is around tons of awesome cards were made so let us use them.\n\nPoint three, Magic has many cool formats so why not building them all in "good":\nThey already experimented with different formats in the duels of the planeswalker games but none was done good. There was always some stupid thing to it. WHY THE HELL SHOULD I PAY FOR SEALED SLOTS AFTER I PAID MONEY FOR THE GAME?!(Dues of the Planeswalker).\nThis game didn't try to really improve any of these formats or even implement them, what the hell WotC?\n\n\nThose were my major issues with this game now let's see what actually improved:\n\nPoint one, yeah no more new version every year:\nYes they acutally are going to add more coming cards to it without having to spend another 13 bucks on a new game and unlocking everything from the beginning again and again.\n\nPoint two, smoother gameplay:\nThe game got faster and smoother than his predecessor's which leads to better gameplay overall.\n\nYeah that's pretty much it already about the good points of the game.\n\n\nLast i'd like to say a couple words about the additional card system:\nYes you can invest actual money in it or spend a huge amount of time playing with a nonfunctional deck until it can be called somewhat of a deck with actual strategie behind it. Hearthstone does this too from what i know and i can't really say it's a bad way to do this but it's not the right thing for me. I would never pay money to get digital cards when i can spend my money on real cards which i use in real life playing with my friends on kitchen table or at stores and meet new people there.\n\nSo overall i can't really recomment this game in it's current state.\nIf you are new to magic then it's a real good game to start learning since the tutorials are going to help you as a new player and you don't have to pay for anything. On the other hand, it's not a very good game for veterans.

Not to mention the fact that if someone quits it has a chance of freezing the game... it has gotten to a point where it feels like a chore to complete quests and unlock packs that it's not even fun anymore.\n\nOld Review: The game feels a lot smoother since the update.  Can't say much about the other features, but I'm enjoying the newer sets of cards so far.\n\nMajor drawback this round is how the game speeds through a persons turn.  If you are out of mana sources, or have no playable cards in your hands, your turn is pretty much over DESPITE having abilities you can play on the field.  Want to activate an ability that costs mana during your turn when you're out of playable cards?  Nope, best of luck hitting pause and triggering it before your turn is up as it will SKIP your main phase 2.  Already lost quite a few duels this way.","April 8","false","336.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

The game is made to be infuriatingly lopsided when playing against the computer, especially in the story mode, so you'll spend money on 6 card booster packs (6 ♥♥♥♥ING CARDS)and the game has less than 500 cards I think; This game has nothing to offer but one of the most frustrating free to play models imaginable. And if you want to play against other players have fun with that because everyone is ahead of you with enough cards to make actual constructed decks and anyone who's played MTG can tell you you're not gonna stand a chance against constructed decks using the joke of a collection they start you off with, don't touch this game until at least Battle for Zendikar hits but I have a good feeling there won't be much added I recommend waiting a year before even considering this game.","September 28, 2015","false","13.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Takes like 76 boosters with 6 cards per booster to finish collecting all the cards atm. They said they will be adding more cards every 3 months. Boosters will not give repeats which is a plus. Even though playing against players with a more fleshed out deck could be a little more challenging there is no reason you can't win with this starting pool.\n\nPpl say u can't manually select the lands, they are wrong u can select them. Also there is an option to turn off auto blocking. All this they would know if they have completed the story properly.\n\nThere are 5 campaigns for story mode with 5 missions per campaign. You get 150 gold total from ea campaign.  During the campaign you'll be given the option to do skill quests which teach you the intricates of the game and also award you with ~15 gold. So total of 750 + 250~ = 1000~ gold which you can buy boosters with where ea booster is 150 gold. So around 6-8 boosters.\n\n-Good learning curve for beginners of magic. Yes ppl say the campaign ai  has pre built flavorful decks and even some veterans find it difficult to overcome. That is the whole point of story mode. It is there to teach new players how some tactics can be overcome, and it also sheds more light on how a lot of the mechanics can be used differently. If it was easy, beginners would come out of story mode fighting veterans of the magic community not even having a clue how they were defeated and blame the balance on a small starting pool. Expect to lose and retry a lot in the story mode. You don't need to finish it for veteran players, you just need to finish the first campaign to start building your own deck.\n\n-Deck building. Utter free reign on your deck building as opposed to previous planewalker installments. You can use a deck building wizard or do it manually.\n\n-UI. I just want to touch upon this since I read a lot of the negative reviews are from this category. Yes after like 3-4 iterations of this game the ui should be polished. I haven't experience any of the problems they have touched upon in the negative reviews( like black screens and unresponsiveness), but I'm also using a more up to date pc compared to what some ppl are using, The game when it came out had a lot of server issues disconnecting which could of infuriated a lot of the players, it most certainly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off when I finally defeated lilliana's campaign after 3 times beating her just to find that I have been disconnected and the results haven't been recorded. But I didn't let that affect my review which a lot of ppl were mostly complaining about. It is around launch so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI'll list the cons of the ui in the cons section, but atm I have no problems with the visibility of the UI and it's responsiveless, with only a few gripes on the available options.\n\n-earning boosters. Vs hard ai for 15gold, probably the fastest way since ai's don't need to think and make you wait. With a good deck you can prob knock off an ai every 10 mins~. Vs human you get 20 gold.\n\nA lot of ppl complain about the coding of this game not being done properly, but I find it decently well programmed since I have been through programming courses, when fighting the ai and looking at how a lot of cards demand a lot of what if and what not commands I find that the programmers have done very well in all the special situations that all the cards demand. Not to mention the ai are actually hard, they will fall for some more complex human tactics but often then not if you let your guard down they will kill you. A lot of times I find myself beating the opponent human to find him rage and replaced by ai just to get beaten by the ai later on. I have only seen one or two coding errors within my 40~ hrs of play time, when using a destroy target artifact enchantment spell I removed the creature along with the enchantment aura it had, and when an opponenet killed my creature with an enchantment aura that gave me life, my opponent got the life boost too when it was already used.\n\n-Don't want to look like a nerd while playing the paper version in public? You can be a nerd at home.\n\n\n\nCons\n\n-UI, they have removed chat from the ui. There's no voice communication either. This goes right up there in ways to ruin a great a game.\n\nThe skip atk phase button is in the same position as the continue button so after spamming continue because you have nothing to do on main phase but you want to atk on atk phase you can screw urself over.\n\nThe option to skip when human player quits in the middle. But most of the time I would welcome the free gold, but there should be a quality of life option to leave the game as well.\n\nTaking the time to think on main phase but running out of time automatically skips you through atk phase and 2nd main phase after atk phase. There should be some sort of flashy mechanic to draw ur attention when ur about to run out of time and also to not skip thru all ur phases.\n\n-earning gold. Max 400 gold earned per day so 20 games of winning against humans. Even though it's very hard to win more than 20 games considering the time it takes for a human match, the limit should be bumped a littler high for those of the community that want to enjoy the game f2p so they can unlock more cards and bring their dream deck to reality sooner. With that being said I do find the grind a little slow to unlock more cards to unlock more flavorable plays, but I do respect the gold earned per a play since the game is f2p.\n\n\n2 headed dragon doesn't reward gold. To me this is very weird. Considering this mode is a fan favorite and it takes a much longer time to finish compared to single vs, I don't see the reason to not add gold reward. Hopefully this will be changed later but atm this is probably the main reason to not recommend to a friend.\n\nNo 4 player ffa. I know some argue that the current iteration of cards are probably not suited for a ffa brawl but this mode was a lot of fun in it's previous games and options would definitely not hurt the community but vice versa.\n\n\n\n\nTDLR.\n\nwith the basics of a mtg game covered and free to play but without the quality of life options, communication with ppl, and most important of all U CANT EARN GOLD FROM PLAYING TWO HEADED DRAGON, I don't recommend this. With that being said you can enter this game and play for free, but the grind will not be friendly to new comers.","August 2, 2015","false","294.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It is an expandable (Battle of Zendikar is live now on PC) free-game (which alone is very rare, regarding Magic: The Gathering), in which you are finally able to play with Planeswalkers and make your own deck to play versus others, or AI.\n\nThe game has microtransactions (you buy boosters with in-game money), but you can earn that in-game money playing for free (like other games out there), by doing quests or finishing storylines events.\n\nAnd to make the story short here is a list of PRO and CONS:\n\nPROs:\n- expandable free-game with microtransactions (like other games popular right now: see Marvel Puzzle Quest for instance).\n- enough methods to earn free money in game (If you play regularly, you can buy a booster every 2-3 days).\n- expandable storyline\n- unlockable cards according to the real set of cards (as of now: Magic Origins and Battle for Zendikar).\n- planeswalkers (you can play with them, and the current creature-planeswalkers are a great fun to play with)\n- battle others online\n- make your own decks with Wizard and Advanced Deck building (in other variants you could only play with certain decks or make 1 color decks. Now you can make any deck you want with the cards you have in your collection)\n- gives you motivation to gather the cards needed so you can improve your decks.\n\nCONs:\n- the archetype deck-building (Wizard) can be improved. It limits you to choose between the first 5 possible cards at a certain time in the building phase, and only when you chose one of them you can choose other cards. It should let you choose from all the cards that are available for the restricted archetype build in any order and amount you want to "draft" them.\n- It lacks the ability to play with friends (battle versus specific opponent or play 2 Headed Giant with a friend).\n\nThe game has lots of potential to grow, and it certainly has more room for improvement. It maybe is an 8 out of 10 right now, but it's going in the good direction, and with more expansions it can look better and better.\n\nI am very glad that I now have a way of playing Magic for FREE with most of the cards in the real core sets and I think all of you Magic fans should be.\n\nI recommend this game to any Magic fan. It isn't as high as Magic online yet, but in some areas it really is doing a better job.","November 25, 2015","true","43.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","0"

Probably, because you get to play campaign right away. And so far, this is the most enjoyable thing. Because, well, this game is much more complex, therefore, you have real trouble making decks and, moreever, you won't be able to make decks that you want because of how little good cards that synergizes you have at the start. And considering that this game is lacking such feature as "dust", you will loose a lot of games to, hell, even medium bots.\n\nEdit: 2 days have passed since I started playing, and now I have mostly complete deck that I enjoy to play, and that is without spending a penny on the game. Maybe, I'm just lucky, as it seems I haven't opened even 10 packs yet. However, as I found out recently, you don't even have to be lucky to get the deck you want as cards you have maximum of won't drop (explains absence of "dust"). So here you go, I have no I dea, how publisher earns money from the game. (Probably, money come from selling physical cards, so they can afford to support this game.

Programmers of this game are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥; AI cheats. They know what your top card is at all time and WILL play acordingly. You get mana screw of flood nearly everygame in storymode becasue the prebuilt decks suck balls (young pyromancer in a deck with 5 instants or sorceries),etc. Only saving grace is the ability to build your own decks and they ♥♥♥♥ed that up too. The only thing you can do is play against AI, becasue in multiplayer when another player concedes, and they will concede rather than play out a lost game, the AI takes over and often due to cheating, will win, causing you to lose a game that your opponent conceded from.

Apparently I'm not good enough for the real game, you know, the one where there's no animations, a terrible UI consisting of separate windows popped out for weird things, minimal sound, and zero explanation as to what's happening as you mash your way through interrupt opportunities via the tiny OK button off to the left.\n\nNo, instead I'm forced into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Corral of Magic Duels, with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rock-sounding OST, minimal animations without any sense of impact or importance to them, minimal sound (though slightly less minimal than MtGO), and a plethora of features designed to make me feel as though the game itself is calling me stupid for playing it.  Is it the mandatory pause of 2-3 seconds between each phase?  Is it the narrator who reads verbatim all the help text, that pops up explaining things like the concept of what a "turn" is, at a rate of about 1 word every 2 seconds?  Is it the insultingly easy "challenging and fun skill quests"?  Is it the way all the cards zoom up to the screen when played so I can take my sweet time in seeing that yes, this is another of the same 2/2 with no abilities?

You have to use the deck wizard currently, and the deck wizard has no idea how to build a good magic deck. That, combined with the severly underpowered starting set of cards, means you're forced into grinding low level opponents for hours to earn a few more card to hopefully improve your deck (again, asumming the server connects and the game even decides to recognize your progress).\n\nHopefully in a few weeks this review will be obsolete as all the major bugs will be resolved, but until that happens, avoid. This game is not fun, or even functional in it's current state. A shame, since the Duels series used to be such an easy and enjoyable way to get your magic fix.","August 2, 2015","false","18.4"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

PLEASE. Turn off Combat animations! It eats up too much game time.\n\nThe game is well supported and while the cost to buy packs of cards is rather steep the game is very well tuned.\n\nPrimary concern stems from the fact that the rares are restricted to "2-of's" and the Mythic Rares are "1-of's" which makes building a powerful deck with lots of rares a rather awkward experience since your draws are so inconsistent.\n\nAdditionally, the latest expansion brought even more colour fixing to the game at the same time as it brought the mechanic Converge. The inclusion of Converge and the additional fixing now allows for more decks to play whatever they want. While this innitially is not of great concern, it should be noted that Magic 2015 had similar issues as 5 colour "good stuff" decks became more and more prevalent.\n\nHowever, the overall experience has become more fine tuned and the inclusion of "free tapping" and other features in recent patches shows that the developers really care about the future of this game.\n\nMoving forward, it is this reviewers hope that there is an expansion on the ranking system, the option to have a 15 card Sideboard, and that we get back the camera tools that we had in previous games.","March 12","true","200.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My MTG experience started with DoTP 2015.  I will say, the most awesome part of these games is that they introduced me to the world of MTG. I had no idea of the depth of story and how everything fit together. With that said, I likely will never get into paper Magic past the lore. That endevor will just take too much of my time. Life is simply too busy.\n\nAs far as Magic Duels itself, I do enjoy it, but I'm hesitant to recommend it to others. It feels like Magic Duels is a game put together by a few dedicated highschool kids in their free time. Overall the quality of the interface is not very polished. There are a few glitches here and there, as well as some interesting features left out from previous iterations (hold priority just to name one).\n\nThe biggest issue I have is that I would feel much better with some sort of account system. Currently I have not spent any money on this game because I feel that if I needed to format my computer for any reason I would lose all progress. I'd feel much more secure in spending money if I had this confidence. Another big deal for me, though not quite as big, is that I cannot play on Android. If I was able to apply the same account to both my PC and Android device I would have no problem throwing plenty of money at this game, even in its unpolished state.\n\nI do enjoy playing Magic Duels and will continue to play it. I probably won't spend any money until the major issues listed above are addressed. Here's hoping. I also cannot recommend anyone else spend money on this game if I myself cannot.","March 12","false","500.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No ready button. Nothing!\nYou just invite a friend and hope the game starts and you get into the same team with him.\nYou absolutely can't kick people you dislike either!\n\nThen there are some other issues.\n\nWould you like to communicate with your teammate? Too bad.\nWould you like relatively stable and lag-free online matches? Too bad.\nWould you like to get a proper reward from 2HG win? Too bad. (The coin rewards sometimes show up and disappear after)\nWould you like short and fast turns? Too bad.\n\nDespite all the shortcomings, there is still some light in the horizon.\n\nThere are some cool decks you can make, although the card pool is bit too small.\nMore cards will come and at least the future patches might actually fix more problems than they cause.\n\nIn conclusion.\n\nIf you are a 2HG enthusiast, give this game plenty of time to fix itself.\nIf you like playing solo, this game is relatively good stepping stone to MTG.\n\n(Why is there no "Give it some time" button in Steam?)","August 31, 2015","false","291.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My friend made an 85 card mill deck and when she tried to play it, in game it gave her a 60 card dck with no land. So it randomly made her deck unplayable. After she had just spent money to be able to make that deck. Kind of a disincentive.\nMy self I just notice when it skips the main phase if you don't have a sorcery or instant to cast even if you do have activated abilities or other actions to take.\n\nSo yeah, pretty good for free, but they have to things to fix.\n\nEDIT:  Oh and for the past week every time I try to play a solo game for the quests it just loads forever so I can't actually play. I mean if you didn't want me to play you should have just not made the game rather than keeping me from playing it, but thats where we are. Again, after spending money on cards, that I now don't get to use since it won't load. Thanks.\n\nEDIT EDIT:  Ok I even tried playing it on my wife's computer, where it works and it still won't let me play solo. it just loads forever. And then when you close it, its still running a process somehwere, so you have to go into friggin task manager to actually close it.\n\nThe frustrating thing is its enjoyable when it works, but there are so many bugs. Like I tried playing vs (which it amazingly let me do) and then the opponent played a card that returned a card to your hadn adn then makes you discard a card.  So I have two cards in hand; the creature and a card I want to save, so i click on the creature...and the game says "you can't play that its your opponents turn" while the window at the bottom says "pick a card to discard" with a timer running out >_< so i keep trying and it keeps saying no adn eventually the timer runs out and it gets rid of the card i wanted to save. Its that kind of ♥♥♥♥ constantly.\n\nThis game is like "this shoe would be really comfy except for that blde you put in the heel. why did you do that?" The fact Magic is fun but the game keeps ♥♥♥♥ing it up to keep you from enjoying it just makes it frustrating.

Yeah sure, you cant build your own deck by ALL cards, but you can build your deck anyway you like it, and i mean ANY combination.\n\nSo there is this thing with the deck maximum amount of each cards, in real magic, its 4 no matter the rarity, but here we see it with 4 as commons, 3 uncommon, 2 rare and a single legendary.\nThats what most people are upset about, that you cant build the deck like real magic, and i get that, but i dont see it as a flaw or faulty game design at all.\n\nIt really helps balancing the game out, so we dont se 2-3 decks completly owning every single game, instead, the small common/uncommon decks actually have a chance, since you see one planeswalker, you only have to worry about that single one.\n\nIts both ends decks build around a single overpowerd card, but also balances decks power out. In addition, it really forces a player to make his own deck rather then search out the top 3 decks, sure you can do that, but every deck has a rather good chance by itself because of this 4-3-2-1 rare style.\n\nAnd here is what i absolutly love about Magic Duels:\n\n- Whenever i buy a booster, i get cards i DONT have, thats right, no extra copies to "dust off" nope, you get a brand new card every time. So when you have 4xcommon card, you dont see it in a booster anymore. Man, such a simple thing as that should be natural in anygame, yet it aint, but Magic Duels really does show some love there.\n\n- Also, you are able to get a few packs a day, without grinding. I Play a few games a day, and i earn my self some packs without even realising. So just by having a good time, you get some progression without tireing grinding.\n\nI would absolutly recommend this game over other free card games such as Heartstone. as i have explained above, hearstone is the complete opposite of these "features".\n\nThough i have really been talking well about it in this review, DO mind these major flaws:\n\n- The online vs gaming is extremly annoying to match any player, it takes 2-3 searches before you get to fight an opponent, because it cant "find" the room anymore, you just get returned to the main menu and have to try search again. Such a stupid flaw really drags the quality down of the overall experience, as a new player i really do understand why you would be discouraged before even playing it.\n\nBut if you like magic, and you play standard, give it a try!\n3/5\n","March 12","true","74.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another upside is that the game limits your card collection to 4 of any one card, so you won't get continuously screwed by opening 2 of the same card you already have 23 of.\n\nThat being said it is very SLOW grinding for new cards and the interface for playing games can get a bit annoying with how it works. Especially when you accidentally click a card and there is no confirmation that you wanted to play that card.","March 12","true","79.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have also competed in pre-release events of the actual, physical card game, which I still play regularly. I even own the Heroscape-like boardgame --it's a blast! I highly recommend that last one.\n\nI am not sure where the hate for Duels is coming from -- perhaps from a sloppy launch? In its current condition, Duels is probably the best M:tG game out there, and certainly the closest to reproduce the real-life collecting experience outside of M:tG Online. And it's free. Story Mode is fun, and every chapter gives you enough gold to acquire at least one booster; by the end of Story Mode, the average player should have a decent enough deck to win most hard-mode duels against the AI. By combining those earnings with that of daily and weekly quests, even a very unlucky person should be able to expand their collection at a satisfying rate. I've certainly not grown tired of the game, and I've only unlocked about half of the achievements.\n\nFuture updates should increase card selection and add Story Mode chapters, and there's every indication the development schedule will keep pace with real-life M:tG releases.\n\nOf course, the game is not without problems. The UI takes some getting used to, but it's more forgiving than in 2014. For some reason, the cinematics are buggy and have no sound (but that, I think, is a fairly minor complaint). Legacy formats like Planechase and Archenemy are not available. Randomly-assigned multiplayer matches are undeniably unfair:  folk willing to pay will definitely get a leg up on the competition. But playing against friends and/or the AI is always fun. I would especially recommend this game to casual players who want to stay abreast of the M:tG world but can't afford to maintain a standard deck.","March 5","true","145.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nowhere near enough cards are included in these games and it is in my oppinion the problem\nWith more added depth this game could easily be the best MTG game on steam.\nBut taking in consideration that there is already a MTG game that can be played online, even if it costs real money to play it makes these games seem far from what they could be.

At one point the game was so buggy as to be near unplayable but as it's grown older on my shelf the bugs have grown less noticeable and much less frequent. The free-to-play nature of the game drew me in aswell as the personal history I have with Magic. The game has offered me a nice alternative to stretch my magic muscles when I get the urge, and it has offered me the ability to play my favorite card game from a place wherein there is not a sanctioned Modern event within 100 miles. The few gripes I have for the game are thus: The game- unless you're sporting a wallet filled with gold- is a massive grind. Recently there have been a few changes to the gold rewards on the quests and vs battles that have helped the pacing tremendously, but you still must have an impressive amount of patience in order to finally booster your way into the cards you want for that deck you've been really wanting to build. As of today I've put in roughly 200 hours into this game and I've only recently finished off the Origins Set boosters moving into BFZ. The grinding admittedly however gets easier and easier the more cards you acquire, the hardest part of the grind starting at the very beginning when you only have your campaign gold and a couple of deck builders toolkits, which has led to the discouragement of many would-be Magic Duels players. On the subject of the campaigns, they're fun- very fun. Though short, the different scenarios and decks you are pitted against throughout the story are diverse and engaging, and in my oppinion make up for the choppy cheesy messes that are the cut scenes, and as of today there are plans to release Shadows Over Innistrad which will introduce a brand spanking new campaign with a plethra of new cards.\nThe pacing of each game is one of my few gripes, with slow drawn out turns with timers on them that should last half the time they do, which admittedly may be my inner veteran coming out. "Untap, draw, tap, Goblin Guide, swing, pass."\nAnother of my gripes are the stipulations placed on Two Headed Giant. Though you can still fulfill quest parameters while in a game of THG the game doesn't have any natural gold reward or while I'm at it, any support at all really. There hasn't been a THG I've played in months that hasn't disconnected one of us at some point during the match, leaving one of the players with an ai companion that doesn't understand the meaning of the phrase "Board State", amongst many other less rage quit worthy glitches in the mode. That being said and taking all things into account I really do recommend the game, it's fun, casual, you get the thrill of opening boosters and playing in a pitched match without throwing a hundred dollars out the window to satisfy the standard format and it's developement has come much further than I ever thought it would. Knowing the team of developers having put in all the work they have I wouldn't be at all surprised if they fix THG next or add in a way to communicate with your opponent.  Perhaps the most exciting thing about this game is that it's far from done with it's developement, they're going to keep adding new cards and new mechanics and new campaigns, and fixing old bugs. That's what make games like these so great.\nWould recommend 8.5/10","March 11","true","236.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My MTG experience started with DoTP 2015.  I will say, the most awesome part of these games is that they introduced me to the world of MTG. I had no idea of the depth of story and how everything fit together. With that said, I likely will never get into paper Magic past the lore. That endevor will just take too much of my time. Life is simply too busy.\n\nAs far as Magic Duels itself, I do enjoy it, but I'm hesitant to recommend it to others. It feels like Magic Duels is a game put together by a few dedicated highschool kids in their free time. Overall the quality of the interface is not very polished. There are a few glitches here and there, as well as some interesting features left out from previous iterations (hold priority just to name one).\n\nThe biggest issue I have is that I would feel much better with some sort of account system. Currently I have not spent any money on this game because I feel that if I needed to format my computer for any reason I would lose all progress. I'd feel much more secure in spending money if I had this confidence. Another big deal for me, though not quite as big, is that I cannot play on Android. If I was able to apply the same account to both my PC and Android device I would have no problem throwing plenty of money at this game, even in its unpolished state.\n\nI do enjoy playing Magic Duels and will continue to play it. I probably won't spend any money until the major issues listed above are addressed. Here's hoping.

Yeah sure, you cant build your own deck by ALL cards, but you can build your deck anyway you like it, and i mean ANY combination.\n\nSo there is this thing with the deck maximum amount of each cards, in real magic, its 4 no matter the rarity, but here we see it with 4 as commons, 3 uncommon, 2 rare and a single legendary.\nThats what most people are upset about, that you cant build the deck like real magic, and i get that, but i dont see it as a flaw or faulty game design at all.\n\nIt really helps balancing the game out, so we dont se 2-3 decks completly owning every single game, instead, the small common/uncommon decks actually have a chance, since you see one planeswalker, you only have to worry about that single one.\n\nIts both ends decks build around a single overpowerd card, but also balances decks power out. In addition, it really forces a player to make his own deck rather then search out the top 3 decks, sure you can do that, but every deck has a rather good chance by itself because of this 4-3-2-1 rare style.\n\nAnd here is what i absolutly love about Magic Duels:\n\n- Whenever i buy a booster, i get cards i DONT have, thats right, no extra copies to "dust off" nope, you get a brand new card every time. So when you have 4xcommon card, you dont see it in a booster anymore. Man, such a simple thing as that should be natural in anygame, yet it aint, but Magic Duels really does show some love there.\n\n- Also, you are able to get a few packs a day, without grinding. I Play a few games a day, and i earn my self some packs without even realising. So just by having a good time, you get some progression without tireing grinding.\n\nI would absolutly recommend this game over other free card games such as Heartstone. as i have explained above, hearstone is the complete opposite of these "features".\n\nThough i have really been talking well about it in this review, DO mind these major flaws:\n\n- The online vs gaming is extremly annoying to match any player, it takes 2-3 searches before you get to fight an opponent, because it cant "find" the room anymore, you just get returned to the main menu and have to try search again. Such a stupid flaw really drags the quality down of the overall experience, as a new player i really do understand why you would be discouraged before even playing it.\n\nBut if you like magic, and you play standard, give it a try!\n3/5\n","March 12","true","74.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have also competed in pre-release events of the actual, physical card game, which I still play regularly. I even own the Heroscape-like boardgame --it's a blast! I highly recommend that last one.\n\nI am not sure where the hate for Duels is coming from -- perhaps from a sloppy launch? In its current condition, Duels is probably the best M:tG game out there, and certainly the closest to reproduce the real-life collecting experience outside of M:tG Online. And it's free. Story Mode is fun, and every chapter gives you enough gold to acquire at least one booster; by the end of Story Mode, the average player should have a decent enough deck to win most hard-mode duels against the AI. By combining those earnings with that of daily and weekly quests, even a very unlucky person should be able to expand their collection at a satisfying rate. I've certainly not grown tired of the game, and I've only unlocked about half of the achievements.\n\nFuture updates should increase card selection and add Story Mode chapters, and there's every indication the development schedule will keep pace with real-life M:tG releases.\n\nOf course, the game is not without problems. The UI takes some getting used to, but it's more forgiving than in 2014. For some reason, the cinematics are buggy and have no sound (but that, I think, is a fairly minor complaint). Legacy formats like Planechase and Archenemy are not available. Randomly-assigned multiplayer matches are undeniably unfair:  folk willing to pay will definitely get a leg up on the competition. But playing against friends and/or the AI is always fun. I would especially recommend this game to casual players who want to stay abreast of the M:tG world but can't afford to maintain a standard deck.","March 5","true","145.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plus a game this iconic and celebrated by its fans is always going to get tons of shade thrown at it by the hardcore/longtime crowd. However, I'm brand new to MTG in general as well as the digital doppelgangers (I also bought Magic 2014 DOTP Gold Complete on sale just prior to trying this out). I don't own a single paper card nor have I ever played any version of Magic, so I was a Magic virgin going into this (pun intended, nerds).\n\nAs of 2/22/16, this is a pretty good game. In fact, it's a great game for two types of gamers:\n\n1. People new to Magic (me).\n2. Casual/Mobile gamers (not me).\n\nI highlighted that part as the TL;DR version, but I'll add this:\n\nIf you are new to Magic, this is probably the best possible way to learn. The tutorial/story mode is very well done and the interface is very clean, intuitive, and looks like it belongs in 2016.\n\nUpdate on 3/10/16: There are some critical bugs in certain parts of the game, but the devs are serious about Duels going forward for at least two years. It probably won't ever compare to MTGO, but this will be the perfect intro for new players, in a perfect platform for it, free and accessible. Seriously, you can pretty much ignore most reviews from last year. The farming is opened up, you get more coins for everything, and the gold cap resets every 12 or 24 hours like the quests. It's not hard to amass cards if you can play an hour or so a day. My monored aggro (farming) deck usually beats the AI in 5-6 turns. Disable all the fancy animations and such, and a game can end in minutes. That definitely makes the AI look stupid (and it is sometimes), but the complaint about farming was repeated a lot a few months back.","February 22","true","100.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was excited about the game when it was announced but that quickly fell apart once I tried it.\n\nI have really tried to like it but there is just no way that I could recommend this over Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013/2014. They are far superior games in almost every single way. Even the 2015 version, (which was the worst one yet), is much, much better than this one. The fact that this game is Free-to-Play is honestly not exactly much of a redeeming factor with a game this flawed.\n\n----------CONS:----------\n\n- The decks you can build are very boring. The cards have very little synergy and in general it feels like any exciting card combinations are just not there. You never feel like you have a truly powerful deck.\n\n- Connection issues - This game will crash a lot and often you can not get progress, which also means you do not recieve coins, (currency for buying booster packs).\n\n- The entire gameplay feels extremely slow for someone having played the earlier versions like 2014 or 2013. The gameplay needs to be swift and responsive. This is NOT the case!\n\n- No lobbies - Why would you remove the most convinient way of getting together to play and select which deck you want to use? This is madness!\n\n- No chat or online interaction of ANY kind. This means that it is impossible to coordinate strategy with you team mate. This is beyond stupid. It makes the online gaming feel like playing against an AI. There is no way of telling the difference. If a player gets replaced with an AI, you have no way of knowing it apart from the message, (which you can miss entirely if you turn your head for a moment).\n\n- 3 & 4 player Free For All is not implemented. Why would you remove this mode from the game? It is just lazy.\n\n- Bugs prevent certain cards from not working as the should. And by certain I mean several.\n\n- Story of the game is boring and more importantly really short. Recently a new campaign was added. It is 5 games long. It feels extremely lazy and rushed. Even for a free game this is completely insulting.\n\n- You can only recieve currency for completing the campaign ONCE. When you have completed a match, you will recieve ZERO coins for completing it again.\n\n- The coin system looks good at first glance but feels more like a massive cash grab once you experience how slow progression is in this game. Makes you want to buy coins for real money (I would strongly advice you not to do this). In earlier games you could pay 1 euro to unlock a whole deck. There is a massive difference to this than unlocking 6 random cards.\n\n- No Plane Chase mode. This is a minor complain because it was last seen in Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013. Makes the game a little more exciting and different. It's a refreshing change of pace. Would like to see this mode return to future releases.\n\n----------PROS (mostly very minor):----------\n\n- Deck building is easier than ever before. There is more support on how to get your deck started and also an auto complete option. This is honestly pretty solid.\n\n- Nice to see good in depth tutorials. Makes it easier for new players to pick up. But why on earth would you force players to get through the tutorial? It is very long and tedious for experienced players who knows all about Magic. Forcing a player like me to get through it is a bit insulting.\n\n- 2 Headed Giant mode is back, (removed in DotP 2015), but how do you invite friends to play? This does not seem to work as intended.\n\n- Nice customization of Avatars for your decks. This is a pretty cool minor feature.\n\n----------CONCLUSION:----------\n\nI would NOT recommend this game at all. Maybe, just maybe if you are completely new to Magic the Gathering and don't feel like paying for the real experience just yet. Although I think chances are that this experience may hurt your overall opinion on Magic.\n\nI would much rather recommend Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013/2014 even 2015 (better chances for online matchmaking). I recommend putting these titles on your wishlist and grab them on the next sale. They rarely get on sale but it happens.\n\nGood luck!","January 13","false","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, you earn just 5 gold for easy AI win (10 for medium, 15 for hard), sure there is a daily limit of 400 gold, and sure, there are only 6 cards in boosters. But there's one thing they don't usually mention- you will never get more copies of a card from booster than you are allowed to use in deck! If you'd play Magic Duels and get 400 gold every day, you could get all the cards from Origins set in under a month! A MONTH. Name another online CCG where you could get every available card in game under a month without spending a penny. (with the Zendikar expansion there are more cards, so you'd need more than a month now to get them all, but still it's not that bad).\n\nSeriously, I've seen much worse grind CCGs (looking at you, Duel of Champions...)\n\nAnd it's completely free.

This game gives you the ability to collect cards and play them completely for free. unlocking cards by simply playing magic is great value. Especially so for players who are new to the game, players without the financial capability to play magic on paper or on MTGO, or players who don't live near a FNM gamestore. Other positives are the casual gameplay, and the sleek design compared to MTGO.\n\nNow the negatives however: The game has bugges. It's out for quite some time, and a number of bugs simply haven't been fixed. There are connectivity errors, causing you to lose coins or sometimes even boosters you buy. The coins are deducted from your account, but the boosters are simply not awarded. I'd say this has happened to me around 3-5 times in the 50+ hours i've played. Another problem I have with the game is the lack of communication between players. There is no chat. This is bothersome in 1v1, but simply mages 2 headed giant unplayable. You can't ask your teammate what they're planning to do, who is going to attack and block, etc.\n\nHowever what made me recommend this game is the fact that I've contacted customer service about the boosters i didn't get awarded, and within 3 hours they contacted me back and refunded me the coins I lost. I found this to be decisive in giving the game a positive review. Also, the ability to play MTG for free is great. If the bugs are fixed in upcoming patches, it could be a truly great game.","January 17","true","65.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other times, you've lost well before deciding if you should keep your hand or not, and no matter how much skill or luck you are able to command, you'll be losing a short game. Yet it's the vast swath between these that's truly rewarding; where a deck fully designed by the player contends with something just as good by someone else, where the balance of power is constantly shifting, and the whole game comes down to a single health point or two, and a single turn makes the difference between a win and a loss.\n\nSo, after about 100 hours or so in the game, I feel comfortable enough to say it's worth a round every now and again.","December 15, 2015","true","177.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In-fact you'll mostly skip or ignore it just to get to the game play however would been nice to hear some voices speak the lines of the text then just reading about it.\n\nGraphics:\nWonderful if all you care about is the cards them self as everything else is plain and boring. The animations aren't good in-fact it's something you may want to turn off to increase the speed of the game. The board is plain however at least it doesn't hurt your eyes.\n\nSound:\nThe sound isn't awful however it's not great. The music doesn't really stand out at all however the sound effect aren't too bad.\n\nContent:\nStory Mode (Origins, Battle for Zendikar)\nBattle Mode (Versus Battle, Solo, Two-Headed Giant)\nCard Collection {Shows All Cards}\nQuest {Achievement Unlocking for Coins}\nIt's basic which pretty much sums it all up. The modes while are okay for what they are there nothing that really stand out other then two-headed giant which allows you to play with a friend and not against them. There not much to the options of the game just your basic settings.\n\nYou are able also to build a card deck quickly without knowledge with the Deck Wizard. The Deck Build allows you to build your own custom deck with the current card you have unlock which is great and able to filter out card by type, color, cost, rarity it sadly lacks a search for card base on name and filter list of cards starting with A and ending with Z.\n\nDifficulty:\nIt's hard very hard.... I'll admit I'm no expert at this game. I have very little knowledge about Magic TCG however I have played other card games in the past. The AI in the game seems unfair and doesn't help when in story your facing AI which are made to have better decks then the ones they give you to use.\n\nFree to Play Model:\nThe model is fair to people who don't spend money on the game as their isn't too much of a pay to win aspect to Magic Duels. The major downside is you'll need to grind to unlock booster packs without spending any cash.\n\nThe closest it comes to pay to win is allowing people to pay for more booster packs which can lead to people getting cards quicker then someone who doesn't pay as they can still unlock booster packs by playing the game and getting coins. There is no guarantee that you'll end up with any rare card as all packs are RNG.\n\nExtra Information\nThe game plays very slow like where you will be wishing their is some way to speed up the pace of the game play. You can disable the animations of the game to slightly improve the game speed.\n\nRecommend:\nNo, While with friends this game can be fun sadly playing solo will make you hate the AI unless your very familiar with Magic The Gathering. If your a fan of card games or magic I do suggest you try it out for your self. If not well there other card games which may be simpler to get into.","February 14","false","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was excited about the game when it was announced but that quickly fell apart once I tried it.\n\nI have really tried to like it but there is just no way that I could recommend this over Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013/2014. They are far superior games in almost every single way. Even the 2015 version, (which was the worst one yet), is much, much better than this one. The fact that this game is Free-to-Play is honestly not exactly much of a redeeming factor with a game this flawed.\n\n----------CONS:----------\n\n- The decks you can build are very boring. The cards have very little synergy and in general it feels like any exciting card combinations are just not there. You never feel like you have a truly powerful deck.\n\n- Connection issues - This game will crash a lot and often you can not get progress, which also means you do not recieve coins, (currency for buying booster packs).\n\n- The entire gameplay feels extremely slow for someone having played the earlier versions like 2014 or 2013. The gameplay needs to be swift and responsive. This is NOT the case!\n\n- No lobbies - Why would you remove the most convinient way of getting together to play and select which deck you want to use? This is madness!\n\n- No chat or online interaction of ANY kind. This means that it is impossible to coordinate strategy with you team mate. This is beyond stupid. It makes the online gaming feel like playing against an AI. There is no way of telling the difference. If a player gets replaced with an AI, you have no way of knowing it apart from the message, (which you can miss entirely if you turn your head for a moment).\n\n- 3 & 4 player Free For All is not implemented. Why would you remove this mode from the game? It is just lazy.\n\n- Bugs prevent certain cards from not working as the should. And by certain I mean several.\n\n- Story of the game is boring and more importantly really short. Recently a new campaign was added. It is 5 games long. It feels extremely lazy and rushed. Even for a free game this is completely insulting.\n\n- You can only recieve currency for completing the campaign ONCE. When you have completed a match, you will recieve ZERO coins for completing it again.\n\n- The coin system looks good at first glance but feels more like a massive cash grab once you experience how slow progression is in this game. Makes you want to buy coins for real money (I would strongly advice you not to do this). In earlier games you could pay 1 euro to unlock a whole deck. There is a massive difference to this than unlocking 6 random cards.\n\n- No Plane Chase mode. This is a minor complain because it was last seen in Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013. Makes the game a little more exciting and different. It's a refreshing change of pace. Would like to see this mode return to future releases.\n\n----------PROS (mostly very minor):----------\n\n- Deck building is easier than ever before. There is more support on how to get your deck started and also an auto complete option. This is honestly pretty solid.\n\n- Nice to see good in depth tutorials. Makes it easier for new players to pick up. But why on earth would you force players to get through the tutorial? It is very long and tedious for experienced players who knows all about Magic. Forcing a player like me to get through it is a bit insulting.\n\n- 2 Headed Giant mode is back, (removed in DotP 2015), but how do you invite friends to play? This does not seem to work as intended.\n\n- Nice customization of Avatars for your decks. This is a pretty cool minor feature.\n\n----------CONCLUSION:----------\n\nI would NOT recommend this game at all. Maybe, just maybe if you are completely new to Magic the Gathering and don't feel like paying for the real experience just yet. Although I think chances are that this experience may hurt your overall opinion on Magic.\n\nI would much rather recommend Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013/2014 even 2015 (better chances for online matchmaking). I recommend putting these titles on your wishlist and grab them on the next sale. They rarely get on sale but it happens.\n\nGood luck!","January 13","false","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played the Microprose version for many more hours than this version.\n\nI like the core game.\n\nHowever, with the latest update, the game was essentially broken by an intentional design choice on the part of the developers. Namely skipping a players turn unless they have a sorcery-speed or land card in their hand. This breaks a fundamental aspect of the game that instants can be cast at any time. The game will not allow you to do so.\n\nIt doesn't speed up the game like the developers insist.

Quests do not reward you all the time, or if they do they don't give you full rewards.

The game gives you your own collection, and encourages microtransation purchase of virtual packs, but then gives you a sizable amount of campaign scenarios, where in all of them you are forced to use their preconstructed decks, which at least 80% of them are filled with unfun garbage. For a game designed for appealing to beginners, it debuts and shows off a spectrum of bland and unspectacular cards like Drownyard Explorers, Shambling Ghouls, Fire Elemental, Carrion Crow. I was enraged to see Nephalia Moondrakes as Innistrad Jace's 'big' card.\n\nThe Origins campaign, spare much less than half the battles, were insufferably boring. Liliana's decks in particular were very bland and very much worse than what you were facing, up until the last battle, which was actually well done. Gideon was boring, Chandra, for a 'burn deck', saw a distinct lack of burn spells, and a lot unspectacular creatures. Nissa's deck was usable, and what should be the bare bones standard for entertaining design, and Jace's campaign managed to have the only consistently fun deck and gameplay.\n\nThe Shadows Over Innistrad challeneges were quite bad with a few exceptions: Jace and Tamiyo vs Avacyn had a good decklist, Sorin vs Avacyn would have been a great fight; Sorin had a very fun deck, but Avacyn's deck was very underwhelming and very squishable, I replayed that battle twice, wondering where her threatening cards were and found none. Jace's deck proved to be very slow and bland against all aggro decks, I had no fun with it until a brand new Welcome to the Fold was put into his last encounter.\n\nI actually do not have complaints about the Zendikar campaigns; Gideon's decks were actually good and fun to use, and the very last battle against the Eldrazi titans was very well done and very fun.\n\nThe storytelling was adequately executed, I am generally satisfied.\n\nThe game engine appears to be the same Duel of the Planeswalkers engine that has been used for years. I think it does have some issues regarding the game atmosphere and feel; the effects and card animations have lingering, floaty animations that confuse or lag, rather than impress, or appear 'magical' or whatever the intent was. They aren't inherently bad, they are well done for the intent to be floaty or slow, but they are frustrating when you are in a boring spot, or losing a match. In particular I feel the drawing animation should be much more concise. Sometimes some cards fly erractically (I experienced this when opponents used cards with madness effects in the Innistrad campaign), linger and wait for your acknowledgement, or don't linger and wait for your acknowledgement when you expect them to.\n\nFor magic's complicated design and arcitecture, the engine executes it fairly well, with a few occasional hiccups. I find myself occasionally having just not enough time to respond to a spell or ability that I really intended to respond to as soon as I noticed my opponent's move, while sometimes feel frustrated waiting for priority to tick away while either me or my opponenet have no mana untapped. This is less of a criticism, I imagine priority is a part of mtg that is a nightmare to design for in a game. I feel the use of the space bar handling both pausing the timer and passing priority when appropriate was handled fairly elegantly, and should have been noted at some point in tutorial dialogue.\n\nI had two technical problems: I had some problems with a glitch in the graveyard browser, several times while I tried to make a decision while one of my spells was resolving, I tried to minimze my spell, and when I entered the graveyard broweser, no cards showed up. This happened every time I tried, and robbed me of information I could have used in gameplay decisions.\nI had several crashes in Chandra's campaign against the Lieutenant. I am sorry that I don't have any information on what could have caused the crash. It was mildly frustrating, but I managed to make it past the node on about my fourth time. The good news is that these were really the only glitches I encountered in a very expansive and complicated system.\n\nI do fairly often get screwed by the game skipping phases when I have activated abilities I want to use on my turn. I don't have an exact example at the moment, but several times the game skips phases on your turn when you don't havve creatures on your turn, and I have wanted to activate draw effects and hopefully draw a land to drop, but the game will skip the phases so quickly that by the time I can actually pause the timers to activate my abilities/cast my instants, it's already the end step on my turn.\n\nThe ingame popups while navigating the main menu are really annoying, and have yet to actually pique my interest in anything they state. The game has spammed me with many popup informing me of a reward for beating the Gideon campaign, which was something I claimed within the first hour of the game, and irrelevant like, 4 or 5 times they informed me of it.\n\nThe deckbuiliding UI is pretty bad, filters for only colors, nothing for rarity or card effects. Finding the way to name and change the picture for my deck required me to look online, and was very unintuitively placed. You should be able to favorite cards to find during deck construction. I didn't buy any packs with real money, and I am already swamped with how many cards I have to wade through, the system really needs improvement.\n\nThis game makes a critical mistake that is very common in the video game industry, and that is hand-holding new players with tutorial messages. It is very patronizing to players when games decide we are not intelligent enough to figure out mechanics on our own. I am playing from the prespective of a veteran player rather than a beginner, so I am predisposed towards not needing the tutorials, so my criticism will be biased, but I do feel that a better design would be painless for a seasoned player as well as accessible to a novice. I feel the bland preconstructed deck construction is also tied to this 'tutorial' mentality, that starting players cannot handle flashier or more powerful cards for some reason. I feel this decision is not only mistaken, but detrimental towards the starting player's excitement and motivation. I feel that Wizards puts a considerable amount of thought in how to introduce new players, and this overcaution has hindered the game's enjoyability and viability as an introductory tool.\n\nThe new design of their pay model is very interesting. Though I tend to dislike freemium-style, free to play games, as they prey on whales, I think it's ultimately Wizards/the dev team's prerogative for how they decide to monetize their game. I think the current design is more advantageous than the previous model of buying the complete game, given that they can use Magic: Duels as a tutorial/introductory tool for bringing in new players to the game in reality. While I feel that duality in functionality was a smart design choice, I think the game is ineffective its execution, as I stated in the above paragraph. I would feel more inclined to purchase packs if I felt owning these virtual cards meant anything; they will be outdated once Wizards releases whatever their next game is. The packs purchasing mechanics also comes with a very slow earning of packs with ingame currency, which for me at least is a bit daunting and discouraging.\n\nIn summary, some things about this undertaking were done very well, more things were done very badly. I love mtg, Hopefully the next installment is better executed.","May 19","false","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a fun game for both experienced players, and those who are new to the game. You can play against other people, or you can play against an AI opponent.\n\nIf you're experienced, there is an advanced deck-building mode, but if you're new to the game, it has a deck wizard (no pun intended!) to help you as you build your decks. As you play the game, helpful tips guide you along, which you can choose not to reappear as you learn. The game tempts you to spend real money to obtain  "coins", which you can use to obtain booster packs in this game, so that you can get better cards to add to your decks. If you don't want to spend real money, you have the option to complete "quests", such as casting certain types of spells enough times, which give you the coins you otherwise would spend real money on to purchase the digital booster packs.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that there is a timer, which lasts for about two seconds. It activates in response to everything you do. From my experience and perspective, the timer is useless, and it's annoying. I see no advantage to it, and it actually hinders your gameplay if you forget about it, or if you don't click on it in time to stop it so that you can cast another spell, or use one of your cards' abilities in response to something.\n\nYou can customize avatars, backgrounds, and the names of your decks. The music is exciting, relaxing, and entertaining as well.\n\nThis game is fun! I love it! I just wish there was a button you could click to proceed to the next step instead of the timer. For keyboard commandos who like to do things quickly, keyboard shortcuts would have been the perfect finishing touch.

There are not a lot of viable decks, and you can't craft specific cards, so A) play gets repetitive after a while, B) it takes a while (or money) to build your collection to the point you can build one of those viable decks.  So you really do have a pay-to-win / grind-to-win for what's a rather limited game.\n\n4) Mods ban people on forums that don't like what they've done, and delete critical posts (even polite ones).  Source - looked at Magic: 2015 to see how people reacted to Magic: Duels as a successor, looked on Magic: Duels forums and noticed certain posts had been deleted.  Well, really.\n\n==\n\nAlthough there are a load of things holding this game back (no second main phase, really?), even though the developers are pretty unresponsive (not responding to lack of second main phase, really?), mods apparently act shady, loads of iffy things - if you're a dyed-in-the-wool Magic fan, or just sick of Hearthstone or whatever, go ahead and pick this game up.  Why choose the lesser of two evils (Hearthstone) when you can choose the greater of two evils (Magic: the Gathering).  You can have some fun, etc.\n\nBut if you start thinking about spending money, take a good hard look at the developers' lack of support for the game, the limited meta, overbearing mod actions - it's just really not good.\n\nNote - there ARE some nice things for new players, like you start off with a load of cards and lands that produce multiple mana types.  Still leaves you dead against anyone with any kind of bank (whether money or time invested) but enough to play around some, anyways.","June 5","false","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","2"

I usually like these games, I also rarely write reviews, and when I do it is purely for reccomendations.  This game... however, has caused me to make a exception to that trend.  Most MTG games are fairly straigth forward, and as with most of the games, an eventual purchase is expected to fully enjoy the game.  Either you need to pay intially to play the games, or you will have to purchase some cards/booster packs to play beyond the standard pre-made packs.  This game... however, advertises itself as truly free, and then berates you with annoying totorials, oddly placed buttons that often result in misclicks, and a very liberal use of language.  I began playing and went through the very lengthy, and quite tedius tutorial/story mode because it provides you with enough ingame currency to purchase a few booster packs.  This tutorial is the epitomy of "well duh" and takes you through some rediculously obvious and self explanatory game mechanics in a fashion that requires you to constantly load and swap out of your main tutorial into a secondary tutorial scenario that forcefeeds you mechanics as simplistic as casting an instant spell, using a creature ability, using a "tap creature" ability... and many other things that truly shouldn't need clarification.  In fact, there are a couple abilities that could do with a bit of explaining, but they actually seemed to have changed the rules (you can now tap a tapped creature.. which doesn't seem relavent, but it used to come into play a lot) and leave out those tutorials until you coincidentally run into them during an actual match..  but back to the main issues.  The starter pack is quite possibly one of the worst starters you could possibly get.  I'm actually wondering if it is truly random, but many of the other reviews back up the fact that it just seems horrible.  You get virtually no cards with any form of synergy with each other and then must grind very slowly against AI opponents with incredibly simple but well synergized decks in order to get enough coins to buy more boosters in hopes that you'll get some of the missing pieces to form a real starter deck to then farm for an actual PvP deck over what I am assuming is the better part of a half millenia.  You will generally win 1 out of every 5-10 duels vs these AI decks simply due to the fact that you have a random assortment of low strength spells and monsters with abilities that do not work well together (I.E. A card that boosts its effects for every creature of that type in play, and they only give you 1, or a card combo that allows you to farm up all of your enchant spells, which would be incredibly powerful IF you actually had any enchants that would impact the outcome of the game or provided more than a +1 +2 bonus)  Then we get to the quests...  There are player base quests where all players of the game work towards a goal such as beating the final tutorial opponent 5,000,000 times (last I saw we were at 5,004,531 although there was no actual payout yet for some reason) which would be cool only it doesn't seem to work...  and then you get individual quests which request very specific color types or goals to be carried out in "Duels."  Now personally I'm still trying to figure out WTF a "Duel" is to the makers of this game, because the AI battles are actually called duels.. and yet they don't seem to give you credit for them for your individual quests.  I found this odd because the 5,000,000 win quest also specifically mentioned winning "Duels" only in that instance it WAS against an AI opponent.  I guess this could mean that you have to win vs another player, but this is completely impossible without spending about $80-120 on the in-game boosters, which are roughly $7-8 a piece.  I can't fathom why they would sell them for so much in a game that has no actual card or re-sell value, especially when their largest Free-To-Play MTG game actually sells them for about the same price AND has the added value of allowing you to exchange these cards for the real life physical copies should you gather an entire set of them...  Plus that game has every MTG card in existence in it and also allows you to play reasonably against other players for free, or pay a small fee to get a workable set of pre-chosen cards from which you can assemble your own deck from.  If you want to spend some time on a free MTG game I highly suggest looking elsewhere at the far more successful iterations of this franchise.  Wizards apparently gave this project to the crackheads of their company that chose to follow the tradition FTP model of making the game terrible unless you pay, and just barely fun if you do.\nSteer clear!","August 19, 2015","false","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Honestly this feels like Magic 2015 all over again.\nFirst of all, the deck building feature would be great if building your own deck was actually plausible. As it stands it suffers from the same issue as its predecessor in that the only decks that you can actually win with are the premade ones. Tweaking them with cards from booster packs is not the same as making your own deck.\nSpeaking of booster packs, if you've read some of the other reviews than you probably have a general idea of what a pain it is to unlock them. After completing the campaign your two options are to either challenge other players or to grind against the AI. The former is the potentially the most profitable but poses a problem in that it's not uncommon to have your opponent quit like a jackass if you're beating them. If that happens then you get nothing which apparently the developers thought was fair. The latter is just a pain since the AI appears to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lovechild of Skynet and Ultron. It definitly does not care for humans and will do everything in its power to destroy you which it will have no problem doing since it will likely have much better cards than you unless you've either spent about a year grinding for coins or have dropped a few hundred dollars on booster packs. Even if you do manage to scrape out a win the spoils of victory are hardly worth effort.\nIf they add a larger (I mean MUCH larger) variety of cards, improve the rewards (by which I mean actually provide rewards) from multiplayer opponent rage quits, lower the monetary cost of booster packs (right now they cost more than actual cards!), and add different difficulty levels for the AI (something a little easier than impossible) then this could shape up to be a decent game. More campaigns or story quests wouldn't hurt either.\n...\nOr maybe they should just try again next year.","August 23, 2015","false","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Terrible to play.\n\nHow do you justify creating a game where a player can bail from the game the moment they realize they cannot win, causing their opponent to play the remainder of the game vs. the AI which doesn't play at all by the rules, but cheats to win, so you can never get the gold coins to advance?\n\nThis allows you to never give out the free gold after a match but to rather force players to purchase gold with real money. This is but one of the numerous very large problems this game has… Problems that don't need to be here. Problems that you could have fixed instantly if you cared to. What is worse this, problem actually seems to be there by design.\n\nThere are so many more problems with this game that I can't even list them all and I will not even try. This is just the top one for me, since I have yet to finish a single game that I was winning vs. a random player since I started playing the game. Not once…\n\nYou will not see a dime from me, wasted on this game with this built in system, designed to steal away a player's chance at earning the gold in game. This game is essentially a scam, because you designed the game this way fully knowing that players would abuse it this way.\n\nSo, so not the game we were waiting for!\n","August 21, 2015","false","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The introductory story follows the adventures of Gideon as he ascends to to ignite his spark and become a planeswalker. Those duels were all sufficiently challenging to me as a casual MTG player, but still winnable. I have, since then, tried to play Chandra Nalaar's story, and have yet to be able to defeat the first freaking duel. While I haven't really put much effort into testing the rest of the game? The fact that I have a Chandra Nalaar deck, which is only 40 cards, and has maybe two playsets of burn damage cards? And the rest of them are creatures? I'm kinda beginning to wonder if the developers even know what MTG is, let alone how to play it. I'll probably just delete it and pretend it doesn't exist here before long. The -only- upside to this experience thus far? Is that I didn't spend a cent on it. If I had? I'd be demanding my money back.","November 27, 2015","false","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What's even worse is you don't have a side board to help you out. This game doesn't even have the excuse of pay to win here, it's just that badly unbalanced.  I understand they're trying to engineer difficulty but when it's to a point of no progression and no way around it that's just plain unfair. What I reccomend is that the story mode be reworked, until then, I doubt I will play anything but online\n\nI have other complaints now.\nThe game feels too unbalanced and because of that I uninstalled Magic Duels...AGAIN!\nWhile the campaign requires a specific strategy in itself, which became more angering than anything to pull off. Getting right to it, I tried multiplayer after some time the multiplayer is not playable for me. No it is not a technical issue, it is a balancing issue. Everyone has better cards than me, constantly outracing and beating me and I rarely ever win if at all. The ranking system seems to be something thrown in as it imposes no actual system. Instead it just gives you a shiny number to display on your player portrait to show off.\nLastly, for someone who is busy getting actual cards for actual decks I have I will not be getting microtransactions and I will not grind hours on end just to recieve a few booster packs.\nNeedless to say, there needs to be some ACTUAL ranking system, not just badges to show how futile your efforts will be and how many single player matches you need to do to get something worthwhile to be able to even stand a chance against anything.\n\nTL;DR:Game needs major overhauling for multiplayer","December 25, 2015","false","25.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captrosha/recommended/316010/","captrosha","captrosha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captrosha/","3 products in account","As of this writing, I have spent 70 hours playing this game.  Pretty much just been playing Solo Battles once I completed the pretty short Story Quests.\n\nThe Story Quests were pretty fun and I did really enjoy those.  I wish there were a lot more of those to complete or that they added more on a regular basis.\n\nThe problems I have with this game:\nThe AI is simply "amazing" at it's ability to draw the exact cards it needs, when it needs it.  I guess they program this ability in order to make it a challenge vs a human, but come on, there has to be a better way to make an AI challenging than giving it the ungodly ability to draw any card in it's deck to overcome what is going on at the time.  I mean, just put a few Enchant Aura's on a creature to make it more powerful than what the AI has out?  Well, this AI with no cards in its hand, amazingly enough is able to draw a card that returns your creature to the top of your deck.  That is just one example of the seemingly endless ability of this AI to get the card it needs.\n\nThe Deck Shuffler is just bad.  You either get a Flood of lands or a Dearth of lands.  Can't tell you how many times I have to restart a duel just to get a decent, initial draw.  And heaven forbid if you get a draw with a few lands, some enchant aura's and no creatures.  All you will draw from that point are more lands and more enchant cards until the AI has its big guns out and you have no way to recover.\n\nThe way to obtain cards is just annoying.  You either grind coins to purchase boosters or you spend cash to buy coins to purchase boosters.  I have no problem with that with it being a F2P game per se, but I have an issue with just being able to purchase boosters.  I wish you had more purchase options.  The AI seems to have access to all manner of cards and to have to fill your decks out with 6-card boosters is just boring to the extreme.  Getting tired of going up against Planeswalkers with no way to seem to be able to obtain any myself.\n\nThere seems to be no way to back up a phase ...and the Stop Timer is annoying in that there seems to be some delay when you click it and if you are a tad bit slow, you may end up in the next Phase before you meant to get there.  There also seems to be something off during the Block and Damage dealing phase but that just may be me.\n\nWish there were an easier way to see a stack of lands than currently.  For example, if the AI has tapped several lands and I want to cast something that can target a Land, the only way to "see" what is in that stack is to hover my mouse over it and wait for it to pop-up with text.  Cumbersome.\n\nI have fun playing it most of the time, but the AI is beyond frustrating!","January 13","false","337.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Several fun aspects have been removed from previous games, such as the chanllenges, rematch, guests, and arch enemy, and have been replaced with a more... monatary system.\n\nVerses, 2v2, and the quest systems are still there but the quest system isn't as involved as before, leaving quests to be future content. As for verses it's become a choice; Play with some of the worst cards available or buy packs and hope that out of the 6 new cards you'd get something that is playable. If you go with the packs you'll quickly understand that you have to pay up some real money for digital fluff or wait, complete daily goals and get a new pack every week or so.\n\nI understand there are real people behind this game making it work and they need to eat so I guess forking over some money wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo is this game worth it's price? YES.  Is this a game I'll play more offten?

The campaign was fun and challenging but has no replayability. It takes way too long to grind gold to buy packs. The community is all but dead. Matches take longer than they should because of animations (even with all the extra stuff turned off). The biggest problem though is that when someone concedes a match to you, you're stuck playing against the AI when the match should have ended right then. I understand why people quit, I do it too to save myself time, but the match needs to end when someone concedes. One of my smaller issues with this game is milling. I think these online magic games should be trying to take the best of magic and making it a simpler, more enjoyable game. Milling decks should be left to the try-hards at Friday night magic tournaments.

Some of the daily quests are broken, the ones where you have to win a number of games using a specific color combination deck only registers victories when using a deck made in the deck builder tool\nand not when using a custom built one.\n\nThere are about 300 cards in the game making the pool of viable decks very small. Mirror match-ups are common, and the PvP matchmaking is swarmed by elf decks which are not easily countered due to the limited cards. I imagine as time goes on, if the game has a player base, more cards will be released.\n\nThe singleplayer component is short but fun. 5 campaigns with 5 missions each will take you a few hours to beat depending on RNG. Often, you will be stuck on a mission simply due to not getting any useful cards from the prebuilt deck and be forced to restart the duel. The singleplayer awards 750 gold in total which is enough for 5 booster packs.\n\nThe price of booster packs is not very high, considering how much gold is won from duels. A single booster pack costs 150 gold, a victory against a real player awards 20 gold and playing against the AI awards 5, 10 and 15 gold respectively according to the difficulty of the AI.\n\n","October 15, 2015","true","122.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And the developer seems to have gotten this down to a T at this point.\n\nI loaded up the campaign, and after rushing through all of the tutorial stuff, I got to my first matches in the campaign.\nI have not yet started any of the campaigns barr the first one, however I sincerely hope that the difficulty raises, as I did not have a single match in which I dropped below 18, but overall the game ran absolutely without a hitch. I have seen bugs and errors in other peoples reviews that I have not experienced my self, but without a more complete scope of how the game is, I cannot comment on their issues one way or another.\n\nAfter completing the campaign I went into the deck builder to see what that was like and I was pleasantly surprised to see an assisted deck builder. Of course the builder follows certain deck archetypes that arent neccesary for the higher class players, but for scrubby little noobs like me, it helped me build a deck I was comfortable in using that seemed to work well enough against the easy and medium AI.\n\nSo overall the game is good.. However there is one major bugbear that I have.. Microtransactions.\nOf course I understand this is a free to play game, and the developer needs to make money one way or another, and thats fine.\nTo get new cards through booster packs, You need gold, you can earn gold by doing the daily quests in game (In a manner not dis-similar to hearthstone) Winning matches and doing the campaign.\nMy problem would be that the rate of coin earning seems far too low to keep someone who has no intention of putting any money into the game playing to earn new cards. Infact, if I were to want to spend any money, I would want to spend it on cards in real life.\n\nTo summarise. I would say that this is a good game for beginners and newbies to MTG, and in this way it serves its purpose to teach how to play the game and to show what the game can be like.\nThe downside is a fairly restricted microtransaction for cards system, which could be fixed with tweaking to the ammount of coins you get for completing tasks, or lowering the price of boosters in game.\n\nWould recommend to New players, but am aware that there are better options for more hard core players of MTG, such as MTG Online.","October 16, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Against opponents whose decks are very effective against the utter crap you have to work with. If you know what you're doing you will win when the game chooses to give you a match that is mathematically winnable. Thing is, this happens rarely. That is not difficult, it's just terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\n- The AI is too "good". Even on the easiest setting the AI executes everything flawlessly with relentless aggression. Meaning If the game is not winnable mathematically in the beginning, it never will be, because the AI never ever makes a mistake. And will obliterate you. Again, if the game gives you a winnable game and you know what you're doing, you'll win. This once again happens rarely. That is not difficult, it's just terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\n- The Deck Wizard is the biggest joke in the history of Magic. It is a "help tool" that more or less creates a deck for you. Thing is, it creates super slow utterly useless decks with some sort idea of "strategy" that never actually materializes. It's so bad it goes as far as NOT GIVING YOU ENOUGH LAND. If you make a deck that has more black cards than red ones, it gives you significantly LESS swamp cards than mountains. And you can do nothing to change that. That is terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\n- The easiest way to gain coins, with which to buy boosters, is to do Daily Quests such as "win 4 duels with black/red archetype deck". What does "archetype" mean? It means a deck created with the Deck Wizard. So you are actually asked to win matches... that are stacked against you to begin with... with a "deck" created with a "program" that seems to be specifically designed to create the worst, slowest, most useless, borderline unplayable deck in the history of mankind. Sound fun? I can tell you it isn't. What it is, is terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\n- The card pool is too weak to make the game interesting even from that front. Also the means of getting boosters is pretty weak, since actually playing the AI is a lesson in frustration trying to get a game going that isn't unwinnable from the word go. That is terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\nThe Good :\n\n- The tutorials are pretty OK and I like the idea of giving some currency for completing them. I also found the first fifth of the campaign to be somewhat decent and fair.\n\n- One on one duels against a friend can be fun.\n\n- The actual card gameplay seems to work fine and that creates small echoes of the fun this game could have been.\n\n\nConclusion :\n\nA game such as this has lots of potential. If the campaign and solo battle duels would be better designed to avoid constant mathematically unwinnable matches and the card pool would be widened, it would be a much MUCH better game. Also the Deck Wizard needs to be either fixed to work properly and give much more freedom, or be removed completely and let the daily quests be completed with user-made custom decks that don't involve the wizard. Also I have to ask. Who is this game for? Pro players will scoff at the limited card pool and the bare-bones approach in general. Newcomers will learn the basics from this but will be utterly turned off Magic by the aforementioned constant unwinnable starts to duels against the flawlessly murdering AI. How does that help anyone get interested in Magic, I ask?\n\nIf you absolutely need a free option to play duels against your friend, or you want to go through tutorials to learn the basics of the game, this might be for you. Otherwise I can't recommend this until all the mentioned problems are fixed, which would require essentially rebuilding most of the game. Do not spend money on this at least.\n\nEDIT : I have to update this with my current experience. At some point, I'm assuming after opening something like 15 boosters, the game _always_ creates a deck for the AI that has a planeswalker. Regardless of whether or not you have even one in your collection and regardless what sort of utter useless crap you have to use to get your archetype daily quest done. Also the game cheats. It can have two Legendary Creatures of the same name in it's collection. You can't. The game creates decks for the AI that you can't build. I know in rules of magic you CAN have 2 Legendarys of the same name in a deck as long as they are not on the battlefield at the same time, but what I mean is you can have ONLY ONE in this game, and in the last duels game _in your collection_. Also this leads me to suspect that the game creates the AI decks on a turn by turn basis. I Countered the Legendary Sphinx Allhammaret in my match to the graveyard, and 3 turns later the AI played another   Allhammaret. The only way this makes any sense is that the game simply generated a new Legendary of the same name into the deck the moment I countered the first one, since making a deck that has two of same Legendarys makes zero sense otherwise.

Another weird thing is that you can have as many legendaries in your deck as you want now, why did they change that? The difficulties for the AI is completely backwards, Hard is so easy you almost cant lose and easy is suprisingly hard. A good thing is this game has controller support, but every time i try and use it it locks up and i have to do something with the mouse to get it out of the lock. Basically the game is complete trash as of now, but i do see potential after ALOT of updates to fix the countless problems with the main selling point of this game (two headed giant) and they allow you to earn more gold daily or make it quicker to earn gold (i understand its free to play so its to encourage you to spend money on the game but the pricing for the booster packs are way too high for such a buggy game (estimate ~$60 to buy enough boosters to unlock all the card when older magic games go for way cheaper))","September 6, 2015","false","136.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Against opponents whose decks are very effective against the utter crap you have to work with. If you know what you're doing you will win when the game chooses to give you a match that is mathematically winnable. Thing is, this happens rarely. That is not difficult, it's just terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\n- The AI is too "good". Even on the easiest setting the AI executes everything flawlessly with relentless aggression. Meaning If the game is not winnable mathematically in the beginning, it never will be, because the AI never ever makes a mistake. And will obliterate you. Again, if the game gives you a winnable game and you know what you're doing, you'll win. This once again happens rarely. That is not difficult, it's just terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\n- The Deck Wizard is the biggest joke in the history of Magic. It is a "help tool" that more or less creates a deck for you. Thing is, it creates super slow utterly useless decks with some sort idea of "strategy" that never actually materializes. It's so bad it goes as far as NOT GIVING YOU ENOUGH LAND. If you make a deck that has more black cards than red ones, it gives you significantly LESS swamp cards than mountains. And you can do nothing to change that. That is terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\n- The easiest way to gain coins, with which to buy boosters, is to do Daily Quests such as "win 4 duels with black/red archetype deck". What does "archetype" mean? It means a deck created with the Deck Wizard. So you are actually asked to win matches... that are stacked against you to begin with... with a "deck" created with a "program" that seems to be specifically designed to create the worst, slowest, most useless, borderline unplayable deck in the history of mankind. Sound fun? I can tell you it isn't. What it is, is terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\n- The card pool is too weak to make the game interesting even from that front. Also the means of getting boosters is pretty weak, since actually playing the AI is a lesson in frustration trying to get a game going that isn't unwinnable from the word go. That is terrible-♥♥♥ game design.\n\nThe Good :\n\n- The tutorials are pretty OK and I like the idea of giving some currency for completing them. I also found the first fifth of the campaign to be somewhat decent and fair.\n\n- One on one duels against a friend can be fun.\n\n- The actual card gameplay seems to work fine and that creates small echoes of the fun this game could have been.\n\n\nConclusion :\n\nA game such as this has lots of potential. If the campaign and solo battle duels would be better designed to avoid constant mathematically unwinnable matches and the card pool would be widened, it would be a much MUCH better game. Also the Deck Wizard needs to be either fixed to work properly and give much more freedom, or be removed completely and let the daily quests be completed with user-made custom decks that don't involve the wizard. Also I have to ask. Who is this game for? Pro players will scoff at the limited card pool and the bare-bones approach in general. Newcomers will learn the basics from this but will be utterly turned off Magic by the aforementioned constant unwinnable starts to duels against the flawlessly murdering AI. How does that help anyone get interested in Magic, I ask?\n\nIf you absolutely need a free option to play duels against your friend, or you want to go through tutorials to learn the basics of the game, this might be for you. Otherwise I can't recommend this until all the mentioned problems are fixed, which would require essentially rebuilding most of the game. Do not spend money on this at least.\n\nEDIT : I have to update this with my current experience. At some point, I'm assuming after opening something like 15 boosters, the game _always_ creates a deck for the AI that has a planeswalker. Regardless of whether or not you have even one in your collection and regardless what sort of utter useless crap you have to use to get your archetype daily quest done. Also the game cheats. It can have two Legendary Creatures of the same name in it's collection. You can't. The game creates decks for the AI that you can't build. I know in rules of magic you CAN have 2 Legendarys of the same name in a deck as long as they are not on the battlefield at the same time, but what I mean is you can have ONLY ONE in this game, and in the last duels game _in your collection_. Also this leads me to suspect that the game creates the AI decks on a turn by turn basis. I Countered the Legendary Sphinx Allhammaret in my match to the graveyard, and 3 turns later the AI played another   Allhammaret. The only way this makes any sense is that the game simply generated a new Legendary of the same name into the deck the moment I countered the first one, since making a deck that has two of same Legendarys makes zero sense otherwise.

You earn little currency for the level of bull i have to play through, and not to mention that the game is BROKEN AF. Please please please fix this game, because its not enjoyable when you have to restart every ♥♥♥♥ing match 100 times in order to get a playable hand, the shuffling mechanic sucks for the user, ooh but the AI always gets perfect hands, good land advantage, card advantage, and of course they all have OP cards while you get the equivalent of 3 booster packs, which is nothing you can work with.

I just can't recommend it for anyone that actually plays the real thing.\n\nGood\n\n-MTG anytime, by yourself or against a random player online\n\n-Possible to unlock all the cards for free\n\n-Nifty ability to stop the timer and do what you want in response, sort of like in real life (assuming you're not playing a complete jerk) you can tap lands and do something\n\n-Origins is a pretty good card set to start with\n\n-The Quest system. Pretty fun, gives background on the planeswalkers, has enough challenge to make it enjoyable without being super frustrating. Also teaches the game mechanics very well.\n\nBad\n-The online MM is TERRIBLE. Someone leaves? Penalty for not wanting to play out against the AI. Someone drops? Penalty. The wait time is rather long (at least it has been for me) and prepare to get wrecked by people who have dropped the money to unlock as many cards as they can.\n\n-The guided deck builder is just plain bad. Instead of putting up a bunch of dreck, how about providing a list of one drops, two drops, three drops, etc and saying "Hey, you should have this many of this kind of drop."\n\n-The grind to unlock cards. Seriously this right here is killing me. I don't expect it to be a waltz through the park but it's so agonizingly slow and the quest system just doesn't work right. The need to use the awful deck builder to do half of them makes it even worse, as custom built decks (y'know, ones that aren't complete crap) don't count.\n\n-The AI in solo battles. Again, not expecting anything to roll over and die but it seems very much like it already has all the cards unlocked, gets perfect draws 90% of the time, and is overwhelmingly blue. Blue is for people who have no friends and smell of wee. Not just whining here though, the AI really is quite bad at the game. I can kind of understand giving them certain advantages, but maybe teaching it when to trade, when to flunge, and when to cast certain spells (do not drop your +1/+1 all creature AFTER the attack step for example).\n\n-The turn order can be kind of screwy and this leads to some frustrating situations. Abott of Kerral Keep is completely unusuable, as it just exiles, and unless you have another card to cast AFTER you drop it you can never drop the exiled card.\n\n-The button positioning. Put the Skip Attack button UNDER the attack all button. DO NOT have a big finish button for graveyard/triggered/death effects that cancels the effect, label it PASS or CANCEL or LET EFFECT RESOLVE FOR CURRENT RESULT. That gets really old, really fast, especially if you're in the middle of something and you misclick.\n\n\nMost of these are based on a crack packer's attitude, but some of them really should be addressed. The wonky quest system for instance. If I build a Black/White deck that doesn't suck, let it count towards the Black/White victories.\n\nIf you've never played MTG and have no desire to get into the physical game, give this a shot and have some fun. If you do crack packs, this will hold your interest for a little while but Wizards will get your money anyway and it's not going to be through this.","September 29, 2015","false","27.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As it stands right now I have to NOT recomend it. I'll explain briefly why:\n\n- The card collection available kinda sucks.\n\n- In-game cards cost as much as its real life counter-parts\n\nThe free alternative is getting gold from quests / story mode / battle (PvP or pvAI).\n\n- Story mode has a set amount of gold to make. Basically you get 1 booster per story and there's 1 story per color. In this story mode you're given a pre build deck to use.\n\n- Battle mode is pretty much a drag. The easy battles against AI award 5 gold each (150g per booster). 10g for medium and 15g for hard. The bad part is: your starting collection is not enough to make a deck that has a decent chance against medium or higher. You only get gold if you win. PvP has the same problem.\n\n- You get a daily quest everyday. This combined with battle mode could be a good alternative, but the problem is most quests are "win 2 games using a <<SPECIFIC DECK ARCHETYPE>> deck" and your starting collection doesn't allow you to even build most decks and the decks you can build pratty much awful.\n\nSo I would recommend playing the real thing.","September 28, 2015","false","13.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I really, really did. Here are my experiences of roughly an hour before giving up and playing something better:\n\n- Try to go into Battle Mode or the card shop to see prices\n- Anything except story mode tells me "be Gideon, you know you love Gideon, everyone loves Gideon, it'll be hard if you haven't tried Gideon."\n- Think "okay, I'll play chapter 1 of story to get some coins and maybe have a somewhat decent deck."\n- Get stuck in dumb, slow, boring, babby tutorial for dumb babbies.\n- Once it gets to the blocking tutorial, I am given one tapped creature and am told to survive this turn. Opponent kills me every time because I have nothing to block against.\n- Restart\n- Now tutorial works as normal\n- Do some story battles, boring and easy.\n- Get to a new tutorial on enchantments, tells me to win this turn. I have an enchantment that gives +1/1 to all my creatures\n- No creatures\n- Curse loudly\n- Restart again\n- Finally get to last battle of Gideon's campaign\n- First turn cannot play land or advance to next phase, get the error "The game is busy." U wot m8?\n- Wait 5 min, finally the game decides to let me play\n- I am just about to win, opponent has 2 life, no creatures, and I attack\n- Game crashed\n- The CPU literally flipped the table on me, took its cards, and went home\n- Uninstalled and never looking back","October 6, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I had my doubts after getting one of the plainswalkers game in the past but still positively approached the game.\nMe and my friend wanted so badly to get a duel off as we played in real life few years back using some sets bought for cheap but still had alot of fun. Well of course you cant. Not from the start a least. You guessed it, you have to unlock it first. Yep - you have to unlock multiplayer games in a multiplayers card game.\nBut thats just a tip of the iceberg really. There is so many things that are bad about this game that its just impossibile do concive how a game like this could have been released at all.\n\nI wont make it to list all of the things that wrong with this game but heres just a few from the top of my head:\nOne of the worst Menu systems I have seen im my 20 years of gaming. I was surprised that I can be that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about menu but then I realise that its just plain insult.\nWanna play anything? You HAVE to play what game wants you to play first. You wanna skip tutorials cause you played 10 years of MTG? Well to bad for you, you cant.\nConnection to steam cloud or any network capability of this game should be reffered to every time you look for a methaphor of an absolut worst one ever implemented into a game. You literally get disconnected all the time losing your wins (dont register), losing achievements (i dont care about those but some ppl do), card pack and lots of more annoying stuff.\nDeck builder is so bad I cannot even describe it. It is the most useless, uninnovative, annoying piece of crap my sore eyes have ever glanced at. Honestly you need to witness it to understand how irritating can just putting 60 cards togather in a deck be. Its beyond atrocious.\nPack of course have 6 cars in them - yes you heard right - not 15 as in MTG. And to get one pack you need to do some griding as well. All in all you would need to grind alottttt to not spend money If you wish to have all the cards.\nYou can get some gold (in game money) with quests daily or weekly but guess what? Yes thats right they bug out to so sometimes you get the gold, sometimes you dont. Like everything in this game, quests are also boring and mostly consist of getting wins with decks that game have created for you.\nYou play multiplayer. You crash your oponent. He concides. What happens? He gets swapped for AI. This has to be the biggest WTF of card game history. You are literally forced to waste time and play the rest o the game with an AI. Best of it is you can lose to the AI and not get points. I think there is nobel prize winner on this game programmers team and all people who played this game have a special place in our hearts for this guy - its just not warm and fuzzy.\nI was going to name PROS but I hardly can? I tought maybe the campaigns but those force you to do tutorials for HASTE or TREMPLE which for me was so boring I couldnt take it as a positive. I thought I can give a game system a pass but after first strike sometimes didnt work (it just didnt, sometimes yes sometimes not) I cant even do that.\n\nJust dont touch this game. You will want to like it but it will just ♥♥♥♥ you off and dissapoint you to the point you cant take it anymore. I played maybe 10 hours last 5-6 cause i really wanted to give it a chance.\n\nIt is disgusting.\nIt is bad.\nIt is broken.\nDo not get near this game.","September 23, 2015","false","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is no skip option in the tutorials for people who play magic and the gameplay is very slow. Each turn takes forever. Next thing is coins. This is magic not farmville, why did they suddenly add coins? Another thing is in game play why is there no chat? Are we really that irresposible that we cant chat with our teammates in double headed giant or chat with out opponents? Not only is there no chat but DHG the cards and gameplay are so small its hard to see the cards being played. Now onto the story mode.

I usually like these games, I also rarely write reviews, and when I do it is purely for reccomendations.  This game... however, has caused me to make a exception to that trend.  Most MTG games are fairly straigth forward, and as with most of the games, an eventual purchase is expected to fully enjoy the game.  Either you need to pay intially to play the games, or you will have to purchase some cards/booster packs to play beyond the standard pre-made packs.  This game... however, advertises itself as truly free, and then berates you with annoying totorials, oddly placed buttons that often result in misclicks, and a very liberal use of language.  I began playing and went through the very lengthy, and quite tedius tutorial/story mode because it provides you with enough ingame currency to purchase a few booster packs.  This tutorial is the epitomy of "well duh" and takes you through some rediculously obvious and self explanatory game mechanics in a fashion that requires you to constantly load and swap out of your main tutorial into a secondary tutorial scenario that forcefeeds you mechanics as simplistic as casting an instant spell, using a creature ability, using a "tap creature" ability... and many other things that truly shouldn't need clarification.  In fact, there are a couple abilities that could do with a bit of explaining, but they actually seemed to have changed the rules (you can now tap a tapped creature.. which doesn't seem relavent, but it used to come into play a lot) and leave out those tutorials until you coincidentally run into them during an actual match..  but back to the main issues.  The starter pack is quite possibly one of the worst starters you could possibly get.  I'm actually wondering if it is truly random, but many of the other reviews back up the fact that it just seems horrible.  You get virtually no cards with any form of synergy with each other and then must grind very slowly against AI opponents with incredibly simple but well synergized decks in order to get enough coins to buy more boosters in hopes that you'll get some of the missing pieces to form a real starter deck to then farm for an actual PvP deck over what I am assuming is the better part of a half millenia.  You will generally win 1 out of every 5-10 duels vs these AI decks simply due to the fact that you have a random assortment of low strength spells and monsters with abilities that do not work well together (I.E. A card that boosts its effects for every creature of that type in play, and they only give you 1, or a card combo that allows you to farm up all of your enchant spells, which would be incredibly powerful IF you actually had any enchants that would impact the outcome of the game or provided more than a +1 +2 bonus)  Then we get to the quests...  There are player base quests where all players of the game work towards a goal such as beating the final tutorial opponent 5,000,000 times (last I saw we were at 5,004,531 although there was no actual payout yet for some reason) which would be cool only it doesn't seem to work...  and then you get individual quests which request very specific color types or goals to be carried out in "Duels."  Now personally I'm still trying to figure out WTF a "Duel" is to the makers of this game, because the AI battles are actually called duels.. and yet they don't seem to give you credit for them for your individual quests.  I found this odd because the 5,000,000 win quest also specifically mentioned winning "Duels" only in that instance it WAS against an AI opponent.  I guess this could mean that you have to win vs another player, but this is completely impossible without spending about $80-120 on the in-game boosters, which are roughly $7-8 a piece.  I can't fathom why they would sell them for so much in a game that has no actual card or re-sell value, especially when their largest Free-To-Play MTG game actually sells them for about the same price AND has the added value of allowing you to exchange these cards for the real life physical copies should you gather an entire set of them...  Plus that game has every MTG card in existence in it and also allows you to play reasonably against other players for free, or pay a small fee to get a workable set of pre-chosen cards from which you can assemble your own deck from.  If you want to spend some time on a free MTG game I highly suggest looking elsewhere at the far more successful iterations of this franchise.

You can only earn so much gold from wins every day and the cap for this is WAY TOO LOW, also you have to restart the game to see the gold you got from challenges every time you complete one.

Don't tempt fate, don't think "eh, maybe the glitches they're talking about won't affect me, I'll give it a try", which is exactly what I thought.\n\nPresentation's really nice, the game's very well made, all things considered - gameplay has its quirks and is vaguely slow, but works as well as one would expect of digital MtG. Game feels restrictive, though, because apparently the only cards in the game are from the Origins set, which leaves you with about 25-30 cards of each color.\nPlayed through the first campaign, great little introductory matches (if a bit exhasperating if one already knows what the game's like). Got three free boosters from finishing the campaign, bought two more boosters with the quest cash, opened them all, got quite a few nice cards. Last one I opened was Outland Colossus, and I immediately remembered the review in which some guy said he lost his brand-new Colossus to server ♥♥♥♥ups.\nAfter a little prayer, I closed the game and went to bed. Opening it again the next day, I saw the Colossus was still there. Entirely relieved, I went to make me a few decks to ♥♥♥♥ around with the AI to get used to the game.\n\nAnd then I noticed the Mythic Rare I got in one of the packs, Jace, was AWOL, as was Hixus, another rare, along with apparently all of the cards I got in the boosters in which both of these cards came from. I actually still have the "get a mythic rare" achievement, despite not having any mythic rares at all at this moment.\n\nThat seals it for me, I'm not playing this game any longer, and I strongly encourage everyone to not play it at least until this particular issue is 100% guaranteed to be solved. I will NOT deign to waste an entire afternoon winning matches to buy a booster that may or may not cease to exist whenever the server feels like it.

Spreading out those purchases will make it cost more.\n\nThe duels of the planeswalkers games have pay to win too, but it's hardly as necessary as unlocking cards in dotp takes a fraction of the time it does in this game. In dotp you pay one small fee for the game, maybe one more even smaller one for an expansion, then just have fun for several hours learning the starting cards and after a day or 2 you'll already have them all. In Magic Duels Origins, it'll take weeks.\n\nEDIT: Also the story mode forces you to use premade ♥♥♥♥♥♥ decks, with no customization. So even if you play perfectly whether you win or lose a match is 100% chance. Sometimes (or rather, most times) there's just nothing you can do because your deck sucks, making the story take longer than it would otherwise simply because you're forced to lose at random. This also makes the card rewards from the story mode hardly worth the time.\n\nTL;DR:\nDuels of the Planeswalkers is a small one time fee for the game and you can quickly unlock all cards.\nMagic Duels Origins is free to play but unlocking all cards takes way wayyy too long to encourage you to spend AT LEAST 80 bucks to unlock all cards instead.\n\nAs with any TCG, it's going to be pay to win. Skip this scam of a game and just wait for the next duels of the planeswalkers game, where you can avoid pay to win by simply playing for a few hours with the cards you start with.","December 11, 2015","false","51.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

Much like it's predecessors, Magic Duels it a closed environment with the tutorial/story mode presented as the tutorial on how to play M:tG. It does several things well, however there are a couple game breaking bugs which the player has zero control over.\n\nOverall the system is improved, however they have shifted to an always online server requirement in order to have any progress recorded. I personally believe that this always online initiative that is occurring is a negative step.  In the little time that I have been playing Magic Duels, the server has gone down repeatedly, which has dragged the game to a standstill. In fact as a player any progress you make while not connected to the server doesn't register, so if there are rewards for the game you player, you are effectively punished for not being online and connected to the server, as all rewards are forfeit. The rewards that are forfeited are the rewards which grant you access to additional cards.  This is a poor facsimile of the real game which has its roots in offline play. While I appreciate the spirited attempt to bring the game into the digital age, this iteration of the game also fails the true test of the game.\n\nIn comparison to the real game, you must work hard for "booster packs" which unlike the real game are only 6 cards, with no guarantee of a rare. This feels rather insulting if you have ever had experience with the real game.\n\nThat said, the basics of gameplay are there, and as an introduction to M:tG its a good way to learn the initial gameplay and get a glimpse into the possibilities of what the real game holds, but it never succeeds in truly enlightening the player.\n\nDon't waste your bandwidth or your time with this game.","August 2, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've played since The Dark was out when I was in highschool. I've watched the wonderful evolution of the videogame until.... the debacle that was 2015. Now we come to this. Sigh.\nSo, what's wrong with this game? Too long a list. I wish I was exagerating. Lets hit the main ones.\n1. The list of bugs and glitches is overwhelming and literally makes it unplayable the majority of the time. We are talking "fatal error" that shuts the game down. We are talking "can not connect to server" thus not being able to earn cards or even save any progress. We are talking even if those two game enders don't hit you, that there is a daily cap of 400 gold (2 and 2/3 packs of six cards) that when you hit it, you are unable to earn more for ...well they say 24 hours, but the truth is... unknown. Because the reset glitches and doesn't come. So I'm currently locked from earning cards. Daily quests aren't reseting either. Can't earn it there. Just glitch glitch glitch. More glitch than game.\n2. Here's what really bugs me loving magic as I do; They copied (failing horribly) another popular TTCG's format INSTEAD of providing us their own unique and usually innovative game. I don't want the champion to immitate the rookie! I want to see him outshine it in every way. So disapointed in you wizards.\n3. I'm not a big fan of F2P. Why? This right here. Glitch after glitch and people saying "well its free you shouldn't expect more, just give them time". Handing me free literal crap does not make me enjoy the squish between my fingers. And I give you the same look at that to the people talking wonders of F2P. Sideways head-cok, What are you on? Stepping in Dookie and proclaiming it has Substance does Not a philosopher make. Nor does releasing it as a game.\n4.This? This is supposed to "teach" new players magic? Really? You took out UPKEEP phase! ummmm...yeah. Do I need to say anything about how limiting this will be in the future? Really? Its a time of powerful consequences and powerful bonus's and powerful tricks. Who doesn't remeber that Green upkeep bounce deck from 2013 with Roaring Primadox? Good times there.\n\nSigh, just... Sigh. I expected better from you WOTC. Not too much. Just better. I can't believe after the 2015 debacle you brought us this polished Dook and proclaimed "See, we listen to you". No, No you really didn't. I will be happy to ammend this review in the future. But you've still let us all down. Twice now. This doesn't get forgotten. Now... now sadly I don't think I can ever get excited for any future release. All I will feel is anxiety over how you plan on kicking your own groin this time.

If you have played paper magic, then this game still is not for you, its like paper magic only with out the social aspect and some how more P2W.\n\nOk so I said I would change this review if the servers ever started working, and they have. I still cant recommend this game though.\n\nIts just not worth your time.\n\nThe game is a supposed to be a digital trading card game, but it is not, there is no way to trade cards with other players. This alone wouldn't be that bad, but the only way to get more cards is through opening packs, which give you random cards. See the issue? You have no control over what types of decks you can make, the only way to build a specific deck list is to open packs until you have unlocked every card in the game (132 packs exactly).\n\nWell that shouldn't be an issue, right? you can unlock packs with out paying. all you need to do is win games against other players. Right?  Wrong you will win a few games against players who haven't spent money. Since you have won a few games your rank will go up, then you will suddenly start getting matched against players who's decks are loaded with the strongest cards in the game, and then you will stop winning.\n\nNow all this wouldn't even be so bad if you could just spend $10 and get a fairly good deck list and start winning again. How ever you have no control over what cards you will get with that $10. If RNGesus doesn't smile on you and give you strong cards that also have synergy and are in the same colors then you will still be playing at a huge disadvantage.\n\nThrow in that MTGO is still a thing and I just cant see a reason to play this game. sure MTGO is pay 2 win, but at least there you could buy the deck you wanted not just dump money into a slot machine. Also there are tournaments in MTGO, many formats and cards from every set, not just one boring core set.\n\nA large number of players are having issues even getting the game to work at all, I am not one of them, but before you download be aware that you might be.\n\nThere is also the issue with multiplayer. If your opponent forfeits you are forced to finish the game out against an AI opponent, MTG can already be kind of tedious if you need to actually get someone's life to 0 even in a one sided stomp, and this game has you wait through a lot of timers (I see why they are needed, so players can react to things on the stacks). The end result is that you will spend a lot of time in games that are already over.\n\nI guess a player who is trying to learn magic might want to try this game just since it has some nice tutorials, but as a game is not fun in and of its self.","July 30, 2015","false","11.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You and your arch enemy (everyone is arch enemy online) sit yourselves down and get an imaginary board between you, where he got his side and you got yours. Then you each got a collection (that you build yourself) of 60 chess pieces, and draw seven random ones. Then you get to beat with them on your opponent, while he beats back. The fun part is, put into chess terms, that you should always try to kill as many opposing pieces with as few of yours as you can. Here comes mind games, trickery, epic turns of events, and conceptually this game goes so much farther than chess. Would you like to play a piece that wipes the whole board, leaving nothing? What about stealing one your opponent's pieces and beating him with it till he succumbs in a pool of tears? Or how about combining a strategy where you got huge crowds of tiny nasty critter pieces that don't really care for whatever strategy your opponent is running, and just overrun him or her, in a true zerg-swarm style?\n\nThese are just a few examples of things you can do. You know what I am thinking about right now? Building a strategy entirely based around tentacles. Giant crabs. Weird fish. Entangling. That's right.\n\nMagic Duels is one of many Magic games, and this one serves best as an introduction. It's free, and it's got a nice short tutorial that teaches you all the basics. In fact this game is where it is easier to start if you are interested in trying to see whether this is a game you would like to play in real life.\n\nBut it goes beyond that, although the depths of it aren't that exciting. It gives you a pool of cards (the pieces) to play with at the beginning, but if you want more, you have to purchase packs of random cards (which means that sometimes you will open something epic, like a big tentacle creature, and other times you will open something really boring, like a non-tentacle creature). You can pay real cash for them, but you also can do various daily game-play oriented quests to earn them shiny coins. But it is a slow progress: you will end up buying a booster pack maximum every third or fourth day, giving you like 12 new random cards each week. It's not so exciting, really.\n\nIf you are familiar with magic, this game only includes the newest sets: 2015 Magic set, and Battle for Zendikar. Oath of the Gatewatch set is set to come sometime during March or April.\n\nSo yeah, I recommend this game because it gives a nice intro to Magic the Gathering. It's very basic, there is no trading, no other game modes but simple duels against other people or A.I.","February 4","true","27.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Your deck from the start is absolute garbage and half the cards you get aren't even playable in your own deck. Your campaign deck is updated everytime but they don't tell you which crads have been replaced and which cards have been added, you can't see the deck you play you just have to rely on chance I guess.\n\nAfter the single player(wait was that it, so short) you can play the onlkine mode(if it doesnt crash every single time). They brought back two-headed giant thats for some reason doesnt award quests and where you can't communicate with your own teammate for some reason and you can't tell if your teammate has dropped and been replaced by AI, since you CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH THEM.(seriously wtf).\n\nThe time it takes for you to build up some sort of reasonable card collection is just bad, the quest give wayy too little gold, the packs cost too much and the packs only have 6 cards. IRL magic packs contain 15 cards and while they're usually just for drafting this is way faster. There is also no way of trading in any way, every TCG online or IRL should have this.\n\nI honestely believe that this had so much potential, both for seasoned players and as an introduction to new players but this game is so bad I would never admit to playing it.","January 8","false","110.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This, along with the specific card pool makes Duels in essence a new format.\n\nWhen opening packs, you can't get more copies of a card if you already have the limit of that card. This means as you get more cards you don't want, the chance of getting cards you do want increases.\n\nA reasonably nice interface. While it's quite clunky in a few places, at least it looks better than Magic: Online and Cockatrice.\n\nAvatars. While some people ignore this, you can give each of your decks a face. I can't help myself from coming up with some personality to go with the avatars I choose, but that may be just me. I've also found the majority of players who settle for the default avatar play RDW. An impatient colour for impatient people, I guess.\n\n\nThings I don't like:\n\nVery short timer. When anything is put onto the stack, you have about 3 seconds to press the spacebar (which works about 9 times out of 10) or click the pause button (which works about 6 times out of 10). If you miss the timer, or your method of pausing fails for whatever reason, tough luck.\n\nVery sensitive casting. When you click a card, you'll play it immediately. If you miss-click, or you've played too much Hearthstone, tough luck.\n\nGrinding speed. One pack of six cards costs 150 gold. Every game you win nets you 20 gold. This along with the daily quests means you can get a pack every 5 - 7 games. While this is a little slow, it's not that bad and I believe the micro-transactions are justified seeing as this is a free game and all.\n\nNo chat. This could be there too stop harassment, so there's no chance people new to magic would be driven away by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or salty people on a loosing streak. I haven't played 2HG myself yet, but if theirs no chat there as well, then it would be nigh impossible to strategize with your partner unless you know each other personally can  communicate in some other way.\n\n\nWho I would recommend this game to:\n\nIf you are new to magic, then I would recommend Duels. It's free, it's pretty good at teaching you the rules and getting you into the game. Clear descriptions, the "Deck Wizard" that lets you pick the type of deck you want to play and guides you through building it, and no-one calling you names, due to the lack of chat.\n\nIf you already play the magic, but mostly casual "Kitchen Table Magic", then I would not recommend Duels. You would probably not enjoy the grinding you have to do in order to get access to cards, nor the lack of a chat system.\n\nIf your already quite experience with Magic, then I would recommend Duels. Rather than see it as another duels game, the ranked 1v1 matches should lead you to see it as another format. Try it and see if you enjoy it, it is free after all.","January 14","true","67.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm a big fan of the trading card game but rarely play because of cost, and have played other computer based TCGs like Hearthstone and Scrolls to try a fill that void.  If you are in the same boat and hoping that this will feel like playing Magic for real, you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nThe gameply is incredibly slow.  Magic is a complex game because it requires interactions on your opponents turn.  In order to capture this in a game, you have pauses between every card played, every phase, and so on.  I get that this is necessary for PvP duels, but do I really have to sit through it all when playing NPCs in Story mode and the like?\n\nWhile we are on the topic of story mode, let me just say how frustrating of an experience it is.  In addition to being incredibly slow, you have to play with a prebuilt deck that you can't even examine outside of duel.  Not only are these decks complete rubbish (and significantly worse than your NPC oppenent's), you have no idea what cards are included in them.  Good luck forming strategies like that.\n\nAnd the icing on this horrible, horrible cake is the game performance.  I have a decent laptop that can run popular games like League of Legends, CS:GO, and Skyrim on low to medium settings with around 60 fps.  I rarely exceed 14 in this game.  The interface is really bizarre.  The game table is massive, but the cards are tiny.  The default option for the englarged card view is to scroll up on the card.

Some time if your friends dont crush you out right' it's simply because your friends are not cold blooded computer and dont unleash their full power at you. Where im going with this, is that AI are NEVER gonna be perfect and it is good that way, they are not too tought where you never gonna win a fight and they are not too easy so that you are no just wacking some brainless virtual opponents.\n\n6- The only sad thing about all this is that in 2HG you dont get any money even when you play against real opponents i see why in 1v1 when you invite someone to play you dont get any, that is to prevent farming without playing but 2HG i dont really get it ... hell even only 5G would be fun it would reward those who invite their friends to play the game with them, to give those guys a small candy\n\nAnd last point, no chat is a good thing in this game because trolls are so toxic and in this kind of game it make your play time really bad to play against those, and we all know that out there we have WAY more trolls that good guys, I would had one in 2HG with your ally but it is not game breaker\n\nI hope my review will help you see past all those bad review because some ppl can't enjoy anything in life even for FREE\nThank you, and have a good day","November 19, 2015","true","188.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The new commitment to doing videos explaining decisions and curating the cards available to provide the best possible experience is a really important step, and encourages me to think that they're really going to support and improve this experience over the long term.\n\nI would recommend it as an intro product to anyone who wants to learn Magic, and if you like it, it's definitely worth paying for packs.\n\nWith that said, the game has had a rough start, with a lot of bugs that should have been caught in Beta. Being tied to the paper Magic set release allows you to get in on the hype (Innistrad looks amazing!), but it also means that the quality sometimes suffers due to a fairly punishing schedule by digital standards.

Your deck from the start is absolute garbage and half the cards you get aren't even playable in your own deck. Your campaign deck is updated everytime but they don't tell you which crads have been replaced and which cards have been added, you can't see the deck you play you just have to rely on chance I guess.\n\nAfter the single player(wait was that it, so short) you can play the onlkine mode(if it doesnt crash every single time). They brought back two-headed giant thats for some reason doesnt award quests and where you can't communicate with your own teammate for some reason and you can't tell if your teammate has dropped and been replaced by AI, since you CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH THEM.(seriously wtf).\n\nThe time it takes for you to build up some sort of reasonable card collection is just bad, the quest give wayy too little gold, the packs cost too much and the packs only have 6 cards. IRL magic packs contain 15 cards and while they're usually just for drafting this is way faster. There is also no way of trading in any way, every TCG online or IRL should have this.\n\nI honestely believe that this had so much potential, both for seasoned players and as an introduction to new players but this game is so bad I would never admit to playing it.","January 8","false","110.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It  is a lot of fun for free, especially if you have ever played with the Magic the Gathering cards back in the day but no longer have anyone near who likes to play. I think the easy and middle levels are pretty similar.  There are so many delightful  perks, like that extra coins are awarded daily for the first battle with a live rather than AI opponent. I especially like that the game awards no cards one may not use (redundant beyond the number allowed in a deck, for example) and enjoyed collecting my first full set. The quests + versus bonus coins are a good way to earn a booster set every day or two.","December 24, 2015","true","137.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This, along with the specific card pool makes Duels in essence a new format.\n\nWhen opening packs, you can't get more copies of a card if you already have the limit of that card. This means as you get more cards you don't want, the chance of getting cards you do want increases.\n\nA reasonably nice interface. While it's quite clunky in a few places, at least it looks better than Magic: Online and Cockatrice.\n\nAvatars. While some people ignore this, you can give each of your decks a face. I can't help myself from coming up with some personality to go with the avatars I choose, but that may be just me. I've also found the majority of players who settle for the default avatar play RDW. An impatient colour for impatient people, I guess.\n\n\nThings I don't like:\n\nVery short timer. When anything is put onto the stack, you have about 3 seconds to press the spacebar (which works about 9 times out of 10) or click the pause button (which works about 6 times out of 10). If you miss the timer, or your method of pausing fails for whatever reason, tough luck.\n\nVery sensitive casting. When you click a card, you'll play it immediately. If you miss-click, or you've played too much Hearthstone, tough luck.\n\nGrinding speed. One pack of six cards costs 150 gold. Every game you win nets you 20 gold. This along with the daily quests means you can get a pack every 5 - 7 games. While this is a little slow, it's not that bad and I believe the micro-transactions are justified seeing as this is a free game and all.\n\nNo chat. This could be there too stop harassment, so there's no chance people new to magic would be driven away by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or salty people on a loosing streak. I haven't played 2HG myself yet, but if theirs no chat there as well, then it would be nigh impossible to strategize with your partner unless you know each other personally can  communicate in some other way.\n\n\nWho I would recommend this game to:\n\nIf you are new to magic, then I would recommend Duels. It's free, it's pretty good at teaching you the rules and getting you into the game. Clear descriptions, the "Deck Wizard" that lets you pick the type of deck you want to play and guides you through building it, and no-one calling you names, due to the lack of chat.\n\nIf you already play the magic, but mostly casual "Kitchen Table Magic", then I would not recommend Duels. You would probably not enjoy the grinding you have to do in order to get access to cards, nor the lack of a chat system.\n\nIf your already quite experience with Magic, then I would recommend Duels. Rather than see it as another duels game, the ranked 1v1 matches should lead you to see it as another format. Try it and see if you enjoy it, it is free after all.","January 14","true","67.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This game changes magic fundamentals. Nowhere in magic is it a rule that you can only play 3 uncommons, 2 rares and 1 mythic of a certain type. Either the makers of duels are trying to suggest here that the paper card game is broken or they are suggesting that players are too stupid to make good decks if they're not given certain limitations. Just stop it, I've not gotten to know a single magic player on a personal level who didn't dislike this.\n\n2. Lack of cards to start with. Now first I'd complain about the shallow pool of cards to pick from overall, but I realise getting the game to work with a ton of different cards takes time and effort. What I can not understand however is why the pool of cards you start out with is so shallow you have difficulties creating a decent themed deck. Honestly with the promise of this game being the last game and that they would only build upon this game in the future, they should have the players start out at least with all of the common and uncommon cards in the set. Just give the players some tools to work with here to make the grind any fun.\n\n3. The grind and the deck wizard. I was surprised to see I wasn't getting any quest completion when I won duels, then I googled the issue and discovered you only get quest completion if you use the terrible deck wizard. In most card games  that have a deck wizard you can just ignore it, generally those wizards are worse at making decks than the players anyway. In this case however I found myself incredibly frustrated trying to build a fun deck when the deck wizard was making me choose between a handfull of absolutely terrible cards. I'd go as far as to say even new players do not benefit from this wizard. Any player who has taken the time to learn about manacurve and land count will be able to make a decent deck on his own. Stop trying to handhold the players through frustrating deck wizards.\n\nI could continue to complain about other features such as the UI but those three points are the main reasons I really dislike this game. I can't recommend it to anyone who plays the physical card game, it's only going to be a frustrating experience.","November 6, 2015","false","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However this is not the case. Twice now, in the middle of a duel, the game has asked me to do a skill challenge regarding the concept of "First Strike". As a player of the actual TCG, I understand the mechanic but I do the skill challenges to earn some extra coins for packs. In this case, whenever I go to do said skill challenge, it freezes my computer up to the point where I have to restart THE ENTIRE COMPUTER just because the game will not properly shut down. This greatly effects my view of "Magic Duels" as I use it to test out deck ideas before actually buying the actual card.

Or maybe if you -don't- look at it wrong.  Granted, it usually crashed while I was alt-tabbed, but at this point in time any game that can't handle alt-tabbing is really kinda sad.\n\nI want to like it, but I've had to re-start the same step of the REQUIRED tutorial section several times because of these crashes.\n\nThat's another thing, too...yes, the tutorial is very well-designed, but I've been playing MtG for over a decade.  Locking me out of MAIN MENU OPTIONS until I go through every step of the tutorial is a bit much, no matter how well crafted that tutorial is.","March 16","false","69.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I do in a way but there are just way too many problems with the game for it to be fun. I'm talking about actual bugs and design flaws - things that should not be in the game (I'm not going to judge deck or card balancing here).\n\nA Couple of terrible bugs\n- Trying too find an actual multiplayer match can be ridiculous. About 30-60% of all searches for a standard 1v1 game won't work and about 50-80% of all searches for a standard 2v2 won't work. There are a couple of different reasons for this but all of them are utter crap.\n- Particularly in 2v2 matches, the game will break and the match wont continue until a specific person has left the game is just beyond a joke and happens about 40% of the matches. Rare in 1v1's though.\n- Certain spells also have a chance of breaking the game causing the match the stop until someon quits is again bloody terrible.\n\nA couple of terrible design choices\n- Text chat has been removed destroying any communication in 2v2 which is absolutely moronic.\n- Removing game lobbies in 2v2, I'll explain this one. Unfortunately you do come across some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who join a game just to quit which compiled with struggling to get a game can really ♥♥♥♥ you off. When you try to find another game you can end up with the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ again. The lobbies in the old games showed who was going to be in the game so if you knew there was an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you could find another lobby. Plus these lobbies worked so much better for actually getting a successful game.\n- If you minimize the game or it gets minimized by another program and its your turn, the game decides to skip your turn entirely which heavily punishes you.\n- The time limit per turn is outrageous long. Some people deliberately waste as much turn as possible hoping their opponent will quit from boredom and give them an easy AI match victory.\n\nThe game itself is fun when things work and your playing against another decent player but thats so few and far between its just not fun.","March 27","false","345.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You get 1 quest a day and it is worth 40-120 gold. Basically you can earn one pack of 6 cards every other day if you do them all. Coming from MTGO where you could spend 10$ and build a few decks its a grind and then some. Even if you spend money you still just open a few boosters with 6 random cards so dont expect to build a good theme deck or have a good selection until after you spend a LOT or grind a LOT.\n\nThis game needs to realise MTGO is already out there and far better for building decks and playing online. This one should try to focus on story mode campaigns and selling those off to make money. Those were pretty fun and cool but over to fast and replaying them pays nothing. That leaves you to take your starter cards and play online vs people who own every single card from all 4 sets, or play ai which sometimes are good games and others you are playing a bot on easy watching him drop rare card after rare card then some rare legends and gg lol.\n\n\nThe second biggest problem with game is all the pop ups. You are constantly closing them. I got one to write this review. I get them telling me to visit the store after just buying something from the store, and even after reviewing this, I still constantly get them asking me to review it and leave feedback.\n\nBest game for playing vs ai but it has a ways to go before i can really give this a thumbs up.\n\nIf you are looking for a great game to play vs ai and not have a single ad let alone 20 a gaming session play Hex: Shards of Fate. Tried it and this game has collected dust ever since.","April 12","false","32.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Story mode is good.  Con is if your an experienced player, your going to get frustrated by having to play tutorials and skill quests in the beginning as it seems required to unlock all the options....sorry.   I personally love the story mode as I'm more a solo player and the AI seems pretty good (as it should be as years of programming MTG Ai should be leveraged...i hope).

Pretty sad\n2) The sheer amount of bugs is infurating. Expect the game to crash. Often.\n3) Many of the automated sequences makes it hard to respond to triggers and may cause inintended sequencing of the stack\n4) Sorting through your collection is a pain.
