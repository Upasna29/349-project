For that reason alone I say to you young whippersnappers that you should not buy this.\nI can only guess on why the price is so high, but I can't be certain.\nMaybe to keep people away and only get those people in to the game who actually would provide feedback on a regular basis. Thats just me guessing though.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/TtvvxhPQzWU\n\nWhat little there is at the moment in the game I'll try and write about it.\n\nThe story seems very interesting to me. Aliens and somehow all the nukes on planet earth got blown up and people live in underground caves with freaking cave(sky)scrapers. Thats cool.\n\nThe game was dropping some frames even on lower settings so they can work on that optimization.\n\nGameplay at the moment is nonexistent, but you can move around not picking stuff up. Thats maybe something? (it isn't)\n\nCharacter creation does show a lot of promise even though you can't do much at the moment, it semm that there are apparently a lot of species, classes, skills and perks to be chosen later down the line.\n\nI'll edit this the next time I visit the game and we'll see what my opinion is then.\nAt the moment though I cannot recomend purchasing this for that big pricetag even if you enjoy playing early access games.\n\nDo have look at my video of the game if you wish to see some gameplay of it.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/TtvvxhPQzWU","March 9, 2015","false","0.7"," 354 of 412 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","354","412","2","5"

I would have waited patiently for a game to emerge some day.. but now it is on early access, for 46€, and it gets recommendations over and over, which I don't understand, and I think a completely wrong picture of the game gets shown to the people.\nSo please know: What you can see in the videos and pictures above, is really everything there is! Plus, you cannot do anything but move around. You can not use or touch or do anything else than move around. There is exactly one location to move around in. The desert scene is video only until now.\nFor me it looks like a hollow shell of a game. They made some really polished things, but for me it seems there is nothing behind it. Why would anyone create and show a polished character generation first, and then tell nothing of the use of the generated stats?\nThat said, I'm going to wait and see. I hope I'm wrong. They got the kickstarter money, so they should have everything to finish the game.

Cashgrab at the finest.\n\n#Updated on Fev 8 (2016!)\n\nToday, the dev announced that they are about to release an action comic related to the game...

You have about 4 rooms to walk around and few interactive options. Even as a tech demo, it is bad.\n\nMy reason for stating that my hope has faded away is due to how the dev, who claims to be "Mr. Nixon", himself is a very shady character with lots of vague promises but no actual action or even result. This game has been in development for 2 years now and there is barely any game made, let alone progressions.\n\nI see absoutely no way that this game will be finished.

We still have what amounts to a tech demo of a game that I would describe as "Neverwinter Nights in space"... if it was finished and had a compelling story, which I certainly would not bet on at this stage of development.\n\nIn today's update on Kickstarter, the developer apologized for how much of a pain it is to do most tasks using the default male/female characters.  To make that easier, they have assigned preset skills to those characters, so they'll have a decent chance at using lockpicks and first aid kits.  While certainly an improvement over the last version, it's a very small step in a process that has moved with glacial speed since funding was completed in August 2014.  *If* this game is ever finished, then maybe I'll change my recommendation - right now, all I can do is urge anyone considering this game to save their money or find some other game.","October 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 92 of 102 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","92","102","0","0"

First of all, would I recommend this ? Well its depending - this "game" is actually not early access but early tech demo. The graphic is pretty promising and looks quite nice, but there are merely a handful of rooms to explore with barely any interactivity. The indoor screenshots you´ll see in the preview, are all there is in the game in its current state. Those screens from the desert like area are from an even earlier prototype, which was given out during the kickstarter. So, if you´d like to support the developer - even with the risk, that this may NEVER be finished - go on, buy it.

I'll let the interaction speak for itself on the mannerisms this game devoloper has to it's Kickstarter founders and fans.\n\n\nPost 1\n_____________________________________________________________\nAfter helping fund you on Kickstarter, I was hoping for something great...\nWhen all this news came out in the begining about what you've done in the past and how this was all regurgitated work that you pasted on Kickstarter, being several years old already, I dismissed it.\n\nBut I have watched you churn next to nothing out for this game over the past year+. Sans your beloved comics/stories. Which is NOT what I, nor ANYONE else on kickstarted paid you for. You started a Kickstarter campaign for this game. Not a storybook, that was a side job. But that is where you've spent all your time.\n\nI am no longer intrested in anything you produce for this title. So long as you are producing it.\nThis game has remained in the same playable state for over a ENTIRE YEAR. I won't tell you what you did wrong over this time, I think you know. But I will state, THIS, is the exact reason why people don't like crowdfunding untangible objects.\n\nI personally feel like, this game, was a cash-money grab. Given what I've seen over time, I will be contacting Kickstarter and Paypal for a refund. Tell us again, when was this finished game supposed to be delivered to backers??\n\nPost 2\n_____________________________________________________________\nI was getting ready to make the same post as OP.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/335850/discussions/0/405692758716820487/\n\nAs a Kickstarter backer for this myself. I am beyond livid about the transpired production from this devoloper. I would love to play this game. However, hardly anything has changed since his 'techdemo' that was posted to Kickstarter. Let alone, when it finialy released here on Steam's EA portal.\n\nHonestly, I don't care what his story is. Or how he words it. He had choices he could have made to fix AND avoid the issues he made for himself, backers, and fans.\n\nInstead, he chooses to promote some crap app, that noone cares about.\nSo he can 'write' his 'stories'. And continue to promote those.\nSince they might be actualy tangible for the public. And he can continue to bait...i mean string along his followers.\n\n-You promised a game.\n-You failed deadline after deadline.\n-You kept us in the dark.\n-You can't show us, or the Kickstarter backers where all the 'backer' money has gone to.\n-You promote new stories, instead of the game promised. And promise more things you dont deliver on.\n-I'm sorry, but you sound more and more like Chris Roberts with every "patch".\n\nAnd alas, seeing as how you try and ban people that make any type of 'bad pitch' to your game, like always, i double post to Kickstarter too.\nAlways, cover your A$$.\n\nSpeaking of Kickstarter, I think it's time I've had a talk with them about you.\nI cannot stand liars, oh, and i'll be getting my refund too.\n\nI also like how you've now taken to locking comments on your patch notes.\nMakes it a bit harder for people to vocalize their hatred for what you're doing, OR, to warn others.\n\n**Kickstarter Estimated delivery: Oct 2014**\n\nPost 3\n_____________________________________________________________\nYou leave so many holes in your comments, I could probably sit here for hours poking though your last post here to: gbkstm.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/335850/discussions/0/385429254936639502/\nWho's post was superb! But I need to keep this short so I can cook dinner for the kiddo's.\n\nBut I would just like to take a moment to quote you Mr. Nixon. From your own Kickstarter page:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blackcloudstudios/after-reset-rpg-rebooted/comments\nScrolling down through the comments to Sept 15, 2015 responding to my comment.\nYou say, and I quote;\n\n"RE: We will not post any new project (game or not) till we complete the prologue we promised in the current project. We should complete it as we did for TFoG project and only after that we'll be able to move forward."\n\nSo why are we hearing about the Fall of Gyes 'application'? Before, it was just going to be a graphic novel as an extra that we could read from our game directory.\n\nAnd if you say something about StarWars and you knowing what you're doing because you have a "MBA in Strategic Marketing (Durham University Business School and Synergy University Business School) as a proper educational background" you're more out-there than I originally thought. Because if you're going to compare what you have here, with StarWars... (insert joke).\n\nAnd remind us all again, how and where all these 50 different location are going to come from? Especially when you don't even have one, ONE, finished yet.\n\nThank you Chris Roberts, I know you can't keep a timeline, or the truth.\nBut please, give us another ship to buy. For a game that doesn't work.\n\nI guess in your mind, selling someone just the 'Interior' of a car... constitutes selling them a 'whole' car. And the more accessories you add to the inside, the less people will worry about not having an outside.\n\nYou talk, and talk, and talk, but we've not seen you meet ONE goal yet from the Kickstarter.\nLet alone, all these extras you keep introducing and talking about.\n\nEND\n______________________________________________________________\nAnd with that last post, I've now been banned from the game discussions on STEAM.\nHis reason given 'bumping threads'.\nYet has no proof, because i did no such thing.\nSo he'll attempt to erase what he can, i'm sure.\n\nSources are in STEAMS discussions/news for the game. And Kickstarter in both Updates area and Comments section via:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blackcloudstudios/after-reset-rpg-rebooted/comments\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blackcloudstudios/after-reset-rpg-rebooted/updates\n\nI do NOT suggest you give this devoloper any of your money.\nAnd if you already have, I suggest you contact Paypal for refund.","March 28","false","2.8"," 78 of 87 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","78","87","3","2"

I missed the kickstarter but wanted to back the concept so here I am. I can understand both sides of the debate currently ongoing but choose to give it a thumbs up as someone who does back a fair amount of kickstarters but maybe as I'm yet to be burned by an early-access game, I don't have that in my mind so much. The intro cinematic and story along with the graphic novel gripped me. I can see where this is going but yes, It may not be completed... That depends on how well received the full prologue is if you're on the fence you can wait for that and keep an eye on/ Follow it. Gameplay consists of limping around a small medical area of a bunker, there are a couple of items which are highlightable, including items inside slightly opened cupboards/ drawers which I liked and sliding doors which open but that seems to be it, also currently having my foot in a cast I find the limping quite life-like, not for slow hobbling but If I try and lunge fast I swing my arms and its not unlike the animation lol. It is akin to many tech demos I have seen but yes it is a tad on the expensive side.

Well, yeah, there is nothing to save yet, but still, this is not how early acces should look like.

As of right now all you can do is create a character and explore a small laboratory so I will comment on the features that are implemented.\n\nCharacter Creation:\nThe character creation is very in depth, there are many races to choose from although there is only one available in the alpha to try out. The way the skills and attributes are set up is very reminiscent of Fallout 1&2, Wasteland and other classic RPG games. This gives you the ability to completely tailor your play-style with great precision. There are also options to customize the physical appearance of your character’s height, weight, age, eye color, and many other options that are not yet implemented. Finally there is an open ended Bio editor so you can create meaningful and detailed backstories (if you are into that sort of thing)\n\nAppearance:\nThe attention to detail in this game is superb. The menus are well crafted with a pleasant and interesting blur effect on the text (this effect was toned down significantly with the last update due to user feedback). The in-game graphics are excellent, far beyond what you would expect in an alpha, honestly better than I have seen in some AAA games lately.\n\nThe Development:\nThis game is alpha (more of a technical demo at this point) so if you are not interested in that sort of thing turn back now. What I can say is that the development team is HIGHLY active and extremely open/straight-forward. I have been following this game since I backed it early on in the kickstarter and the quantity and quality of the status updates from the developers have been phenomenal. As of now there have been 57 updates pushed out on kickstarter alone keeping backers updated and informed every step of the way. The website for this game has active dedicated forums and the developers seem to be taking the feedback on the game seriously. The content updates are coming at a steady rate and only seem to be increasing in frequency and quality lately.\n\nBottom Line:\nAgain this is currently alpha so if that’s not your thing than don’t bother with this yet, but keep an eye on it because it is shaping into something that has the potential to be amazing. If the alpha experience is for you and you wish to be an active part in shaping this game then this is the game for you, I recommend you join the forums and let your opinions be heard because the developers ARE listening.\n","March 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 15 of 232 people (6%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","6","15","232","14","0"

The vision that the devs have for the game.\n\nTo me it is the Fallout descendant that never happened. Sure FNV and F3 were amazing games in their own right, but they were not the desert land which we all come to love and cherish. The ambience is there, the feel is there, the story is there. You want to get excited pick up Fall of Gyes and give it a read. I was salivating in my frontal cortex as I was reading it, just thinking how good the full story is the game will be.\n\nThe graphics are breathtaking for an isometric based game. I understand its alpha at the moment and there is a lot they need to do, but the raw commitment to detail and level of quality is already evident. It had all those shiny polished edges we have come to expect of Mass Effect and Civilization visual levels.\n\nThe gameplay isnt there yet obviously, but that will hopefully soon come as updates roll hot off the presses. Poke around the website, drool at screenshots and so far it looks like it will be all the fun, explody, clicky bits that keep us happily poking away at Wasteland and Fallouts. And yes it has cyberdogs and lasers.\n\nAnd of course I have to squeeze in a spiel on commitment and persevearance that the devs have shown so far to the game. Kickstarter, Fall of Gyes, Steam Greenlight and Early Access are all proof that they ARE working to get this game done. ON THEIR OWN TERMS. They could have sold out to any of the big boys to get the game done. There have been and there will be publishers coming to them to offer coin for their seat at the table, but so far Richard Nixon and his team have stayed strong to their vision for their game and their independence. I for one am tired of AAA massive budget title games that in the end feel like cookie cutter, vanilla, sexless clones. Let us finally have a game made by someone with guts, skill and spine.\n\nGet the game, support the indie devs and have patience.

I kickstarted this game because it gave me nostalgia feels form playing Fallout 1&2, and this game looks like it's going to deliver.\n\nI won't say you guys should buy the game now, but I do say that you should at least follow it and keep yourself up to date on it. The developers are pumping out updates at a decent enough pace so I just ask for your patience before throwing it your review bone.","March 10, 2015","true","0.7"," 13 of 225 people (6%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","6","13","225","8","0"

I backed this game on kickstarter and am willing to wait for the creators to make it the way they want to make it. I recommend waiting for some more builds before buying but i am sure the game at release will be worth it.","March 10, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 189 people (3%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","3","6","189","8","0"
