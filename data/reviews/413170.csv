Just like in ye olden days it's filled with BRs, but this time with an extra touch of Koreans joining the fun with their own tongue. Nobody ever lives near the servers which means great fun if you actually try to shoot them accurately and they take zero damage. If you like being called a "lagger noob idiot wtf" all the time then this is the game for you!\n\nThe game itself disregarding the community is pretty OK. You get some varied characters and weapon types to choose from and many different choices for armor and weapons. Don't expect to get what you desire quickly, since you have to grind for weapons and armor that are outright better in every way or shell out some cash for the big guns and some paytowin buffs. Unlike the Aeria games version that was shut down long ago this seems up to date with the original foreign version of the game content-wise. Sadly this means a grindy gem buff and pet system has been implemented judging by the menus available for them.\n\nThe main draw of this game for me back in the day is that it can run on the most absolute potato PCs, even a laptop or netbook.","March 20","true","1.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

Played the game after it went down on aeria as well all the way till it was called giga slave, got ip banned and went to MA taiwan i believe. Stopped playing a few years ago. Now its just an unbelievable brocken grind. Skill points have been done away with, guns are still pay to win and the inflation in the item market is unreal. You will have to grind 50+ hours to get anything to at least stand a chance against anyone with a item mall weapon. Game is also still buggy as hell for being a almost 5 year old game. Heals now heal you over time and reloading in the ammo bay takes ♥♥♥♥ing FOREVER. If you have no one with item mall weapons or gear in your party you can't even beat the final boss in the damn "story" mode.

I have no problem with other M-M-O games, such as GW2, Armoured Warfare, War Thunder etcs, these games work fine. Except Metal Assault.\n\nThe game play is still solid, just as it was almost 5 years ago, since Ariea games knocked it down. Unfortunately, due to its nature of "pay 2 win". The game is not in top shape. As a free player you'll only get ONE inventory slot and not even a personal storage. Those things cost real money! NPC loves to give you quests and you'll love em because you''ll get free loot & money. But you can't turn the freaking quest in because the quest rewards spams you with grenades, aids kits, tokens and junks! YES you need inventory space to complete quests! And the only way to get 'Personal storage licence" is to buy the beinnger package through their website.\n\nIn game economy is screwed, inflation is at all time highh... player population is VERY VERY VERY VERY LOW. I once found only 3 games. THREE GAMES lobbies.\nIt is a fun game for those who like Metal slug or who played Metal Assault, otherwise this game is like a turd, waiting for those to step on it....\n\nI hope my speculation is wrong, but I expect this game to fall yet again...","April 14","false","6.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It has flaws, but you cannot get this type of awesome gameplay anywhere else, so I HIGHLY suggest any fan of Metal Slug or skill-based 2D shooter games check it out.\n\nThis game is a prime example of gameplay trumphs graphics. It's very skill-based. It has a questionable Item Mall (more on that below). But hot dang, is it ever a good time!\n\nThe core game breaks down into 3 parts: PvP, Mission, and Coop.\n\nPvP is what the game was built around: the PvP in this game is awesome. The skill ceiling is super high, and I've seen some extremely good players do some phenominal stuff. The community is still very new, but mostly filled with players that have played MetalAssault when Aeria Games owned it, meaning these guys know what they're doing. The community is quite nice though, and if you're fast to learn and willing, they WILL teach you how to get better! You're going to get your butt kicked at first, but with some practice, you will get better for sure.\n\nMission mode is the "storyline" of the game. I say it with quotation marks, because the story is very bad and really is just there to have some dialogue talking to the user. This mode is very difficult until you have good gear. However it is quite fun, and it feels very satisfying to beat a level after trying it many times. When you get to the later maps, this mode becomes quite profitable as well, but at the time of writing, very little people have gotten to those maps (the game is new, and the best gear has not been acquired yet).\n\nCoop is what drives the economy in this game. This is the mode where you make your money, and this is the mode that you MUST play if you're going to want to get anywhere in this game without paying real life dollars.\nIt's basically "zombie mode". There's many variations of maps, but the requirements are always the same: complete 10 rounds and get a bunch of EXP and Credits. If you successfully complete the map, depending on how many players you have at the time, you randomly roll for a chance to win one of 1, 3, or 5 box(es). This mode is also quite fun to play, but it is not for everyone, so if you do not enjoy Coop mode, you will likely not enjoy this game (more on that below).\n\nABOUT THE ITEM MALL:\nI have been trying to play as a COMPLETELY free-to-play player and now have ~30 hours logged.\nYes, it is completely possible to play for free, BUT you have to enjoy Coop mode.\nAt the time of writing, the Item Mall has some 7-day weapons that make your life 10x easier in Coop and Mission modes (THEY DO NOT BREAK THE BALANCE IN PVP, WHICH IS WHY THIS GAME IS WORTH YOUR TIME!).\nThese 7-day weapons can be bought from other players for Credits! How do you make Credits? You must spam Coop mode for a chance to win a box, then sell whatever you got from the box for profits. Then, once you buy those weapons (specifically the Flamethrower is the best possible purchase), you can do the harder Coop maps for BETTER LOOT!\nThis is how you get rich, and this is how you get better gear.\n\nI plan to make a free-to-play player guide eventually, once I get better at the game.\nFor now, if you have any questions, contact me in-game.\nIGN: EggsDee\n\nHappy playing!","March 23","true","82.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just play it, it's 100% free and is totally worth checking out. I played this game back when Aeria Games hosted it and the game was so successful. Sadly they closed it down without reason and most players thought it would never come back to life.\n\nI dumped hours into this game when it was first released. If it was P2W or a bad game. I would've never loved it so much to see it's return.\n\nIf you haven't tried this game and are looking for a fun and enjoyful experience. Pick this game up and give it a try.\n\nHowever given that the game was only revived a month or so ago, don't expect it to be 100% flawless. This game has a long ways to go before it's back to it's prime.

It has four game modes, tons of maps,\nThere's co-op vs zombies, co-op mission like metal slug. There's PvP, self explanatory. And A.I mode, basically fight against A.I. I forgot names of the four classes except Carl and Ai..\nI'll tell them by class types and what they do. There is Carl, a speed type assault in the frontlines, quickly clearing waves of zombies, and is very versatile and flexible. He uses Speed skills like a jump tumble. There is another class, let's call him Tank. He's also supposed to be in the front lines also, tanking, and demolishing anything in his way. He has a body rush skill that shortly stuns and in that time can be used for getting an advantage. There's the female sniper, forgot the name, it's been a while. She stands in the back lines, sniping, and giving cover to the front lines. She can also assault, and is also very flexible. Then there's Ai. She's different than all the others, she can infiltrate deep inside enemy territory, turning invisible. She has a backstep as for movement. She is also very flexible in all ranges, assault to tactical to support.\n\nOverall, awesome game, but needs other platforms other than windows, like Mac, and servers for the Brazil community etc. this has crazy potential once the developers kick in.\n","March 20","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now don't get me wrong, it's a good game with a lot of potential, it's just that it's very disheartening to know and see that you're playing your first few games with high-ranking players and I usually don't have a problem with this because it's satasfying to debunk someone that has spent more time/money on than the game than you and it's even more satasfying if you're outright dominating them(Rage and accusations are a bonus.) But it's not the case as those high-ranking players have  Better Gear  than you, effectively putting the balance between Skill and Gear more into Gear's favor. Heck in one of the games I was in, two players were talking to each other and one of them brought up the recent players that joined(Me and some other bloke.) and talked about the new players or "low ranks" as they called it and also said that we are easy kills. Now I thought that it was just trash talk until I realized that one of the players that was talking was on my team and most new players don't want their own team talking bad about them.\n\n\nNow here are some suggestions to help early game players get used to the game before tossing them into the chaos that is being "Everyone is Stronger Than You." Follow them if you wish.\n\nMake it so that you do gain experence for playing against AI bots up until a certain level, then maybe it halves up until a certain level as well, until you reach a set level to where you're not allowed to obtain EXP from bots anymore.\n\nHave it so that at early levels, a promotion could give you a useful Item or two, like a new gun or gear. Something to replace the used gear that they give you.(Used, really? What are we, cannon fodder?)\n\nHave it so that new players can have a better insight on how the game works, without wandering around aimlessly.\n\nHave a few rooms be beginner friendly and/or beginner only.(And what I mean by "beginner friendly" is that have it so that you could only use low-tier gear or just the starting gear in said room.)\n\n\nAnd before you say "Git gud, skrub."(Get good, scrub.) Note that this game is more focused on what gear you have over overall skill, which means that it's doesn't matter how good you are, you would most of the time be outplayed by the better equiped.\n\n\n\nNote: This review is in a WIP state until I play more of the game, all the while I will be changing the review accordingly and may even change it into something that I could recommend.\n","April 8","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Hue.) I've never had an instance where I died and called BS due to lag.   The only real problem is that there's not enough players on the game right now to really get into a game fast. It'll leave you waiting in the game lobby for a room to open up for quite some time and honestly, that's why despite recommending the game, I likely won't be playing it a whole lot.\n\nThe only things that a player might call foul on gameplay-wise is the apparent lack of licenses, (The lack of licenses is supposed to be something that'll be fixed and added back in eventually.) some hotkeys being paywalled (You can buy them easily from other players on the trade board with in-game cash. About 4-5 hours will easily earn you enough cash for an unlock.) and flamethrowers being OP in some instances.  Flamethrowers are really easily shut down with a single shotgun blast though.\n\nGameplay otherwise has been smooth as silk for me, it's just I'm impatient and don't like waiting for awhile to get into a game lobby.  I think I might like the game more than others because of the 2D art style and quasi Metal Slug gameplay, so your mileage may vary, but there's a lot to like here and especially for the price of free.\n\nGive it a try and don't shy away from the PvP side of things.  Nothing's more satisfying than watching a BR with flashy gear and some ridiculously high rank eat a sniper rifle round from a new player's starting gun.  The wall of unreadable curses that will follow afterwards is just beautiful.  Delicious salty tears.","April 9","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is one of those games while not heavily great on graphics still somehow hooks you into playing it almost daily.\n\nAlthough, this game is sort of pay to win but daily rewards and zombie modes will get you towards other peoples level and there really should be 3 or 4 more servers. The game is all laggy as majority of players are in Asia playing in the US server, which makes the game really unfair.\n\n","April 25","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign is fun too it allows for the experience of Metal Slug, with my own customized character. The only problem I have is that there should be more options to make your character more unique to others. Skin tone being one of them.","April 24","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only thing i ever grinded for was the armor. Only way to make quick cash in this game is collect armor and weapons and sell them on the market. They updated the game so it can run on all resolutions. I hope they add new content/characters and more. Other than that, this game is top notch, However if your trying to look for a guild...good luck unless you have friends who play the game with you.","May 6","true","32.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, there\'s so many bugs and problem issues that requires more fixes. As an example, going solo in a Co-Op mode is impossible, especially for new players. The bosses in Co-Op mode have too much health (over 69 bar of health!) and can instant kill players by getting hit directly at the multi-spamming homing missiles.","June 1","false","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
