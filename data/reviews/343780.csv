I really want to make some witty comment like Cat Goes Fishing has me hooked, but I really don't feel that strongly about it.  It's fun, in a casual, play a bit here and there way, which seems to be the phone game mantra.\nCat Goes Fishing does take a bit of strategy, as you have to use smaller fish to catch larger ones, while trying to get the bait to the fish you want to catch.  This layered approach to baiting fish may seem tricky at first, but keep at it and in no time you'll be a master baiter.\n","January 19, 2015","true","11.7"," 337 of 364 people (93%) found this review helpful 328 people found this review funny","93","337","364","328","15"

Well, as much gameplay as you can get with a single cat click. It's cute, it's fun and in a few minutes play you'll be hooked. After playing WoW for so many years, I never thought I'd admit to fishing being enjoyable but this game really lured me in.\n\nWith a bit of purrsuasion in the form of different baits, you catch the fish and sell them for money or use them as ever increasing temptations to catch bigger and betta fish whilst warding off hordes of hungry tiddlers.\n\nDid I mention your cat can wear heats? Purrfect. You don't need to be a brain sturgeon to realize this is worth buying - it only costs a few squid!\n\n(To all my friends and family, please forgive me for posting this.

Despite its repetitive game play, it is perfectly capable of showing diversity and new content as you play and progress without losing its fun or its certain realism to actual fishing!\n\nThe strong aspects in this game\nDiversity:\n\nDespite the game being about a repetitive subject such as fishing, Cat Goes Fishing is perfectly capable of showing a diversity allied with its vast content variety as you progress and discover.\n\nMusic:\n\nThe music in this game is a good match to the game overall environment and also to the interaction between players and the game itself giving a very comfortable feeling of relax and pleasure.\n\nDifficulty:\n\nThe difficulty in this game adds up to the initial mentioned realistic fishing experience. As you catch different types of fish, they will struggle against you while testing your patience and coordination making players feel as if they were actually fishing or playing a game dedicated only to fishing realism.\n\nPrice:\n\nI don’t usually talk about the price in games unless they are unfair, but I must say the amount of fun and entertainment this game has to offer makes it reasonable at its current price of 6,99€.\n\nGame mechanics and user interface:\n\nBoth game mechanics and user interface are simple, and perfectly suitable with the game structure and its game play that it provides to players.\n\nNow to the weaker aspect\nGraphics:\n\nThe game graphically talking, deserves a lot more action and detail into it, as it makes players feel like there is something the game is lacking of, and that is precisely the non-existence of simple water splashes among others easily making players into thinking that the game shows an obvious enormous potential, but lacks good graphics or animations into it making it look more like a flash game rather than a Steam game.\n\nConclusion\nI would rate this game a 67 out of 100 or 3,3 out of 5,0.  An interesting cute game able to provide tons of fun and moments of joy without losing its challenge or fun core in it!","May 25, 2015","true","21.6"," 54 of 61 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","54","61","5","4"

It has become almost a trend in gaming to put a Cat or funny animal into an unusual role and forget the importance of game design. When it comes to Cat Gone Fishing, the adorable aesthetic aside. The game is very well designed and highly addictive. Yes, it's a cat holding a fishing rod and it is adorable but that aside the core gameplay of Cat Goes Fishing is what I enjoyed most about this game. With dozens of upgrades available for your rod, boat, radar and more, you will turn your Cat into a fishing machine as you begin to battle the monsters underneath the surface. Cat Goes Fishing is a wonderful game to just load up and completely just fall into and relax while you play it, discovering even more aquatic animals after you think you've found everything. The only true complaint I could have about the game is it's lack of options, Cat Goes Fishing shows its mobile roots with no shame. While this may be disconcerting to some, I found the positives of this fun and adorable game to far outweigh the bad. Besides, guys, it's a Cat wearing a hat and fishing! Come on! It's adorable!!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/bHZpctDcrRU\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","September 20, 2015","true","9.9"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","30","33","5","0"

Amazingly fun game.\nGameplay Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNZaH8D5ln8\nStarting as cat with a basic rod the controls are simple, you can play this with one hand. Fishing up the smaller species initially and selling them will reward you with money, which is used for purchase of better rods or upgrades to current equipment. The game then introduces you to it's quest system, completing these tasks rewards larger sums of money. While questing the fish catalog becomes useful as it will display all species in the game.\n\nSometimes fishing in the depths you may discover rare hats, which not only look cute on cat but give large bonuses to both your fishing abilities and values of catches. More tongue in cheek one-use items available later include rockets and bombs but everything has it uses. In these cases scaring away packs of fish or making your cast go much further with cheaper rods. Boat travel is also included, but I have not progressed that far yet.\n\nContent wise, If you check the store page the developer mentions and I quote.\n"Regular updates will bring new fish, boats, hats, and entirely new mechanics to the game, extending your experience and offering new ways to master the game.

Under the cartoony art direction and streamlined controls you still have a variety of factors affecting gameplay, including depth of water, distance from shore, rod style and modifications, baits, and different outfits affecting perks. You get short term goals that when completed give additional rewards which helps you unlock more content faster. The game is suprisingly addictive, and its easy to zone out clicking away mindlessly while listening to radio. Overall I would say this is a nice pick, I spent a lot of time unlocking things, until at some point it became too repetitive to continue, but still once in a while it is nice to pick up and pick a couple of fishes, but at that point it has little more to offer than your average tablet game.","October 7, 2015","true","31.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

Cute and relaxing does not also mean boring, however.  There's always things to work towards (catching certain fish, acquiring new gear, etc.). I was honestly surprised that there's enough to strive for in Cat Goes Fishing to keep me interested.  The amount of money you earn is reasonable for what you catch/how difficult the fish is to catch, and you earn it at a good rate, too.  This means when you're eyeing that $50,000 boat, it won't be days until you have it; you will probably be able to earn the cash in half an hour, 45 minutes (or less if you don't purchase certain items that enhance your casting, like rockets.

Because every cat likes fish, right? In „Cat Goes Fishing“ you have to level up to achieve different things. You will get a shop quite early in the game to make it possible and upgrade your rods. By time, you will also be able to purchase things such as rockets or bombs to apply on your fishing rod. Later in the game you will be buying a boat to move into the depths of the ocean, getting even more rare fish than you got at the shore. The more money you make, the better upgrades and items you can buy. And during this process, you will level up and unlock several new things that will improve your gameplay.\n\nThe game has 52 achievements to collect, most of them seem easy to achieve since they are bound to the quests you get in the game (hunting several fish, buying a special item), but a lot are also harder to get.\n\nAlso, you will find two modes to play on. First one is normal, where you simply catch fish, sell them, level up. In realism mode, the fish will try to withstand when getting pulled out of the water. They won't make it far, most of them will get eaten by bigger fishes in the underground, so you will receive less money once you try to sell your prey.\n\nOverall, this game is nice to spend some time on, either when installing something else or just chilling out. It can possibly get addictive, especially when you like cats and fishing (?), but in the end it's just a short little game with more achievements than spectacular gameplay.","December 30, 2015","true","10.6"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","1"

Click for casting/reeling & A/D for movement. There is no tutorial as of the writing of this review, but getting the general sense on how to start casting to maximum effect is quite simple. There isn’t any Menu either.\n\nWhile, the casting & movement mechanics couldn’t get any simpler, there is some depth on how you choose to complete the quests. There are many different types of effects you can apply to your rod to target or dissuade various types of fish or to augment other elements. There are also tools both temporary & permanent that will come in handy.\n\nAs you catch fish & complete quests, you will level & accrue currency. As you level, the quests get progressively more difficult. However, from my experience, there does appear to be a degree of randomness with respect to the quest system; old quests will pop up time & again. The quests will progressively get more & more grindy. Completing them will require you to farm currency for pro-longed periods of time, before you can purchase the necessary items & upgrades to complete them.\n\nHats! Hats! & More Hats! Yes, Cat Goes Fishing does have an array of hats. They are obtained by catching them so keep an eye out. The sad part is that you can’t collect them. You can only wear one hat at a time. Each hat provides a useful boost. Be wary of accidentally selling a hat, as it is easy to do.\n\nThere is an in-game catalog giving various details on the different types of fish, so it may yield some assistance in catching your desired fish.\n\nThe artwork is exactly as shown in the screenshots. The background scenery is under-utilized & quite bland. The sound is one uninspiring track looped continuously. Luckily, it can be muted with the ‘M’ key.\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn’t label Cat Goes Fishing as a fishing simulator. I wouldn’t recommend it to those who love fishing & desire that experience, albeit through the eyes of a cat. Rather, Cat Goes Fishing is a game you pop in when you have a few minutes to kill, just for the posterity of seeing a cat catch some fish, while wearing a snazzy hat.","January 23, 2015","true","5.0"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

Eventually everything is bought, all things are caught/collected,  and thus there is a wall.\n\nI would not recommend this game as there is no innovation. This is a free flash game style of game.\n\nTo make matters worse, there is no full screen, no selectable resolutions, no aduio level adjustment for the single track OST that plays constantly.\n\nThis is a dollar mobile app type game not worth the asking price of several times that.\n\nMechanically it works.

It serves the purpose well; simple and cute artwork for a simple and cute game.\n\nDespite the simplicity of the controls, there is actually a perfect amount of difficulty instituted here. You've got to craftily avoid smaller fish to get to the bigger ones, or combo the smaller ones as bait for larger and larger fish. The better the fish, the more money you get for them. Money is spent on an assortment of fishing rods, powerups for each rod, boats, and even extras like one-use bombs and larger hooks. The balance in the game seems perfect; even hours later, I'm still catching new fish and have only unlocked half the rods and boats and powerups, and I'm still getting new quests for bonus money.\nOh, and you can catch adorable hats for your cat to wear which give different bonuses!\n\nThe only thing I can't seem to find is an options menu, but the sounds and music are so unobtrusive that for most people it might not matter much.","February 1, 2015","true","11.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's a super fun and super cute game! It's a quick, no brainer, casual experience that fills the the need to play a game when you don't have enough time to play one.\n\nI still haven't mastered how to properly fling my rod though. A few times I'm able to make the thing really fly out there but I don't  know how to replicate that. But I'm still able to catch the fish I want, provided the other dumb fisH don't get to it first. :P Luckily, there are upgrades you can buy to keep those pesky fish at bay. :)\n\nSpeaking of upgrades, that's another dynamic of the game I like. You can complete quests AND score some cash by catching fish. With that cash you are able to buy a better rod, an upgrade so your boat can leave dock, and other random things like a rocket to shoot your line out farther. It keeps the game interesting without needing it to be interesting.\n\nI give this game a thumbs up and a good recommendation for those that are really into mindless fun.","April 9, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even the fact it is windowed doesn't bother me! This is a very pleasant and easy going game (though can be sort of frustrating when trying to catch specific fish!) that isn't confusing and yet has a decent amount of depth for it's simplicity.\n\nThe cat that goes fishing is cute in all of the little hats you unlock throughout the game, each giving you a bonus to some random fishing affect (small fish worth more, rockets cost less, etc). There are different kinds of rods that also have bonuses that you can pay to get equipped to them (such as faster lure sink). There are a few other fun features that give this game a playful, meaningful and yet simple to understand, feel that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone.\n\nIf you are looking for a relaxing game that doesn't cause you to obsessively keep track of every detail, a game that helps you unwind from a hectic day, this might be for you.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that has mild strategy, a fishy smell and a furry protagonist, this is for you.\n\nIf you broke your thumb and two fingers on your left hand, no worries. You only need to press A and D with that hand and have your right for the mouse!\n\nThere's surprisingly quite a bit packed into this little package and it's definitely worth the (sale) price I paid for it. Especially the sense of pride and accomplishment as your cute little kitty reels in a monster shark.\n\nAfter all that, the only fault I have found in this whole game is the fact I can't upgrade the upgrades to my pole. But it isn't a drawback really, just expected it to be an extended feature and was surprised it wasn't. ^^\n\nIt -can- get repetitive, but I enjoy that sort of gameplay just as much as I like gameplay with constant changes. But just a heads up for those who get tired of a bit of repetition.","January 25, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It requires a little bit of reflex, planning and skill to overcome the missions/objectives. You'll get frustrated when the medium/large fishes start biting in on your haul, as you reel in your hard-earned fish to sell, only to find it missing a tail.\n\nPretty straight-forward, and the fish do not relatively move a large distance, so you can expect the same cluster of fish to be hanging out in the same areas. Once you memorize their approximate locations, it becomes less of a random experience like how real-life fishing is, but becomes repetitive execution.\n\nCan probably be improved. I had fun, I don't deny that, but at the price, I think other titles within the same genre offer a better experience than this one, albeit being unique.","February 10, 2015","false","4.0"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

Catching fish does start out as being quite fun, but as you move up you realise that there are many worhtless fish between you and your current money making goal. You can fortunately try clear the way with bombs to scare them off but often I would run into respawns that I was unaware of, making the whole cast a waste of effort. Factor in that some bait requires catching three fish and you can soon see how furstrating losing a single bait to fish fodder can be.\n\nAll of this soon becomes tiresome and it feels like they do not give you the tools you need to alleviate these issues unless you are willing to grind yout way up high in game money walls. I soon lost interest in my dreams of fishing as a cat but I'm sure one day they will be realised.","January 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","16","31","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shorinjiryu/recommended/343780/","shorinjiryu","Shorin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shorinjiryu/","105 products in account","This anime has some of the strongest character development I have ever seen,  the dub is seccond to girls und panzer, and it is probably my favorite anime besides king of the hill.\n\nCat Goes Fishing is about the struggle of one cat and his quest to catch fish. As we start out the cat is just a simple prolitarean in a capitalist society. He sees the error of his society's ways and wants to rise up with his fellow workers against the oppressive corperate regeme he is living in. His father, who faithfully served for Whiskerslovakia as a boat millitarycat (also known as the navie) in the war against the hunter dogs, but was executed in the great fishpression of '92. After years of resenting his father, cat finally learned why his father was executed: "he was a scapegoat for it all" his revolutionary friend meowthew told him, and both of them should form a revolution against Whiskerslovakia.\n\nAt a rally that cat and meowthew organized, police turned on the demonstrators and stated executing people in the streets. Meowthew died in cat's arms and cat found himself alive, not as an act of mercy, but to bear the suffering of his now dead best friend. Cat went back to his normal life and did not engage in any revolutionary activity until as the sole survivor of the riots he was approached by Mr. Meowgi, an old friend of his father. This is the last connection he had with his family, as his mom had died after childbirth. Mr. Meowgi gives cat a fishing rod, and cat was finally ready to accept his quest.\n\nCat now knows he has has to leave. Our hero moves to the underground of the capital, Meowscow, and joins the underground resistance, leaving behind his girlfriend of five years, Sameowa. They were good together at first, but they had recently been going through trouble, and both were too busy to break things off. In the capital, his first assignment was to sabotauge regime fishing boats. Although a dangerous task, cat and his father before him were white cats, so they could easily blend in with the snow of Meowscow in Whiskerslovakia. Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha, a black cat, was also assigned to the mission, but she never made it to the boat. Instead, Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha was brutally beaten and captured. We can't be sure if she was captured for being a meowmber of the rebellion, or just for being black in an all white and calico society. This was the second time Cat saw the true face of his enemy. He successfully infultrated and sabotauged the boat, and soon forgot (three days max) Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha. After all, it's a cat kill cat world. Cat returns and recieves his sweet payment of catnip, and spends it on new armor for himself and an upgraded version of his fishing rod.\n\nCat had overcame his trials and was now ready to fully face his enemy. He leads a ride into the city to assassinate a senetor, Wood. Cat had found out that Senetor Wood was the one who captured Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha, and had eventually killed her. Cat was ready for his vengance. Cat had now reached the senetor, and was prepared for an epic fight. All of his platoon was killed except for him, who completed his mission, and returned with newfound condidence that he could now face his true enemy, the ultamate evil, President Raftdog, who is actually a cat and not my English professer. With his mind set and his heart pure, he entered the Impurrial Meowice. Cat was surprised about how little people were on guard at the meowice. It was empty. Raftdog was alone and it was time to strike and take vengence for all that him and his evil regime had done to cat. Raftdog told cat, "I know my time has come, but the Whiskerslovakian Empire will rise again!" With these last words, cat swung a swift stroak with his trusty rusty fishing rod, and ended Raftdog's life, or so it seems.\n\nIn the Meowice, cat finds Lapurrrrrrrrsha's lost collar, which was the key to her invunerability, and the whole reason why Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha thought she could take the mission in the first place, unfortunately, the empire had found a way to bypass this invunerability, and captured Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha. When cat returned, he was celebrated by all, and bestowed the highest honor by Mr. Meowgi.\n\nIn conclusion, I greatly enjoyed this anime, and can't wait for the second season to come out. This anime alone helped me achieve my doctoral degree, and was the topic of my thesis paper. I rate this anime 9.5/10 and hope that all of you reading this can experiene the greatness as I have.","March 11","true","0.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","50","5","10","7","0"

The art is friendly and colorful. There's 1 music track (turn it off by pressing M) that you can hear in the trailer. The actual game is simple and fun. When you cast your line, you control where the bait moves. Then when you hook a fish, you have to reel it back while avoiding the other fish that may want to eat it. You'll have to use a different type of strategy to catch each fish.\n\nThere's a leveling system where you can buy and upgrade things with the money from the fish you catch. It's a bit clunky and annoying to use, but I didn't feel that it took away from the game at all. You can buy different fishing rods and add some tweaks to augment your playing style. It's mostly to give you some goals and rewards.\n\nIt's an okay game.  It's missing a few things, but what's there is fun to play with. If you're interested, I don't think you'll regret spending your five dollars.","January 23, 2015","true","34.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You will struggle with your first cuddlefish, a small tiny thing that hardly is worth anything and you feel awarded anyway.\nAfter a while you get the ability to use rockets, bombs, boats and hats to help progression but you don't have to do so, you can take your time and just relax with it.\n\nYou can go pretty deep in the ocean, catching hideous monster like fish and cute little glowy things yeah the variety in fish is pretty good for such a small game. The thing that is so good about it is that every fish is unique and have it's own personality witch you need to adapt to or your haul gets eaten up quickly! Everything from slow, aggresive and jolly.\n\nGraphics of the game is adorable, it feels almost as papercraft and everything sticks out and is colorful, the Cat itself is just adorable and that is a big +.\n\nIn the sound department it's a bit lacking, It sounds like it's Shakira ~Underneath your clothes~ song on repeat forever (Unless you fish deep). otherwise it's just you and your cat. (You can turn of game audio by going into your computers volume control and just mute it. )\n\nThis game have no menu screen or interface menu at all, no fullscreen support or resolution changes but frankly it doesn't need it. There is no micro transactions or in game stores.\n\nGameplay, now this is where the game shines. I've never been so hooked on a fishing game before.\nYou always feel good getting good fish on the line and you never feel frustrated or annoyed when it goes bad, the game is very forgiving.\nAll the different rods, boats and hats improve your "stats" in the game and some can be really good and help you out in different ways, you also got quests that is money and exp rewards that are both easy to understand and managable while you are fishing so you never need to go out of your way to do them.\nI recommend the game to everyone out there, you will get happily suprised by this title. It's pretty Puuurrfect.\n\nRating system for the stupid people:\n★★★★★ / 5 Stars","January 23, 2015","true","7.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do the thing, unlock things that make it easier to do the thing, do the thing more.  Unfortunately, it suffers from unfocused game design, and leads to a lot of frustration.\n\nThere are four different sizes of fish, each having a minimum size of bait required to catch them -- but ALL fish go after and try to steal ALL bait, not just bait their own ranking.  The only way to get this bait is by catching a fish of one rank, and throwing it back in to get bait of the next rank.  Lastly, any time you're pulling a fish in, any larger fish it passes will nibble on it, damaging your catch and lowering its value (and making it not count towards quests - though it can still be bait).  This bait system works against itself in the worst, least productive way.\n\nSo let's say you catch a small fish.  You throw it back in as Medium Bait, and start trauling for bigger -- oops, no, another small fish ate it.  You start pulling in your new small fish, and the medium fish you were trying to catch darts in and eats half of it before you can get it back on board.  So you throw it back as medium bait, and try again.  Three attempts later, you finally catch your first medium fish.  You throw it back as Large bait, aiming to hook a big one -- oops, no, the cheapest variety of small fish just ate your bait, and then got eaten to the bones by a medium fish again.  And you have a quest to catch three large fish, and the game will not progress until you manage.\n\nUnfortunately this ruins it as a casual experience, adding difficulty via grinding.  I'm holding out hope for an eventual upgrade that will make it go away, but it's not in sight yet.  I'll change the review if I find it.  Example upgrades that could turn it around if they exist :\n- the ability to buy bait of the desired size\n- permanent upgrade that raises the minimum rank of your bait\n- permanent upgrade that makes fish on your line immune to being nibbled on on the way back\n- making fish stop stealing bait too low rank for them\n- making fish stop biting bait too high rank for them\n\n..but really, it would be better if one of those things were available from the start.","November 30, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

At first it's kind of zen - you just hook fish from the water - for like the first half hour. Then it starts getting more complicated - you catch a small fish which you use as bait for bigger ones which can be used to catch the biggest ones. The problem is that the water is filled pretty densely with fish and fish you don't care about will constantly take the bait instead. Fifty times I made a large bait and then threw it in only to immediately be taken by a tiny fish near the surface. Additionally bigger fish can bite at smaller fish on your line and if they do, the fish you caught won't count for any quests you have. You can buy upgrades to counter some of these issues but after the first few they are extremely expensive.\n\n","April 15, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

You can sell said fish for money to upgrade your hook and line, or use said fish as bigger bait to TRY and catch bigger fish. That is all the game has to offer, and really, i dont find it that fun. As I said earlier, the game is only good for getting the achivements and the badge it has, to get your Steam level higher. Now, I haven't really gotten into the game, (That is a little bit of a lie). As you progress and complete missions, you will get to go to different areas, such as the ocean, to catch bigger fish, for more money. There.\n\nOverall, I don't hate this game.

It may be cute, but the grind gets old fast.\n\nFor example, let's take the bait mechanics.  Catching a small fish is easy enough, but if you want to catch medium fish, you must first catch a small fish and recast it.  To catch a large fish, you must catch a small fish, recast it as bait, catch a medium fish with that, and recast that one too.  If the wrong size of fish bites down, it can send you backward and make you repeat some or all of these steps.  Why can't we just buy or save medium and large bait?  True, there are hats and upgrades that can help with this eventually, but they don't eliminate what feels like unnecessary tedium.\n\nOverall, I gave this game a chance, but left feeling more frustrated than I did relaxed.

Too much grinding and frustration.\n\nI came back to see if there were any new improvements to the game, only to find once again that the cost of the rods HAD GONE UP AGAIN.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustADeadBunny/recommended/343780/","JustADeadBunny","Wilson Wilson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustADeadBunny/","278 products in account","It's a lovely game. If it doesn't fit on your screen, ALT+Enter makes it fit.\n\nThe game has a fairly simple system when it comes to catching fish. Left click the mouse button and then let go at the desired height. You can upgrade your fishing rod itself, aswell as modify it so that it attracts/repels certain fish, casts faster, sinks deeper or slower aswell as many more things. You can also add attachments to the rod such as fireworks so that it can be cast farther or bombs to clear away large shoals of smaller fish. There is also direct rod upgrades which are graphically pleasing and overall, better rods.\n\nYou can either sell the fish you catch, or recast with them in order to use them as bait to catch the bigger, more expensive fishes and there's a plethora (25 ish at the moment) of different fishes to catch which all require different tactics.\n\nThe money you gain you can use to purchase upgrades aswell as hats and boats for you to be able to fish better, deeper and further out.\n\nThe quest and system rewards you with xp and money for catching x number of x fish.\n\nThe games music is rather pleasing, although tiresome after long sessions.\n\nWould strongly reccommend. At the current price £3.74 it is a steal.","January 22, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Music is soothing but gets boring after a while; grahpics are simple but it could do better with the edges. As a coder and designer, I hate seeing jagged edges around whatever image they are using. It's just a matter of attitude. If you plan on selling this for money, do it with all your heart.\n\nSome bugs that need to be fixed; just like mostly every game.\n\nThe 7 buck tag is too much for this game. I would recommond you give it a try if it's around 2.5~3 bucks.\n\nYou can NOT change the settings such as music on/off, screen resolution and all that stuff. Actually there's not even a menu for that.\n\nI should give some credits to the person made the top right corner flyer pic.

There are various types of rods with different stats like speed, strength and range. Each rod has upgrade slots to which you can add different things like sinkers or reel speed. In fact what upgrades you have equipped is part of the tactics. There are basic quests that give you a bit of direction, catch so many of a certain kind of fish etc for a cash bonus.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/343780/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","Pretty simple, casual 2D fishing simulator. Visuals are nice, animations are fine, and music is okay to listen to for a while (then press M to turn it off). Upgrades come in pretty quickly at first, then mid-game there is a lot of unrewarded gold grind while you save for better rods + upgrades, boats, and other upgrades. Quests are decent gold but you can easily get stuck on a quest if you haven't gotten the proper rod/upgrades yet. Also, fish take time to respawn so you may have to wait for the fish you want (or get a boat to increase your fishing range). At end-game once you can grind the shark/maw/anglerfish, gold comes in quickly enough to upgrade everything you want and more.\n\nFishing is pretty straightforward: catch a small fish to catch a medium fish to catch a large/huge fish while avoiding fish you don't want to catch. I upgraded reel speed and lure sink speed to better avoid fish I didn't want to take. The Bait Guard and Crankbait upgrades are really useful, but are also very expensive to grind. Minimap and radar upgrades are nice for avoiding unwanted fish, though you can throw your line beyond the radar (which might be fixed in the beta). Radar is also useful for finding where the Maw/Anglerfish spawn and where you can cast to avoid the most fish on the way down.\n\nPretty fun for a 2D fishing simulator, though I would've liked more special fish like the shark. The shark takes your live fish and drags your line further away, effectively extending your rod's reach further than you normally could go. It's pretty fun to use when you're starting out with mediocre rods and no boat, but I don't think there's any more sharks further out so everything beyond the initial screen is just simple fishing.","April 11, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its basically a more laid back version of Insane Fishing. This is not a game you will play for hours at a time but it has a kind of peaceful zen feeling to it with more aspects unlocking as you go along. There are various types of rods with different stats like speed, strength and range. Each rod has upgrade slots to which you can add different things like sinkers or reel speed. In fact what upgrades you have equipped is part of the tactics. There are basic quests that give you a bit of direction, catch so many of a certain kind of fish etc for a cash bonus. This is not a game you will play for hours at a time or anything but its a good game for a 15 minute break or if you want to take a breather from something a bit more in depth.

You'll start  to memorize where a certain type of fish will spawn, you'll start to incorporate bombs and rockets just to catch a certain type of fish and you will find your own preference of rod modification to suit your own fishing method.\n\nThis game turns out to be very addictive and surprisingly very challenging (it took me 2 hours just to catch my first Mew shark). But once you get all the steam achievements and amass tonnes of wealth I found out that the replayability of the game is awful, its just another cycle of catching a fish, reel it in and repeat.\n\nThere should be an option where\n1) The cat can purchase a plane and hop off onto another island (that has rare and exotic fish perhaps?)\n2) Buy a house and decorate it with cupboards and store all different kinds of hats (I hate selling Legendary Hats!)\n3) The cat would get hungry and would like to eat a certain type of fish\n\n9.5/10","February 19, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All you do is fish but you're an adorable cat that can wear hats! The hats are slowly sinking in the ocean and you have to catch them on your hook which will then give you the option to wear it or sell it. You can only keep one hat at a time and each one has special benifits (like the Baseball cap lets you have 2 quests at once). The quests are completely random and generated so you may get the samething repeatedly but its still fun. I've never been a huge fan of playing fishing games but this one is just so cute and fun, and ADDICTING! There is some strategy to it as how to catch the bigger fish and you'll get the chance to modify your fishing rods to help you with it.\n\nPros:\n-Completely adorable\n-Mildly relaxing\n-Bright and colorful\n-Fun little quests\n-Upgrades to your equipment\n-Nice achievements\n-Still contains blood (when a bigger fish takes a bite out of your smaller fish)\n-Addicting\n\nCons:\n-Addicting\n-Mild blood (not particular good for little kids even if it's extremely cartoonish...don't know if you can turn it off or not)\n-Music gets a little old after awhile\n-Edit: Max lvl is 30\n\n10/10 I would recommend this game to people who hate fishing. :)","February 21, 2015","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play it for 5 minutes or 2 hours. I have found myself immersed in 2-3 hour sessions of this wonderful indie title.\n\nPros:\n\n- The art style is a perfect blend of cartoon and realism.\n\n- The quests, although some can be extremely difficult, present a nice balance of challenge, objective, and progression.\n\n- The developers are quick to patch bugs or errors and pay close attention to what the community has to offer. For examle, I posted a screenshot to show my friends that I had snagged my first legendary hat. I expressed that I felt that hat was slightly nerf. Within a week a developer had commented saying that next patch they would buff it.\n\n- The AI for the fish is that of a AAA(triple A) title. Each one of the 40+ fish in the game have a unique fighting style when hooked. Also, some fish travel together, chase eachother, and some will protect their "leader." I would like to write more about the AI but it would take hours.\n\n- The game progression is layed out perfectly, the larger, and harder to catch fish are father out at sea which requres the player to buy a boat, stronger fish are deeper, which requres the player to buy a better rod. The prices are layed out perfectly so when you dont get all the rods, then all the boats, air vice versa.\n\nCons:\n\n- The music can get a little repetitive, but this can easily be fixed.\n\nTo be honest there arent that many cons :)\n\nSuggestions\n\n- I feel this game could improve visually by adding in more customization options. These could include rod colors, boat, colors, boat names.\n\n- Lastly, on realism mode I think a day night cycle could be cool.\n\nFor 6.99 this game is 100% worth it!","February 21","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Judge it by its cover as much as you want to, you really get everything you'd expect by reading the title:  you are a cat, you go fishing, does really anything else need to be said?\n\nThis game combines all of the best parts of LolCats and fishing with out needing to get up super early in the morning, get cold (unless if you really want to), and wait around for hours for a fish to bite.  Fishing has become streamlined, there are upgrades, you catch fish.  If that doesn't sound appealing, I don't honestly know what does.  If you are going to buy this game, wait for it to go on sale.

This is how you do : firstly, catch a small fish, then use it as a bait to catch a medium one, and finally use the new bait to catch a large fish. The challenge is there : getting the big fish (shark, maw, ...) is not a piece of cake !\n\nYou will be rewarded with money by selling fish and completing quests. With money, you can buy new rods (+ upgrades, 8 different kinds, choose wisely), some useful devices/items (rockets, bombs, ...) and boats that allow you to catch more kind of fish by navigating on the sea.\n\nYou will also find hats while fishing : you can only wear one, so choose wisely in order to get the bonus you want ! You cannot stock them, you can only keep the one that you are wearing. Tip : I think the best one to wear is the baseball cap, because being able to have two quests at the same time is great, especially if you are stuck with one, since you cannot drop it.\n\nIn the end, this game is simple but pretty fun, even though it is a little bit grindy if you want to unlock everything and get all of the achievements.","February 1, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sound effects are really cute (especially Cat's disgruntled rumble when you bring up an empty hook), and the game's missions are straightforward and help you build up to bigger, better items.\n\nWith that being said, it gets stale pretty fast.  I haven't even caught every fish in the game, but my interest has fizzled down to 'I'll play it while I'm waiting to hear back from my friend' or 'ugh, I don't have time to play something involved before I have to leave...I'll play CGF'.

The premise is simple enough, and described perfectly in the title - you are a cat who has gone fishing, and your goal is to amass tasty fish, sell them for better gear, and collect cool hats which impact your game.  The sound effects are really cute (especially Cat's disgruntled rumble when you bring up an empty hook), and the game's missions are straightforward and help you build up to bigger, better items.\n\nWith that being said, it gets stale pretty fast.  I haven't even caught every fish in the game, but my interest has fizzled down to 'I'll play it while I'm waiting to hear back from my friend' or 'ugh, I don't have time to play something involved before I have to leave...I'll play CGF'.  Given my usual desperation to fill out lists, this is a bad sign.

You start out as a cat on the shore trying desperately to catch a fish, and eventually you level up until you are in a fast boat zipping across the seas :) I love the hat mechanic. Hats are randomly spawned in the water, and when you fish one up you can put it on or sell it. Each hat grants special abilities if you wear it. Rods can be upgraded, and you can purchase a rocket to go further OR a BOMB. Yes, you can put a bomb on your fishing rod. Epic. With the new update, there is nightfall- additional fish to catch. For people like me who played the game until it was fairly maxed out, this is super exciting. New fish, new challenges. What cat could resist?
