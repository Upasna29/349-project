"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/recommended/3720/","Thomas-","Chargeback Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/","748 products in account","Evil Genius is a base-building strategy game, similar to Dungeon Keeper.\n\nYou play as a malevolent mastermind during the cold-war era, with the sole aim of taking over the world.\n\nAs with all plotting masterminds circa 1970, you have a secret base built within a mountain on a tropical island, and of course, what evil genius is complete without his evil henchmen? These fellas are under your total command and do all dirty work you task them with. You start off by hiring basic henchmen, which carry out menial tasks such as construction or basic room staffing. These henchmen then branch into three different paths: military; science; and social. These paths each have four henchmen types each, ranging from basic guards, to valets, and mad scientists.\n\nHenchmen aren't the only things you'll find in your evil lair. There's a variety of room types to be constructed, from barracks for the men to sleep, or security rooms to manage CCTV cameras and hold prisoners. Your base requires power, and your staff have many stats (needs) that must be met. By building each type of room you can meet the demands of your ever growing lair. As you progress, more rooms and various objects for rooms can be researched via your science minions, allowing more depth to your base as well as better ways to meet the ever growing needs of your minions.\n\nFinally, no evil lair is complete without traps. Throughout your campaign for world dominance, you're bound to draw the attention of various justice forces. From agents who snoop for incriminating evidence, to burglars trying to steal back ill-gotten gains, building traps can have all kinds of nasty effects on intruding spies. From simple pressure pads and toxic gas, to wind corridors of death, the game offers a wide selection of traps with endless customisation for you to build the ultimate defence against intruders.\n\nOutside of your lair, hotels can be built on your island. Pesky tourists want to visit, and in order to keep them busy these establishments can be constructed to help prevent them wandering into your base. Social minions such as valets will man your hotels, and ensure tourists remain outside the base. Hotels can have a variety of recreational objects for tourists to pass time.\n\nAway from your island is the rest of the world. Accessed via the world map, you can deploy your henchmen all over the world to perform multiple nefarious acts. From stealing money, to plotting schemes. Henchmen can also be deployed on missions in each region to build notoriety, as well as steal priceless artifacts, or even research that can be used for new objects and rooms.\n\nThe game itself, in the spirit of most similar British games made in its time, has a strong sense of humour. These moments show in the little things, such as your evil genius gloating over agents locked in your prison cells, or torture scenes consisting of the torturer smoking a cigarette, whilst the unfortunate agent being interrogated begs for a puff.\n\nVisually, the game has aged amazingly well. Though the game was released in 2004, the clean and sleek aesthetic has allowed the game to remain as beautiful as it was at release. A rare accomplishment for many older games. Evil Genius visually competes with a lot of games released today.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a base-building game, look no further than Evil Genius. This game is both incredibly fun and absolutely stunning, whilst having plenty of depth and an amazing sense of humour. The game only offers a campaign mode, but will easily keep you playing for around 50 hours or more. If you find yourself wanting more, there are sandbox mods available for you to just freely build the ultimate evil lair.\n\nA brilliant game, even by today's standards, and one of the best PC games to have ever been released.","July 20, 2015","true","31.5"," 136 of 141 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","136","141","8","13"

Where other games similar to Dungeon Keeper failed, Evil Genius succeeded in so many ways while also creating a world that was unique in itself. The goal of the game is to build an evil secret base on a deserted island and further your plans of world domination. Be careful, however, for the forces of good will do everything in their power to stop you from fulfilling those dreams. You control everything from a birds-eye view where you build rooms and objects via "blueprints" which Minions then proceed to purchase and place for you. The game overall is very smooth and challenging. After all these years, I still haven't managed to beat the game and I bought it when it first came out! All in all, I love this game and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to rule the world and throw foolish special agents into giant mixer bowls.","August 29, 2015","true","41.8"," 68 of 74 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","68","74","11","3"

Before it was released on Steam, I had over 100 hours logged into this game spanned over 5 playthroughs. That's a few more than my traditional 0.5 playthroughs of most games.","November 25, 2013","true","81.5"," 53 of 56 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","53","56","0","0"

I have played and loved Dungeon Keeper 1,2 as well as Evil Genius.  Saying Evil Genius is a clone of  Dungeon Keeper is to me like saying Chess(EG) is a clone of checkers(DK).  There are similarities but one is a lot deeper and harder to master than the other.  There is nothing before or since like Evil Genius.  There have been attempts to do something like Dungeon Keeper  with mixed results.  No one has to my knowledge has  even tried with Evil Genius.  It is also the only game I know where so many people(like me) are crying for a sequel.  The game does have some flaws involving minion, space and gold management.  The learning curve is very steep at some points and it is not always intuitive how you do some simple things like interrogate a prisoner.  Even with the bugfix patch it can be a little unstable.  For the first time through, expect that you will have to go to the glossery and the internet for help and that you should save often.  Even on easy mode, Marimba Mamba (the weakest superagent) is most likely going to wipeout  many of your high level minions, steal some of your ill gotten goodies and blow up your power stations while you are checking on an act of infamy.  On the plus side there is a lot of humor and some replayability.  The graphics are dated but it still looks good.  It is worth buying this game, even at its non-sale price.","October 7, 2014","true","204.6"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","30","33","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayfromtheSun/recommended/3720/","JayfromtheSun","IT'S ME, AUSTIN!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayfromtheSun/","336 products in account","An old favorite of mine. I distinctly remember just seeing this on an EB Games shelf when I was 14. I loved the box art at first glance and upon further inspection, I discovered that this game involved the building of a secret island lair, from which countless dastardly schemes could be unleashed upon the world. "Perfect," said young Myself. The only reason I really remember this experience was because the oldest woman I have ever seen working at a video game store tried to get me to show her some form of ID because it was rated Teen. I told her I was fourteen years old and I didn't know of any kids my age who had IDs who weren't sheltered because I didn't know any of these kids because they were sheltered and sat at home playing games about learning and stuff and living life like an inspirational poster, only to dream secretly at night of escape and perhaps even breasts or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or whatever body parts they learned to like.\n\nAnyway, I bought this game, took it home and installed it and it ran horribly on my Compaq from the dark ages. I had what fun I could with it barely functioning, but ultimately it got tossed aside for a while UNTIL I GOT A DESKTOP THAT DIDN'T HAVE WINDOWS ME ON IT. I spent days installing games that I once thought were meant to run with the in-game models either upside down or simply invisible for the first time in double digit frames and with all of their visual effects present. I made my way through the pile and then suddenly arrived at this little gem from the past. I reinstalled it and away I went into my second world domination career.\n\nMy apologies for the story. Moving onto the game, you are tasked with the objective of constructing a hidden lair somewhere on some unknown island (where bumbling tourists and slightly less bumbling secret agents happen to wander to) with the intent of world domination. You must start smaller, however, and your options slowly unfold for you as you progress. It's pretty much Dungeon Keeper in a Bond movie setting. Over time you will research new rooms and equipment to further your schemes. Unfortunately, over time your enemies will become much less forgiving as well. You will eventually have to build a front, an island hotel to lure tourists in until they grow bored and leave. You will have to capture skilled individuals to train specialized minions. But most importantly, you will carry out evil deeds from your control center.\n\nThis brings us to the world domination portion of the game. This is basically a view of the globe on which you will place minion pieces used for stealing cash for your lair, plotting new heists and whatnot, and carrying out said shenanigans. These plots range from stealing the Eifel Tower to clubbing seals and to obliterating the city of Nashville, Tennessee, thus eliminating country music from the world; your singular act of goodwill throughout the course of the game. It's bursting with humor, much of it slapstick or parodic of spy fiction in general. If that's not your thing, you may not enjoy the game so much, but me? I can't get enough of it. I will say, however, that this is probably where the game struggles most. Playing from this sort of board game-like perspective can become pretty monotonous at times and you ultimately just spend a lot of time waiting. You have to keep a near constant check on it near the end of the game and this becomes nerve-wrecking once you're being bombarded by meddlesome agents at your home base at all hours of the day. Something in the interface to show a sort of minimized view of the information this screen provides during base construction/defense would have been nice.\n\nThe game is pretty tricky to figure out and will probably take a few practice runs to get the hang of before you can really start progressing. I'd say the first half or so of the game is learning all the intricacies where the second half is more of a "here's an island, go wild and work towards this ultimate goal" sort of thing. This is an objective-based game and there isn't much point to just letting your base idly run without moving forward in the story a bit. In that aspect, it's not particularly open-ended and this actually does restrict it quite a bit. Don't go in expecting any sort of free mode. There will be none of that. Of course, if you want, you can totally give yourself all the items and a ton of cash and just make your island into an insane deathtrap for incoming agents.\n\nWhich brings me to one of the game's strongest features: its base construction. You have a limited space in which to build your island stronghold and there isn't really one way you have to go about it. This is where the game most certainly gives you the most freedom. You can opt to have a very open base, with all of your rooms sort of running into one another for easy maneuvering. Or you can take the route of twisting, tight corridors chock full of traps both deadly and confusing to the enemy (or even your own minions if they're not careful). Your goal in base construction is more or less to keep your heat-generating rooms as far away from the entrance as possible, while keeping things like minion barracks and mess halls towards the front. Or you can always just fill the entrance corridor with flame pits and slaughter every intruder before they even get a chance to step through the door. The AI is just smart enough to keep you on your toes, yet dumb enough to get themselves into some silly predicaments fairly often. About the AI, though, it should be noted that your minions are not directly controllable while in your base (apart from your avatar and your handful of main henchmen), and this can lead to some awkward situations, often involving their unnecessary deaths or dismemberment.\n\nI could ramble about this game for a good while, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head that's worth mentioning. I would like to lay out some pros and cons, I suppose:\n\n+Wonderful base building; again, traps are a load of fun to play with\n+Great art direction and style; TF2 reminded me of this when I first saw it\n+Superb music\n+Lots of humor, though this is always subjective\n+Tough, but very satisfying to succeed at\n+Polish, polish, polish. I don't know of very many glaring bugs in the game\n\n-World domination feels kind of like playing a board game, which may not be what you'd expect from this and is also fairly monotonous/stressful as it almost always eats away your minions\n-Fairly steep learning curve. Some objectives are relatively unclear in their descriptions\n-Minion AI often leaves a lot to be desired. There is a henchman that will more or less destroy your base if he enters combat\n\nWould I recommend it? You bet. Almost every flaw present here can be looked past pretty easily.

I played this game for the first time many years ago, when i saw it on Steam i couldnt resist to play it again, this game is simply fantastic. The point of the game is simple, conquer the world, and to do this you need to build a secret base, steal money around the world, get notoriety doing acts of infamy and stealing legendary loot. It has the feeling of a 007 movie, but you are on the other side. This game is challenging and never gets boring, it makes you want to finish it over again, trying different ways, different building for your base. The part i loved most are the animations of the characters, they make the game humorous and hilarious, unforgettable the interrogation sessions, many times i let the enemies come inside my base because i was focused on the minions while training.

A game highly inspired by Sharks with frikkin laser beams attached to their heads, Tuxedo'd super agents (damn them all!) with never a hair out of place running into your hotels, opening all your doors and foiling all my evil plans... Kill him, killl him and SALT THE EART... Ahem, I'm sorry.\n\nSo Evil Genius is a lighthearted (although oddly tactical) game of how to be the Very Best Supervillain you can be.  Start with designing and building a secluded island base and move up to your very own volcano.  Employ henchmen and minions to do your evil bidding around the world.  Grow mad scientists to break the boundaries of physics for new traps, items and weapons! Pilfer, pillage and cause mayhem across the globe while torturing Persons of Interest and Super Agents in the most hilarious ways possible (cymbals, mixing bowls and moonwalking anyone?)\n\nIt probably sounds like I'm a huge fan of this game and I am, there's not many games that could have kept me coming back literally for years to replay.  It's an oldie, but a goodie, very modifiable, oddly detailed in very peculiar kinds of ways and extremely survivable for long years of playing -  owned it since the first release day many moons ago and still playing it, just found it on Steam and bought it here too with obviously no rugrats...

The game itself takes place almost exclusively on a tropical island that is home to your evil lair. It won't build itself though; the building and improvement of your lair is the main focus of the game.\n\nThe other main game element is the World Domination screen. The means, by which you actually make a name for yourself, collect resources and find new Henchmen.\n\nHenchmen are your specialist minions. They don't get involved in all the daily operations in your base, but instead are directly controllable and can be used to dispatch the forces of justice or can be sent around the world to help with any stealing or plotting currently going on.\n\nThroughout the game, tutorial videos become available to you, relating to both the world domination map and base operations. These are useful and certainly point you in the right direction.\n\nAnyone who enjoys constant challenge will find much to love in Evil Genius. The majority of the game's features function extremely well and the theme is rock-solid throughout.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n+ Amazing sense of humor, style, and polish\n+ Textures, filters, shading, and colors are used amazingly well\n+ Sound effects, garbled speech, radio broadcasts and so on are wonderful\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- The gameplay is a bit too slow","May 20","true","0.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","4"

It's a good deal of fun, basebuilding and minion management is interesting and very easy to pick up. The technology scaling is also a blast, leading to really entertaining trapbuilding (which could have been a game on its' own). The constant incursion of the forces of justice makes for a nice tense threat element, and the superagents can really do some damage if they have time.\n\nHowever the game is a touch buggy at times, so keep an eye out for stuck minions.

My actual playtime is roughly around 6-7 hours.\n\nNOTE:\nAll of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.\n\nTL:DR\nEvil Genius was a hard one to review, but alas, I've finally done it, and I can say that I'm quite impressed. I first played this a couple of years ago but didn't really like it back then. I thought, since its sitting in my library, I'll give it another go. It has turned out a lot better than I thought it would. You play as an evil mastermind, tasked at building your own base and gaining noteriety around the globe by completing devious missions. Basically being a James Bond villian. If base building is your thing then yes I would recommend this!\n\nAbout\nEvil Genius is a base building game, where you play as one of three different evil masterminds and attain noteriety across the globe by completing missions. If you've played games like Dungeon Keeper, this will be very familiar to you. You are first placed on an island, with a few tasks to complete. You are also given a huge mountain. This is where you build your base. You are given a selection of rooms to begin with plus gaining more the more tasks you complete. Pretty much simple right?\n\nGameplay\nObviously, for the kind of game it is, your camera is set from above so you can manage your base easily. The game isn't as simple as it seems. Plenty of things can happen at any given time such as blackouts, attacks, e.t.c. The game gives you tutorials on how to do things when they're needed so in some ways the game does hold your hand. As I mentioned before, there are three different leaders to choose from, all of which, are different in their own ways. But no matter which one, you always start on the same island. People who are familiar to these kind of games will find it easy. Newcomers won't find it hard to adapt.\n\nDesign/Graphics\nBeing a game from 2004, the graphics, of course, are a little bit outdated, but that didn't bother me at all, and it shouldn't bother you. Everything is clear to understand, and there're different graphics options to fit your PC, some of which might make the game look better for you anyway. As of the design, I can say that the island you start on is a bit plain in terms of detail, but that doesn't really matter since you're trying to build a base anyway. The rooms are interesting and can have added detail anyway. It's one of those games that doesn't try to be lazy when making it.\n\nUI [User Interface]\nAgain, for people unfamiliar to these kind of games, they might struggle on where to find things. Like I said earlier, there are tutorials on how to do things, but not everything. Sometimes the game leaves you to try and find out where things are and what they do. At some points I did struggle on finding my way through things, but again, you adapt. In terms of settings though, I never had a problem, nor should other people.\n\nPros - Interesting James Bond feel\n- Unique Idea\n- Plenty of entertainment\n- Sinister soundtrack :D\n- The game is quite humorous at times.\n\nCons - Can be confusing at times\n- Sometimes left at points where you have no idea what to do\n\nFinal Recommendation\nEvil Genius is one of those games that doesn't look amazing, but when actually played, suprises you. The idea of the game is what intruiged me the most. Playing as an evil mastermind that made you feel like a villain of James Bond is excellent in my opinion. Although sometimes confusing, Evil Genius makes up for it with It's excellent features and the enjoyment of annoying other countries. :D Worth buying if you like these kind of games, or want to get into them.\n\nFinal Verdict - 8/10.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHBsjmMM17w\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/3720/\n\nIf you liked this review, be sure to give it a like! I'm still learning. :)\n\nAlso be sure to follow my curator page here- http://steamcommunity.com/groups/narukoopasfriends#curation\n\nThanks for Reading!\n","January 30","true","3.5"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","1"

No, there's protocol. You gloat, you find his weakness, you cheat, you scheme, you start the unneccesarily slow dipping mechanism.\n\nAt it's core Evil Genius is Dungeon Keeper with a more simple RPG aspect and a wonderfully done 1970's coat of paint.

It's the same sort of game as Dungeon Keeper, where you play as the villain creating a base which will be raided, but in this circumstance you're a James Bond villain who needs to send your minions out to accomplish certain tasks while dealing with secret agents in a faux-60s style.\n\nIt's a lot of fun, but the mechanics can occasionally get in the way of the good time.

Taking control of this genius and his minions is fun but challenging. Players must keep in mind that while they are trying to opperate their base, minions will do their own thing. Your sort of at the mercy of these guys in some cases. This is where you might find a little flaw in the game. Sometimes minions won't do things as fast as you want or react to an intruder unless you tag or notify them. I had a tourist end up in my freezer. This guy walked right past a hallway full of minions and ended up in the freezer. Not to mention as I was locking the tourist up, investigators came in and started taking pictures. So be prepared for incompetence from minions. However, it does add to the challenge so I wouldn't completely call this a problem.\n\nWhile I'm technically still new to this game, I will say this game keeps me well entertained. From building to managing my minions on the world map, there's so much to do. Placing traps is also quite fun. Just make sure you get traps placed at the main entrance early. This may save you from having idiots trapped in your freezer. Just don't go too willy nilly on things you may not need right away. I had to start over after I accidentally wasted money on stuff I didn't need at that moment. Also, pay VERY close attention to how you use and distribute your minions. This is a crucial resource for making your lair run as smooth as possible. Keep this in mind when senting minions out into the world to do your bidding.\n\nOverall, This game is simple and just challenging enough that you will not get bored with it.","November 9, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

But it would be true nonetheless.\n\nThat's not a bad thing by the way. If you like that sort of thing then you'll probably get sucked into this as much as I did and  while I think I am now 'done' with it I did get plenty hours of fun.\n\nIt's good. Not perfect. But good.\n\nThe core of the game is base building and minion management and that all plays out in a similar manner to how you would expect if you've played a game like this before but where it differentiates itself a bit from the mechanics of Dungeon Keeper is that aswell as having enemies trying to break into your base and take you down you can also send out your minions into the world on missions and whatnot. Sending them on missions will earn you income, blueprints or new special henchmen and they kind of work like a modern Facebook game might in that you send people on a mission and then you just wait 5/10/15 minutes or whatever it takes untill it's done and you get a mission report. This aspect of the game can be a little annoying as time gating is rarely fun but there's always plenty of stuff to do around the base while these are happening, or you can always just make a sandwich or something. It's ok. And no microtransactions obviously.\n\nThe ai of your minions can sometimes be a bit dodgy aswell, but the game's 12 years old at the time of this review and frankly the ai can be a little bit dodgy at times even in modern releases like Prison Architect for example. So again. Like before.\n\nIt's good. Not perfect. But good\n\nFans of this sort of game will more than likely have an enjoyable time for X amount of hours","January 29","true","48.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The style of the game is its strongest feature; the music, art, and humor make it a joy to play, and really capture the tone of the spy thriller genre they're parodying. The UI could stand to be more detailed, although it'd likely make the game more difficult because there's hardly enough time to enter commands as is.

You start with money and basic rooms to start your fledgling base, and will gradually gain access to more rooms and minions as you carry out missions.\n\nPros -\n\n- The game is relatively easy to learn, with a quick tutorial to show you the basics, as well as a detailed glossary for every room and item.\n- The game is challenging enough to almost always keep you occurpied and thinking.\n- There is quite a bit of detail in the game, especially in minion animation and such.\n- Agent AI is acceptable, with them snooping around your entire base, unless you stop them with traps.\n- The game visual and audio assets are quite nice. The terrain is quite low-res and undetailed, but the models look colourful. Audio is also acceptable. Overall, aesthetically, pretty good for 2004.\n\nCons -\n- The game is very slow, and requires you to play for hours if you want to complete it. This is nice for some people, but boring for others, and you can sometimes be waiting for minutes to get funds so you can build something. There is also no time speed setting.\n- Although the game has enough features to make it fun, I feel that there could be more. There are only two ways of making money - The world domination screen, where you send out minions to provinces and tell them to steal, and stealing from tourists (something I haven't been able to figure out yet).\n- Pathfinding for the minions is mediocre. You will often find groups of 3 or 4 just standing by a door for a few seconds before continuing on their way.\n- Revising your base design to fit new rooms closer ot the entrace, for example, can be difficult. For a new player, who doesn't know what rooms they will get later may fill up any space, then have to destroy rooms/make rooms smaller etc. The problem is that building/removing/destroying rooms and objects takes time, which can be detrimental if your base is crawling with enemy agents.\n\nDespite the cons, I still find this game enjoyable.","February 9, 2014","true","24.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The shear joy of being that cheesy but funny James Bond villain is something you can't miss. The way you can make any room in any shape gives a lot of freedom to build and defend your base. The minion skill tree lets you prioritize what is important, technology, military or an even a blend of both.\n\nHowever there are flaws to the game. You can't build an infinitly sized base, or even build DOWN a floor. The base always stays on one level, and the mountain you use for a base can get really cramped. Also, the 'heat' system is hard to work. Any villainous act increases it, and as it increases, agents come to wipe you out. To lose heat you must not do any villianous acts for a long time. Bear in mind that to even get money, you have to steal it, so to lose heat, you must  Stop Earning Money.  It can get really annoying at times. But if you can get used to that, it is a really fun game, with a great concept and excellent execution. I just hope that sometime, Rebellion brings back Elixir Studios to continue work on a possible sequel to this great game.","July 2, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're always waiting on something or other, whether its for more minions to be trained up, stealing money to be completed, plotting to uncover new world objectives, or just waiting for pesky agents to leave you alone or give you room to do what you need to do. You're going to be clicking things for about 10 seconds and then waiting a few minutes for the payoff with nothing to do - thank god for steam overlay and the fact that it doesn't pause the game when you go into it.\n\nAll and all though, it's not a bad little game.

Although following a linear progression to 'World Domination' the game is suprisingly flexible, as your Evil lair is extremely customizeable ranging from the creation of room shapes, varied room types based on function, large and varied asortment of equipment to use for each function as well as the ability to demonlish sections and start over allows for the creation of large open areas full of equipment or snakey corridors ful of small very specific cubicles. Combine that with varied minions, stolen objects, Agents of Justice, Henchmen and traps creates for a very replayable expereince despite the linear storyline. The downside however is that it is an older game from a smaller studio reflected in some limitations as well as the very occasional bugs.","June 20, 2014","true","62.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Real time strategy base builder, the game is restricted to two maps that change throughout the storyline. Micromanage every inch of your evil lair in combination with uncontrolled simulated minions, as well as tourists who tend to wander in the wrong places and forces of justice from 5 different world powers that send out varied agents that disrupt your activities.\n\nFull of witty and occasionally dark humor this game offers a very fresh experience not often available in the gaming market. Although following a linear progression to 'World Domination' the game is suprisingly flexible, as your Evil lair is extremely customizeable ranging from the creation of room shapes, varied room types based on function, large and varied asortment of equipment to use for each function as well as the ability to demonlish sections and start over allows for the creation of large open areas full of equipment or snakey corridors ful of small very specific cubicles. Combine that with varied minions, stolen objects, Agents of Justice, Henchmen and traps creates for a very replayable expereince despite the linear storyline. The downside however is that it is an older game from a smaller studio reflected in some limitations as well as the very occasional bugs.","June 20, 2014","true","62.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/recommended/3720/","kentlang","Protesting Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/","230 products in account","Ok, here's the deal. You're playing an Evil Mastermind who wants to take over the world: Maximillian. Unless you're mad, female or cannot live without Lord Kane. You have bought an uncharted island far from any countries and now you're going to take over the world. Interested?\nThought so. The game starts out pretty bluntly with you, three minions and a henchman.  You get objectives that you need to complete in order to progress in the game. And the objectives kinda goes like this: Establish a base, Learn the Advanced Stuff, Prepare to take over the World and then you start building a doomsday device because... the most easy way to take over the world is to hold the world ransom apparently.\nTo your help you've got up to 100 Minions and ultimately 7 Henchmen that will ensure your security and that your goals become finished.\nBut of course the Forces of Justice would want to prevent you from this so they send you their "top agents" that got nothing else to do than to try and mess up your base. These forces are called\n\nS.A.B.R.E: European Agency that also protects Australia, South Africa and India.\nH.A.M.M.E.R: The Soviet Union. Protects Russia, Eastern Europe and Cuba.\nA.N.V.I.L: Communist China, protects the Philippines\nP.A.T.R.I.O.T: Americans, protects Japan too.\nS.M.A.S.H: Middle Eastern Agency, protects North Africa, Middle Africa, South America and Antarctica.\n\nI know what you're thinking: "What a bunch of cretins. How can they possibly stop my mastermind plans of taking over the world?" I would answer that they can't unless they bring in their super agents. Super Agents are agents that have sworn to demolish your base, kill your minions and steal that urn that you think would go well into your inner sanctum. The one you will find most annoying are the A.N.V.I.L Employed Jet Chan and he is your average martial artist hero that would love to run into a base full of heavily armed, evil minions without anything else than his knowledge of martial arts to back him up. And this isn't as suicidal in practice as it might sound. Jet Chan is pretty skilled at killing your minions and will with ease kill your toughest henchmen and taunt them afterwards.\nBut what is a henchman? He is a very loyal lackey that possess an extreme amount of endurance. So much so that he can only be killed by Super Agents. He does have three lives though so don't worry if he goes down once but if he goes down twice then you better load an earlier saved game. He is also very strong and can deal out loads of punishment. Some can deal more damage (Jubei, The Butcher), others have useful special abilities (Jubei, Lord Kane, The Matron) and others doesn't have so useful abilities and become useless tanks (like Moko, Eli Barracuda and Red Ivan).\nIn this game though, you don't control your minions. Instead they wander around the base and take care of themselves by their own initiative. So why do you have to be there watching your minions all the time? Because they're insanely stupid. They never take initiative and kill intruders, they always let them slip through your doors and even if they started to fight these agents they never seem to be in shape for doing so since they're prone to exhausting themselves in other activities, like manning the control room. If it wasn't for your evil intellect the whole secret base would fall apart. You do control them indirectly though: You can tag anyone except yourself and your henchmen which you want dead, captured or just confused. Your minions will then when they're either confronted by a tagged character or hear about a tagged character in the base loudspeakers, will drop everything they're currently doing and go and carry out the evil deeds.\n\nSo what do I think of the game? The feelings are a bit mixed. The game have several bugs which can be fixed by various members of the Evil Genius community. I have myself fixed a few in my bugfix file that you can find on the file page. The agent AI is quite poor since these guys likes to break into the base by force which alert you right away about their indiscretion. The gameplay tends to become pretty linear since it's often just the usual scenario of trying to man the control room and keeping the agents out of the base.  During the first part of the game it's pretty fun to try and take over the world but after a while when you get a more secure and impressive base you start to feel that the game starts to run itself. The agents kill themselves because of their stupidity, the minions go about their daily lives and you just sit in your chair and watch them wander around in your pretty base. You can try beefing up the game with more minions and funnier henchmen but that doesn't add variety to the game and variety is what the game so desperately needs.\n\nThe game is a pretty fun game that I enjoyed playing and although it looked more promising in the initial demo than in the finished game it still offers a decent amount of entertainment value. And this is one of these games that almost anyone can pick up and play since the difficulty is generally quite low. So I recommend this game for any casual gamers out there that wants easier games to play and those of you who just are looking for a fun game. If you're a hardcore gamer you might wanna skip this in favour for some other game like Dawn of War.","December 24, 2012","true","74.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The decore and technology all look like something from that era.\nInteresting progression system requiring you to complete acts of infamy.\nEasy to mod. Just unpack files and change values.\nHandful of unique henchman that you can directly control and have special abilities.\nA nice comedic take on some things. Interogations involves smashing their heads between symbols and spinning them in an office chair so it's not gruesome. Minions will stupidly work themselves into a coma, and if low enough on stats will even walk into your bases traps.\nYou can kill your minions to motivate the rest of them. Pretty wicked.\nA good variety of rooms and limited space makes planning a good idea.\n\nCons:\nBasically needs to be modded or it's painful to play on many levels.\n\nOnly 3 evil geniuses, and the wiki says maximilians passive bonus to research was never even added.\n\nBodies of agents you kill take forever to rot and drain your minions loyalty as they sit there, you can store them in the freezer to stop it but space is limited and they take twice as long to decay in there.\n\nConstant assualt from agents of justice constantly destroying your stuff, breaking your doors down, and robbing you. You end up having to kill them which leads right into the body bag issue and increases your head sending more agents.\n\nThe biggest rip off ever, you make extra security doors, and put traps around your base and agents just climb up through the ♥♥♥♥ing floor. One of the agents in my game crawled up in an in-accessable area of the room because there were gold bars blocking the path so she'd just shoot at people walking buy.\n\nMoney gain is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and painfully slow, you have to stick minions in the world map to steal funds but as they're there they get picked off by the local law enforcement and you only get the rewards for your efforts every 2 minutes or something like that.\n\n\nBasically the game has a great premise, I'd like to see it done with a bit more to it. I modded my game to make it more playable. Made money from world map collect every 20 seconds instead of 2 minutes (still takes quite a while since your agents will get wrecked by the local police). I made it so bodies increased loyalty instead of decreasing it so they actually seem like EVIL minions and not random people who took the first job they could get. I made the freezer increase decay rates so I wouldn't have mounds of bodies piling up.","April 1","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Remember San Andreas? Remember how the game was 100% more fun when you were spawning hyrdras and ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up? This game is kind of like that. Playing without cheats is a good genuine challenge regardless but it's ok to do some good ol' guilt free money cheats because freedom to build the base of your dreams is half of the fun. (Actually it's probably 90% of the fun; the other 10% is making examples the minions that displease you by shooting them / stabbing them in the neck with a curvy dagger /  burning a hole in them with a cigarette).\n\nThe art style is an overstylised...... early 80's?That reflects the whole OTT spy genre that was happening with James Bond and the whole USSR vs America with all of the inbetween cultural stereotypes thrown in like the ridiculously overdone accents for the respective world regions and a lot of the time this makes for some great satirical comedy.\n\nThe one downside for me is that there are definitely a few things that can use rebalancing but luckily somewhere on the interwebs there's a unnofficial patch that fixes a wide variety of minute but overall rebalancing aspects. I've had some fairly rare texture glitches and sometimes the agent models turn into inpromptu contortionists acts but frankly it doesn't even seem that out of place in a game that's main artistic drive is to completely overstylise the era.\n\n9/10\n","November 29, 2015","true","24.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/3720/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","Do you remember Dungeon Keeper? You know, before EA f#cking made a sh#tty phone version, KILLED IT FOR GOOD, AND THREW THE CORPSE INTO A MOTHERF#CKING GRINDER, TO THEN SERVE YOU IT'S ORGANS ON A PIZZA? Well, games like that still exist. And this one is a great example, mixing most of the good stuff from Dungeon Keeper to (I sh#t you not) the Austin Powers movies. Yeah... It sure as hell is a random f#cking mix. As usual, I will start with the stuff the game doesn't go right:\n\nFirst of all, the game only offers a story mode, with 3 humans to select for your main character. That's dissapointing, there's no Freeplay mode, there's no multiplayer, NOTHING. It also only has 2 islands, unlocking the second one midway the story. The lack of content is a real shame, as it could've help make this game stand out and live longer.\n\nThe second thing are the bosses. Later on, completely hilariously broken characters with start invading your island. However, this offers a really harsh challenge: You need money to keep your base up, however getting money will get you negative attention. Getting negative attention will make more people go to your island. The more people blowing stuff and killing your minions, the more money you'll need to keep up with everything. Is a never-ending death cycle that will probably end once you're out of the game for good.\n\nThe last thing I'll comment uppon is that the game hasn't aged well on performance. There's people who have issues setting the resolution to the game to a number that's actually good for them, and stuff like that.\n\nAll of that being said, what's left is a really good strategy game, which also has quite the amounts of comedy.\n\nThe biggest standout on this game has to be the designs, animations and graphics. THIS is a great example of cell shaded graphics well put to use. The animations for characters fit perfectly with the cartoony style and FOR F#CK SAKE, THIS GAME HAS THE BEST LOOKING MENUS I'VE SEEN. I'M NOT KIDDING.\n\nThe music and voices are also quite good, fitting perfectly with your role of a generic overly evil dude who wants to screw over everyone ellse.\n\nThe characters themselves are also quite entertaining, as you can unlock henchmen who are all parodies of a movie. Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction? You got it. A Russian Rambo/Arnold? You bet. There's even a ♥♥♥♥ing Ronin that reminds me of The Last Samurai, tons of stuff to choose. This hilarity also goes to the world map and events, were most stuff is just pure gold (until your troops are taken prisoners, that is).\n\nThe game also lets you fill the base with deadly and stupid looking traps, and set them to trigger on different ways. The best part about it is watching some of your staff trigger them as well by accident because their intelligence dropped to low, although that might suck as you'll have to get new ones. You can also interrogate people in some hilarious ways, some even being parodies, like using a GIANT F#CKING LASER ON HIM LIKE IF HE WAS JAMES BOND.\n\nDo I recommend this game? If you enjoy strategy games AND like games such as Dungeon Keeper, then I seriously wonder why don't you have it already. It's a really good game, and fun to play. However if you're not a fan of base-managing games, then that might turn your boner off.\n\nTL:DR Edition: Dungeon Keeper mets any Humour-based movie that parodies James Bond and similar stuff. Fun game, although a bit challenging at times. Get it on sale if you like that sort of stuff, totally worth it.","March 23","true","8.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

How close does it come?  Closer than anyone else, but not without a lot of new, and very avoidable flaws.\n\nMuch like DK2 the game revolves around you digging out multiple specialty rooms in your Evil Lair (Control Room, Armory, Barracks, etc.) to acomplish various tasks, and to keep your minions healed, happy, and armed.  The forces of good will also come wandering in to your lair in an effort to sabatoge your operation and must be kept at bay, or dealt with. You also have the option of building traps and security devices to keep intruders occupied, or dead...\n\nYou have the option to deal with the do-gooders in various ways. By default your minions completely ignore all enemies and neutral tourists unless they are directly atttacked. You must "tag" an intruder on your island with an action for your minions to take. These are either "Kill", "Capture", or "Befuddle".  Killing is the most straightforward way, but the downside is that a dead enemy leaves a corpse behind. If tourists or enemy agents see these your "heat" level increases for that particular faction. A higher "heat" level for a faction means that they will send stronger agents to your island and are much harder to deal with. To deal with the bodies you must build a freezer and storage racks to hide the bodies until they decay. You can kill anyone that looks at you funny, but you will run out of storage space quick. Another method to deal with them is to "befuddle" them. You have social minions like Valets and Spin Doctors who will attempt to confuse enemy agents and tourists. Once their Mind stat is reduced to zero the enemy will stand there in a daze and do nothing. Agents only have a fixed amount of time they spend investigating your island, so the more time they spend drooling on themselves the less time they have to throw monkey wrenches in your plans.  The third option is to "capture". Minions will attempt to knock the victim out and then drag them to a holding cell. From there you can either kill them, or interrogate them. Interrogation is only useful against skilled civilians so that you can train your minions for that profession, otherwise it is a complete waste of time.\n\nOne thing that sets the game apart from the DK series is the use of the world map.  Not only must you build and maintain your evil lair, but you must send your minions out into the world to Steal, Plot, and cause Mayhem to further your evil goals. It is a very unique addition, but has numerous flaws that make it more of a pain than a pleasure.  The world map is split between 4 different alliances, each alliance having 4 separate territories. Each territory has an income and a security rating. The income number shows how much your minions can steal from that territory, and the security rating determines how much heat your illicit activities will generate. You won't know what these numbers are unless you have a specific number of Control Panels in your control room properly staffed.  You also have access to various evil missions to send your minions on. These include kidnapping specialists for interrogation, stealing valuble loot, and regular story advancement mission.\n\nTHE FLAWS\n___________________________\nThe game, unfortunately has many, many flaws that should have never happened.  For starters the controls are terrible and very unintuitive. Almost everything is done by right-clicking. Left is generally only used for selecting your Avatar/Henchman and to drag out room building templates.  What game uses the left button only 10% of the time?   The World Map controls are just as terrible.  Scroll speed depends on how fast your PC is, so old PCs have a reasonable scroll speed, but on newer ones you will constantly overshoot the place you are trying to scroll to.  This is very irritating when you are frantically trying to tell your minions to go in to hiding so they aren't caught by the investigator agents who randomly deploy across the world and kill your minions.  Speaking of which, when those agents deploy you have NO WARNING! While you are desperately trying to fend off agents invading your lair, about 80% of the places you have minions deployed on the world map will suddenly have an investigating agent deployed there as well, and if you don't luck up and check the world map at the right time all of your minions will end up dead after about 10 seconds.  The World Map button will sometimes tell you have have minions being killed, but by the time it tells you it's way too late.\n\nKeeping enemies from casually wandering in to your base and investigating your freezer full of corpses, blowing generators up, or stealing gold is unreasonably difficult. As I mentioned before minions completely ignore enemies unless manually told to do something about them. There is no "default" action you can set for enemies so you have to manually assign an action for EVERY enemy individually. Good luck with that level of micro-management when you have two separate screens to pay attention to, neither of which can be automated in any helpful way.  Traps and Security Cameras are supposed to help with this but both are complete wastes of money.  Traps can only be triggered by an enemy activating a pressure plate, tripwire, or motion detector. The problem is that these can NOT be placed on the actual trap, they must be placed next to it (or anywhere else, but that is even less useful). When placed next to the trap the enemy will, 90% of the time stop on top of the triggering device while the trap gos off harmlessly next to them. If it does manage to trap an enemy it has an equal or better chance of trapping your minions as well!  Security cameras are just pointless. They are supposed to alert you to intruders and then deploy minions to deal with them. The cameras only alert if an enemy has been "tagged" previously. Enemies that havent been tagged will be ignored. Even if an alert is sounded only minions within earshot of a loudspeaker will be deployed.  All of these things are complete wastes of valuble cash.\n\nDealing with enemies is needlessly difficuly as well. Enemy Agents will always be armed and you have the option of arming your minions, but only if you have built the proper gun cabinets, and only if your base is on Yellow or Red alert.  The rest of the time they return the guns to the armory and if enemy soldiers start raiding they will gun your helpless minions down before you can issue the alert. This makes some sense for your regular minions, but why aren't your guards armed 24/7? Your only real defense is your Henchmen, the only guys that you can manually control besides your avatar.  They can easily deal with weaker agents on their own, but require backup if faced with numerous opponents. You start with one, but can recruit more later on. One word of advice, avoid the ones that use explosives, they will kill your own guys more often than your enemies. The best method of dealing with potential intruders seems to be using the "befuddle" option if you have a lot of social minions. Yes, it requires 1 minion to be occupied with each target, but it saves freezer space and doesn't raise your heat level.\n\nHotels are a complete joke. They are super-expensive, require staffing, and produce no income. Better off stuffing their corpses in the freezer.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n_______________________\n\nA worthy attempt to recreate the magic of Dungeon Keeper. Some horrid flaws keep it from being a true successor, but it is well worth your time and money if you loved DK2.","October 7, 2014","true","33.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Everything from the aesthetic of the game to the wacky voice-overs when you complete missions is charming and memorable. This is a game I regularly come back for not just for the excellent gameplay, but the metagame lore is just as enchanting(Mixer, anybody?).\n\nPros\n- Constructing a base in any way you're interested in (corporate facade, death trap, hotel facade)\n- Those visuals dude, iirc TF2 took some inspiration from this game's art style\n- Quirky humor, but unexpected tidbits of brilliance\n- Valet minions sleep during 1-on-1 training and I find that unreasonably hilarious\n\nCons\n- Quirky controls when demolishing or fixing rooms (plan ahead plan ahead plan ahead)\n- World map agents automatically unhide after a too short interval (can be fixed in configs)\n- World map isn't really all too exciting when you only get 100 minions maximum without changing configs (reducing base defenses/activity)\n- Only 100 minions maximum..... unless you edit it to like 500 like I did :p\n\n$10 for one of the most memorable games is a steal, if you find it on sale for less don't second guess yourself... pick it up!","January 27, 2015","true","37.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Manage your evil lair, send out your minions to various missions, defend yourself against hordes of cannon fodder agents or special agents, hire high ranking criminals to be your right hand man, be evil and execute a rebellious minion or a captured agent to raise moral of the troops.\n\nPlaying the role of a evil character is really refreshing planning how to build your hideout with all the rooms you need and might need to set your evil plans in motion. Rasing your infamy to lure more high ranking criminals to your side. Research technology, weapons, rooms and traps for your lair. In this game you can fullfill your evil mastermind needs to the fullest.\n\nThis game has a great community and as far as I can tell, most players actually fell in love with it and cry out for a second game which we sadly might never see in this generation. If you liked the real Dungeon Keepers franchise (not the latest fake one) then you might actually like Evil Genius or Banished both are going a similiar direction.\n\nI'd really love to tell you all about the game but I am wonderfully lazy. So treat yourself to a wine well matured and acquire this game one way or another, who knows maybe a friend has a cd somewhere with extra stuff on it.

Picked it up relatively late (2015), but it seems to be all the fun it was back when it was released back in 2004. In many ways it reminds of the old James Bond movies, only that you play the villain. Gameplay wise it is a real time strategy, in which you build a lair into a mountain on a remote island. Then you recruit minions, expand your lair, research and upgrade technology, and last but not least deceive or eliminate visitors or enemy agents. You can also run missions in different parts of the world, granting you all sorts of rewards. Evil Genius is actually quite a complex game with many upgrades, research options, traps.. basically lots and lots of options to customize your lair and get expanding/researching. There is no fast forward, which makes sense considering your missions in the world are on a fixed timer, and your minions out there will get killed pretty fast if you don't check in on them occasionally. There are only two maps, although you will spend many, many hours on each of them. It's a slow game, but very rewarding if you take your time.","December 31, 2015","true","49.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You get henchmen to buld your base, guard it and even fool turists to try and keep your activities unknown.\n\nSadly there are only 2 levels, but with all the reasearch and the length of time missions can take this is a game you can play for hours on end with the many different traps and science devices you can strap agents too, uncluding a laser like the classic bond film, Gold Finger. One hell of a buy if you ask me :)\n\nA suggestion when playing this game is to alter the files so you can get more minions as I find 100 is too few, especially when you run into secret agents who can end up killing over 50 henchmen before collapsing and you can't get rid of them until you learn their secret weakness on the second level.\n\nAlso I believe the research file needs to be fixed. Research on google to find out the fix.\n\nI've heard that there is meant to be a sequal in the works, but it's on the back-burner at the moment and I hope it doesn't become like DK3 where it became a mobile game instead. This is a really fun game that you can get many hours out of and with a lot of dungeon keeper like humor.","January 5, 2013","true","20.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

THAT is a lie. When I first purchased this game, I played it for 4-5 hours until moving on to something else addicting. When I came back to this, it said I had 1 ♥♥♥♥ING MINUTE. I knew for a fact that that was a lie, but maybe I was playing offline or something. Ok, now to the real review...\n\nREAL REVIEW:\nME: Evil Genuis! The critically aclaimed game by everyone ever!\nMINION: Sir, no big companies have critically aclaimed this game at all so that is a-\nME: GAURDS! KILL THIS TRAITOR!!!\n\nREAL REAL REVIEW:\nOk, this is the real review this time. So, Evil Genuis, a game alot like Mastermind exceot the fact that it cost money and has alot more features and not to mention alot of more time that you will most likely be depositing into this masterpeice.\nHave you ever wanted to destroy the world? No? How about take over it? No? How about torture the people that inhabitate it because you can? NO?! ♥♥♥♥ it then, just become a god damn useless island where tourist come to see the sites. You can do all those things and more in this base building, strategy, world domination/tourist island/ torture island/ world destroyer simulator. The main goal that your supposed to fallow is to conqure the world in various ways. It can be very, VERY difficult to start out but you will surely handle the ropes right eventually. One thing to keep in mind while playing this, NEVER be too ambitious when it comes to building your base. I started out my first time by trying to completely fill up the mountain with as many rooms as possible, at first I ran super low on money and it ended up taking me 2 hours to get it a quarter way done, then secondly I had to take almost all of it down because I had unlocked other rooms I needed in the mountain. Oh yeah, forgot to mention that you build your base in a mountain. You can also build tiny houses outside of the mountain to build bases in, but be careful since tourist or spies can get easy access to them and report them to the country they came from. Ofcourse you could always just capture them before they leave and torture them  if you wish. Also, waiting is a huge factor in this game, but you can shorten the wait time by spending gold (which is in game money) to shorten it. Before you say anything about pay to win, keep in mind that this game is 1: not F2P and 2: has no micro transactions. If the government is becoming to hard to handle, or if you just wanna see something funny happen, set up traps in your base so the government forces will run into them when infaltrating your base. There's alot of stuff to do in this game that I haven't mentioned and all this talk about the game make me want to go back to playing again, so i'm off to take over the world!\n\nTL;DR?\n10/10, the best game I have EVER played. But I have a weird taste for games so you may or may not enjoy the game. Also, waiting is a huge factor if you wish to not spend much money (in game money ofcourse).","January 22, 2015","true","19.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It has a very unique, well-presented concept : you get to play as a James Bond villain, complete with the stupid minions, eight-feet tall bodyguards and shark-filled traps. The art and concept teams did a great job, creating very interesting characters and buildings that makes you want to unlock everything and to find out what the game has to offer.\n\nThe one problem this game has is its pace, and it's, sadly, a crippling issue. No matter how well optimized your base is, you will spend most of the game waiting endlessly for minions to be recruited, trained and outfitted so you can attempt missions. Those "missions" only require you to have the right number of henchmen, to click on a button and to wait (and hope) until the mission succeeds or fails. That's it. You don't get to do anything else, you don't get to command your soldiers as they attempt to steal a german satellite or whatever you sent them out to do. Clicking "Start mission" and waiting. That's all there is to this game besides base building and it's a little underwhelming.\n\nThen again, it would all work perfectly if you did not have to wait for dozens of minutes for your henchmen to be recruited and trained for missions. The worst part is that you always have to choose between waiting less or playing efficiently : recruiting minions faster costs money, so if you want to use your money carefully (and you will), you need to wait even longer. Same goes for your missions : you need to send henchmen away from your base so they can steal money... which makes your missions' progress even slower, because the henchmen you're using to steal money can't go on missions. There is no way to increase the game's speed either. It's like the developers really wanted the player to choose between waiting for long, unproductive minutes or to use his hard-earned funds to actually keep playing the game. It's not rewarding at all and makes the whole game feel like a grind.\n\nI have played about twenty hours because every once in a while, I tried giving the game another chance, reinstalled it and started another playthrough, only to get tired of it at the same point, after five or six hours, every time. It's just so terribly slow, so full of waiting and almost devoid of actual gameplay besides the base building that is also very, very slow once you spent your initial funds (because earning money in this game is also very slow and difficult). To me, Evil Genius will always be the game that could have been, and that never will be.","September 28, 2014","false","18.9"," 55 of 135 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","55","135","0","6"

It is very buggy and crashes frequently.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and can get very repetitive however it does have the secret of "just one more quest" value to keep you going.\n\nThe base requires constant supervision if you want to maintain you supply of minions and henchmen.\nThe humour is weak, mostly dad jokes or plays on every old Bond film you have ever seen.\n\nThe difficulty level spikes considerately when your  notoriety level increases making the game a grind of creating minions, protecting them and then losing them on a mission. Wash and repeat.\n\nAlso frustratingly, the AI control of the minions is as dumb as mud. They constantly wander into your own traps and blindly run off on low priority tasks even after using your overlord to set a high priority on an urgent task.\n\nAll in all I don't think this is a game to appeal to many but  I will complete it for my own satisfaction.\n\nAdditional: I managed to complete the game after a few restarts despite the bugs.

You play as the typical James Bond villain, with 8 feet minions fighting for you as you forfill your dreams of world conquest. This concept could of worked, very well. But Evil Genius completely crushed this golden oppurtunity with terrible AI, and tedious grinding.\n\nOne of the HUGEST problems with Evil Genius is the way your "Minions" work. In a game like this, you're supposed to feel like a badass, as you epicly fight through enemy soldiers with your loyal army of minions. But in Evil Genius, you don't feel like a badass, you feel like a victim. As soldiers wave through corpses of your minions while your remaining soldiers constantly desert you every 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes.\n\nThe only way to keep up your minions "loyalty" is by interrogating enemy investigators/soldiers you captured. Which is extremely hard to do depending on the way you play. Minions drain on loyalty completely every 3 minutes, and depending on your heat trespassers barely ever show up.\n\nWhile their not busy constantly deserting, their busy going insane, getting stuck in a corner on a big piece of nothing as they suck up minion space.\n\nSo then your last saving grace is a henchman, which you only get about 3 of in the time you play.\n\nEvil genius can be fun in the first couple hours, but it gets REALLY frustrating, REALLY fast.","August 4, 2015","false","28.2"," 8 of 41 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","8","41","2","3"

The Bond-villain style of the game is really fun and funny, and the idea of building your island lair up from scratch has some real appeal to it. But in the end this game simply is far too shallow and repetitive to be enjoyable in the long term.\n\nThe art design is charming, and so are the animations and sounds, but the meat and potatoes of the gameplay simply loses its appeal far too quickly.\n\nThe base building mechanics are solid and the traps are fun to build and use, but there is no differentiation between islands, and you are often restricted in the size of base you can build. Research can grant you more expensive but more space efficient versions of existing technology, but deleting old building plans within the confines of limited space and starting over is a real pain.\n\nThe minion AI is atrocious, which I suppose is intentional, but it is also lazy developing. Your minions will constantly die in your own traps, and minions make no distinction between themselves as far as their role goes. Your ever so valuable third tier minions are just as likely to stumble into the gas pit attempting to kill an intruder in hand to hand combat and die as a plain worker is. I don't even want to start talking about how repetitive the evil missions are.\n\nThese are just a sampling of the problems with the game. Overall, I would say it is a fun little game that is not worth more than a couple dollars.","December 31, 2013","false","14.0"," 22 of 89 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","22","89","0","0"

Also the interface is kinda weird and substandard, the world map minigame is simplistic and trite (IIRC), and the superheroes who invade can be too frequent and incredibly irritating.\n\nIf there's a community mod out there to fix the bugs and annoyances, then by all means give this unique game a shot.

Dungeon Keepers, Overlords - yeah, this game wrestle on that series of games. It's setting bows heavily to the direction of classic James Bond movies with twists and humour that's kind of like Adam West's "Batman", "Maxwell Smart" or "Man and Naked Gun". Basically you build a lair, train minions and send them to do their wicked works all around world. This produces resources that can be used to upgrade lair and train minions. Island where lair is under constant watchful eye of few spy organizations which get more interested about your lair when you rob them, kidnap their citizens, assasinate their citizens etc. They send spies and saboteurs to ruin your lair and plans while your minions and traps are the only thing prevemting them. Both your opponent organizations and you have special characters with special powers which can be decisive in critical times. If you have played Theme Hospital, Dungeon Keeper or Sims you find game easily approachable, fun, twisted and enjoyable, casual little game. If you prefer RTS games with more realistic or "serious" tones with lots of manageable factors you might not like this one. But in the end, this games' strong sides lay on the humour and it devious evil geniusness.","December 1, 2014","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I had to warn a  player what not to do, it would be to block off any part of your base. If you make a spot unreachable by your minions, agents will just burrow in there to figure out what you're trying to hide from the forces of justice. Some crafty players even take advantage of this to make trap rooms (with no other way in or out) just to trick agents into these death traps.\n\nFor an older game, it would be safe to say it's still very fun and not clunky like a lot of other older games that would be called 'classic' to get you to forgive technology and graphics.

Gameplay is simple yet intricate which yields a wide variety of possibilities\n-Characters/Units are amazingly colorful. Everything from animation to voice overs are drenched in\n-Easy to learn, difficult to master\n\nCons:\n-Base Construction is slow at first due to Unit pathfinding problems.\n-Base & Unit Micromanagement gets tedious at higher levels because Unit pathfinding is mediocre. Units forget what theyre doing or stop what theyre doing all together randomly, which gets frusterating when defending your base from incoming spies, building large facilities, or sending alot of units out on large missions\n-Needs more depth/content. This is me nitpicking, because i know how old the game is and is something a sequel would address...but for me...the only reason i stop playing Evil Genius is because it simply leaves me with alot to be desired.\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you ever wanted to live out the most devious fantasies of Dr. Evil from Austin Powers, this is the game for you.\n\nScore:\n8.75/11","October 5, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the gameplay front it does many things poorly, several in game factors collaborate to frustrate the player. Stupid minions running one by one into their deaths, while you can only watch their folly. Pesky invulnerable super agents destroying your base. Traps being somewhat poorly balanced. There's no way to turn off just the announcer's warnings - you'd have to turn off all sounds. The pacing is very slow at the beginning. There are only two islands on which to construct your bases - no random maps, no skirmish mode. Specialist science minions and social minions have little to do. Acts of infamy provide little tangible benefit...\n\nHow can the game be any good then?\nBecause of the things it does good, it does really well. And there are very few games similar to this (Dungeon Keeper being the closest).\nIt's all style over substance. The art direction, themes and music (particularly title soundtracks) are just spot on and so perfectly captures the idea of playing Bond-film like villain, constructing a secret base in order to take over the world! The animations are superbly done, cartoony, but appropriately so. Thus even though the game is 10 years old, it still manages to look alright.\n\nIf the theme and management style in any way appeals to you give this game a try, but if you enjoyed Dungeon Keeper this is almost a must-play in my opinion.","December 30, 2014","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I had to warn a  player what not to do, it would be to block off any part of your base. If you make a spot unreachable by your minions, agents will just burrow in there to figure out what you're trying to hide from the forces of justice. Some crafty players even take advantage of this to make trap rooms (with no other way in or out) just to trick agents into these death traps.\n\nFor an older game, it would be safe to say it's still very fun and not clunky like a lot of other older games that would be called 'classic' to get you to forgive technology and graphics. But, considering you can zoom in and see great detail - this game is polished.\n\n"He who walks ... arrives." -My Favorite Evil Genius","December 26, 2014","true","46.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything in it is slow, minions moving around, building the bases, buying new items, they move very slowly when doing this and sadly there's no speed X2 or X4 buttons. Making it seem to take forever to get started. Earning money in the beginning when you don't have good ways of reducing heat, which determines how many and how strong the agents that attack your base are, is very difficult. Best option is to send out a very small number of minions to steal in order to keep the heat down, but this takes a long time with so few and again no speed up button so it drags some. The ai of the minions is just, well there isn't any to be honest. They aren't smart. At all. An agent will blow up a door, set itself on fire, your minions will rush to put out said fire as the agents kill them because their ai says they were attacked, by a door, that they blew up. So your minions turn into a shooting gallery for them. It seems the game really needed a lot more work and sadly won't get it. AI's horrible, interface can be challenging, everything takes what feels like hours to do. And yet I still find myself playing it. Maybe it's just the fun of being that evil bond villian, laughing maniaclly as secret agents get tossed around by your death traps or as you just randomly kill a minion for failing you, or for losing loyalty, or just because. Not a game many will like, but it's worth the try, if just to set up a death corridor and laugh as people get tossed around.","October 7, 2014","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I love it.\n\nEvil Genius is an evil lair simulator, with emphasis on planning the base. The retro-styled, goofy supervillain theme to the game reminds me of Austin Powers (which I like). You have to build your base so that your minions (which you cannot control) can work efficiently, but that also keeps out the forces of justice. Most of the minions work independently, and you must "idiot-proof" your base for the simple-minded AI. Sounds like a bad thing, but I enjoyed the design challenge. You also have to send out minions to steal money, which is also mostly non-interactive.\n\nMy main complaint is that this game can be very slow, as you wait to earn cash. Expect to put the game on cruise control for long periods of time. I also recommend modding the game to increase the max minion capacity.\n\nI would gladly recommend this at $10.

Have you ever fantasized about being Dr. Evil and designing your own secret lair?   Well then this is the game for you!  It is funny, forgiving, and challenging.  Basically it is a city-building game, with the "city" being your lair.  You use your lair to train and recruit minions and henchman.  These will be sent out into the world to create HYSTERICAL acts of infamy and destruction.  You acquire insane loot and work towards world domination, all the while holding back the forces of good (including Super Agents a la James Bond).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/3720/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Where to begin? I guess with the beginning.  Evil Genius starts with a short FMV giving you the basics of what your about to do.  Build a secret lair in a mountain, perform various Act of Infamy, research various things, and ultimately create your Doomsday Device.  When you start in the game proper you have but a handful of Minions and a single Henchman, your pick of Genius determines which Henchman you get at the start.  I quickly set off and ordered my Minions to build me base, starting with the Corridors and moving on to Barracks, Control Room, and a Mess Hall.\n\nAll this base building costs money, and while you do start with a few funds, it’s nowhere near the amount that you’ll need if you plan on creating a Doomsday Device that will bring the Forces of Good to their knees.  For this we have the World Domination Map, where you send your minions off to different regions to steal money or preform Acts of Infamy.\n\nNow here’s where one of my little personal tricks comes into play.  I discovered this about two or three playthroughs ago.  The best way to get the most money right at the start without the heat or agents from the regions getting suspicious of you and investigating your island.  You can do any Acts of Infamy or Stealing, as much as you want, before you complete the mission involving capturing the maid.  No agents will come looking for you until you capture her.  So, I recommend building your Lair as much as you can, and build a massive Barracks full of Lockers(these determine how many Minions you can have).  With enough you can hit your Minion cap and send all of them out to different regions to steal money.  Leave the game running and come back later, I let it run overnight, and you will have a nice pile of gold to get you started.  Just also remember to bring all your Minions back and let it run for a little longer.  Since you will steal acquire Heat, so you want to give some time to let that fade off.\n\nNow is that cheating?  Or is that truly winning at the game and bending the mechanics to better suit your needs?\n\nNow after a few hours you’ll have a pretty nice Lair going for you, probably with some spiffy traps, and plenty of Minions of various types wandering around doing your bidding.  And yes, I do mean hours.  My personal biggest complaint about Evil Genius is it’s lack of game speed control.  There is no way to speed up time in any manor, and so there can be times where you just play to wait.  And that can get boring.\n\nEventually you’ll make it to the second Island, and this is where the fun really begins.  The is the best part of that game, in my opinion, and really this whole thing is all about my opinion, so therefore, this is the best part of the game!\n\nWhat do you do first on the second island?  Why build a new Lair of course!  That old island with that old and inferior base that you spent hours getting perfect is now replaced with a new and improved Lair.  You’ve got more space to spread out with and the experience to know how you want to be set up.  But you also have the Forces of Good still being a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, the amount of which is directly proportional to how much of a ruckus you created prior to moving to the new island.\n\nAt this point I stop telling you how to play, or what exactly happens when you play.  You have to just go and play it.  Trust me on this.  While you’ll complain at the total number of hours you’ve spent playing it, you’ll know that every minute of that time was spent being the best Evil Genius you could and loving every minute of it.  You may, probably will, get irritated at your Minions from time to time, as the AI does seem to just slip here and there.  But overall it’s never anything truly gamebreaking, and these time are sparse enough that you wont even remember all of them.\n\nYou can really push yourself, and your own morals, as to what it takes to be an Evil Genius.  Does it end with beating the game?  Or is it more than that?  After all, almost all the game files are written in Excel spreadsheets, and can altered in any way you choose.  A quick Google search will result with a list of in game cheatcodes.  Is using these cheating?  Is altering the games core files to better your success cheating?  These types of actions could be considered being nefarious, something which the game itself rewards you for being.\n\nThe graphics and stylized look of Evil Genius both seem to have held on well with the times.  While you can tell it’s a dated game, its not so blinding obvious.  The music too is a perfect fit for it’s visual look.\n\nI have only three real complaints about Evil Genius.  One you cannot effect the passing of time, two you cannot zoom out far enough, to my personal liking, and three I had to fix the resolution every time I started the game.  But hey, if that’s my only compatibility issue, I’ll live.","May 16, 2013","true","126.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those of you familiar with old James Bond movies, with feel right at home with this games comedic foundations. The game will have you developing traps that open the floor to a deadly pit of saws one minute and then have you interrogating a prisioner with Micheal Jackson choreography the next.\n\nThe game oozes with charm. Not only that, but the game offers a solid strategic challenge as well. You will find yourself having to keep track of both your base activies and your world domition tactics on the world map (Think total war, but with everything happening at once). This sense of micro-management will never leave you bored, or unatentive. The game always presents a obstacle for you to overcome, rather that be enemy agents trying to inflitrate your base, a power failure leaving your base vunerable or trying to keep pesky tourists from wondering into your evil lair the game consistently presents you with challenges, some difficult some not, and never at any point leaves you with nothing to do.\n\nOverall, this game is ranked in my Steam favourites. The game is genuinly funny and light hearted. It presents challenge with its gameplay, has a addictive formula to boot and is a hit for those who are fans of games like Dungeon(s) Keeper, Tropico and the like.","June 19, 2011","true","36.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ricotez/recommended/3720/","ricotez","Ricotez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ricotez/","336 products in account","I don't know any other games that embrace the Spy genre with this much style. Everything about this game, from the music to the characters, is meant to fully immerse you into a world of minions and doomsday devices.\n\nThe concept is simple. You are an average Bond villain, and you want to take over the world. In order to do so you need a base of operations (which you have to lay out and build yourself), an army of minions (who live in your base and are trained into better jobs there) and a control room that lets you send your minions across the globe to steal money for you and carry out devious schemes. But this attracts the attention of the 5 superpowers in the world, who will start sending investigators and agents to your base. As your global notoriety climbs, you have to manage your heat or you will become overwhelmed by the number of investigators and soldiers sent to  attack your base.\n\nThe game is an incredible lot of fun to play. Although your first base design will inevitably suck, the more you play the better you will get at it. (Also, a minor spoiler: halfway through the game you move to a new base, which lets you fix any mistakes you may have made that playthrough... Only to make a bunch of new ones, of course.)\n\nBut I also have two gripes. First of all, you can issue basic orders and give anyone on your island a tag that determines what must be done with them (jailed, dazed or killed), but you cannot directly control your minions. This is understandable - you ARE the mastermind, after all - but can get quite frustrating when all of your minions are busy and you really need something done. Fortunately you can directly control your henchmen, who may not be able to build or do much work around your base, but who are very good at killing, dazing or jailing intruders.\n\nSecond of all... The game has a lot of bugs, and most of them are really minor and solved by the Unofficial Patch. Why no such patch was ever brought out officially is beyond me. There are also game breaking bugs: for example, once you place down the conference table in the first island, you may not move or delete it or your evil genius can no longer sit at it. This, of course, halts progression and gets you stuck.\n\nFortunately these two problems are not extremely big, and have not ruined my fun yet.

There are awesome (but slightly lengthy) animations for EVERYTHING, tons of campy spy-thriller charm, and you get to play the bad guy which is another thing I like to see. Playing the villain. Okay, on occasion, not often, some villains are just terrible and poorly written.\n\nMicromangement is the name of the game as you juggle constructing a working evil lair while performing acts of infamy around the globe while keeping the lair safe from goody-goody-do-gooders-goody-two-shoes-long-gag. Chances are you'll screw up too if you don't know what you're doing. Especially later on. Not to mention that there are a couple glitches here and there that can potentially break the game.\n\nGo to Evil Planet (a old but still functioning website) and do some research there before making a run, it'll help. Also the game still runs perfectly well on Windows 7 (dunno about 8 yet) which is better then a few games on Steam that I can think of.\n\nKeep in mind that it is LONG though. It's all strategy gaming which means that things will be moving slowly, which is preferably since it only takes an instant to royally screw up and be forced to grab an earlier save file to make up for the huge losses (see: EVERY SINGLE SUPERAGENT APPEARANCE AT YOUR LAIR).\n\nWatch a bit on Youtube, see if it's your thing, maybe pick it up on sale (as small a chance as that would be).","November 18, 2012","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timebolt/recommended/3720/","timebolt","Timebolt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timebolt/","70 products in account","Want to rule the world like a James Bond Villain?  Want to laugh maniacally as the world falls at you feet?  Want to show those James Bond wanna bes who's the boss?  Want to spend more time building your evil lair than taking over the world?  Want to spend most of your time waiting for your money to build up?  Want to micromange every little detail when your minions should be doing the job themselves?  Then this game is for you!\n\nOk in all seriousness even though this game has it's flaws I still think it's a great game.  It just has several big flaws that brings it down.  The waiting for money is my biggest issue.  You would think for a simulation game a fast forward button would be standard, not this one.  That's right you only have play and pause at your fingertips.  Well I hope you have something else to do whilst your waiting for that money to come in because there's little else to do whilst your waiting for the money.\n\nThe micromanaging can get very monotanous very quickly.  You see since your evil activities are causing the world to send their "very best" spies to put a stop to your activities you have to keep an eye.  Minions won't automatically attack spies without you tagging them first.  Meaning your going to be randomly searching your base to see if any spies have landed and you really need to keep an eye out otherwise your beautiful base will be ruined in seconds (and trust me that is THE last thing you want unless you enjoy the waiting game).\n\nThe basebuilding is the main part of the game.  Really this game should be called Evil Lair Architect.  Not that thats a bad thing the base building is very good.  It's the only simulation game I've played that allows you to plan out a building without it being built first.  This I like alot and other games would benefit from it, Simcity being one.  It's the optimazation of making your minions work hard and keeping spies out that make it a big draw for me however it's the waiting that makes it toturous.\n\nThe minions themselves are divided into classes that do certain jobs.  You start of with a basic construction worker that do all the building for you that can then level up.  Scientists can do research for you to get new items (you can decide how they research the items but honestly this system is just luck based).  You have security minions that will beat up the spies.  You then have the social minions that can confuse spies into forgetting their mission (just like mp's).\n\nTaking over the world has little to it.  It's literly just a map.  Thats it.  You sends minions onto the map to complete missions or collect money for you.  Minions of different classes can do certain jobs better but honestly I would have appreciated a playable map similar to XCOM: Enemy Unkown.  Anything that makes the waiting more pleasant.\n\nIf your graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ then I'm afraid this game will not satisfy you.  Granted it's an old game but even for it's age it doesn't look good (Rayman 2 was released 4 years before this one and looks just as good).\n\nThe only thing that keeps this game up is it's charm and premise.  It's filled with humour (they interogate minions by dancing and putting them in a blender whats not to like?).  The premise itself is also interesting too.  Taking over the world who doesn't want to do that?  Honestly though these are the only things keeping it good for me along with the building mechanics.  If those aren't enough then I'm afraid this game is not for you.  If it is for you then I'd suggest waiting until this game goes on sale first.  Yes it is cheap to begin with at £7 but If your going to be dissappointed (and I wouldn't be surprised if you do) then get it cheap.","November 27, 2013","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timebolt/recommended/3720/","timebolt","Timebolt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timebolt/","70 products in account","Want to rule the world like a James Bond Villain?  Want to laugh maniacally as the world falls at you feet?  Want to show those James Bond wanna bes who's the boss?  Want to spend more time building your evil lair than taking over the world?  Want to spend most of your time waiting for your money to build up?  Want to micromange every little detail when your minions should be doing the job themselves?  Then this game is for you!\n\nOk in all seriousness even though this game has it's flaws I still think it's a great game.  It just has several big flaws that brings it down.  The waiting for money is my biggest issue.  You would think for a simulation game a fast forward button would be standard, not this one.  That's right you only have play and pause at your fingertips.  Well I hope you have something else to do whilst your waiting for that money to come in because there's little else to do whilst your waiting for the money.\n\nThe micromanaging can get very monotanous very quickly.  You see since your evil activities are causing the world to send their "very best" spies to put a stop to your activities you have to keep an eye.  Minions won't automatically attack spies without you tagging them first.  Meaning your going to be randomly searching your base to see if any spies have landed and you really need to keep an eye out otherwise your beautiful base will be ruined in seconds (and trust me that is THE last thing you want unless you enjoy the waiting game).\n\nThe basebuilding is the main part of the game.  Really this game should be called Evil Lair Architect.  Not that thats a bad thing the base building is very good.  It's the only simulation game I've played that allows you to plan out a building without it being built first.  This I like alot and other games would benefit from it, Simcity being one.  It's the optimazation of making your minions work hard and keeping spies out that make it a big draw for me however it's the waiting that makes it toturous.\n\nThe minions themselves are divided into classes that do certain jobs.  You start of with a basic construction worker that do all the building for you that can then level up.  Scientists can do research for you to get new items (you can decide how they research the items but honestly this system is just luck based).  You have security minions that will beat up the spies.  You then have the social minions that can confuse spies into forgetting their mission (just like mp's).\n\nTaking over the world has little to it.  It's literly just a map.  Thats it.  You sends minions onto the map to complete missions or collect money for you.  Minions of different classes can do certain jobs better but honestly I would have appreciated a playable map similar to XCOM: Enemy Unkown.  Anything that makes the waiting more pleasant.\n\nIf your graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ then I'm afraid this game will not satisfy you.  Granted it's an old game but even for it's age it doesn't look good (Rayman 2 was released 4 years before this one and looks just as good).\n\nThe only thing that keeps this game up is it's charm and premise.  It's filled with humour (they interogate minions by dancing and putting them in a blender whats not to like?).  The premise itself is also interesting too.  Taking over the world who doesn't want to do that?  Honestly though these are the only things keeping it good for me along with the building mechanics.  If those aren't enough then I'm afraid this game is not for you.  If it is for you then I'd suggest waiting until this game goes on sale first.  Yes it is cheap to begin with at £7 but If your going to be dissappointed (and I wouldn't be surprised if you do) then get it cheap.","November 27, 2013","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything in it is slow, minions moving around, building the bases, buying new items, they move very slowly when doing this and sadly there's no speed X2 or X4 buttons. Making it seem to take forever to get started. Earning money in the beginning when you don't have good ways of reducing heat, which determines how many and how strong the agents that attack your base are, is very difficult. Best option is to send out a very small number of minions to steal in order to keep the heat down, but this takes a long time with so few and again no speed up button so it drags some. The ai of the minions is just, well there isn't any to be honest. They aren't smart. At all. An agent will blow up a door, set itself on fire, your minions will rush to put out said fire as the agents kill them because their ai says they were attacked, by a door, that they blew up. So your minions turn into a shooting gallery for them. It seems the game really needed a lot more work and sadly won't get it. AI's horrible, interface can be challenging, everything takes what feels like hours to do. And yet I still find myself playing it. Maybe it's just the fun of being that evil bond villian, laughing maniaclly as secret agents get tossed around by your death traps or as you just randomly kill a minion for failing you, or for losing loyalty, or just because. Not a game many will like, but it's worth the try, if just to set up a death corridor and laugh as people get tossed around.","October 7, 2014","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/3720/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Where to begin? I guess with the beginning.  Evil Genius starts with a short FMV giving you the basics of what your about to do.  Build a secret lair in a mountain, perform various Act of Infamy, research various things, and ultimately create your Doomsday Device.  When you start in the game proper you have but a handful of Minions and a single Henchman, your pick of Genius determines which Henchman you get at the start.  I quickly set off and ordered my Minions to build me base, starting with the Corridors and moving on to Barracks, Control Room, and a Mess Hall.\n\nAll this base building costs money, and while you do start with a few funds, it’s nowhere near the amount that you’ll need if you plan on creating a Doomsday Device that will bring the Forces of Good to their knees.  For this we have the World Domination Map, where you send your minions off to different regions to steal money or preform Acts of Infamy.\n\nNow here’s where one of my little personal tricks comes into play.  I discovered this about two or three playthroughs ago.  The best way to get the most money right at the start without the heat or agents from the regions getting suspicious of you and investigating your island.  You can do any Acts of Infamy or Stealing, as much as you want, before you complete the mission involving capturing the maid.  No agents will come looking for you until you capture her.  So, I recommend building your Lair as much as you can, and build a massive Barracks full of Lockers(these determine how many Minions you can have).  With enough you can hit your Minion cap and send all of them out to different regions to steal money.  Leave the game running and come back later, I let it run overnight, and you will have a nice pile of gold to get you started.  Just also remember to bring all your Minions back and let it run for a little longer.  Since you will steal acquire Heat, so you want to give some time to let that fade off.\n\nNow is that cheating?  Or is that truly winning at the game and bending the mechanics to better suit your needs?\n\nNow after a few hours you’ll have a pretty nice Lair going for you, probably with some spiffy traps, and plenty of Minions of various types wandering around doing your bidding.  And yes, I do mean hours.  My personal biggest complaint about Evil Genius is it’s lack of game speed control.  There is no way to speed up time in any manor, and so there can be times where you just play to wait.  And that can get boring.\n\nEventually you’ll make it to the second Island, and this is where the fun really begins.  The is the best part of that game, in my opinion, and really this whole thing is all about my opinion, so therefore, this is the best part of the game!\n\nWhat do you do first on the second island?  Why build a new Lair of course!  That old island with that old and inferior base that you spent hours getting perfect is now replaced with a new and improved Lair.  You’ve got more space to spread out with and the experience to know how you want to be set up.  But you also have the Forces of Good still being a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, the amount of which is directly proportional to how much of a ruckus you created prior to moving to the new island.\n\nAt this point I stop telling you how to play, or what exactly happens when you play.  You have to just go and play it.  Trust me on this.  While you’ll complain at the total number of hours you’ve spent playing it, you’ll know that every minute of that time was spent being the best Evil Genius you could and loving every minute of it.  You may, probably will, get irritated at your Minions from time to time, as the AI does seem to just slip here and there.  But overall it’s never anything truly gamebreaking, and these time are sparse enough that you wont even remember all of them.\n\nYou can really push yourself, and your own morals, as to what it takes to be an Evil Genius.  Does it end with beating the game?  Or is it more than that?  After all, almost all the game files are written in Excel spreadsheets, and can altered in any way you choose.  A quick Google search will result with a list of in game cheatcodes.  Is using these cheating?  Is altering the games core files to better your success cheating?  These types of actions could be considered being nefarious, something which the game itself rewards you for being.\n\nThe graphics and stylized look of Evil Genius both seem to have held on well with the times.  While you can tell it’s a dated game, its not so blinding obvious.  The music too is a perfect fit for it’s visual look.\n\nI have only three real complaints about Evil Genius.  One you cannot effect the passing of time, two you cannot zoom out far enough, to my personal liking, and three I had to fix the resolution every time I started the game.  But hey, if that’s my only compatibility issue, I’ll live.","May 16, 2013","true","126.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those of you familiar with old James Bond movies, with feel right at home with this games comedic foundations. The game will have you developing traps that open the floor to a deadly pit of saws one minute and then have you interrogating a prisioner with Micheal Jackson choreography the next.\n\nThe game oozes with charm. Not only that, but the game offers a solid strategic challenge as well. You will find yourself having to keep track of both your base activies and your world domition tactics on the world map (Think total war, but with everything happening at once).

The game always presents a obstacle for you to overcome, rather that be enemy agents trying to inflitrate your base, a power failure leaving your base vunerable or trying to keep pesky tourists from wondering into your evil lair the game consistently presents you with challenges, some difficult some not, and never at any point leaves you with nothing to do.\n\nOverall, this game is ranked in my Steam favourites.

Like the Sims, your loyal minions have needs that must be met or they would collapse, die, or even run away. Building facilites in your base is very easy to pick up, as you progress throughout the game, you will have access to more efficient need-restoring objects but much of them bring along higher heat. What is heat? That's the stuff that agent investigators (a.k.a. the "good" guys) want to bring home to have a proper "clause" to send in even more dangerous agents to steal your money and loot, attack your minions, or simply blowing everything up. I don't recommended killing agents as another one would likely take his/her place shortly after, it's better to waste their time with any means possible.\n\nAlso unlike the Sims, you are not in direct control of the majority of the characters in the game but rather interact with them mainly with objects.","December 27, 2011","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I had to warn a  player what not to do, it would be to block off any part of your base. If you make a spot unreachable by your minions, agents will just burrow in there to figure out what you're trying to hide from the forces of justice. Some crafty players even take advantage of this to make trap rooms (with no other way in or out) just to trick agents into these death traps.\n\nFor an older game, it would be safe to say it's still very fun and not clunky like a lot of other older games that would be called 'classic' to get you to forgive technology and graphics.

I had never heard of it before, but I have been looking for a game just like this for a long time.\nAlthough it is an old game (11+ years), this does not feel old in anyway, and if you told me it was released this year, I wouldn't be able to tell you otherwise without seeing the date.\n\nIt is a great spin on the save the world nonsense that has been milked by companies for years (like the Quantum of Solace game that is just repackaged Goldeneye, (but lets not travel that rabbit hole)), and allows you to do the exact opposite, like setting traps for inspectors, interrogating prisoners, building a beautiful underground lair :) and just allowing yourself to be a generally bad guy.\n\nOnce you get involved in building that beautiful lair and your nefarious empire it becomes extremely hard to stop (see that time played of 8 and a half hours, that was just on the first night). I consider replayability (its a word) to be one of the greatest measures of a game, especially on PC and this is one that will be in my library for the long haul, up there with Sins of a Solar Empire, Duke Nukem, AOE 2, C&C RA2, etc. You know those games where you may not play them for a while, but you always find yourself coming back to reinstall and play them.. well this is no doubt one of those.\n\nI am (like the rest of the community) hoping rebellion brings out a second at some stage, but to be honest, if that day never comes I don't think il be overly disappointed because this is such a great game and its aged like a fine wine.\nThe other bonus to age is that prices drop, and even without a sale this bad boy is a bargain.","March 24, 2015","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything in it is slow, minions moving around, building the bases, buying new items, they move very slowly when doing this and sadly there's no speed X2 or X4 buttons. Making it seem to take forever to get started. Earning money in the beginning when you don't have good ways of reducing heat, which determines how many and how strong the agents that attack your base are, is very difficult. Best option is to send out a very small number of minions to steal in order to keep the heat down, but this takes a long time with so few and again no speed up button so it drags some. The ai of the minions is just, well there isn't any to be honest. They aren't smart. At all. An agent will blow up a door, set itself on fire, your minions will rush to put out said fire as the agents kill them because their ai says they were attacked, by a door, that they blew up. So your minions turn into a shooting gallery for them. It seems the game really needed a lot more work and sadly won't get it. AI's horrible, interface can be challenging, everything takes what feels like hours to do. And yet I still find myself playing it. Maybe it's just the fun of being that evil bond villian, laughing maniaclly as secret agents get tossed around by your death traps or as you just randomly kill a minion for failing you, or for losing loyalty, or just because. Not a game many will like, but it's worth the try, if just to set up a death corridor and laugh as people get tossed around.","October 7, 2014","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play, as the game's title says, an evil genius, bent on destroying the forces of good and conquering the whole world. You start off on a small island paradise, with only a handful of minions, 250,000 dollars, and a single henchmen. From there, your task is to build a complex base of operations into the mountainside,  complete with traps, training facilities, and more, while at the same time plundering riches and fighting off the constant intrusions from the forces of justice. Evil Genius manages to bring out the worst in all of us, and you'll be surprised to find yourself stalking the despised well-doers as they land on your little shred of land, eager to find out how they will meet your demise. And with ways ranging from bazooka-wielding Russians, to a complex set of bee-related traps, you'll find dozens of ways to amuse yourself with their death.","December 18, 2010","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unleash your inner Evil Mastermind as you build your island headquarters for your schemes and conduct missions all over the world against the forces of justice.\n\nA game I have put many hours into over the years when it first came out and glad to be playing it again, and while some of the graphics may not quite be up to standards of what some would expect today, it by no means looks horrific with the art style suiting the game perfectly. The music and menu screens add to the spy farce that this game plays to heavily, being a play on James Bond predominantly, but pokes fun at every spy movie whose villain plans to take over / destroy the world.\n\nA decent variety of minions requires some micro management to balance out what you require to carry out later missions in the game, ensuring you always have at least one of each alive so you don't have to go out and capture someone from the world to interrogate is a small quibble, but overall the system works well with an organic progression of minions along one of three trees: science, military, and social.\n\nThere is not much immediate replay value in the game, however, after some time away it is always great to return to it and play a great strategy game in the manner of Dungeon Keeper mixed in with a little Theme Hospital as you try to keep your base safe and secure from enemy agents and keep it all running smoothly so that things don't back up and you end up with a bunch of unhappy, thieving, minions.\n\nA solid strategy game for any fan of the genre.","January 15, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the gameplay front it does many things poorly, several in game factors collaborate to frustrate the player. Stupid minions running one by one into their deaths, while you can only watch their folly. Pesky invulnerable super agents destroying your base. Traps being somewhat poorly balanced. There's no way to turn off just the announcer's warnings - you'd have to turn off all sounds. The pacing is very slow at the beginning. There are only two islands on which to construct your bases - no random maps, no skirmish mode. Specialist science minions and social minions have little to do. Acts of infamy provide little tangible benefit...\n\nHow can the game be any good then?\nBecause of the things it does good, it does really well. And there are very few games similar to this (Dungeon Keeper being the closest).\nIt's all style over substance. The art direction, themes and music (particularly title soundtracks) are just spot on and so perfectly captures the idea of playing Bond-film like villain, constructing a secret base in order to take over the world! The animations are superbly done, cartoony, but appropriately so. Thus even though the game is 10 years old, it still manages to look alright.\n\nIf the theme and management style in any way appeals to you give this game a try, but if you enjoyed Dungeon Keeper this is almost a must-play in my opinion.","December 30, 2014","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ricotez/recommended/3720/","ricotez","Ricotez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ricotez/","336 products in account","I don't know any other games that embrace the Spy genre with this much style. Everything about this game, from the music to the characters, is meant to fully immerse you into a world of minions and doomsday devices.\n\nThe concept is simple. You are an average Bond villain, and you want to take over the world. In order to do so you need a base of operations (which you have to lay out and build yourself), an army of minions (who live in your base and are trained into better jobs there) and a control room that lets you send your minions across the globe to steal money for you and carry out devious schemes. But this attracts the attention of the 5 superpowers in the world, who will start sending investigators and agents to your base. As your global notoriety climbs, you have to manage your heat or you will become overwhelmed by the number of investigators and soldiers sent to  attack your base.\n\nThe game is an incredible lot of fun to play. Although your first base design will inevitably suck, the more you play the better you will get at it. (Also, a minor spoiler: halfway through the game you move to a new base, which lets you fix any mistakes you may have made that playthrough... Only to make a bunch of new ones, of course.)\n\nBut I also have two gripes. First of all, you can issue basic orders and give anyone on your island a tag that determines what must be done with them (jailed, dazed or killed), but you cannot directly control your minions. This is understandable - you ARE the mastermind, after all - but can get quite frustrating when all of your minions are busy and you really need something done. Fortunately you can directly control your henchmen, who may not be able to build or do much work around your base, but who are very good at killing, dazing or jailing intruders.\n\nSecond of all... The game has a lot of bugs, and most of them are really minor and solved by the Unofficial Patch. Why no such patch was ever brought out officially is beyond me. There are also game breaking bugs: for example, once you place down the conference table in the first island, you may not move or delete it or your evil genius can no longer sit at it. This, of course, halts progression and gets you stuck.\n\nFortunately these two problems are not extremely big, and have not ruined my fun yet. It's good to be an Evil Genius.","June 11, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely delightful to play through again.  Drags a little as you must wait for minions to be replaced or to repair your base but all the great animations and little details to make your evil base come alive is outstanding to watch.  The game draws a great line between the funny and the evil of being someone ambitious enough to rule the world.  The desciptions and radio messages of "Acts of Infamy" are great.  Interrogating "forces of justice" and "superagents" is entertaining.  Missing a piece of loot because of moving to your second evil liar or missing an important piece of labortaory equipment brings down the game.  However, these small detriments to the game do not take away from the overall enjoyment.\n\nI would love to see this game get a little old school love like some other titles.

But there is something about this game that makes you want to keep playing it to see how cool you can make your underground lair, or how much international treasures your henchmen can steal.  You only deal with combat within your own island, and the fighting mechanic is centered around you tagging certain enemies with either kill, capture, or confuse. Then all your henchmen that see those tagged enemies react accordingly.

I have spent plenty time of my life with this game WAY BEFORE it was even listed on Steam... back in the good old days of CD ROM\n\nThose who have played this gem of a game, know exactly what to expect.  This game is still great to play and I still highly recommend it after all this time.  The game is basically a port over to steam, but nothing has notably changed or been altered (possibly better sound) but since it is an older game, you may find it outdated, but as it has a cartoon style, there is not much to complain about (both graphical and controll aspect)...\n\nBut for those who do not know much about the game, here are the basic reason(s) to become the next Evil Genius...\n\nBasically this is a building / stratagy simulation game where you play the leader of an evil organization controlling various minion types with the main goal of trying to take over the world... while building your evil base, you must keep your base productive, keep your minions happy, while also defending it from the various, government agents, tourists and wild life...\n\nIt may start off a little lack luster as you start constructing your base, but you will eventually find the game moves alot faster after various goals have been achieved, obtaining a higher notority level and having more objects to build within the various rooms.\n\nThere are many unique features that makes Evil Genius stand out amongst others, but personally, there are 3 key fatures make it stand out most from this genre...\n\nThe first thing is the ability to evolove your minions, where as most sim's or stratagy type games are designed with purchusing various unity to help, Evil Genius relies on promoting your minions through training them.  These upgraded minions branch out to become better soldiers, engineers, valets, etc. with each of these upgrades having their own branching upgrades.  For example, soldiers can be trained to become either a sniper specialist, mercenary, etc.  Each minion has a unique name, with various levels (health, loyalty, inteligence, hunger, etc.)  making each minion feel a little more personal, unique, and harder to send out into the world, not knowing who and who will not be retuning from the mission (poor bobby johnson did not see that cliff in front of him :( )... but if your minions become disloyal and try and steal or try to desert your organization, you have plenty of options to show them their wrongdoing... try capturing and interogate them with your interogation chair, or cake mixer, or laser cutter, or whatever as you watch them squirm... or simply get your henchmen to do the dirty work by beating them comedically, or simply locking them up and useing them as experimental test subjects for your scientists.\n\nAs the Evil Genius is the main unit, there is always a #2 unit, and this will be your main henchman.  Unlike the traditional unit, he will respond to identified threats immediatly and will protect you until the last unit of health with 3 special / unique abilities to help eliminate mass groups of enemies.  Each henchman has there own special backstory and with more henchmen becoming availiable to you as the plot progresses.\n\nThe second thing is the global map with the various prizes that can be obtained (in some missions).  This global map is how you the 'Evil Genius' obtains notority.  Each mission provides a humourous debriefing, requiring a specified number of minions and alotted survival time in order to succeed in the mission.   Once completed, you gain notority and In some cases are reward with a physical trophy that can be placed within your lair.  As you gain more notroity, more missions will become availiable, in some cases, missions become availiable only when minions are sent to the specific country on recon.  The trophies obtained provide various effects and in some cases are cursed until all compontents are obtained and combined to create a larger / completed trophy.  Like any evil genius, you have to have that trophy room to look at all of your evil loot...\n\nThe third and final thing, is you as the evil genius... or at least the one you control in the game.  The Evil Genius is the leader / controller of the units, there are 3 leaders to choose at the start of your game, each one providing different benefits during your main game.  This may mean more loyalty, more stength, faster recon on the global map, etc.  As mentioned earlier with minion loyalty, As the game progresses, your Evil Genius may be required to show your followers who is top dog via torturing or straight out exacuting a minion in front of other minioins to raise the moral level.  Again, these acts done in a more humorus manner (an 'Austin Powers' type death).  When called upon, your Evil Genius CLONE.... I mean REAL Evil Genius may have to particiapte in missions to successfully complete them.\n\nIf you like this type of game, and want to experience the James Bond nostaligia with that Austin Powers sense of humor then I hightly recommend this game.  Go forth, become the Evil Genius you always wanted to be and RULE THIS FICTIONAL WORLD!","August 31, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After seeing it had launched on Steam for a modest price I snagged a copy and am pleasantly surprised by how in depth this hidden gem is, in some ways I actually prefer it to Dungeon Keeper.\n\nThe interesting thing about this villainous base builder is that rather than building small lairs and moving from level to level, you only have two islands to build on, one that you access from the start and another that unlocks halfway through. This allows you to expand your HQ over time and it's a rewarding experience to finally see your underground criminal empire begin to flourish. You also have access to a world map screen that allows you to influence the world outside of your base by sending your henchmen to commit crimes or perform espionage in various countries which brings in gold, specialist units and ups your notoriety. But beware, the more influential you become, the more secret agents the governments of the world will send to your island to unravel your insidious schemes. It should be noted that the game's theme is heavily influenced by 60s spy serials and it carries this off with a comedic tone reminiscent of the Austin Powers movies, which I rather enjoyed.\n\nIf you're a fan of Dungeon Keeper or looking to get into to the whole base building, overlord style strategy genre, I highly recommend this game. It's a great time sink and it's easy to lose a few hours twiddling your evil moustache and plotting world domination. Just be sure to watch out for that pesky super agent John Steele.","June 25, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like building the ultimate trap rooms and watch as the Agents of the world tries to best your contraptions. And then do a truly evil laugh as they fail utterly.\n\nThere is just something very special about being the Evil Genius and having minions to do your bidding in your quest for world domination.\nIt's different and fun. And I have been waiting for Evil Genius 2 for years now. I really do hope somebody pics up this IP at some point and make a proper sequel.\n\nIt's hard to express the joy of this game. But if you have ever wanted to be the Bond villain, then this game is your best bet.\n\nIt does have a few flaws though. Quite a few actually.\n\nThere is no widescreen support. But you can find a workaround for that if you google. "Evil Genius WSGF" The ui will be stretched though.\n\nSome of the mechanics are a bit annoying and requires more work then what should be necessary.\n\nThere can also be a lot of down time while you wait for your minions to complete work orders. Or waiting for money to come in.\n\nThere are more minor things that keeps irking me from time to time. But in the end the things that are good with the game far outweigh what is bad.\n\nIf you are unsure about the game I would suggest watching some let's plays on youtube. I would also recommend not watching a whole lot of them if you want to avoid spoilers.\nThere are some super agents that can only be defeated in a certain way. And some of the fun (and annoyance) in the game can come from defeating them. Until you can find that way to defeat them they will just keep coming back making your life hell.","May 30, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You must also pay attention to the agents invading your base (that's what the traps are for) and various activities out on the world map so you can gain research, unlock new minion trainers, and a variety of other nefarious activities, but mostly hilarious acts of infamy that including things like stealing frikken lasers, blowing up gnashville, and publically executing the stars of a silly 'brady bunch' type show.

I may have more hours on other games, but there is nothing else I come back to year after year. Mind you the hours shown are the amount I have on steam.

As you progress you will need more advanced henchmen which you train in your base.\nAnd what classic super villain situation is complete with without meddling do gooders and of course special agents who will travel to your island, requiring you to distract or eliminate them before they discover evidence of your nefarious plots. One way to combat them is to build traps which can be as simple as a single piranha tank to a network of traps that blows, chops then burns agents foolish enough to enter your base.\nThe game graphics aren't HD or anything, but they still look quite good, it kind of fits in with the game itself actually as it is themed as a classic super villain vs world type of deal.\nI cannot recommend this game enough, especially since these days it is priced at only $10.\nOh and after you've played few a few times, I would look into how to increase the minion cap, I upped mine to 200, It is very nice to have way more top level minions as well as making the base feel more alive.","December 21, 2015","true","47.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have spent plenty time of my life with this game WAY BEFORE it was even listed on Steam... back in the good old days of CD ROM\n\nThose who have played this gem of a game, know exactly what to expect.  This game is still great to play and I still highly recommend it after all this time.  The game is basically a port over to steam, but nothing has notably changed or been altered (possibly better sound) but since it is an older game, you may find it outdated, but as it has a cartoon style, there is not much to complain about (both graphical and controll aspect)...\n\nBut for those who do not know much about the game, here are the basic reason(s) to become the next Evil Genius...\n\nBasically this is a building / stratagy simulation game where you play the leader of an evil organization controlling various minion types with the main goal of trying to take over the world... while building your evil base, you must keep your base productive, keep your minions happy, while also defending it from the various, government agents, tourists and wild life...\n\nIt may start off a little lack luster as you start constructing your base, but you will eventually find the game moves alot faster after various goals have been achieved, obtaining a higher notority level and having more objects to build within the various rooms.\n\nThere are many unique features that makes Evil Genius stand out amongst others, but personally, there are 3 key fatures make it stand out most from this genre...\n\nThe first thing is the ability to evolove your minions, where as most sim's or stratagy type games are designed with purchusing various unity to help, Evil Genius relies on promoting your minions through training them.  These upgraded minions branch out to become better soldiers, engineers, valets, etc. with each of these upgrades having their own branching upgrades.  For example, soldiers can be trained to become either a sniper specialist, mercenary, etc.  Each minion has a unique name, with various levels (health, loyalty, inteligence, hunger, etc.)  making each minion feel a little more personal, unique, and harder to send out into the world, not knowing who and who will not be retuning from the mission (poor bobby johnson did not see that cliff in front of him :( )... but if your minions become disloyal and try and steal or try to desert your organization, you have plenty of options to show them their wrongdoing... try capturing and interogate them with your interogation chair, or cake mixer, or laser cutter, or whatever as you watch them squirm... or simply get your henchmen to do the dirty work by beating them comedically, or simply locking them up and useing them as experimental test subjects for your scientists.\n\nAs the Evil Genius is the main unit, there is always a #2 unit, and this will be your main henchman.  Unlike the traditional unit, he will respond to identified threats immediatly and will protect you until the last unit of health with 3 special / unique abilities to help eliminate mass groups of enemies.  Each henchman has there own special backstory and with more henchmen becoming availiable to you as the plot progresses.\n\nThe second thing is the global map with the various prizes that can be obtained (in some missions).  This global map is how you the 'Evil Genius' obtains notority.  Each mission provides a humourous debriefing, requiring a specified number of minions and alotted survival time in order to succeed in the mission.   Once completed, you gain notority and In some cases are reward with a physical trophy that can be placed within your lair.  As you gain more notroity, more missions will become availiable, in some cases, missions become availiable only when minions are sent to the specific country on recon.  The trophies obtained provide various effects and in some cases are cursed until all compontents are obtained and combined to create a larger / completed trophy.  Like any evil genius, you have to have that trophy room to look at all of your evil loot...\n\nThe third and final thing, is you as the evil genius... or at least the one you control in the game.  The Evil Genius is the leader / controller of the units, there are 3 leaders to choose at the start of your game, each one providing different benefits during your main game.  This may mean more loyalty, more stength, faster recon on the global map, etc.  As mentioned earlier with minion loyalty, As the game progresses, your Evil Genius may be required to show your followers who is top dog via torturing or straight out exacuting a minion in front of other minioins to raise the moral level.  Again, these acts done in a more humorus manner (an 'Austin Powers' type death).  When called upon, your Evil Genius CLONE.... I mean REAL Evil Genius may have to particiapte in missions to successfully complete them.\n\nIf you like this type of game, and want to experience the James Bond nostaligia with that Austin Powers sense of humor then I hightly recommend this game.  Go forth, become the Evil Genius you always wanted to be and RULE THIS FICTIONAL WORLD!","August 31, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played this game off and on for years, ever since it first came out. It's fun and quirky. Who doesn't like the thought of becoming a maniacal genius, constructing the perfect evil lair filled with traps for any pesky super-spies that come your way? You get to order minions around, steal amazing artifacts (Shrunken Eiflel Tower? Check. Excalibur? Check. Cloning Machine? Of course).\n\nThe game involves quite a bit of strategy--it's easy to run out of money, or find your base overrun with police SWAT teams. Going through the story mode takes about 5-10 hours or so, depending on how you play. But I found myself running through the story several times, each time saying all make my base "better next time!".

I may have more hours on other games, but there is nothing else I come back to year after year. Mind you the hours shown are the amount I have on steam. I originally had the game on disk... twice before buying it on steam so who knows how many hours I really have.\nAbout the game, you can read other peoples reviews for more depth, but what brings me back is the pure joy of building your base, especially once you get to the (spoilers) second island when you have a large cash reserve and most of the rooms unlocked.\nOf course it's not all about the base building, the game itself is about completing objectives on the world map by sending out henchmen. As you progress you will need more advanced henchmen which you train in your base.\nAnd what classic super villain situation is complete with without meddling do gooders and of course special agents who will travel to your island, requiring you to distract or eliminate them before they discover evidence of your nefarious plots. One way to combat them is to build traps which can be as simple as a single piranha tank to a network of traps that blows, chops then burns agents foolish enough to enter your base.\nThe game graphics aren't HD or anything, but they still look quite good, it kind of fits in with the game itself actually as it is themed as a classic super villain vs world type of deal.\nI cannot recommend this game enough, especially since these days it is priced at only $10.\nOh and after you've played few a few times, I would look into how to increase the minion cap, I upped mine to 200, It is very nice to have way more top level minions as well as making the base feel more alive.","December 21, 2015","true","47.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the satirical elements that mocked spies specifically from spy movies.\n2. I liked the storyline.\n\nWhat I disliked about the game:\n1. A tad slow at times where you are trying to generate cash, sometimes you are brainlessly checking to make sure no agents get into the inner part of your base.\n2. The different Evil Geniuses should affect the gameplay more than just additive bonuses.\n3. You might not get a bunch of hours on this game, however it is still fun to come back and replay the game from time to time.\n\nWhy I would recommend this game:\n1. It is easy to run on laptops.\n2. It is a fun build-your-own-base type of game.\n3. With the time I have played it, I have never run into any glitches.\n4. I would recommend it to any person who has seen a couple spy movies to appreciate the satire.\n5. If you like games like Sim City or Prison Archetect definitely pick this one up :-)\n6. You get to be a villan.\n\nWhy I would not recommend this game: (to some people)\n1. Patience is needed when playing this game. (World Domination isn't as easy as clicking your mouse once)\n2. If you hate spy movies, or more specifically, the villans in spy movies then you don't want this game.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. If you don't think you would like it, give it a try!","February 2","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easily my favourite business-management/building game. Anyone who loved the Tycoon/Sim games of your youth who missed this I really recommend picking it up for cheap somewhere.\n\nWorth noting: the game wasn't designed expecting today's ultra-large resolutions, so it doesn't scale very well. There are patches[www.wsgf.org] to help with this, but the HUD still scales poorly. Just a reminder that you're buying an old game. HUD scaling aside, the game still looks great.\n\nAlso I strongly recommend downloading the custom community patch[www.n1nj4.com]. It fixes a lot of balancing/issues, and opens up some new features otherwise unincluded in the last release of the game.","January 7","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game play is well paced, the learning curve is even and well supported with in-game docs and tuts, and there's a wide variety of acitivities and troop types to keep you interested.  3 difficulty levels and 3 different "Evil Geniuses" means a nice amount of replay value as well.  Nice soundtrack, comical animations, a real winner all the way around.\n\nCons\n-----\n- The save system is a little weird, which can be frustrating\n- You can't (or I haven't discovered how to) speed up the game play in any way, so there will be times when you're tapping your toes waiting for cash to build.\n- Slightly punishing if you don't progress very carefully, which can require you to restart, which means wading through the tutorial level again.\n\nPros\n-----\n- It's NOT a fantasy setting, so you never have to look at a goblin or magical spell or cleric.\n- Just because it's a modern setting they didn't just translate concepts from the fantasy ones we're all too familiar with.  There's fresh new concepts at play that are very engaging.\n- Weirdly addictive, you'll definitely loose hours plotting out just how your secret lair should be laid out.\n\nI highly recommend grabbing this one; it's a fresh take on a very worn out genre.","January 16","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty forgiving early on, with a difficulty arc both graceful and satisfying that really gets much tougher later.  The graphics are of course dated, but as is the hallmark of many truly great games it doesn't matter.  The fun comes from the game, and the graphics are there to help you keep track.\n\nIt is often compared to the Dungeoun Keeper series, which is fair.  I played me some Dungeon Keeper 2 back in the day, when mice had balls and input devices were not even hot-swappable, let alone wireless.  Despite the relative technological desolation of those dark ages, I remember that being a pretty awesome game.  Still, I cannot adequately describe how much happier I am to be a sinister plotting megalomaniac bent on world domination.\n\nMany of the reviews here already break the game down by pros and cons, etc, so I'm just going to say highly recommended, and even when not on sale it's pretty cheap.  Take a spiritual journey to 2004 with Elixir Studios and get in touch with your inner despicable villian.\n\nExtra Endorsement: I experienced the glitch with the conference table on my very first playthrough of the game, and found out about it on the internet after being stuck for hours unable to complete Objective 2.  20ish hours into the game, my whole save became worthless.  Without any hesitation, I calmly opened the menu and clicked "New Game".  For me, that means this game = digital crack.","January 17","true","73.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I dont have very many hours in this game yet but it helped me realize that i am a psychopath and i love that. First off you start out on a big canvas to make your very own evil base. I would strongly suggest doing the tutorial as this game can be a bit confusing. I know what you are thinking. What is the point of building an evil base on an abandoned island. Well my friend let me start off by saying that in your evil base you have the power to capture maids and starve them to death. Still doesnt sound like fun? How about this, you can build a large variety of hilarious traps such as gas chambers and wind machines that you can put anywhere in your base. Secret spies from around the world will try to kill your "boss" and instead of sending my minions/bodyguards out to kill them i usually just let them into my base to watch them land in one of my many traps. This game is a masterpiece and the graphics are pretty good, it amazes me it was made so long ago.\n\nJudgement 9/10 Would buy again.","January 17","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
