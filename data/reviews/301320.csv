"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crackisgoodforyou/recommended/301320/","crackisgoodforyou","Long Dong Silver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crackisgoodforyou/","200 products in account","First off: this is not a game, if you're a fan of the Rollercoaster Tycoon games this might not be for you. It's a simulation and a tool made for people who may already have a wider knowlage of roller coasters. It has no park management features like Rollercoaster Tycoon. Nolimits often requires a quite in-depth understanding of rollercoaster engineering, physics and a passion for theme parks and roller coasters. If you're a Rollercoaster Tycoon player who wants to try something new, try the demo first.\n\nPros:\nRealistic-This is the most realistic design tool for roller coasters. It's not just stunning in terms of visuals, it's full of tiny details that enthusiasts can all recognise and appreciate.\n\nMassive improvement from NL1-Everything in the editor has been vastly improved, you could spend hours just fixing g-force spikes and bumps that aren't apparent in the editor. The G-force comb is nothing short of glorious, it allows you to fully finetune rides to perfection without the need for other software like Newton.\n\nImproved terrain editor-The simple addition of tunnels make this many times better than NL1.\n\nVerity-NL2 has more coaster types than you're likely to master. Classic corkscrew coasters to B&M diving coasters, this simulation has everything. I would have liked to see more family style coasters though.\n\nScripting-This is probably the biggest advance for NL2, it makes coaster extremely flexible, though it has some problems I'll mention later.\n\nStation improvements-The addition of dueling stations and tandem stations is very helpful for creating realistic rides.\n\nControl panel-In NL1 controlling the ride was pretty much pressing the f9-11 keys, now it's fully functional and allows you to control individual block segments. It's surprisingly fun to operate rides in the simulation, some people have even made their own physical USB control panels. Unfortunately for the people building their own controls, there is a lack of hotkeys for operation, all block controls must be controlled with the mouse (but this isn't much of a loss).\n\nCons: It’s important to be honest, there are some serious problems which aren't fixable but could potentially ruin your experience of NL2.\n\nNo lessons learned from Newton-When people are forced to use other software for the actual design of a ride, there's a problem. The NL1 editor was very hard to use if you were building a coaster from scratch with no help from programs like Newton; NL2 has somewhat eliminated the need for Newton but a combination of Newton's perfectly smooth curve and the already amazing editor would have been beyond perfect.\n\nScripting-It's a gift wrapped with a lock and chains. If you have difficulty wrapping your head around scripting transfer tracks and switches, you're screwed. Like with Newton, the NL community has made some software to make scripting easier but it simply isn't enough. (What would have been perfect is a second scripting method based of placeable triggers, It would be less flexible but certainly easier to use).\n\nAnd that's pretty much it.\n\nWould I recommend NL2 to the average steam user? No.\nWould I recommend NL2 to fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon fans? Maybe.\nWould I recommend NL2 to roller coaster enthusiasts? Absolutely.","August 22, 2014","true","120.0"," 115 of 126 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","115","126","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AJClarke0912/recommended/301320/","AJClarke0912","AJClarke0912","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AJClarke0912/","60 products in account","While I only have a few hours of playtime on the Steam version, I've poured many more hours into the standalone version.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs this game for me?\nFirst off, it's worth knowing that this is not a game, but a simulator. If this interests you, then NoLimits 2 will be a good choice. Your enjoyment of NoLimits 2 is likely bound to how many of these items apply to you:\nIn RollerCoaster Tycoon, you loved the coaster building process the most\nYou're a coaster enthusiast\nYou enjoy simulation games even if you don't "play" them avidly\nYou're the creative type who enjoys a blank canvas or a sandbox with no goals or restrictionsIn addition, if these apply to you, then you should probably just get this now. They do not apply to me, but having either of these skills opens up immense opportunities in NoLimits 2:\nYou love 3D modeling\nYou love programming\nIf 2 of those bullet points match you, then I'd maybe pick up the game on sale, as you may still enjoy it but perhaps won't sink tons of hours into it. Do note that NoLimits 2 has never gone on sale for anything more than 20%, so don't expect deep discounts on Steam sales.\n\nIf 3 of those bullet points match you, then you might enjoy NoLimits 2 as a casual user. If you're the type that just likes to check out the simulation, as well as how insanely creative/detailed people are, there's plenty to download and explore with the Steam workshop and fan websites. You may find yourself tinkering with building your own coasters, but some may lose interest given the vast array of tools at your disposal.\n\nIf 4 or more of those bullet points match you, then I would recommend this game at full price.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComparison with Theme Park Studio\nThose in the market for a theme park/roller coaster simulator may have heard of Theme Park Studio - an early access project almost directly competing with NoLimits 2. However, I still feel this as though this is the superior product.\n\nIt seems both NL2 or TPS have rather hefty learning curves. Both feature loads of tools and things to learn. To me, neither is easier than its competing counterpart. After that, it really comes down to how the rest stacks up.\n\nIn NL2, you're getting arguably better graphics, far more accurate physics, and a *much* more polished product. This is a finished game, with "free DLC" updates along the way; in fact, the new wing coaster trains just debuted a week ago at the time of this review.\n\nIn TPS, you're getting easier functions to build a park, and animated guests, but I feel like the advantages stop there. In NL2, it's a little less integrated, but it's still not that hard to make a path. Some simply paint the ground in asphault, while others have created path-building kits to add as scenery. Adding flat rides built by others just requires adding the scenery object (script is typically already attached). I think TPS's selling point was that in NL2 it was "nearly impossible" to do these things but it's really not.\n\nI really wish TPS ended up being good. It's always nice to have something new and awesome coming along but it's just not there yet. Maybe in the future it will eventually become worthy of it's purchase price, but as of now I really wouldn't spend any money on it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonal opinion time:\nFor me and many others, this is the absolute benchmark for accurate roller coasters. The level of intricacy with which someone can design their dream ride is unparalleled by any other software. As with anything this realistic, there is a learning curve that comes with the program if you wish to design your own. However, compared to NoLimits 1, the rate at which new users are becoming proficient truly speaks for how well the new track building system is. Some of the amazing works you'll see on YouTube, the Workshop, and NL fansites were created by people who just picked up the game a couple months ago.\n\nNow, would I recommend this game to those don't plan to build? If you're a roller coaster fanatic, I'd still say yes. With Steam's integration you can download other tracks with absolute breeze. Plus there's other options to further satisfy your hunger for rides: sites like NoLimits-Exchange.com and CoasterCrazy.com provide an excellent abundance of things to download to your heart's desire.\n\nThis is as real as it gets... for the most part. If realism isn't your forte, go make that 1000 ft tall mountain racer you've always wanted. If you can build it, the simulation will always run it.\n\nBut perhaps the best part is the realism. The fact that some recreations get within inches of their real-life counterparts just shows the level of detail with which you can sculpt the rails. And for some, having that dead-on accuracy makes each ride feel as though they could be built into real life. You can build your dream ride, watch it go, and truly imagine it existing at your favorite amusement park so long as you could print out blueprints. That feeling is truly awesome and cannot be replaced IMO.","January 2, 2015","true","98.8"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","45","47","0","0"

If yes, please read this before making your decision.\n1. NoLimits 2 is a fantastic piece of software, yeah, software, because, according to the makers, they are targeting realism now and they prever to call it a simulation-program. Keep in mind this ISIN'T RollerCoaster Tycoon or Thrillville.\n2. You can't be a sadistic a-hole and watch people die, 2 reasons: there aren't any peeps in the entire simulation, just steel, wood and foliage. The second reason is that you can't crash a coaster, if it hit's the end of the open track it just displays and error stating that the coaster has crashed.\n3. If you want to make rollercoasters, of course you do, you have to learn it. It's not that you build gorgeous tracks within the first hour, propably not even after 10 hours of learning. There aren't track-pieces like RollerCoaster Tycoon, it's more CAD-style based, just open air. Actually it's an editor where you can design almost anything inside.\n4. You can add buildings, etc. to it, but you have to make them in a program like SketchUp, 3DSMAX, etc. Than you have to export -> import them. As you see, this is not a game for people who don't have patient, this is a quality program which is rather serious. (Although they have an annual April fools joke on the news-website)\nIf you like building rollercoasters and would invest some time in it to use the same software as some of the professionals use, don't hasitate and buy this gorgeous piece of art!!! If you like rollercoasters to ride them, buy it also, on the market-place and other sources like coastercrazy, nolimits-exchange, etc. you can have an almost unlimited supply of coaster-food. Do you want to build coaster in the simple RollerCoaster Tycoon site and don't want to learn how you make proper creations, yeah, better spend your money on something better. Although this software just deserves to be bought anyways.","June 18, 2015","true","123.4"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","43","44","6","0"

Rollercoaster enthusiasts have been waiting a long time until a proper rollercoaster game. NoLimits actually uses the same software that real rollercoaster engineers use to create their screaming behemoths. How cool is that!?\n\nThat being said, the game does have a learning curve. It will take a while to master, buts it’s one of those games that’s well worth the time in trying to learn! Even though the game is billed as a rollercoaster simulator, you can even build whole theme parks! The easiest way being able to import your own .3ds models into the game. If you can't find any you like online or you are not good at creating them yourself, there are tutorials online in how to use the games supports system to create buildings and objects. Do not feel overwhelmed at first for there are tutorials all over to help get a handle on the program.\n\nIt may take some time to create an amazing coaster/park, but seeing these engineering marvels standing tall over your beautiful landscape is well worth it. I recommend any rollercoaster enthusiast to try the game out!\n","August 21, 2014","true","92.6"," 62 of 79 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","62","79","0","11"

If you enjoyed going into sandbox mode in RCT3 and just building, this is for you. If you enjoy managing money and staff, this is most assuredly not for you.\n\nIt is very complicated, not only with all of the options covering track, supports, and scenery, but also containing a java-based scripting engine which can be used to animate objects (including lights), and even program the block system for an entire ride. (a good 800 lines of code - not something I will ever try)\n\nThe models are superb, everything moves in sync, and the lighting engine is simply beautiful. I almost feel that calling it a game is an insult. Ask the companies who use this to sell rollercoasters.\n\nThe in-game help tool isn't terribly useful. It says what the various tools do, but not how you can use them. There are several youtube tutorials which are brilliant however.\n\nThis is not for everyone.

It has a nearly endless seeming list of new features, most of which make things a whole lot easier than No Limits 1. There really is no competition. It's like comparing school cafeteria food to Olive Garden. It took 8 years but it was worth the wait.\nI really like how much easier the building system is compared to NL1. That's one of my favorite things about NL2. That combined with auto-heartlining the track, I feel like I can build any sequence of curves how I want, in any shape. I don't really feel the need to look back or live in the past.\nThe graphics, while not a top priority for me, were made with TLC. The terrain editing, environments, and tree models pretty much encourage the user to make the most of it, particularly if they're designing a terrain coaster.\nThe combs, while not exact, give an indication of how I'm doing at making the ride survivable and smooth, and help take away more of the artificial difficulty that NL1 had. Having multiple viewports is slightly awkward but I can watch the G's of one viewport while watching the radii in the other. With this much in the way of new features to aid in smooth design, I feel like I can comfortably stick with hand-building, not even think about touching FVD++ (no offense Lenny). I really wanted to make smooth, heart-lined track and be able to easily adjust earlier portions at will if needed, and now I can.\nThe NL2MAT editor is pretty complicated for me, and I'm not sure if any adequate tutorials for that exist. Of course, scripting is even more complicated for me. I really like the scripting engine allows one to use custom trains. In fact, the attachment script is so versatile one can use it for custom trains, attaching headlights, automobiles, Tin Lizzies-type rides, Raging Rapids River Rides, etc. And this is just one little script. Too bad the scripting language is too complicated for most users.\nAs awesome as this program is, there are a few things I don't like.\n-If I forget which park had a particular coaster I want to work on, I have to open and check each park. Search bar won't do.\n-Testing the ride just in the editor seems to have been removed.\n-G-force combs ignore dive machine holding brakes.\n-Importing an element makes all the roll nodes 'strict' so I have to uncheck 'strict' on at least most of them. Might be a bug.\nOverall I recommend this game for any roller coaster enthusiast, and anyone who wants to make virtual coasters but finds NL1 too hard. Even if you're not a die-hard fan and don't know the names of the manufacturers or if you don't ride roller coasters very often, I feel like the sequel difficulty drop may be enough that you just might enjoy it anyway to at least some extent.","November 2, 2014","true","537.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

This is a simulator specifically for roller coasters.\n\nNo limits 1 was the most successful rollercoaster simulator on the consumer market but 8 years ago was when the makers announced NoLimits 2. NoLimits 2 was out at the beginning of 2014 and I was just amazed at the detail and new features. This simulator has astonishing details and physics. Now for my review I'll start with the editor (I will compare with the original NoLimits 1).\n\nEditor:\nThe editor in NoLimits 2 is really advanced and lets you do a lot more than NoLimits 1. First they introduced scripting which allows you to go beyond the limits of what's in the editor. But as with going with track placement, they are still doing the spline based track placement. But it has changed since NoLimits 1 as it's based off of vertexs and control polygons. The supports are the same as NoLimits 1 where it's just a single spline and node. One of my favorite features is the new import options, NoLimits 1 was stuck with .3ds formats but NoLimits 2 allows for Obj. formats which are far superior. the new editor also has a build in FVD tool and allows math formulas.\n\nSimulator:\n\nCommunity:","August 27, 2014","true","39.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

But while they all focus on different aspect of theme parks (RCT is more about management, Thrillville is more game play oriented), none of theme focused exclusively on what I like the most: roller coasters.\n\nWith NoLimits 2, all that has changed.  Instead on focusing on multiple aspects of theme parks, NL2 is dedicated exclusively on roller coasters.  You build them, you ride them, and you share them. In fact, NL2 feels more like a development tools for roller coaster designers than a game simulation.\n\nBuilding coasters in other applications was always a little awkward.  With NL2, building coaster is so easy almost everybody can built a coaster within minutes.  You still need to understand a few basics concept (like blocks for example) and understand how to use the tools.  But when you understand these fundamental concepts,  you will be able to build incredible coasters.  From there, your imagination is the only limit.\n\nThe included documentation provides just enough to get you going.  If you want more information, some excellent tutorial videos are available on YouTube.\n\nOn a technical side, the application runs surprisingly well on laptops.  I had to set the resolution to 1280x720, but other than that, it works very well.  I can now build coaster when I am on the road.\n\nI have yet to experiment with scripting and scenery so I cannot comment on these features.  But all in all, I am very satisfied with this application.  And the more I play, the more I find that while building a coaster is easy, building a GOOD coaster is hard and challenging. And when I see what other people do, I know that I have a long way to go before I could build a good coaster.\n\n","September 7, 2014","true","1.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Its focus on realism and customizability stands out as well as the performance on weaker machines (as long as the user-built parks are optimized that is). Although building your very first coaster can be quite a task the editor is easy to control, all buttons are neatly arranged.\nYou can take in-game screenshots with depth of field and adjustable field of view which can often be close to reality and are able to deceive unaware people (and sometimes even the "pros"). If pictures are too boring for you there is an option for recording videos for which you can enable a motion-blur effect.\nMany prefabricated supports are available to help you getting your first coaster done pretty fast. Those can be atomized and customized, or you can build your own supports from scratch with nearly unlimited sizes (from 0.001 m and 2 m) and a few distinct shapes (which can be cloned for easier placement). For wooden coasters it's even possible to auto-generate the supports.\nFurthermore, you can choose between many different track connectors and adjust where you want to have friction wheels, friction brake runs or magnetic fins. Custom scenery objects are supported, too. Those inlcude .3ds, .lwo and .dae files and lighting effects are just awesome when used wisely since shadow-casting ones can have a large impact on performance.\n\nWell, I just cut a long story short at this point: NoLimits 2 Roller Coaster Simulation has so many features I guess many users haven't discovered everything this program has to offer yet.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough already, the devs regularly provide the (very friendly and helpful) community with updates which will also eventually include new coaster styles and features in the future.\n\n\nSoo ... what are you waiting for? Stop reading this review, get yourself a copy of NoLimits 2 and dive into the wonderful world of speed, height, thrill and fun. Btw, they say Oculus Rift enhances the experience even more.\n\n\n\nThe total play time displayed here isn't correct as I've used the non-Steam version before, maybe add 100 hours and many more for NoLimits 1.","December 5, 2014","true","267.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I've tried nearly all the rollercoaster experiences that have come out and this game blows them all out of the water.  It's almost comical how much better and realistic this experience is.  The game comes with about 18 different coasters (all great) and running at stable framerates.  I've also downloaded a number of user-made coasters from the various fan exchange websites and from the workshop and many of these are fun and run great as well.  I haven't spent too much time in the editor program but it looks extremely robust and judging by the complexity of included coasters; very capable.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is the hardware requirements if using an Oculus.  I'm running an overlclocked i5  3570 with an OC'd GTX 980 and still need to play mostly on low settings to keep a stable 75fps.  The less complex coasters will play nicely on a lesser system but try the demo and give it a go.  Definitely my FAVORITE Oculus experience at the moment.

It took minutes to load simple parks and they ran at only half speed, so I decided to wait till I had a new system. Tried ThemeParkStudio, not much better. During the latest sale I just couldn't resist to buy it (still don't have a new system yet) and I just tried running a few parks. The performance was much, much better than before (my system is somewhere between minimun and recommended) and the editor was also easy to get started with, thanks to a short but great tutorial.\n\nIf you just want to ride some coasters, there are a lot of parks to download from the workshop, just make sure you have enough memory to run them (3GB RAM is not enough for the low quality version of the smiler, 4GB would have worked).\n\nBest rollercoaster sim ever, 10/10\n(I've played RCW1-2 (old), RCT1-4, TPS and NL1)","April 21, 2015","true","53.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

It depends on your skill, me being me, I just mess around which is actually quite fun. However, when it comes to wanting to make a smooth, exciting realistic rollercoaster, it becomes difficult. Very difficult. This game is very time consuming in the way that it takes a long time to create a rollercoaster. You do get a feeling of accomplishment when you make a perfectly smooth coaster and it is the closest thing to building a rollercoaster virtually. It requires patience and skill to not get bored of this game. I don't have either of these. I'd play it every now and again, but not all day every day.  The actual state of the game is brilliant. I haven't come across a single bug, corruption or actually any issues at all other than my stupidity. Very neat and professional, finished and generally a really good game. Just be prepared to get bored of it if you're not the best coaster creator. It is harder than I expected. It is hard to create a smooth track, there's a lot of trial, error, deleting parts and rebuilding. If you REALLY want it, get it. If you don't really mind, don't bother. I would rate it: 9/10 for state and performance, 5/10 for coaster building because of the difficulty and 9/10 for simiulation (when you go on the ride). It's very impressive, just I regret buying it simply because I'm terrible at building on it.","March 8, 2015","true","46.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is better than any other roller coaster game I've played. I tried Theme Park Studio, but it didn't work well enough for me. RCT3 is fun, but the design part of roller coasters isn't detailed enough, and you can hardly make anything realistic. But this is perfect. Not only can you be realistic (and actually stay withing good g-forces) but you can be extremely imaginative (or boring, if that's your thing). If I want to make a typical Arrow looper, I can. If I want to make a ginormous strata coaster that's 15,000 feet long, I can still do that. There are endless possibilities.\n\nSo many new features have been added since NoLimits 1. The design interface is so much cleaner and modern. The track very rarely needs adjusting and moving like in the first game. You just hit "Depump Vertices" and it automatically smooths (unlike in NL1 where smoothing was never enough). Things like the g-force and speed combs are really helpful because you can design in comfortable constraints instead of testing every element.\n\nThe graphics are also much better. I found NL1 graphics to be somewhat jagged and even blocky sometimes. NL2 has pristine graphics and everything is much more realistic. When placing trees, you can count the leaves individually. NL1 had trees that were very bunched together. Terra-forming is a lot better now. Terrain rises in a circular pattern instead of in a square pattern.\n\nAnd of course, there are many more coaster types. 4D, suspended swinging, and wing are just a few of the new coaster types available.\n\n10/10 - Perfect coaster designer. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of roller coasters.","April 18, 2015","true","140.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There's no microtransactions for tracks or trains or anything, so that up front price is all you ever have to pay. There's a workshop so there should be a steady flow of new coasters to try.\n\nCons:\nThere's some clipping with the seats but it's avoidable and ignorable.\nSome of the rides are a little TO intense. I wish there was an "intensity" scale, like, 1-5 so I could know what I am getting into... But, just have someone who cna handle the intense ones try first.

Probably...\n\nThis game is for people who know what their doing, or for people who like shouting in anger... This game is a big challenge, and unless you know what you're doing, this game is hard to play. Although it's fantastic graphics, physics and sounds, make this game worth the price, and I'd just recommend downloading someone else's level... Because all of mine are terrible...","June 14, 2015","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Gameplay is top notch, very scary, very fun. However, this game lacks from a technical standpoint. FPS dips into the 40s are frequent, and my GTX 970 rarely is utilized above 35% according to MSI Afterburner. Still, this is one of the best horror games I've ever played. I've yet to beat it and I've tried well over 20 times. Well worth $17.99.","August 23, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
