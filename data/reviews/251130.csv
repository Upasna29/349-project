It is different from most games out there, which may bother some people.\n\nYou run your own super sentai studio. which involves the management stuff: hire actors, buy/craft equipment, upgrade studio, take care of your fan base, hire marketing agencies. And of course, there is the action: fighting monsters, mecha battles.\n\nThe pros:\n- Amazing soundtrack. Really, really, really amazing. You'll feel like a child again watching power rangers, black kamen rider or your favorite super sentai show.\n- Beautiful graphics. The very best 2D Pixel Art style.\n- Humor everywhere. A lot of hidden references. Pretty cool!\n- Great squad customization. You cannot create your own character. You assign actors to squad's roles and you can choose their color, name, skill, equips, weapon. You can also choose the name of the squad, the name of the mecha, the catching phrase.\n- Solid combat. Very fun, specially if you follow the director's instructions.\n- Lots of content. This game is huge. You can have 15 hours+ of gameplay.\n\nThe cons:\n- Can't stop playing it!","April 30, 2015","true","84.4"," 155 of 166 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","155","166","10","0"

No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nBack in the old days there were a flood of Sentai TV series: Power Rangers, Sailor Moon, Beetle Borgs, Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills, Samurai Cyber Squad, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, etc etc. The list goes on for quite a while. Sentai translates to "Task Force" or "Squadron" and is usually a team of heroes wearing color coded outfits or uniforms. Basically superheroes...Japanese style! Generally they come with a range of personalities/roles that usually follows some variation of the Five-Man Band. Known for their synchronized posing; also, a standard powerup pose is often used in many Sentai works during the transformation sequence. A key concept is that the collective team are more important than the individual, and that more can be achieved by working together. Chroma Squad is directly inspired by Saban's Power Rangers, and capitalizes on most of these concepts from the Sentai genre but takes it a bit further in that you are actually managing the studio shooting the TV series!\n\nGameplay\n==========\nStarting up the game you are introduced to your team of actors/heroes, as they are in the middle of a shoot for a TV show, taking a lot of crap from their director in the process. By the end of the shoot, the actors decide to ditch their jerk of a director and start their own TV studio and sentai hero show! One of the actor's has an uncle that lends you an old warehouse where you setup your new studio.\n\nAt the start of your new career, you get to customize your team of actors, choosing what color their suit will be, the actors themselves, and change their names. You are then able to choose your studio's name, and some various phrases that will you used throughout the game, such as when your actors "morph" into their hero suits ("Chromatize!"). As a studio manager, it's your job to choose which episodes get aired and in what order. At the main screen, you can choose to buy equipment/props for your actors that boost their stats in battle scenes. You can also check yoru fan mail, which you will recieve regularly and are able to choose differents responses to. Sometimes depending on your responses you will lose or gain money and/or items. Items can also be crafted using materials you find in combat, such as duct tape and cardboard.\n\nThe main draw of Chroma Squad is in the action scenes - combat. Chroma Squad utilizes a very simple tactical RPG system in which you can move your team across a grid on the battlefield. During your "Phase" you can direct any of your actors in any order you choose until they've all had an action, then it's the Enemy's "Phase". Each character has access to a limited set of skills, and the number of skills you can use increases as you shoot more episodes and as you wrap up more seasons of the show. Your team is able to use special "Teamwork" actions, which can be very, very useful in dealing damage or traversing the battlefield. For example, one actor can toss another one, enabling them to cover more distance. Another example is having 2 or more adjacent actors attack the same enemy in a team attack. Lastly, if all 5 of your actors are adjacent to an enemy, you can use a Finishing Move, dealing massive damage to your target! FEAR THE POWER OF TEAMWORK! Each scene also has special challenges in the form of Director's Instructions. These can range from reaching an objective within a specfied number of turns, or defeating a certain number of minions before attacking a boss. Completing these orders rewards you with extra points that are converted into fans and money at the end of every episode. Most sentai shows had giant mech suits...such as Power Rangers' MegaZord. Chroma Squad has a similar feature!\n\nPerhaps one of the best things about Chroma Squad is the enemy designs. Early on you meet a fellow named Transitmancer -- a mage wield a staff with a traffic signal attached to the top of it. You will also meet enemies like "The Boxing Box"...which is literally a cardboard box with arms, wearing boxing gloves. There's way more creative ones and even some cameos, but I don't want to spoil too much of the fun!\n\nGraphics\n==========\nIf you have played Behold Studio's previous game, Knights of Pen and Paper, you will be familiar with the art style used here. It's slightly more advanced than KoPaP, with even more details on each sprite. Combat animations, movement, and even the special attacks are very well animated and look really nice. Props look great, and like I said before character designs and enemies look amazing.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThis game has one of the most amazing soundtracks I have heard in quite a long time. The best tracks are the battle tunes by FAR. Just let a battle start and leave it there for a few to take it in. They really get you pumped up for any challenges you are faced with! I have added most of it to my YouTube playlist reserved specially for great game music! The soundtrack is available for purchase on the Store Page for $4.99. Well worth it! Seriously, just give this a listen:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYnd0uRCkCk\n\nThe sound effects are pretty minimal, but they do their job. I can't fault the sound direction here, as it's pretty well done despite being fairly minimal. The soundtrack more than makes up for any shortcomings!\n\nPerformance\n==========\nChroma Squad runs like a dream. No crashes, stuttering, framerate drops, or any weird glitches were encountered during my playtime so far, and I really don't expect to see any. Behold Studios is usually really good about the quality of their games, as we've seen so far. I didn't think to test the game with my controller, as mouse and keyboard worked extremely well. Probably best for this type of game anyway.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nIf you are looking for a fun tactical RPG that's a bit different and has a ton of humor, Chroma Squad fits the bill perfectly. Such a great little title, and a complete joy to play. You should not hesitate at all in buying this, it's quite the gem! The soundtrack alone is enough to justify the purchase.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/XMmY3uRXmvM\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nIf you liked this review or found it helpful, please consider rating it up. Feel free to rate it down if you did not find if helpful, and please leave a comment letting me know what you didn't like so that I can improve my reviews in the future!\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","September 15, 2015","true","22.5"," 123 of 144 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","123","144","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/251130/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4903 products in account","Behold Studios, the developer behind the fantastic Knights of Pen and Paper, have moved from an RPG about basement Dungeons & Dragons nights to an SRPG featuring a homemade super sentai TV show. It's not a massive leap in premise or design but that's not necessarily such a bad thing; KoPaP was a fantastic comedic RPG with enough depth to enjoy as a straight-forward game if humour isn't what you're seeking. While the visual design and menus are immediately familiar for players of the previous titles, I found Chroma Squad to be far and away the more enjoyable game; something I don't say lightly.\n\nThe main meat of Chroma Squad's gameplay comes in the form of grid-based tactical combat where you lead your five person (and the occasional beaver) troop against generally overwhelming odds. It plays out like any game from the genre only fairly simplified. Streamlined is probably the more apt description though as you can easily find yourself tested, especially if you aim to complete the director's requests that come in twos for every single scene. Each character has their own class with subsequent perks to choose from so there's still plenty of strategy involved and the teamwork mechanics add a unique flavour with finishing moves and movement-extending throws.\n\nLike Knights of Pen and Paper, the simulation elements are quite light and serve as an outlet for cash to earn minor bonuses to certain stats. This isn't a business management sim like Game Dev Tycoon and while there are some moments of behind-the-scenes finance fiddling, it's more of a small taster between battles to break up the action than a full-blown hybridisation. However, there's no shortage of options for customisation and you can quickly build up a studio almost as unique to you as one you'd built yourself. You can enter personal phrases to be called out during gameplay, choose your actors, their suit colours and names, not to mention all the visual elements that come with stats like studio upgrades and equipment.\n\nMissions are varied affairs, with hostage situations, survival challenges and races against time thrown in to vary the typical back-and-forth fisticuffs. Early on, you unlock mecha missions which simulate Kaiju battles, these are mostly luck-based fights in the sense that you can keep up a combo as long as you want with the accuracy odds dropping with each successful hit. They can be frustrating but it offers a huge change from the basic battles and looks fantastic in action. It's likely the fights will be divisive with players but they're a great opportunity to see the huge robot you've been constructing from custom parts. At worst, they're a blip in an otherwise fantastic product but I enjoyed them at every occasion.\n\nI'm aware I've talked of the simplicity of the gameplay a fair bit and that it might put a lot of people off but it's been done to remove the chaff and alleviate the grind. There's still a wealth of stats to monitor, equipment to maintain and entire mechanics to indulge in should you so choose. The crafting adds an alternative to buying from shops with rarer and more effective items requiring that you deconstruct spare costume parts. Marketing options grant a huge range of bonuses upon finishing each episode and completed seasons create branches on the skill trees. It's not a slow-paced tactical XCOM clone and it's better off that way, instead it's a unique amalgamation of the best parts of so many different games and genres.\n\nThe most obvious trait of Chroma Squad though, is it's humour. If you don't appreciate games that take a tongue-in-cheek poke at their subject matter then you might be disappointed; but really, what else would you expect from a game starring a homebrew TV setup where the costumes are made from cardboard and sticky-back plastic? A lot of the storyline doesn't really make that much sense, but again, neither did that of most live-action kid's TV shows. The script is mostly fluff and it's unlikely you'll be playing through each episode out of plot intrigue, but that's exactly what the stellar gameplay is there for. You'll still get laughs aplenty playing through the campaign and a constant silly grin from all the pop culture references generously heaped on top.\n\nI'll admit my review comes from the perspective of someone that has never watched a single episode of Power Rangers or anything of its ilk. I know the references and tropes well enough to have understand every in-joke but I went into Chroma Squad excited due to the developer and genre more than the setting of the game itself. I mention it only as I believe that lovers of all things Mighty Morphin will go on to enjoy this even more than I did. With that considered, there should probably be a health warning on this for the most rabid fans.","May 2, 2015","true","8.9"," 99 of 113 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","99","113","5","2"

Somehow, I missed the disclaimer on this originally.\n\nNot since Darkest Dungeon has an experience hit on as many levels as Chroma Squad has. There is a lot of wonderful design decisions made here, and the attention to detail is what shines here: Every detail seems to be thought out from the wonderful Tactical RPG that involves acrobatics and teamwork, to the detail of the story that plays to the strength of the nostalgia of the old Power Rangers. I had this goofy grin on my face the entire time I was playing the game, and this game is an early contender for Indie game of the year. It's that good.\n\n+:\n-Team based combat, especially on hard difficulties, rewards thinking and strategy in its teamwork based combat. Acrobatics (the ability to launch people further then they could run by themselves.\n-Strong detail payed attention to the details of each episode within the story, to make it feel like a old Power Rangers episode/series.\n-Customization of game takes things to new levels with catchphrases and squad names. Adds a whole level of immersion.\n-Little Details make the experience that much more immersive, such as punishing for using a finishing move that doesn't kill a monster. Audience gauge and Director guidelines help add challenge to make the episode more flashy.\n-Overall, the nostalgia that the game repeatedly hits works on almost every level, from the 8 bit graphics to the references to the series past. In addition, it's able to mix up the modern day media/internet culture into it as well.\n-Studio upgrades leave a lot of different options to play around with. Upgrades, Mech Upgrades, Studio Upgrades, etc.\n\n-:\n-Mech battles could be a little bit more challenging.\n-Some more information can be provided at times regarding teamwork skills (like the supports healing factor, for example)\n-Comes very close to copyright infrigenment in several cases.

At worst, the scenarios get kinda samey, the mecha battles are more luck-based than anything, Scout class needs work in terms of role within the team and the meme-based humour might get under some delicate skins. Never mind the details; as a tactical RPG, Chroma Squad gets everything right and even dares some neat ideas concerning character statistics, combat and the money/audience system.\n\nWhat I'm saying is there's a deepness to the game despite the apparent simplicity of the setting, with clear character roles and a certain leeway in how you want them optimized. The love for the genre is genuine and goes a long way in enhancing your experience; it's more than just shooting aliens as in X-Com. Building an audience to gain money and better toys is a welcome change from XP grinding. The grid movement can be unforgiving what with the inability to take back a move but I feel as this just adds to the challenge factor.\n\nIn short: the core of the gameplay is great and the further you get from the tactical RPG, the worse it gets. I can't fault a game for false notes when it's just being overly ambitious. An original backdrop for an RPG, multiple story paths, clever insertion of Kickstarter backers into the story and the fact I've encountered no game-breaking bugs despite a Report button makes me want to heavily endorse this product. An example for other Kickstarter-funded game developers.","January 7","true","65.5"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","38","41","0","0"

The overall episode "goals" challenge you to certain things before the end of the section. Have yet to run into one that wasn't impossible.\n\nAs the seasons (5 in total) go on, you'll come across items to craft and buy to upgrade your Squad members, so there is atleast some customization for you to play with as you're going along the story.\n\nAfter each episode you get revenue based on how many fans you get.

Many games this generation are essentially creatively bankrupt, but Chroma Squad realizes this and challenges the standard of games today. A tycoon game with rpg gameplay and tons of customization has been completely unheard of. Fun humor and fun character designs, the game doesn't take itself seriously at all and knows its limits. It is literally self-aware of the tropes and cliches it uses. For example, in one point of the game, a girl needs to be rescued. One of the squad members questions if it should be a guy just to avoid using sexist tropes. The game knows the stupidity of generic hero-saving-the-day tv shows and utilizes it to bring out the fun that is in them easily.\n\nAlso, if you are a fan of super sentai, you will laugh your ♥♥♥ off at these references. I promise you.\n\n\nSubjective:\nIt's obvious just from the start of the game how much customization there is. You can customize everything- from your squad name, the names of your members, the attributes of the members, the weapons of the members, the abilities of the members, your mecha, your mecha's name, your transformation name, and way more. In theory, it sounds great, but when you get right down to it, it get's annoying. Have you ever felt the feeling of, "Ugh, I can't choose between these great abilities/weapons! I wish the game didn't even give me an option!" Well, half of the game is like that. It's so customizable to the point where it may ruin the enjoyment factor. Should I craft this? Should I buy this? Should I equip this? There's way too many choices. Me personally, I had only a few problems with this, considering how much I love customization in games. This is a pro or a con depending on the player.\n\nCons:\n\nRepetitive. Incredibly repetitive, to the point where you say to yourself, "Really? This again?" The game is oozing with creativity but unfortunately the gameplay is designed so that almost all of the fights are entirely the same. Some enemies are different, the map layout is sometimes different (and other times copy pasted), but the game throws at you the same fights over and over again just to reach the conclusion. This is easily noticeable after getting through the start of the game.\n\nNo effect on overall plot. Nothing you really do changes where the game is going. Sure, occasionally you get fans praising you for doing x or shunning you for doing y, but it doesn't really do much in the long run from what I've seen.\n\nLittle strategy. Unless playing on the hardest difficulty, you only need a bit of strategy to complete the levels.\n\nDialogue. The dialogue is sometimes humorous and creative, but really? It can be written by 5 year olds and probably be the same. The writing is pretty awful and the characters have little depth. This I get it; that's the whole point of the game. It doesn't take itself seriously and is SUPPOSED to be immature. It isn't that big of a deal, but the game could easily be better with more engaging dialogues and more clever jokes.\n\nMecha fights. Fun the first time you launch it and the first time you use a new ability you got, but otherwise? Not engaging at all, and anti-climactic a lot of the time. Incredibly repetitive.\n\nOverall though? Do I have to go through a bit of repetitiveness and subpar dialogue to enjoy a game with tons of replayability, nostalgic design/soundtrack and a unique experience? Definitely. This game is fun as hell.","October 11, 2015","true","12.3"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","44","53","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/251130/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","Back when the Power Rangers were a big deal in 1995, my parents wouldn't let me watch it. They deemed it too violent. Mind you, they're telling this to a guy who is chronically addicted to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and tuned in every Saturday to watch the Spiderman and Batman cartoons. Power Rangers were much too violent though. When my folks finally gave up on controlling my viewing habits Power Rangers quickly became a guilty pleasure and I watched it until Wild Force. Enter Chroma Squad, a retro style turn based tactics game that puts you in control of a squad of power rangers. It is every bit as fun as going round your parents' back to just watch cardboard robots beating up rubber monsters.\n\nChroma Squad's premise is very catchy hook to begin with. A group of disgruntled stunt actors are fed up with their boss and quit their current Ranger season to start their own series. With buckets, old shirts and cardboard boxes your crew assembles a set of costumes and backdrops and the battle against evil can begin. Along the way you'll find that there is a little more to playing Power Rangers than just making cool poses.\n\nThe game's real kicker is the ability to create and assemble your own team. You can possibly recreate every Ranger team down to the letter with the game, or engineer a squad entirely your own. Did you like Mighty Morphing Power Rangers? Just pick the five colours, three boys, two girls and be on your way. Fed up with the patriarchy? Pick five girls, colour them all in shades of purple and kick some ♥♥♥. Feeling grimdark and edgy? Pick five depressed kids, paint them black and act like Batman. Everything is up to you. Each Ranger has its own role. Lead is in charge and gets additional hitpoints, while the tech rangers does bonus damage with weapons. The colours are up to you, so you can make the Pink ranger be the boss this time round and let the snooty Red ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ be the butt of the Megazord this time.\n\nAfter you tune your squad you record your episodes. This is a turn based tactics game where you fight minions and monsters on a grid. The real selling point here is positioning and teamwork. One ranger can kick a mook for sure, but positioning your squad in such a way will allow you to vault your rangers straight into the bosses face on the first turn to deliver a juicy team attack. It is key that master the acrobatics and abilities to chase down the shifty bosses, or that you weaken and wear out the brawlers without losing a Ranger, because no one likes it when the good guys lose.\n\nYou performance isn't measured in money, or experience; it is measured in audience. Since you're recording a TV show your audience is your life; and you cannot survive without loyal viewers and fans. Every episode gives you a hand full of objectives to clear to make your episode a bit better. More audience, means more fans, means more money, means better suits, means better TV, means more audience, etc. It is a simple, yet fun system, because it invites you to think of other ways to approach a problem, rather than to look for the one tactic.\n\nThe entire game is booming with references to the Power Rangers and its Japanese original: Super Sentai. Finishing moves, focus on Red, giant robots, believing in your friends, mystery helpers, talking jars, it's all part of the experience. During your downtime you have time to craft new weapons from arts and crafts materials as well as answer fanmail and hire marketing groups to propel your show to the next level of hype. You'll quickly fall in love with the familiar and sometimes cliché traits of the series that round out the experience.\n\nAll in all, the game presses so many right buttons, it's hard not to like. Though the sometimes lazy writing rips you out of the game, the desire to know what kind of crazy thing the devs have cooked up for the next episode will have you coming back soon. The branching storyline also helps to draw you back in after beating it once. Chroma Squad is a precious gem that should be play by anyone who ever watched even a single episode of Power Rangers.","May 14, 2015","true","14.5"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","34","39","6","0"

One comes up with the idea to create their own studio and so they quit their jobs to set up their own sentai studio.\nThis game is filled with jokes and references to the tv shows or to memes and it's overall a very good laugh.\n\nNow we get to the management/business part.You now have to setup your studio and buy props like mics, lamps or a better green screen. Those items will give you all special bonuses but also come for a price. You don't only have to pay once for those items well for some you do and others cost something like 25 bucks each episode. So you have to choose wisely on what to upgrade. Also you have to hire actors, choose an agency to help you reach a greater audience and make sure you're fans are happy since hey this is tv show!\n\nOnto the RPG part! Retsu go!In case it wasn't obvious but you take the role of five actors and the director of your sentai tv show. You have to read and reply to fan mail which can grant you bonuses depending on your actions and then there's crafting.\nDuct tape, play dough, card boxes and many more stuff you'll need to craft your new items like swords, guns, helmets and so on. You can buy several materials and you can also recycle your old and unused gear for materials. You only have a % chance to get certain materials but hey atleast you have the chance to get some materials back.\n\nYour goal is to record five episodes for a season. Meaning you have to record and fight five different scenarios before you reach the season finale aka end boss battle. While recording the shows you see the directors instructions on screen which you should follow in order to get the max amount of audience.\n\nWhat else can I say?If you enjoy tactical and/or rpg games you should definitely give Chroma Squad a try.\nIf you like the good ol' Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger you will probably drool all over this game.","May 3, 2015","true","47.4"," 51 of 70 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","51","70","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsonjustice/recommended/251130/","crimsonjustice","Crimson Justice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsonjustice/","492 products in account","Chroma Squad is a Tactical RPG made by Behold Studios, the developers behind Knights of Pen & Paper. Chroma Squad is a love letter and a tribute to decades of Japanese superhero shows such as: Super Sentai, Kamen Rider and the Metal Hero series.\n\n=STORY=\n\nYou start off as a five-people  team of stuntactors who decide to make their own Sentai-themed TV show in which they become a Sentai team themselves and fight against all sorts of monsters while managing their resources and fan-community behind the scenes. The first two seasons start very tame since you’re still an indie Sentai studio with a low budget, but from season 3 onwards the plot becomes more serious and fascinating.\nDepending on your choice during the finale of season 4, you might either end up doing the Rider route, the Metal Hero route or the Sixth Ranger route. I won’t spoil much, but each route has their own scenarios going on with interesting mini stories that contribute to the game’s lore. The finale of the game itself is amazing, and is something to behold and be amazed at – I’ll try not to spoil it, but it’s definitely “empowering”.\nMind you, the game developers have suggested to implement more alternate endings or routes  within future DLC or updates, so this review might end up dated and not give a complete overview to what the story system of Chroma Squad offers.\n\n= CUSTOMIZATION =\n\nThis is arguably my favourite part of the game, ‘cuz who doesn’t want to make their very own Sentai dream team? You can customize your team by choosing out of approx. 20 actors, each with their own appearances and bonuses. You can also name them and decide which suit colour they wear, i.e. if you always wanted to make an all-Red ranger team, well here’s your chance!\nThroughout the seasons, the game offers various types of helmets and suits that not only give certain statboosts but also visually alter the appearance of your hero. Unfortunately, the amount of actors and visual-altering equipment you can choose from is quite limited, so you’ll have to either wait for future DLC or step up your modding skills.\nYou can also name your studio, your team, your giant robot, your transformation and lines of dialogue that call forth said mech, transformation and team attack. While it doesn’t give you the ultimate customization possibilities like customizing your own hero costume or actor from scratch, the game offers a decent amount of customization which will hopefully be expanded in the future.\n\n= GAMEPLAY =\n\nWhile the game is a turn-based tactical system, it’s not as complex or multi-faceted as Super Robot Wars, but neither is it overtly simplistic. You generally control five characters, each with their own stats depending on equipment, actor, role and bonuses you’ve activated through studio upgrades or siding with the more favourable marketing agencies. Each role offers a variety of skill, the Techie and Support role are for example more oriented on long-range and healing skills, respectively.\nYour characters can generally do two actions per turn – in most cases you’ll (1) move to the enemy and (2) perform an attack or (1)(2) move to the other end of the screen. Your heroes can wield weapons which not only increase attack damage but also provide with an extra skill. Last but not least, there’s the Teamwork mechanic in which you can make two or more of your heroes pull off an combined attack at an enemy they’re both facing.\nThe giant robot vs giant monster battles have a more mini-game feel to it, but it can still be one heck of an intense battle. It’s a sideview turn-based battle in which you can hit the enemy multiple times until your turn is ended through missing the opponent, ending your combo with the defend options or ending the turn with a super attack. During the enemy’s turn you must step up your reaction game to minimize the amount of damage your mech will receive.\nOutside of missions, there’s also a light Studio Simulation system going on – i.e. you’ll get to read and answer fan letters, upgrade your studio for additional bonuses, upgrade your giant robot, buy equipment, craft equipment or materials and side with the marketing agencies that give you the best bonuses or help you earn and gain more money and fans.\n\n= OVERALL =\n\nIf you’ve longed for a game in which you can make your own Sentai team and fight against hordes of enemies with the help of unlikely allies and your trusty giant robot , then look no further because Chroma Squad is arguably the best Sentai game if not one of the best Henshin Hero games up to this point. The story, several dialogues and fan letters will make you laugh and smile – and perhaps, even give you the feeling that you’re being a true hero of justice. Gameplay-wise, Chroma Squad is a very accessible game but not without a challenge for those who want to step up their game. While the visuals and soundtrack aren’t AAA-tier, they’re still pleasing and amazing to see and listen to nonetheless. This game is definitely made with love, and it shows. I can’t wait for the future updates and potential-DLC this game has to offer. Behold Studios, you’re the best and thank you for this amazing loveletter to decades of tokusatsu heroism.","May 5, 2015","true","55.6"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

Each has a specific role ingame that makes one more awesome than the other.\nThe plot divides and intertwines between "real-life" and show which leads to funny dialouges between the characters and enemies.\n\nThe game itself is NOT a serious simulation and even makes fun of itself. Its mixed with a little bit of income managment and skill editing of the different classes by crafting and/or buying items.\nThe crafting menu is not complex and not too simple - you get new equipment to buy/craft every "season"(which can be compared to chapters) which require rare materials you can find during an episode(level) or craft/recycle out of lower grade materials.\n\nThe gameplay itself can be compared to other RBS - you move your characters a given number of tiles per turn and attack - or use a weapon - or use a skill - or prepare for 'Teamwork' to unleash the super epic ultra finishing move penta deluxe!!!\nWhile gameplay is kept simple the game gives you a number of goals you have to achieve (like: Kill [...] in 2 turns.) in order to gather more audience and get more money and fans for that episode(level) which get harder just like the enemies.\n\nWhile the enemies are sort of clone troopers its not getting boring since you will encounter a new enemytype or boss almost every level.\nThe graphics themselves are outstanding (my bar for this one is not set too high) - the looks of the actors are changing with the equipment they are wearing and animations are smooth and flawless. You can see every minute that went into the creation of every art asset in this game.\n\nI'm not quite through with the game but as far as I played I would say that since I saw it on gamescom 2014 it lived up to all my hopes I put in it and didn't waste any of its possible potential. I absolutely fell in love with this game. (Thanks for being with MEGA-BOOTH at gamescom to the devs at this point)\n\nBuy this game if you want a fun ride with awesome ideas/design and changing gameplay.\n\n-RaptorTwitch","April 30, 2015","true","8.7"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","31","37","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weeabooshogun/recommended/251130/","weeabooshogun","Weeaboo Shogun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weeabooshogun/","178 products in account","I backed this game on Kickstarter, and it's better than I ever could have hoped for.\n\nThis game, at its core, is a tokusatsu simulator. What is tokusatsu? It's a style of Japanese live action television featuring transforming super heroes, martial arts, and special effects and stunts.\n\nLet me first say this: don't let the "Inspired by Saban's Power Rangers" throw you or discourage you from buying it. The designers were forced to put that under threat of legal action from Saban, and there are a few subtle digs at Saban throughout the game. Tokusatsu heroes are much bigger than just what came to the West as Power Rangers. In actuality, many countries including Brazil and France got Japanese tokusatsu super heroes in the eighties and nineties before Power Rangers was a "thing", and that is inspired by the full range of Japanese superhero shows. Fans of tokusatsu heroes will spot references not only to classic Super Sentai, but also to Kamen Rider and Metal Hero shows such as Space Sheriff Gavan and Juspion.\n\nThere are two main portions to the game: tactical combat and studio management. In the tactical combat portion, you battle "mook" enemies and a "monster of the week" in a format almost identical to Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea in an isometric perspective. There are always "objectives" for each episode given by your show director such as performing a certain number of stunts or defeating the enemy in a certain way. Doing so will boost your ratings and improve the show's income.\n\nIn the studio management portion, you purchase and set up upgrades for your humble studio, investing in better cameras, hiring big name actors and skilled crew, and upgrading your special effects and costumes. While your costumed heroes may start out with a mop bucket on their head and bicycle pads for armor, with enough positive fan reaction (which you'll see after each episode is filmed via a sampling of tweets about the episode) you might eventually be wearing costumes on the level of a professional production! Additionally, interactions with other companies and fans might affect your production. What will you do when other studios start coming to you with their hands out? Take them to court or give them a cut? What will you do when overseas fansubbers start subbing your show? Let them on the chance it'll increase your merchandising, or drop the hammer on them?\n\nIn addition to this, you have a great deal of customization of your show itself. You can name your studio, name your super hero team, and even customize what they say when they transform or do their super attack. Want them to shout out, "Henshin!" when they transform instead of the default? You can do it! Want to pick your own colors instead of the default? You can do it! Want to have an Orange Ranger instead of a Yellow Ranger? Want them ALL to be red heroes? Yes, you can even do that!\n\nThis game follows the standard Sentai story elements: heroes battle foot soldier "mooks" on foot in their civilian clothes until they build up enough power (audience approval!) to transform -- and when they do, it boosts your audience approval even more. Once you defeat the monster of the week, of course, as any fan of the shows know, the monster has to grow huge. And what would Sentai be without giant robot battles? Purchase gear and equipment, assemble your giant robot and have a battle on a massive scale.\n\nIn addition, there is a motorcycle prop you'll receive later, and an option to shift the show into a "solo mode" featuring a lone motorcycle Rider hero with a flowing scarf that favors jump kicks as his preferred method of defeating monsters. So in case you are curious -- yes, you CAN be a Kamen Rider!\n\nThe graphics are 8-bit, but don't let that discourage you. The animations are great, the characters are big and bright with big cutscenes when important events happen. The music is catchy and reminiscent of classic Commodore chiptunes or Nintendo 8-bit sounds with a catchier sound.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. If you're a tokusatsu fan, you definitely will want to play this, but even if you just have a passing interest in superheroes, tactical battle games, or managing a TV studio, the charm and uniqueness of this game will certainly entertain you.","April 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","28","32","0","1"

No trope is left untouched as you battle and "chromatze" your way through hoards of enemy lackies and boss monsters in the well designed turned based RPG gameplay.

After 10,000 years I'm free! Not only from the infernal hellfire of school, but from that god awful writer's block! Time to conq- write; write a review. Sorry. It's on Chroma Squad, so strap in.\n\nREVIEW\nChroma Squad\n\nGENRE\nTactical RPG\n\nSTORY\nThe year is 20XX probably. Five stunt actors with attitude are recording their parts in the most recent episode of the hit sentai show sensation: Super Rangers! The show stinks though, and so does its director: Dr. Mi Ah. [More like MAMAMiAh, amirite?] No cool monster fights, no struggles against the higher ups, and most of all; no giant mecha fights! Our heroes are fed up and, immediately after finishing the recording session, quit Super Rangers to start their own sentai show. The gang sets up their base of operations in Blue's uncle's warehouse; unsure of where to begin. However, in the center of the room stands a large object obscured with a large bedsheet. Pulling the sheet off, our actors find the start of their new journey,  and after signing a contract or two; they're ready to Lights, Camera, Chromatize!\n\nGAMEPLAY\nChroma Squad is very unique in its gameplay, fairly simple, but unique nonetheless. You control your units on a grid, taking turns moving your units and allowing your enemies to move. Simple. You can utilize a teamwork mechanic to not only group up on an enemy, but launch your rangers to spaces they couldn't normally reach. Unique. Each of your units has specific passives and abilities tailored to their class. Simple. These abilities may come into play for completing 'director's instructions'; secondary objectives that will give a healthy boost to your audience. Unique. Every mission features a big boss monster that has its own special attacks and abilities. Simple. Just like in Power Rangers though, the monster becomes gigantic after you beat it; bringing you into a risk-vs-reward kaiju fight minigame. Unique. You get the jist.\n\nOutside of combat you can upgrade your gear, improve your studio, answer e-mails, sign marketing agencies to your show, and upgrade your mecha. Upgrading your gear not only increases certain stats, but visually changes the look of your heroes for hire. Improving your studio provides you with an advantage while recording your episodes; though you really shouldn't think too hard about them. I'm not rally sure how upgrading your light fixtures makes enemies less likely to dodge attacks, but I also don't get how so many people burn their meals while watching my show. E-mails range from heartfelt to crazy and everything in-between Sometimesyou get fan-mail about aliens and tinfoil hats, and other times you get companies asking you to buy a 'sword enlargment kit.' Marketing agencies provide temporary bonuses in and outside of combat depending on which agencies you sign your brand to. Personally, I always chose Toys-R-Fans because I like money having money; lots and lots of money. Upgrading your mecha simply gives it small bonuses during the kaiju fights, such as increased hit chance or a chest beam. Y'know, little things.\n\nVISUALS\nThe visuals are nice, not too complex, but very charming. The pixelated aesthetic compliments the game nicely; and this especially shows in the exemplary boss design. You'll start out fighting monsters like Boxing Box; a cardboard box with boxing gloves. [You're on a tight budget okay?] Eventually however, you'll be fighting intergalactic evildoers such as Tengu, a Japanese demon with cloning capabilities. Either way, the game was pleasin' to my eyeballs and I think it'll please yours too.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nHot diggity dog, this is a good soundtrack! Featuring 31 unique tracks composed by a variety of artists; you couldn't ask for anything better to accompany your multi-dimensional misadventures. Each track fits its respective scene beautifully, with the timing on some of them being downright god-tier. [That might be a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point.] Personally, my favorite track has got to be the main theme. I can't tell you how much time I've wasted on the main menu listening to it. I probably need help.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nIt takes quite a bit to make me buy a game based off of impulse alone, and Chroma Squad happened to have that special something. It was charming, enjoyable, and just challenging enough from start to finish to keep me wanting more consistently. In a way, I got hooked on Chroma Squad the way you get hooked on a show. My first thought after beating an episode was 'Man, I can't wait to see what happens next!'. Being able to choose my actors and their names was a great touch, and the ability to modify the catchphrases and names of aspects of the show took it to the next level. I don't think I'll ever get tired of a wise, robed monk yelling 'Prepare for dank justice!' before turning into a spandex clad superhero. The gameplay is simple, but brings a unique twist to just about every aspect. The dialogue is... cringe-worthy at times to say the least. At the same time though, it reminded me of the horrible dialogue in my favorite shows as a kid. I love the look of it, and I don't think I'll ever quite get over how fantastic the music was. This game is by no means perfect, but for what it's worth; I'm willing to say that this is everything that I've ever looked for in a videogame. It panders to my inner-child, it indulges my unhealthy addiction to customization, it scratches that tactical gameplay itch, it gives me goosebumps when I listen to the music, and most of all; it makes me remember why I love video games. Thanks Behold Studios, I needed something to get me outta this rut.\n\nOhheytherealsomayormaynotbeanactualalienthreatthat'sgonnadestroytheplanetifyoudon'tstopitsogoodluckwiththat.","June 10, 2015","true","51.1"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","30","39","9","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/251130/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:Chroma Squad is a turn-based action RPG game that revolves around a group of Power Rangers stunt actors, who are acting Power Rangers. They are unhappy with their director and with the studio where they are taking the show, so they make their own, Chroma Squad! The story might have few surprises for you but the main thing are the references and jokes, you'll find many of those.\n\nGameplay is classic for turn-based action games, with exception of acrobatics - a character can hold a position so another character can ricochet himself farther (closer to your target enemy). You can expect about 30 levels (split into 5 "seasons"), with repeating basic enemies but original bosses, which will make you laugh and, some later ones, might make you a little angry. You have to try hard.\n\nBut I don't want to scare you, I've played on "Interesting" difficulty (take it as normal) and I think it was perfectly balanced experience. I had times where I've almost didn't beat the level (last man Power Ranger standing!) and I've never felt the game was too easy, so I always felt motivated to do my best.\n\nAnyway, Chroma Squad would totally suck if they weren't able to form into a huge mech. And guess what, you will have a mech action too! But don't get too excited for that, mech fights have completely different fight rules, there is no positioning strategy and your attacks are based on your luck.\n\nVisuals are presented in neat pixelart style, combined with nice sound effect and soundtrack, which contains even a Japanese theme song! Everything gets you to the right mood pretty fast, so you can enjoy everything developers made - and there's a lot of content to see.\n\nChroma Squad is definitely worth recommending, I've enjoyed it for more than 10 hours and might even try to play it later again on higher difficulty for another endings. If you are looking for  turn-based RPG, pixelart and want many pop culture references, you'll love it!\n\nPros:- Extensive system of skills, upgrades, items and crafting. You'll spend minutes in management windows between fights and you won't mind it at all!\n- Well-made turn RPG and strategy gameplay.\n- Funny dialogues that perfectly fits into the silly story of stuntmen running a TV show, that changes their lives.\n- Specific unique tasks for every single battle. So if you think it's too easy, try to do something more and complete them - you'll be more popular, if you can do it.\n- Fair pixelart graphics.\n- Doesn't get repetitive. There are many mobs that are getting reused pretty often but you can (on most levels) expect a new and original boss with his unique skills. Also, every season, each of your characters get a new skill!\n- More difficulties, more endings.\n- Good sound effects and soundtrack.\n- Steam achievements.\n\nCons:- Kaiju fights. They are too much based on luck, you just see your % chance to hit your enemy... and hope you'll hit it.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 16","true","15.0"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

It's a lot of fun to play, and the developers clearly have put their heart into it. I highly recommend getting it, though at the time of this writing it still has a number of bugs to iron out.\n\nThe game is challenging. It may be possible to resolve an episode quickly, but going straight to the finish line without doing anything interesting doesn't attract an audience, which you'll need if you want fans and money. Figuring out how to build your audience efficiently while keeping your squad standing is difficult and very satisfying.\n\nBetween episodes, you produce your show at your studio. Here, you manage your squad's equipment and skills, purchase studio upgrades, answer emails, hire advertising agencies, and choose which episode to shoot next. If you've played X-COM, you'll be familiar with this.\n\nThe customisation options really let you craft your own super sentai. You can choose your squad members, pick suit colours, name the mecha (the mecha's colours reflect the team's colours), write catchphrases, and of course, name the squad. The personal touches aren't "cutting-edge" but they make the game more immersive and playing a lot more fun. At least, I get a kick out of it.\n\nLeading my Cuddle Force is a man in a panda suit named Blossom. Squad members Make Love (yes, the button to suit up is labelled "Make Love") and they yell "Cuddles conquer all!" after transforming. Their finishing move is the Beatdown of Love, and their mecha's name is Robert.","May 1, 2015","true","42.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","17","21","3","0"

There is a hilarious tactical strategy RPG hiding beneath the pixel cover, which proudly confesses its Power Rangers heritage.

Oh excuse me "Season 1" with 4 Episodes  + a 4 Part Season FInale!\nand I have to say - I. Am. Pumped!\n\nthe game itself is (as the title card says) a Shoot out to the classic Power Rangers series. You take over the role of 5 spandex wearing Super Sentai Actors who grew tired of their old director and start their own studio.\nThey use Blue Rangers Uncles warehouse to shoot their first episodes and find a prop from a huge Super Hero thing - which their old director finds out himself... From there on he starts plotting and you start raking in fans, money and cardboard to make awesome costumes.\n\nFirst of all - the Episode stories are HILARIOUSLY terrible! But then, looking back to when Power Rangers was a thing in my life... WHo cared about story? I dont want to see those 5 people at school! I want to see them beat up those evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! Come on, make an entrance and beat the crap out of those Baddies! And thats what those episodes are about\n"F**k Story, lets kick some ♥♥♥!"\nthe fighting feels like its fitting into a SUper Sentai series, with acrobatic jumps, multi hit combos and dreadfully colorful Team Attacks, and at times, I feel less like a twenty-something years old dude playing a strategy game, and more like the 6 year old kid, watching those spandexed Actors beating the crap out of other spandexed actors, Striking poses myself and being the Blue Ranger in Kindergarten.\n\nBut I have to do some critic here as well. As first - the tutorial covers the basics. and only the basics. It covers moving, acrobatics, Team attacks with basic attacks. But thats it. Okay - other things can be found out within play, like that you can start a Team Attack with a Weapon Attack, instead of a basic attack and that the Weapon musnt be on Cooldown as well.\n\nSecondly - Weapons. Your main weapons are your - gloves. You can buy and craft swords and Guns but they never seemed to use them in battle. just... punching the enemy. Until I found out that those weapons are Active Abilities, with Cooldowns and all.\n\nThe Amount of customisation is overwhelming in the beginning, and sometimes you may end up not knowing what to pick. But you'll come to understand.\n\nHowever, overall the game is awesome, and if you are a fan of old Super Sentai Series and in need of a little nostalgia fix, get this game!\n\n\nRandom Fun Fact : When Haim Saban first bought the US rights for the Power Rangers Series, he only reshot the "Everyday Life" scenes with US actors and took the Fightng scenes from the japanese original series and re-dubbed them. A pretty intelligent move.","May 4, 2015","true","10.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

You leave the next day thinking you should ask for her number, but you don't want to ruin the mood.  For the next week you can't stop thinking about her, every waking moment at work, you're dream of that smooth sound track, or the cute way teamwork throws you over the enemy head or that classic finishing move with a twist...you realize she was the one, she was the game you could spend the rest of your life playing if they'd just put out more!  But...but, it's too late, because you didn't want to be ask...damn damn damn!  (seriously though, I'd be happy if you guys made some DLC for the game)\n\nActual review:\nThis game is a paragon of polished indie developing.  Gameplay is nicely balanced between managing a budding hollywood studio, planning show episodes, gearing out your team, and actual filming (combat events) of the show.  The storyline is well written and kept me wanting to find out what happened next, combat is varied with all the different things you can do (teamwork, using items/weapons, skills, morphing ("chromizing") vs fighting as nomral people, and of course all the wonderful abilities that come up through gameplay.   Let's not forget the mini-goals you can choose to complete during each scenario and managing your fan base (answering emails...etc).\n\nI appreciate that you have a casual mode for people who want to build a studio based on purely asthetic decisions vs. the harder modes where you need to manage stats that items give production.\n\nMy favorite part is when building a team I can name them anything I want (I can name the squad anything I want too) and you get to choose the people on your team INCLUDING a loveable but useless animal mascot....well he wasn't so useless once I armed him with guns!  mwhahahaha!","May 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","69","25","36","17","0"

While some of the directors goals are tricky, they do add to the challenge, and it force you to learn the tricks of the game quickly. You'll soon enjoy tossing actors across the map and pummeling minions as a team for fun and profit.\n\nOutside of combat, it's all about the show. You and your mech will need upgrades that not only give you the usual benefits of gear, but also make you look better. Get a bigger studio! SD Cameras! Flood lights! The better it looks, the move people will watch, and the better your options and cash flow will be.\n\nAnd this works together, resulting in a good casual strategy game that I can't wait to play more of.","May 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

I was impressed right out of the gate as the game incorporates several different genres very well and even adds several new elements that I have not seen before.\n\nThe tactical combat of the game is very enjoyable and there is much more to it than I had initially assumed.  Each episode begins with your heroes arriving on the scene and battling their enemies in their plain clothes.  While in this form you don't have access to your equipment and abilities, though you are formidable enough to go toe-to-toe with the villains all the same.  Once you transform, however, you get your costume and the previously stated abilities unlocked and you can really do some impressive things.\n\nThe aspect of combat that really caught my attention and made this game stand out, though, is that your goal is to make every fight as cinematic as possible.  For example, every battle has two Director's Objectives that give a massive boost to the points you earn for putting on an exciting fight, your Audience.  You also gain audience for performing special skills, defeating enemies, using teamwork to give a teammate a boost (the boosted character performs an acrobatic maneuver to move additional spaces that turn), and most of all for performing unified 'team attacks' where you set your squad up in such a manner that they all focus on and attack the targeted enemy at once,\n\nThe music is enjoyable, the battles challenging and fun.  Did I mention that you get to customize the look of your gear, colors of your outfits, specializations of your stats and skills, and actors who you use for your squad?  Oh right, and you get to customize and do battle with your own mech!\n\nI can not put into words how highly I recommend this game.  Truly a hidden gem and one of the best games I've come across in awhile.","June 13, 2015","true","17.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Basic attacks, Team attacks (with 1-4 other team members) single or double moves, teamwork stances and acrobatic vaulting and 5 different classes each with their customizable special abilities. Multiply that 5 and you'll be doing a lot of strategic thinking each round of combat.\n\nThere is an actual strategically meaningful decision to be made between performing actions that are tactically sound and actions that make for good television. Because this game is not *actually* a set of heroes saving the world, but rather about a television show about heroes saving the world, your 'audiance meter' is of serious consideration. Often times the director's instructions (which, if completed, greatly helps your audiance meter) run counter to what one might do otherwise if thinking in a pure strategic manner. Striking a balance between the two is the key to maximizing ratings for an episode while still winning a fight.\n\nThe higher your ratings the more money you get. Money plus material drops allow you to upgrade your studio and further customize your 5 actors. Add to all of that a very awesome, and branching, story and you have a game that is WELL worth the cost of admission. The only thing that would make it 100% perfect would be to make an episode editor allowing players to easily create their own episodes and share them on the workshop. Regardless, this is an indie game that is worth your time and money.","May 4, 2015","true","19.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

If you like one or both of those, I am 99% sure you will like this. If you do not know of either, then that is what the rest of this review is for!\n\nI confess, I never watched Power Rangers or any sentai shows as a kid. But I do know the tropes quite well and have heard more than enough about them to get the gist. Chroma Squad is a love letter to those shows, and you should expect them to follow those standard formulas. I found it to be an absolute blast, especially as an SRPG lover. Take a look below to see all the reasons why.\n\nPros:\nWhile I like SRPGs in general, this one hooked me and wouldn't let go. The gameplay is addicting. Every episode has different objectives and maps, and it is a lot of fun to figure out how to best impress your audience while winning the fight. It keeps the core gameplay strong while adding enough variables to make the on-foot fights fresh.\nThere is a crafting system that  works well. You can make some nifty equipment with materials that randomly drop. Sometimes the shop equipment will be better, and you always receive gold after each level. So even if you bomb during a crafting session, you have good resources to fall back on.\nGrinding does not exist. There is no experience present, and the only thing you can earn from each level is randomly dropped items, which cap off at eight per level. I approve of the levels all being scaled by equipment per season, rather than by level. You can even mix up the order you play groups of episodes in!\nYou have a lot of freedom with your characters. You can select different designs for the squad of five, name them, choose their skills, equip them accordingly, and make some great set-ups while utilizing a "role" structure. As a bonus, you get to name your studio, catch phrase, and robot, among other things.\nThe story starts off a bit standard, but it evolves into a fun plot. The build-up is excellently done, and the development your characters get helps a lot. I grew very fond of my squad and was sad to finish their story, though happy with how it ended.\nThere are three endings, and while I have only gotten one of them, I get the feeling they are each very different. Along with this, some choices come up throughout the plot that have an impact on the battles and story overall. It is great to have a reason to replay it beyond simply wanting to play it.\nVery good graphics all around! The characters look distinctive and have well-done designs, the giant robot and enemies look hardcore, and the TV screen openings/endings/loading screens are nice touches. It is a colorful game that is pleasing to the eye.\nThe music is fan-ta-stic! The opening theme alone made me go, "Oh heck yes," and the rest of the game kept that quality. You can buy the soundtrack for $3.99, which is more than worth it. I know I'll pick it up when I have some more funds to spare.\nOf course you get a giant robot to fight in. Why wouldn't you? I like the way it works overall. Defending requires precise timing with your clicks, which is of a fair difficutly. But trying to hit the kaijus multiple times is problematic. I missed far more 70% opportunities than I hit with. Bad luck? Most likely, but it can be frustrating. I still call the robot fights a plus due to their epic feel and most of their mechanics, yet unlike the on-foot fights, there is not a whole lot of variation. The developers mentioned they want to strengthen this part of the game, which would be great.\nSpeaking of the developers, they are very friendly people who take fan comments and suggestions into account. They are constantly striving to improve Chroma Squad. Having people like them as the creators of this game makes me think it will become even better. That is incredible to consider, given that they already have produced an amazing piece right here. Their tribute to sentai shows is masterfully executed, and I love their dedication to that.\nThere are 43 achievements that you can get, and most of them are not too difficult. As a bonus, if you beat the game on a higher difficulty level, you get achievements for that level and all of the ones below it. I wish more games would do this instead of insisting you play on easy mode after beating hard mode, all for the sake of an achievement.\nOkay, look. You control a group of people in colorful suits fighting evil cupcakes, lawyers, irons, badgers, and television sets with martial arts, wacky weapons, and a giant robot made out of cardboard boxes. What else do I need to say to get you to buy this?\nNeutral:\nThe analog stick movement with the PS3 controller seems a bit floaty. I am not sure how it is for other types of controllers. Using the mouse keeps the movements sharp. Thankfully, this is not a game that requires quick analog movements, so it is not a big deal.\nSpeaking of controllers, you can't use the controller for the kaiju fights. Again, not a big deal, especially since there are not many commands used in them. It is somewhat bothersome to have to set the controller aside, but the store page does say it is only partial controller support. My PS3 controller actually worked in every other situation (besides typing out the names for my heroes/studio,) so that was a pleasant surprise given that I wasn't sure how well it would respond.\nThere is no New Game+. Some games are not suited for New Game+, but this one begs for it. The good news is that the developers have acknowledged the lack of a New Game+ and are trying to implement it. I would be very happy with that addition!\nWhat this game does have are multiple save files. I like this feature. The problem is that there is nowhere in the game that makes it obvious this is possible. I thought I would be erasing an old file when I started a new one, and only then learned it keeps multiple files.\nThis game does have trading cards. They look nice and are a good addition for collectors.\nCons:\nIf you have more than a certain amount of weapons or armor in your inventory, you can only see a handful to equip. You can't scroll through them to get an older item if you want it. Since I like to have one copy of each item in most of my games, this drove me bonkers. You can still recycle the old items, you just can't get to them on the equip screen. Ugh!\nWhen using the keyboard controls, the mouse pointer shows over the game pointer. I don't know if there is a way to disable that. If there is, I couldn't find it. That is the main reason I used a controller, as when you are using the analog sticks instead, the mouse pointer vanishes.\nThere are some spelling and grammar errors scattered throughout the game. Most of them are not that noticeable, and they do not interfere with the story, but they are worth mentioning. The oddest one I saw was weapons that you craft saying "any role" can use them, when in truth some are limited to certain roles.\nOverall experience:\n\nI was excited to play this game, and it surpassed even those expectations. It satisfied me not only as an SRPG, but as a stand-out tribute to a great genre. It is charming, fun, and has fantastic spirit. I've beaten it once, but I plan to play it at least two more times. It's too good not to!\n\nRating:\n\n9/10. I was leaning toward 9.5/10, but there's a few issues that drag it down a little too much for me to give that precious half of a point. That being said? This game is awesome and playing it will make you feel more awesome as well. Join in on the sentai love and pick up Chroma Squad now!\n\nLooking for more great indie games?

Thank goodness for that, because it’s every bit as charming as the developer’s previous game Knights of Pen & Paper, only without those pesky micro-transactions.\n\nDespite a few questionable design choices and small bugs, Chroma Squad is an enjoyable experience. The customization makes all the difference in the world, and it has an infectious innocence that evokes fond childhood memories. The campaign goes on for a solid ten hours, plenty of time to use the framework’s potential to the fullest. If that doesn’t appeal there’s also a branching story, talk of adding multiplayer, and the end credits promise an upcoming New Game+ mode.\n\nOverall Score: 6.5/10 - Good - A whimsical love letter to Super Sentai and a must have for a fan, though far from perfect in design.\n\nRead the full review at: http://techraptor.net/content/chroma-squad-review-spandex-warriors","May 11, 2015","true","7.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

This is an amazing game IF: You like Power Rangers or Super Sentai. This is the main reason I'm "Not Recommending".  I will still play for another 50 hours or so, but I'm a Rangers and Sentai fan.\n\n9/10 - Power Rangers/Sentai fans\n6/10 - Normal RPG, tactical fans\n\nChroma Squad has some mis-leading aspects, mainly that this is a simple tactical game, and not so much of a Manager/Studio Simulation, and it lacks any deep RPG elements.\n\nPROS:\n-Best Power Rangers game yet! No joke, easily the best. If you like Power Rangers at all- BUY THIS NOW! You will not be very disapointed.\n\n-Blend of tactical, rpg, and simulation aspects\n\n-Can customize team's colors, equipment, weapons\n\n-Crafting is available\n\n-Can upgrade the studio\n\n-Great retro music and art (some people hate that, I like it)\n\n-You do not gain levels. This is under pros and cons because to some this takes away from how much of an RPG it is. To others, this means no 'grinding'\n\n-Great GUI/UI. It looks very nice, and it's easy to use.\n\n-Contracts with different agencies. This is a really nice touch. I like this a lot.\n\nCONS:\n\n-The simulation/managing aspect is sort-of fake. You don't really become a fliming studio in the sense you get to create your own episodes. Nor does changing the 'actor' for your Rangers change their personality (a black guy with a mohawk has the same personality as an alien, who also has the same personality as a living beaver-man).  You DO get to choose the order of episodes, but this will only change the ending of the game (as of right now, when I write this).\n\n-Virtually NOTHING you do has an effect on how the story/studio/managing/episodes etc. Some things effect how many fans you get, and it will change these end-of-episode fake tweets (Twitter) "Wow!  You ended with a finishing move! That was awesome" or "Lame, you need to change your gear! #OldGearIsLame". This is a nice touch at first, but it becomes annoying. Especially when 'fans' want you to change your gear every episode, when there isn't any new gear avaiable.\n\n-Tactical elements are light: I did not feel I had to ever strategize to complete a level.\n\n-RPG elements are light: Very few RPG-like choices. When you beat a season, you get new 'Season Abilities', ultimately only allowing for 5 different abilities/powers/moves per 'Hero'/Ranger\n\n-Studio Management aspect is very light: Right now it only improves your heroes, and or Mecha. It can also give you more fans/money.\n\n-Mecha Battle: This is nothing more than a simple time-reaction game. It does not feel engaging, and also Mecha battles do not happen after every fight. So when it /does/ happen, it feels anti-climatic because of how shallow the fights are.\n\n-Crafting can be fun, but it also feels shallow. Instead of choosing the gear you like (like a damage suit vs a HP suit vs a magic suit etc) you just get scaling gear. So you end up re-crafting your old gear just so you can get the newest set.\n\n-Due to crafting the items in the 'Shop' are either much worse or much better in comparison. (Level 3 shirt from shop: 120 HP, Level 3 shirt crafted: 87 HP and +1 random property (likely of equal strength)\n\n-The story... If you buy this game for the story PREPARE to be disapointed. It's fully of tongue-in-cheek (aka humorous, funny, comical etc) elements. I am not a huge fan of this. The writing isn't very solid (Sorry Gui) and I never find myself wanting to know what happens next\n\n-There isn't a lot of gear/items/equipment etc. Half way through the game: 14 'equipment' pieces to craft, 17 to buy. Weapons: 14 to buy, 12 to craft. Remember, these only affect some visual looks and your stats. Weapons give you a new attack (which is nifty) but ultimately it's going to be a variation on the same thing (axe doing more damage than sword)\n\n-(Currently) no NewGame+\n\n-There are even fewer studio improvements to buy, making the studio/managing aspect even weaker. (I'm half way through the game and I have 10 available to buy)\n\n-Buying the "bigger studio' doesn't actually change anything for the episodes. Nothing at all. (It provides stats, but does not change the episodes themselves) At least in Game Dev Tycoon the visuals changed to a larger studio and gave more options to do things. That is not the case here.\n\n-You do not gain levels. This is under pros and cons because to some this takes away from how much of an RPG it is. To others, this means no 'grinding'\n\nKnowing all of this: I will still end up playing quite a bit. And I don't mind posting this, knowing a lot of fan-bois will dislike my review. I still find the game to be fun, but very misleading. You don't really manage very much.

No level up system so the equipment system is the only way to change character stats. This causes a pretty simple tactical RPG system character-wise. Most of the strategy is in the battles themselves making sure you choose the right abilites to accomplish the objectives or "director's instructions". Marketing and upgrading your studio are the other two micro managing things you'll do between stages ("episodes"). Both pretty much letting you adjust rewards for completing episodes or helps you gain bonus stats during them.\n\nThe other major part of the game is the Mecha battle! Although they can get a tad bit tedious, it's Costume Quest-esque fun. You ugrade your machine parts, but in the end the pieces are all pretty similar. The mecha fights are all the same, your hits are die rolls, and missing a 95% hit is infuriating when they pummel you 3 times in a row after. The saving grace for Mecha battles is that you can hold Enter to fast forward them like cut scenes.\n\nThe dialouge is pretty funny and the story riddled with pop culture references, this makes for a special kind of humor. It has a pretty entertaining story and kept me hooked all the way through.

Sure the effects were cheesy and the plots formulaic, but there was a special magic when you were younger to seeing a team of colourful heroes take down hordes of nameless aliens and monsters. Hell, Marvel Disney seems to know what’s up. With the help of Kickstarter, Behold Studios launched their tactical RPG based off Saban’s hit franchise with amazing results. Get your suit ready, it’s time to Chromatize.\n\nFor such a lighthearted tone, the storyline is legitimately captivating. In what almost seems like a metaphor for the formation of Behold Studios, the 5 stunt actors that do most of the work on their past Sentai show decide to quit out of frustration with their director’s lack of fresh ideas. While building a studio from scratch, our heroes need to shoot episodes quickly and establish a fanbase to turn some revenue so they can keep the lights on, the actors paid, and the new season contracts coming in. The entire game is framed around this television production point of view, with missions gradually blurring the lines of reality into the realms of fantasy and superpower for the characters. Setups for conflict are playful with these ideas; an episode may require multiple reshoots due to on-set power outages, and other times you could be joined by unexpected ally rangers with their own personal vendettas against the alien baddies. Each level ends with tweets from your followers either praising or criticizing your work, and a fun email system helps to make you feel like you’re actually interacting with your niche crowd. The brief tutorial on combat helps succinctly explain the flow of fighting without dragging down players with over-explanation, and it does a great job to tie into the introduction of the story. The whole game carries a consistently fun tone that’s easy to enjoy. It’s a cheerful and self-aware romp through the experiences of being an independent studio and crafting something meaningful to both the creators and fans.\n\nFor veterans of the genre it may feel slightly basic and on a smaller scale, but every element you’d want in a tactical RPG has been incorporated here fantastically. There are 5 separate roles for each party member to fill. There’s the lead that acts as a tank, support as a healer, a stealthy and mobile scout, an assault character as your heaviest damage unit, and a techie that specializes in ranged combat and item use. Each class has distinct capabilities and limitations for moving around boards and dispatching enemies, making your choice of team member just as important as what you want to do with them. Audience is gained by performing skillful moves and combos, and this metric dictates your overall fan count and income. Just like most Power Rangers episodes, the squad usually has to engage in some out of costume combat before having enough audience power to Chromatize and activate your powerful suits and abilities. Skilled players can be rewarded with bonus audience by following special director instructions in each episode shoot. Trying to setup tactics to fulfil every side goal can be challenging, but other times the objectives sort of complete themselves.\n\nPlayers can employ a variety of tactics to clear levels; strategies don’t simply involve just hiding weaker units behind tanks. There are two phases to each character’s turn, allowing you to creatively set up attacks with special weapons, abilities, and a unique gameplay element called Teamwork. Activating this ability sets up the character to help gang-attack enemies with subsequent Rangers, or catapult teammates across the board to reach distant foes. Setting up a Teamwork attack with all 5 members results in a satisfying finishing move that deals massive damage, but players who aren’t careful to use this maneuver appropriately are punished with a loss of audience interest.\n\nOf course many bosses take on a second life after defeat, becoming Kaiju beasts to destroy with your giant mecha robot. These sequences handle similarly to piloting a World of Warcraft vehicle, but unfortunately for how common these parts are they lack the same amount of strategy that can be found in the rest of the game.\n\nPlayers that put in the time will find it easy to see the inspiration taken from the source material in a loving way, and the thoughtful game behind it. Your experience feels totally customizable from the start. You choose from a large variety of actors; characters with specific stats to fit into the game’s 5 main roles for your squad. You can set the colour for each member as well, fully immersing your interest in your team. If you want the pink ranger to steal the spotlight with the lead role you can totally do that here, or maybe you don’t want a red ranger at all, there really are no limits to team assembly. The unique T.V. production management system to your team’s growth is a wonderfully creative way to explain the game’s action and provide a narrative backbone to the accumulation of player wealth.\n\nRather than gaining experience and levels, characters boost their stats through buying and crafting new gear. Creating new items from dropped material makes outfitting your team to be a more involved endeavour than simply spending money at a shop, and it motivates you to defeat just a few more foes in each stage to get those extra drops. Quirky item descriptions help keep a smile on your face while you click through these menus. There’s a good emphasis on needing to understand how to get the most out of your cash and saved up materials in order to make your team the best it can be. There’s also an interesting balance between managing your budget to buy your team these upgrades and to also spend on studio expenses, such as better lighting and healthcare, each adding their own statistical advantages. A variety of marketing companies can be hired for different perks in order to gain a larger audience and more income, and just like the items more of these are unlocked as you progress through the story.\n\nThe game’s broken down into 5 seasons, with each stage acting as an episode shoot. Starting a new season unlocks the next tier on each character’s ability tree, giving exciting progression to each of the distinct classes. Players can set their team’s abilities to their preference and go back to tweak them later with no penalty, giving a level of freedom to experimentation on these trees that isn’t in most role playing games.\n\nThe level of detail in the presentation truly creates a vibrant world to take in, all accompanied by a soundtrack that’s honestly one of the most enjoyable we’ve ever found in an indie game. Little touches like the plucky upbeat signature jingle complements the rest of the perfect retro groove that the music carefully weaves with its effects and scales. Seriously, they’re some of the best bit-style tracks this side of Megaman. Art is so fine-tuned as to even include bent corners on menu screens to make you feel like you’re watching from your tube TV. The familiar pixel art style is done expertly; there’s a real level of character given to the sprites by the careful expressions and animations. The isometric perspective works extremely well for both the gameplay and the artwork.\n\nBehold Studios really hit all the right notes, giving us a great tactical turn-based action title that’s a perfect game for fans of the genre or anyone looking to try it for the first time. You might spend some time wading through some new gameplay elements, but it quickly clicks and with enough skill you’ll soon be taking down monsters just like they do on TV. There’s no doubt that you should take up your offer to join the Chroma Squad.\nSCORE: 9.0","May 20, 2015","true","23.7"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","20","31","2","0"

I will say, though, that I greatly appreciate the developers including such an easy level of difficulty for people who just want to enjoy the experience and the production of the game itself.\n\nAnd what a production! Beautiful pixel artwork, excellent music, and a consistent goofy tone throughout. I think a lot more could have been done with the story, especially in terms of developing the individual characters, but I appreciate that this kind of depth is not really the sort of thing you'd find in the TV shows the game is inspired by.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this game is that it reeks of Kickstarter. Well over half the missions include someone totally unrelated to anything running in, saying, 'Hey, it's me! Steve so-and-so! I know kung fu!' and then being a bizarrely-dressed fifth wheel for the duration of it.\n\nI get that you can sell little cameos to backers and that this is a fun thing to do, but there is so, so much of it in Chroma Squad. You can't help but think that maybe there could have been more interesting things going on in the actual story if there weren't these constant interruptions.\n\nUltimately, however, the lighthearted tone of the game overall makes it not too big a deal.\n\nAnyways, pick this up!

No. However Chroma Squad does capture the magic and feeling of its inspiration. The jokes, winks, and nudges are all done hilariously and authentically. Poking fun and at the same time honoring the source material. Being a fan just maximizes your enjoyment and lets you in on some of the jokes.\nThat doesn't stop Chroma Squad from being a very deep, rich, RPG. From customization of your Cast(Party) to choosing what weapons(props) to craft. You will mold your team into what you see fit. Battling minions, bosses, kaiju, and a budget. No two save files will be alike unless you want them to be. Not only do you have that turned based tactical combat. You also must manage your own studio. Choose upgrades to boost ratings, and what ad agency will represent you. All these choices and options can deeply affect the flow of combat, crafting, and if you succeed or fail.\nAll of this seamlessly blends together in this over the top and humorous RPG. With wonderfully done pixel art, music, and steamy goodness. Chroma Squad is as wonderful of a homage, as it is a game.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/ZkAJZOdxFYw\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","May 7, 2015","true","8.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","4"

The game can be summed up as "X-Com meets Power Rangers" basically. You control a team of five people, and each one has their own special moves and name. The team is highly customizable, and I've actually grown attached to my hilarious looking squad. You also frequently fight kaiju (big monsters) in a big robot of your own.

It is so suffused with character and charm as to reach points of ridiculousness. It pairs down the infinite complexity of many tactic games to a small team of characters, which allows each to have their own personality. The storyline, though I'm only a few hours in, is the perfect blend of cliché, kitsch, and nostalgia that somehow comes together to be more than the sum of its parts.\n\nI can say wholeheartedly that I really wish I had seen the kickstarter when it was up so that I could say I had done my part to make this game possible.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention a few things I would've like to have seen, after all this is a review. I went in expecting to be able to make small graphical reprentation of my friends and I, but when selecting characters you select them as a whole character. So you can't choose what they look like without also choosing their stat bonuses. So, while there is character customization it's not as indepth as I would've liked.\n\nDuring gameplay you'll get access to crafting. I would've liked to have seen a slightly more informative UI and perhaps an indication of how deep the crafting tree goes. It would also be nice if there was more options at each tier. As it is, it seems to break down to two options, either straight HP or HP with some added utility. But, as I said, I'm only a few hours in. (Half way through Season 3)\n\nIf those two points started to scare you away from this game, please don't let them. I have not had this much goofy fun in a long time, and I wouldn't want you to miss out on it because of my whining.\n\nI unreservedly recommend this game.","May 3, 2015","true","11.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/groundman/recommended/251130/","groundman","Ground Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/groundman/","403 products in account","Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG where you control suit actors for an indie tokusatsu (Japanese for "special effects") studio, directing them both in shooting episodes and budgeting behind-the-scenes. Your goal is to make the ultimate indie 'sentai' (Japanese for "squadron"; think Power Rangers) show by balancing fan acquisition and retention, and leveraging those fans for an extended budget.\n\nBrief plot synopsis: a group of stunt actors, tired of being pushed around by their short-sighted and creatively-deficient director, break off to form their own indie production team. They find a prop called Cerebro in a warehouse belong to one of the members' uncle, and make Cerebro the 'hook' for their new show. Unfortunately, they wind up garnering attention from more than just a growing fanbase...\n\nYour team is comprised of five members; you choose their suit actors (who each possess various stat bonuses and penalties), their roles (which determine what weapons they can use and what skills they unlock), and their colors (Ever wanted to have a ranger team without a red? Or maybe everyone is pink? Here's your chance!)\n\nThe meat of the game is the tactical combat - each episode plays out as a series of turn-based encounters. There is no 'initiative' stat, so you can move your characters in any order. Your get two actions, which you can spend moving and attacking (though attacking uses up all remaining moves, so move first), or you can use up the rest of your turn to use "Teamwork". The "Teamwork" move allows other characters to pool damage for a devastating attack, or to use the teamwork-using party member as a trampoline, bounding across the map in one move action. Each action builds up "audience", which acts as power meter and influences mission profit. Once you get enough audience, the "Chromatize" action unlocks, allowing your group to form up and transform into their super-powered alter-egos. Once in their hero suits, members unlock their special class abilities and weapons. Once you deal enough damage to a boss, a star and the words "FINISH IT!" will appear over their head. This is your cue to use a five-man teammate offensive and unleash one of your two finishing attacks (a standard melee finisher and a "Form the Giant Five-Part Howitzer!" weapon finisher that can be done at each weapons' respective ranges). Special "Director's Instructions" ask you to perform special tasks within an episode (like "rescure the hostage in three turns" or "don't let any team member fall below 50% health") for an extra Audience boost.\n\nThe first 'season' of play will end with you unlocking your giant mecha, which you'll use at the end a majority of the missions thereafter. Mecha combat hinges around stringing together punch combos - the higher your combo, the more damage you deal with your next punch, but the lower your chance of landing said punch. You can order the mecha to defend to end its turn (giving it a bonus to defense against the monsters' counterattack that scales with its current combo bonus) have the mecha perform a finishing move for massive damage (Giant bazooka arm? Energy saber? Chest-mounted laser? Take your pick, or take them all!), or use a defensive technique.\n\nAfter every mission, you're brought back to your studio, where you spend your hard-earned profit on new props and upgrades for your studio. The shop will allow you to buy a few choice weapons and suit parts, but nothing fancy; you'll have to craft the exotic items yourself. During each mission, you collect random materials which can be used to craft props for your heroes or parts for the giant mecha. You can put your fanbase to good use in the Marketing section, where you can hire different firms to grant an array of toggleable bonuses (Need a better drop rate? Go with The Green Team - alternatively, consider an Indie Marketing Gig if you want to improve your Audience-to-Fans turnover ratio). Go to the Studio to buy upgrades to your set (maybe consider some health care?) or mess around with your studio options ("Lights, Camera, Chromatize!" not cutting it for a transformation call? Why not try "Powers Unite!"?). The Mecha section allows you to outfit and upgrade your giant mecha for the kaiju-sized brawls. Finally, the Actors section allows you to review your suit actors' stats, change their special abilities, and mess with their equipment (You can't wear buckets on your heads forever, guys). During the course of the campaign, you'll make decisions through the in-game e-mail system, some of which affect which bosses you fight. While the plot stays relatively the same regardless of what you do (up until the halfway point, anyway!), there are multiple endings depending on the choices you make, and multiple playthroughs are necessary to see everything.\n\nI would recommend Chroma Squad to anyone who enjoys tactical RPGs, regardless if they're a diehard tokusatsu fan (but being a diehard tokusatsu fan won't hurt). Chroma Squad retails for $15, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it at that price.","April 30, 2015","true","60.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Eventually you'll realize that maybe not everything is just a special effect but the game rarely abandons its humour and will keep throwing references your way. You'll also have to manage your studio by buying upgrades and deciding which contracts to sign for marketing: while studio upgrades are a straightforward "more is better" story ad agencies all provide different bonuses to fights/ audience/ money gained letting you customize your experience a bit.\n\nMost fights feel fair and some can be easy as long as you upgrade your equipment and play decently but, at times, you might end up making a bad decision due to not being able to see whether an enemy'll be in range of your rifle or how far you'll be able to throw teammates before you actually move: this is where an undo button'd have worked wonders in case you misjudged a distance-which is not as hard as it sounds- or just misclick. Mecha fights are enjoyable at first but they get dull quite fast as you're basically just chaining a combo, doing the "click to defend" minigame on enemy turn, and unleashing a special move when needed: it's not bad per se but the number of fights and the repetitive gameplay make the novelty value fade fast. Last but not least the crafting system is a bit of a chore as you'll be using materials dropped from fights or bought to build new costume pieces and weapons, sadly they come with random properties so it's mostly luck based whether you'll be getting something decent or useless: in the end you can either reload your save and try again or just buy some all around decent stuff from the shop directly.\n\nChroma Squad offers a good amout of fun, if limited in variety, gameplay enriched by an amusing story and narrative: it's good entertainment made even better if you have even just a passing knowledge of the sentai genre.","April 13","true","11.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InsertCookiesHere/recommended/251130/","InsertCookiesHere","InsertCookiesHere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InsertCookiesHere/","466 products in account","Excellent tactical RPG with a surprising amount of depth.\nIt's a bit of a business management sim on top of the RPG side, but they mesh very well together.\nThe game play works well, with plenty of options in combat to choose how you want to approach things, and a wealth of customization in the pre episode/fight setup.\nA silly and offbeat story line with enough genuine comedy to make you laugh occasionally helps to spruce up the quality game play as well.\n\nIt starts off simple, so it's not difficult to learn but gets progressively deeper, and I can tell there is more to come. I'm genuinely looking forward to each new "episode" of the TV show you play in.\n\nDifficulty wise, I'm playing on hard and it's just right for me. Hard enough I have to pay attention to what I'm doing and think out my actions, and most episodes I'm barely scraping through. Can't comment on how that would fit for others of course, but as someone pretty accustomed to this style of game hard difficulty has works nicely for me.\n\nI'm not finished the game so I can't comment on length, but I'm a long ways from finishing and have put in about 11hrs on this save so far. So I'm confident there is a surprisingly large amount of content to play through.\n\nI've heard tons of love given to the sound track for the game but... honestly I don't see it. It's not bad by any means but it's more decent and fits the game well, then anything truly memorable.\nThe visuals I really appreciate however, it's simple retro pixel graphics but the combat animations, movement, and even the special attacks are all very well animated and look quite nice. Lots of extra frills like a fast forward effect reminiscent of an old VCR on a CRT TV fit perfectly with the atmosphere.\n\nI can happily recommend this to anyone who wants a lighthearted RPG, or just looking for something unique and different. Not much else out there like this.\n\n9/10 and a genuinely excellent game. Easy recommendation.","June 5","true","18.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MetalHead42O/recommended/251130/","MetalHead42O","Lukewarm Bong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MetalHead42O/","394 products in account","I had a blast playing this! With that sweet, sweet 90's pixel-art nostalgia and the general "have fun" attitude of the game, I couldn't help but enjoy it! Not to mention that awesome music. The Nintendo/Sega-esque 8-bit style battle music is soothing to my soul.\n\nFor a T-RPG it's pretty minimal in its actual strategic gameplay. That was something I personally loved, but I could easily see others hating. Differen't strokes for differen't folks. If you were looking for a hardcore, strategy heavy tactical RPG (which no one would blame you considering one of the key words is "Tactical").. then this game most likely isn't for you. If anything, as far as strategy goes it's mainly about what you build more so than what you actually do during the battle sequences. I think this was a great move because It greatly helps the game's immersion factor, which is the part that truly charms you and stands out the most. I played on intermediate difficulty and not once did I have to consciously think about how I was gonna move/attack 'X' turns ahead like a game of chess. I did, however, have a moment where I consciously thought (and was surprised) at how captivated I was into what's basically an 8-bit power rangers rip-off with a "behind the scenes" twist. I think it's because of factors like the minimal strategic gameplay (as well as the storyline) that I was able to just relax my brain and have fun with it.\n\nThe story is easily where this game shines the most. A story that really makes you feel like you're progressing from the point of being stunt actors playing fake super heroes to becoming actual ones that eventually end up saving the entire planet (and I think universe?). Another thing to note about this game is it's very satirical, emphasizing mainly on the process that goes in to shooting the episodes and production in general. The bosses are sometimes pretty ludicrous in design (and name) but this game's humor is just that, ludicrous and out there- So it fits the theme nicely. There's also multiple endings- something that I was unaware of until randomly checking out the achievements (lol). That's a pretty big bonus and adds a good bit of replayability. The story is also much longer than I expected it to be, so that was a pleasant surprise all around\n\nThe dialogue became... interesting... at times. But the rest of the game as a whole easily makes up for the poor dialogue. When it's bad dialogue- it's intentional. It's not like it's bad because it was an earnest attempt at something that just came out wrong in translation, or something that just flat out didn't work at all. It's definitely all intentionally placed bad dialogue. Things like the game's constant breaking of the fourth wall was forgiveable... but intentional typos for a laugh and putting emoji's into my game dialogue?! NO. Just, NO!\n\nThe music was fantastic and hit all the right spots. I'm considering buying the soundtrack for $5 just to make a good review for it that would probably rival this one in length. Nuff said.. It's probably what hooked me the most (next to the story) being how important music in general is to a guy like me, but I digress.\n\nAll in All, it's a fantastic game. I highly recommend if you enjoyed anything 'Power Rangers' related when you were younger, and just feel like having a few laughs with it now that you're older.","October 11, 2015","true","18.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","2"

I think that is pretty nice it forces you to explore more your teammates. And of course there are some giant robot fights in the end of the episodes, it is nice but too easy to win.\n\nIf you are more a RPG-person, your can see the status of every weapon and equipment for each member of the team. And if you don't care about these numbers you can just pick the most expensive and high level item and you are ready to go.\n\nSo if you liked any Super Sentai serie when you were a kid (or still watching these series) you should play it now.\n\nNote to my brazilian friends gamers: Jogae pra apoiar os parça da comunidade indie Brazuca e ajudar a desenvolver mais a industria de games em nosso país :D","August 21, 2015","true","9.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Some focus too much on choice leaving you with a mountain of options and a hard time deciding what actually works for you.  Others are far too focused on the story and ignore a good tactical format for combat.\n\nChroma Squad hits alot of good notes:\n\n-5 classes, all with tie-ins with character archtypes in shows like MMPR\n-"Actors" that give different stat boosts to the class you slot them into, or to your progress as a whole, depending on choice.\n-Solid combat that feels good, without a mountain of stats and rules to learn\n-Various mini-goals for each 'mission' (part of an eppisode) that are typically not too hard to complete and net you more money to spend on upgrades\n-MMO style gear levels (White/Green/Blue/Purple) that help you determine which gear is better (not to mention easy to understand stats)\n-Alot of comedy moments before/during/and after each fight.  There are more references to pop culture, source material, and strange happenings than I can even begin to list.\n-Great badguys, even when they are repetative it's still funny to see the dialog that tries to explain why they are there.\n\nNow some negatives\n-Crafting system can turn out garbage gear.  You can break said gear down and try again, but it's a losing system.\n-Some of the 'mini-missions' don't work with everyones playstyle, there have been a few so far that I found irritating to try to complete.\n-Sometimes the 'jump' feature doesn't seem to want to fire for no reason.  This makes positioning annoying at times.\n-Music gets repetative, but not really a big issue, mute works wonders.\n\nI love me a good tactical game, and one filled with humor and references to some of the best (and cheesiest if I'm honest) shows/movies is awesome in my book.  Too bad there isn't multiplayer co-op or pvp, that would send this game to the realm of 'zomg best timewaster ever... for a week or three'","May 3, 2015","true","16.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","1"

I guess a lot of jokes went over my head but I didn't overly mind much.\n\nThis game describes itself as a tactical RPG, and it couldn't be more accurate about that. It's not particularly strategy heavy, but the tactical play and the between missions team building feels great. The crafting system is a bit clunky and some of the studio upgrades seem very oddly priced, but that doesn't ruin the fun. The game did feel a bit easy on the medium difficulty setting though.\n\nAlll in all, I feel it's good enough to recommend provided you like tactical play and the theme. The rough edges can be forgiven because you get the real feel that this was a labour of love.\n\nThis game does commit the capital sin of making you feel irrelevant during the final bossfight. They tried to go for an epic ending and succeeded, but all your choices and perfect tactics don't contribute to it.

But of course, you dont need to be a tokusatsu fan to enjoy this game. If you like tactical RPGs, then you'll probably enjoy this too. It's a solidly built game that has been a long time in the making. Being one of the backers of the Kickstarter campaign, and having to wait over a year and a half for it to be developed, I can honestly say that Behold Studios have definitely delivered the goods! Show your support, and buy it already :D","April 30, 2015","true","8.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/them00/recommended/251130/","them00","Themoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/them00/","556 products in account","Chroma Squad is a tactical strategy game with some management aspect. It kinda resembles new XCOM games.\n\nIts main meat, the tactical strategy, part is quite fun with couple of interesting mechanics. Things like doing combined attacks with your team members and or making acrobatic throws. Management part offer quite different choices. Such as transforming your viewers into either fans or cash. It has satisfying amounts of options in character customization and in RPG elements. There five roles and you hire different actors with different bonuses for each role and each role has small skill tree in itself. You can equip your characters with crafted gear with random properties. Even the mecha fights which are not the major component of the game has some fun mechanics. It uses combo mechanic where successive hit increase your damage but reduce your hit chance so you have decide when to use your finishing move. Have not finished it yet but according to the achievements pages it even has multiple endings so some replayability.\n\nStory and design wise i feels like a true old Power Rangers TV show. It has a kinda cheesy humor and characters it was to be expected from it's Power Rangers source and i personally found them funny. This cheesyness also includes popular culture references and memes. A small detail i really liked was that you can customize the color and look of your characters costumes and you can see these changes effect the looks of the effects and mecha and small things like that. You can also customize your warcries like when you finish a boss or transform or summon your mecha.\n\nOne last thing, if you do not like pixely art style that might be turn off for you.\n\n10/10, GOTY, would recommend etc.","April 30, 2015","true","11.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/owlswah/recommended/251130/","owlswah","Harruten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/owlswah/","406 products in account","Chroma Squad is, as it says, a tactical RPG that was inspired by the many Sentai series such as Power Rangers, Kamen Rider and many, many more. What is the story, you ask? Well, essentially, the story of the game goes like this: You have a bunch of stunt people who recently quit their jobs because of a director who was, shall we say, demanding and is overall being a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they all decide to start a studio of their own! From the beginning, they don't have much to work with, using cardboard, duct tape, and third-rate costumes to get by, eventually, they start having an audience to work with.\n\nThe gameplay is quite fun, you kit out your actors in the best gear that cardboard and duct tape can buy and record new 'episodes', essentially maps, for the season, each with their own bonus objectives that don't punish you much for failing them but the extra fans and cashflow you can get from maxing out your audience each episode is a nice incentive to do them. Every actor has their own special abilities that are accessible as soon as they suit up which can be sometimes impossible to do at the start of the episode as you need to build audience power first before chromatizing. The phrases said throughout the game such as "Chromatize" and "Mecha Power, Activate!" can be modified in the studio to your liking. Yes, this means you can be as silly or as creative as you like... or creatively silly.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is strange at times, some episodes are easy, others are pretty difficult, even with the best gear for the season's tier equipped, and others still are fairly difficult. You'll end up curbstomping half the time if you're playing on the normal difficulty if you know how to play tactical RPGs, well, tactically, and I'm fairly certain hard mode is pretty challenging but I can't quite say that for myself. I'm not going to say that this game is too easy but it feels too easy at times, especially when you have an assault one-shotting everything they touch that isn't a boss monster or a shielded enemy.\n\nHowever, despite the odd difficulty curve, I absolutely adore the presence of the game and I absolutely love the feel and the gameplay of Chroma Squad, it kind of reminds me of XCOM, in a way, with all the aliens but minus the permadeath. Oh, and the music's damn good too, I will admit that the title theme may have dug deep into my brain and has implanted its melody into my brain and it won't get out. Although, there's not really much replayability in this game apart from the acheievements and, well, I can't say all that much without spoilers.\n\nIn short? Fun game, even if you're not very familiar with the subject of the game, although most references may fly over you since this is an homage game, after all. Worth a buy? Sure. It's a good game for its price although it tends to be lacking a bit in the replayability department, it's fun for what it's worth and that is what matters.","May 28, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's simply awesome. Fun, light-hearted, cute, self-aware and full of references - most of which I probably didn't get, but hey! How fun this game must be for people who love Power Rangers and similar TV series! But fear not! Even if you know almost nothing about this sort of stuff, you'll still find something for yourself :).\n\nPros:\n+ choose your own team - Want to have all female squad? Here you go! Or maybe men only (men dressed as panda by any chance...?). Why not! But how about... A robot? Or an alien? Or maybe even a beaver?\n+ crafting, managing your own studio, buying upgrades, fan mails... Don't you have a feeling that sometimes game developers give us just "naked" game, without any substance besides main action? Well, you won't have this feeling here.\n+ graphic - I cannot imagine better graphic style for this game.\n+ music - simply awesome. I think Lord Gaga's theme will stay in my memory for pretty long time.\n+ tons and tons of references!\n+ funny, self-aware, full of intended cliches. If it won't make you laugh, it'll at least make you smile.\n+ awesome, hilarious enemies.\n+ challenging but not frustrating - I finished game on medium difficulty. It can be pretty challenging when you try to fulfill all goals, but still it's not that hard that you want to throw your PC out ;).\n\nSadly, there are also cons:\n- too long fights. Not all of them, of course, some are very quickly, but there's tons of fights that just take too much damn time and it's not because player don't use proper strategy. No, no. It's because there are fights with tons of enemie's minions and each one of them need to make a move, EACH turn, and sometimes it really takes forever. And if you add mines/sprouts to that... It's just hell. And I don't think there's a way to skip it. There was a time, when I literally step away from my computer for a few minutes and when I get back, last enemies were still moving.\n- mecha combat - it breaks my heart, but it may be one of the weakest points of this game. Of course you need to have huge robots and huge monsters with the game heavily inspired by Power Rangers. And don't get me wrong, crafting upgrades for your Mecha is pretty interesting, but fight itself... Boring and repetitive. If Mecha battles were reserved only for final episodes/bosses then maybe I wouldn't have this opinion, but they are a regular part o game. And they look exactly the same. You make combos, that ends with special move/defense or just because you didn't manage to do another attack. Then your opponent attacks - always three times (and sometimes there's a special move). You defend yourself by clicking in the right moment. And then the process continue. Regular fights are fun (if they don't take too long), because you have different enemies, with different skills, minions, attacks, goals etc. Here, no matter who your opponent is, fight ALWAYS looks the same. There's no much strategy involved.","December 15, 2015","true","18.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I love the concept. Created by Behold Studios, Chroma Squad is essentially a Power Rangers management sim. You get to make your own squad and customize your team to fit your desires of having one of the best or lamest Sentai teams ever!\n\nThe story is that a bunch of stuntmen quit their old job because they believe their director lacks creativity and want more creative freedom. The plot really goes off the rails later on but it's fun to watch. The dialogue of your team is super corny but I loved it however if that's not your thing then it might be something to consider if you're planning on getting Chroma Squad. The dialogue is filled with puns, references and enough fourth wall jokes to make Deadpool blush.\n\nVisually it looks nice, it's some nice pixel graphics. I don't think they use it as a lazy excuse since it's nice good to look at and there is detail in the game. Not the heaviest but enough to distinguish everything easily. The music is personally one of the best parts of the game. This is some really good chiptune music, it has some great soundtracks that get you pumped up for a boss battle and my personal favourite "This is Cerebro" is so campy and so catchy.\n\nThe gameplay itself, when fighting is a tactical RPG. A pretty fun one, the game has an emphasis on team attacks which is pretty cool and works with the theme. You got abilities and cool weapons for the different classes to play around with and a cool chunk of bosses. You also get finishing moves for them which is pretty sweet as well. One thing that does bother me a bit is that a lot of the time the game can be too easy but then there is a huge difficulty spike in the last level. What is that all about?\n\nWhen not in normal combat you're doing one of two things. The first is managing your studio, it's fun as you have to upgrade the studio, buy or craft new gear, hire agencies to promote your show, check emails and all that managment sim stuff. The other is the mech combat. It wouldn't be Power Rangers without a giant mech battle in almost every episode. It can be fun but really it just comes down to chance whether attack or block attacks. It looks cool but it's pretty shallow.\n\nTo conclude my mad ramblings I of course like this game a lot! It's one of those games I wished I played earlier when it came out last year. If you understand the basic core material you'll have a lot of fun with it.  If you've never heard of Power Rangers AT ALL or know exactly ziltch about it then I wouldn't reccommend this to you. Otherwise you should definitely get it! It's a game that's about having fun rather than being amazingly unique or difficult (for the most part). I give this an 8.5/10","March 1","true","18.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are also some RPG elements outside of combat, such as allocating skill points, crafting and buying upgrades.\n\nAfter completing most maps you join together and go into a giant mecha to fight the boss of the map again, with a different combat style which is focused on timing the hits and using a limited number of different abilities. This is a nice addition for the first few times, however it is not nearly as fleshed out and feels like an after thought. And seeing as how you have to do a bunch of these fights I'm quite sure everyone will get tired of them before the end of the game.\n\nThe story is reasonably entertaining, although it can become tiresome to follow since it is delivered solely through text boxes of the main characaters, and you have to wait for each one to finish scrolling in order to move on to the next one. So if you read much faster than the game scrolls then you're going to have to do a lot of waiting. There is an option to fast forward through everything, however it is not really useful if you still want to follow the story since the fast forward skips everything.\n\nAnd the game does go a little overboard with the pixel artstyle, I certainly would have liked more definition and fluid animations. Also the overall design starts to become stale with time, especially since this is quite a long game.\n\nI would easily recommend Chroma Squad to any fan of the tactical turn based combat style.\n\n7 / 10","February 6","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But there is more, because the thing about it that earned my immediate apllause, is that it is parodying sentai with several references throughout, which made me glad, but I have sadly found a lot of accidental hentai.\nSuper sentai, or to the duper americans power rangers, are shows about various dangerous threatening the world with a shower of monsters. So it is up to three to six teammates, to bring an end to the evils killing spree. The difference between sentai, and the ignorance of power rangers are huge, mostly in terms of violence because lord knows how hard mothers bother, they somehow still seek something that will make them take the offense and write angry letters.\n\nThe basic of the plot that quickly forms a blood clot, is five stunt actors are getting the brunt end of the stick from the director, mostly because the real actors are mostly spectators now. They get sick of this repetitive shtick, so they decide that instead they shouldn't bide their time, they quit on the spot leaving the old studio to rot, to start their own, though they bring their former director down by stealing the suits.\n\nEarth is under threat, but like a stoners baguette the heroes take a long time to learn, and until then they are quite stern about this all being special effects, or defects. They use the footage of them fighting aliens, to get their show more lighting. I won't go further, because this does go deeper but is actually simple to follow, which is a nice dimple of quirks that I love.\n\nThe tactical gameplay, is actually quite practical. Like a cannibal feret, you can use teamwork to attack, step back, or get teammates closer or in positions you would rather see in your vision. You have a variety of not only weapons, you have a small soceity of actors to pick from, obviously some fit better into each role of the five, it is up to you to put down that tea cup and to decide which loon becomes a front line goon or a back line maroon. But you also have directors instruction to follow, which you should unless your skull is hollow. Or you'll be low on money, and despite the amount you will quickly blow through it. Items are dropped, as long as you aren't stopped from murdering aliens. Which can be used to upgrade your zord, or create weapons and armor out of cardboard.\n\nThough you must not forget, because you can't bet all your cash on weapons and shiny gear, to try and make the enemies fear you. You have to handle a studio, since you are the borough. You can pay for better green screens, shop association, contracts for promotions that last up to three episodes before abdication. Upgrading health care, so that your squad will fair better when taking hits, or upgrade the workshop to get more tiny bits to craft with. One thing I do enjoy, which was quite a clever ploy. Are the letters you receive, after each episode you achieve, you have fan mail to answer, and if you do it without fail you gain fans, money, or more funny as it is I rather support telling your director off when he threatens to take you to court.\n\nThis game is great, though unfortunately fate can't make everything perfect. The zord battles are the main issue, I did rip a few tissues at them...At first, but aside from that I did not have a thirst for anymore, because they were slow where you just click a button to deal a combo of blows. No strategy or thought, but despite the upgrades you bought, even if you take a hard hit an yelp, and run out of health, you call your fans for help. They give you health, which was quite a bother to me to know there was no stealth to the threat. It meant I could mess up, without having to fess up any real significant consequences.\n\nThat aside this game is grand, and all of the humor and references make it far from bland. Out of all the sentai references, the one that more so instantly hit my preferences, was a statue greater than sweet bubblegum, that was dedicated to big 1, from Jack-Q the second super sentai.\n\nOtherwise can recommend.","April 2","true","18.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

But I also know that graphics shouldn't be a reason to determine whether to buy/play a game at all. The worst that can happen with a good game of which you don't like the graphics is that you might think "well, it could look better". And as we all know, if you have to say that it's just the worst, right?\nIt has an 8-bit soundtack.\nWell, technically it's not 8-bit at all. Ultra fakebit, I'm telling you. Everyone who's ever listened to chiptune should notice immediatly. Noobs.\nFor me it was the same as with the graphics at first - I just can't hear it anymore. And still, the soundtrack is super catchy + fits the game perfectly, although I feel like it could contain a few more tracks. Then again, the theme song is not just catchy, but also funny.\nSpeaking of which, the game itself is pretty punny.\nYes, it's definitely one of the funnier games you'll see. Not necessarily the funniest, because it's not Portal. However, although I've always been looking forward to seeing new boss monsters, because of their funny names or puns they came up with, I felt like the humor was innocuous. Of course humor doesn't always have to be ironic/sarcastic/critical - I just feel it wouldn't have hurt sometimes.\nOh, hold on, there was this one situation where they were directly referring to Anita Sarkeesian's Tropes vs. Women in Videogames series, which I found absolutely hilarious, very well placed and well executed. Good job Behold Studios!\nAlthough it's not a very long game in and of itself, it felt unnecessarily prolonged after around season 3 in the game. It was basically the same thing over and over again, until the game ended. Most episodes you make go like this:\nFight minions, fight minions and boss, fight mecha battle against same giant boss.\nThat's probably the weakest part about the game and the one thing I would personally hold against it. Still, I managed to beat the game just yesterday and right now I'm actually in the mood to play it again, with different actors.\nThe fighting system is tactical and has it's own profundity, while remaining simple. It's really a good balance.\nAlthough, of course, I personally would put the fighting system and the game itself into the more casual corner with the other more casual fighting systems and the other more casual games.\ntl;dr\n\nWhen trying to summarize my experience, I would absolutely recommend anyone (meaning all of my friends and you) to buy this game and at least play the first two to three seasons (the game progresses in seasons) of it, to see if you'd like to continue or stop. I'd also say that it's worth it's regular price. But hey, you can always wait until it's on sale. And if it is on sale, you should definitely get it.","December 25, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has action, comedy, interesting writing, and anything you would want from a PR game. You start out as 5 stuntmen who have recently quit their jobs doing sentai stunts to form their own studio. When you get into the studio thats when the real magic begins. Once there, you're able to design your own suits and mechas, something I'm sure any PR fan has dreamed of.\n\nYou're also able to respond to fan letters and control your fan market to some extent by choosing from a wide selection of advertaisment firms. When you go into battle this game is a mix of an RTS and Turn Based RPG ala Pokemon. The RTS side is used for your simple ranger battles where each class has a variety of skills at their disposal, which grow as the story progresses. You're also able to do showy finishing moves on the bosses in true sentai fashion. My only problem with the RTS board is that sometimes you can't see parts of the grid because they're blocked by objects on the field.\nThe game then becomes much closer to a TurnBased RPG when in mecha form where you're allowed to hit your opposing monster a certain number of times before a hit misses and they hit back. But, all is not lost when they hit back theres a system that if you time it correctly and click in the white area of the bar you can block some of the damage. Think Gears of War's reload system. Everyonce in awhile though this bar lags causing you to get hit by the full blunt of the attack without a chance to stop it.\n\nTL;DR:The Story and writing are amazing and are VERY PR like. The RTS combat while fun has some issues with grid square blocking, nothing gamebreaking though. The mecha combat is far slower than the RTS combat but still quite fun\n\nScore: 8.6/10","May 3, 2015","true","40.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thehunternova/recommended/251130/","thehunternova","FuckYouSenpai!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thehunternova/","59 products in account","More or less an in depth review\n-Pros\n~This game brings you back to your childhood (or lets you experience a childhood), bringing me back to the days where I proudly watched series like Power Rangers. Not many games that want me to feel nostalgic can do it like this game, the next best thing for nostalgia would be Shovel Knight, but this takes the cake\n~Simple , yet extremely fun RPG mechanics. Ok lets get this down, 5 base classes, the lead, support, techie, assault, medic. Each class is equipped with each special ability of course, but then there becomes another layer, with the inclusion of different characters with each their own respective stats and weaknesses, this can dramatically effect the way you can fight a boss. An example would be, my lead, who i chose to be the Panda Guy (Forgot his name!) has reduced movement speed, because of this one of the episodes required me to kill the boss with my lead (This is also known as Director Instructions, although not required, it gives you a boost in "audience" which helps you use a few Studio options which will be explained later) My lead was way too far from the boss and there was no way to get to him before the boss dying from my techie's amazing counter-chance. Thus causing me to feel the want to restart the level and do it again to 100% it, and I did, I had to dramatically change the way I play by having the Lead always stay close to the boss while the others protect him. Now I would explain the skills to you, but they are fairly simple and standard RPG mechanics (Use them and then you have a cooldown, the usual)\n~What it wants to introduce to you though is it's "teamwork" mechanic. This mechanic allows you to have one of your well....heroes...can sacrifice their turn to say instead of using a skill to kill an enemy they switch to teamwork mode so that another one of your team can go to them and be launched farther than they can usually move, you could also do a teamwork attack. Which consists one or maybe even all of your team to attack a single opponent, which does become very useful against harder minions.\n~Music- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the music is so nostalgic, it literally brings the heart of 8-Bit RPGS and Super-Sentai series and puts them together to make just an amazing soundtrack\n~Story - To me, the story is the important part of a game (If it offers a story, it better be damn good *cough cough Call of Duty Ghosts cough cough*. Now at first the story may seem pointless, but after maybe the 2nd season if i recall, it gets just a huge jump in drama and everything just starts to mold into place. Each character is given their own little "arc" or little segment focusing on them and their personal problems, and by the end of them season you feel satisfied and you just want more. Although I won't spoil much of the story, I can tell you that the dialouge includes many pokes and jabs toward internet memes and commonly uses smiley faces (Which too me is very refreshing) Now in terms of story itself, you start off as very ticked off actors that leave the studio they are hired at and buy/create their own. As you progress you are given "choices" through "fan mail" which people send you, although it may not seem significant, these fan mail choose the path you will be taken on and how your fans will react, also be warned there is no voice acting so get ready to read.\n~Bosses- Each boss is super memorable and actually are pretty damn funny when intended, each skill set makes sense for each boss and are actually pretty fun to figure out how to fight against. Now after certain fights, you are allowed to what some people may call MECHA FIGHTSSSSS!.....now these are simple but are actually pretty fun and poke fun at the *ahem* Power Rangers mecha fights.\n~Stuio/Crafting Etc. - In the studio you can buy stuff from the shop or look and change the skill sets of your characters. Inside the shops you are given the ability to buy Armor and Weapons. Now most of these items are basic and the best usually come from crafting (DUH) but are still useful. Now crafting, simple, yet not the best or even my favorite, so ill explain my dislikes of it later. You can also go to the "Studio" options which allow you to spend money generated from episodes to upgrade certain attributes (Health Care gives your actors +Health and HD Cameras give you better Audience Conversion Rate). Next up is the Mecha Screen, basiclly upgrading the parts of the mecha to make it better as the story progresses. Not too overly complicated, but could be a lot better.\n-Cons\n~Crafting- Because you cant replay episodes, you better hope you get those crafting items by luck OR you can spend considerable ( A LOT ) of money from episodes you did to buy Material Packs and because of this you may be out of luck for the first few seasons or you force yourself not to buy better Armor/Weapons/Studio Upgrades.\n~Agency Buying- I held off talking about this because I'm more or less biased toward this, but as you progress thorugh the story you can hire agencies to promote your show, this gives you special boosts to a certain amount of episodes (1 or 3) and of course it tells you the boosts but it doesnt tell you how much fan power it costs (You earn fan power during episodes) which left me bummed out because although there were 4 boosts I liked on the agency, I could only get 1 of them for 3 episodes because I didnt know the fan power was so high. Leaving me a lot of money down the drain.\n\n~All in all this is a great game, it achieves what it wants and does even better than certain rpg's. I would give this game the Indie Game of the Year if i could\n\n9.4/10","June 2, 2015","true","15.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

On one hand, this is a glorious concept of a game that's executed very well. The gameplay is simple, but fun, the classes are well balanced and the graphics are very colorful and pleasing on the eyes. Additionally, the soundtrack is pretty amazing, the music is both cinematic and yet easy on the ears.\n\nBut, on the other hand, this game is extremely luck based to the point of being frustrating. Since you have a finite number of "episodes" you can produce, there's no way you can farm for money and crafting items, which wouldn't be a big deal if the crafting items you need in the late-game weren't so rare. To help off-set this, you can "recycle" and "buy packs", where you can dismantle gear you're no longer using and buying a pack of items in bulk. They both seem like good options, right? Well...they're both luck based in what you get and I have gotten pretty much nowhere by using these options.\n\nAnd finally, my biggest issue with this game...the Mech battles. These were so much fun and truly awesome...the first few times. They get very repetitive very fast since they really have no strategy. Just punch the monster and guard, all the time. Again, this wouldn't be such a big deal if it weren't for three things.\n\n1)  If you miss one of your attacks, you can't guard at all. This may seem obvious but it can lead to some really annoying moments were you miss a 88% chance to hit the monster and then take a total of 20,000 damage. Even better if the enemy has a bonus where they automatically hit you if you missed.\n\n2) These Mech battles aren't check points, so if you mess up a Mech battle (or just get really unlucky) then you either have to take a hefty "Fans" score lost, or redo the whole mission.\n\n3) Furthermore, upgrading your Mech takes so long with almost no benefit. Maybe it was just my sour luck when it came up item drops and buy packs but the biggest upgrade I got to my Mech in 2 two season was "+3% accuracy".\n\nStill, despite these flaws. This is still a kick-♥♥♥ love-letter to Sentai and Power Rangers and a fun game to boot. Hopefully the success of this game will lead to more Sentai/Power Rangers inspired games.","November 6, 2015","true","15.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/251130/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","It’s not often that one show can take control of an entire generation. For my childhood it was Power Rangers… This multi-cultural love-letter to nostalgia took over many homes in the 90s with force. Its flimsy morals and clunkily scripted acting were apparently exactly what most of the world was looking for, as we stumbled out of the cocaine-fueled haze that was the 80s. There are very few shows today that manage to galvanize fans in such massive numbers. Maybe Spongebob comes close, but he’s a crossdresser who lives inside of a fruit. Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG about a tokusatsu show similar to Power Rangers. Each character has a specialized role, but are able to be slightly customized to your liking depending on the actor/equipment you choose. Chroma Squad does have a few blemishes, but is an overall amazing experience. Will it hold up for those who aren’t wearing nostalgia goggles? Let’s find out as we look deeper at Chroma Squad.\n\nFantastic retro style coats Chroma Squad, from the graphics to the music. While the gameplay starts out feeling extremely simple, it quickly deepens as the odds are stacked ever-higher against you. After moving you can attack, move a second time, or prepare for teamwork. Teamwork is an awesome aspect that allows your characters to toss each other around in fantastic acrobatics, or prepare a combo attack on an adjacent enemy. Teamwork attacks are an absolute necessity, as later enemies take multiple attacks to defeat. Aside from fantastic agility and teamwork, the Chroma Squad doesn’t have much in the way of firepower when they’re in their 28-year-old-teenager form. However, once per fight though, you can Chromatize. Transformation not only fully heals all your characters, but also unlocks a variety of special abilities. Every season you will unlock a couple of new skills to pick from, and this extends the replayability of Chroma Squad greatly.\n\nThe fights take place in a variety of sets. Some are fantastic to look at, with a variety of hazards. Others are completely stark with nothing on display except for a couple lighting guys and key grips using their bellies to knock bowls of mac’n’cheese off of the craft service table. At least that’s what I like to imagine. The gameplay grows even deeper as you realize there are a variety of director actions you will need to follow during the combat in order to maximize your audience and gain new fans. Chroma Squad isn’t all about high-flying action though. Between episodes you will need to craft equipments and gear up your heroes, choose between a variety of marketing agents with tons of different boosts, and assemble your mecha to do battle when your enemies go super-size. The management aspect is extremely interesting, and while praying to RNGsus while crafting for a decent upgrade can become a bit frustrating, it again does wonders to extend the replayability.\n\nI’ve sung so much praise for Chroma Squad that I am loathe to point out the low points, but it is about that time in the review. The majority of the controls are point and click, which can be a bit of a drain when sitting for extended play sessions. The less-inspired set designs seriously break my heart, as there is much more potential than a big empty room. The story does alright, aside from some pretty blatant SJW messaging in the beginning. It might be tongue in cheek. I can really only hope. Overall I think Chroma Squad is an experience worth having, especially if you were raised on Power Rangers or Big Bad Beetleborgs or VR Troopers. There really were just a plethora of these shows on in the 90s. This is why it’s pretty obvious to me why this game was so easily kickstarted, and I am positively overjoyed that Behold Studios was able to bring Chroma Squad very close to its full potential. I really do hope to see a sequel sometime in the future.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 6/10\nFun Factor- 9/10\nDifficulty- 8/10\nReplayability- 7/10\nInnovation- 10/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 9/10\nMusic- 10/10\nSound FX- 8/10\nStory/Lore- 7/10\nLevel Design- 6/10\n\nFinal Score: 80/100 for innovation, graphics, and fun factor.\nSummary: Fantastic tactical RPG infused with humor and deceptively-deep gameplay.\nVerdict: Amazing fun. Not as replayable as something like Final Fantasy Tactics, but still worth a look.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-chroma-squad/\nFull review video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5JHWQLc0zo","June 12, 2015","true","8.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

However, after the magic of creating your own sentai team wears off the game's flaws shine.  The mech battles are the MOST tedious, repeatitive and awful experience you'll even have with a game.  The regular on foot combat gets pretty repetitive as well, but isn't the worst RPG combat I've endured.  THE WRITING THOUGH. The writing is attrocious even with the patch that removed some of the meme spouting.  It screams reddit and doesn't ever improve to feel like you're in an actual sentai show.","December 26, 2015","false","25.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swadbando/recommended/251130/","swadbando","Swad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swadbando/","209 products in account","I don't generally write steam reviews, but I felt compelled to do on this case.\n\nI'll keep this short. First of all, if you're looking for gameplay, Chroma Squad has a semi-decent system going for it. In fact, it's quite fun. Not overtly complex, but it gets the game moving. Figths have some interesting mechanics to them, and you generally won't find yourself being bored. Gameplay wise, it's fine. A Seven out of ten, generally.\n\nThe reason I'm giving this game a negative review however, are these two.\n\nFirst of all - and, I suppose, the less important one. The writing. It attempts to be this cheesy script played for laughs, but all it does is give you cringeworthy references that batffle you at just how badly they are handled. The kickstarter backer appearances are laughable and ham fisted. I'd actually feel embarassed for backing this and being put on it as it was.\n\nIt says it's an affectionate parody/homage to Sentai, but it instead feels like it's trying too hard.\n\nNow, you might say that you don't give a crap about the writing and that's fine. It's a videogame. So what's my second complaint?\n\nHow awfully BUGGY the game is, and in the worst ways imaginable. It has a tendency to constantly shut down, crash ,or simply not do anything after a certain sequence of events happened. I've gritten my teeth and bore it for most of the game, but the last straw was, infact, at the very last mission of the game, composed of two long boss fights - the last one being especially long, lasting possibly hours. The game proceeded to crash on the first one, making me lose all progress. It then crashed again at the end of the second one, meaning it put three hours of gameplay to waste, as the game did not foresee it crashing, for whatever reason. That managed to make me give up on the game and not want to finish it. The fact that the bug report icon is ALWAYS there on the top right corner should actually tell you just how unstable this game is.\n\nIt's a fun game. It's an embarassing piece of writing, and an awfully coded mess that's unreliable at the worst moments.\n\nUPDATE\n\nAfter replaying the game post-patch, performance has indeed increased. I've encountered so far only minor visual bugs that did not break the game nor make it crash, so one can assume the stability of the game is indeed being improved. Previous complaints still apply, and the game still has a couple visual glitches, aswell as issues with the achievement unlock system, but right now, it's properly playable. With that done, I shift my opinion to a careful recommendation - if you're a fan of Sentai, you can probably buy it. If not, but you're really curious, wait for a sale.","May 4, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","2"

As such, you'll have to manage your money, buy upgrades to the studio, new clothes for your actors and hire people to take care of your marketing strategy.\nThe meat of the game, however, lies between these management sessions. Whenever you record an episode, the game becomes a tactical RPG: you start giving orders to your actors on where to move, who to attack, stuff like that.\nIt's an amazingly stylish game. The pixel-art is awesome, the soundtrack is pure chiptune bliss (plus a main theme with japanese lyrics!) and the game is packed with references to pop culture and super sentais in general.\nYou don't really need to be a super sentai fan to enjoy the solid tactics mechanics in this game, but it surely adds to the overall experience. I recommend this game to anyone who ever enjoyed a Power Rangers episode or is just itching for a new TRPG game.\n\nTL;DR: Awesome Tactical-RPG with stylish graphics, soundtrack and references.

I was thoroughly satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you enjoy retro pixel graphics, role-playing games (RPG), squad-based tactical combat, superheroes, kaiju, and management mechanics (television studio), then you will absolutely adore Chroma Squad.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic - the amount of detail in every model and object is very high. The sound effects and music are good and add a lot to the retro feel. You can even fast-forward cutscenes and it will appear like a VHS (if you were alive to remember what those are lol) tape. The story is funny and decent, and there is a very good twist that recaptured my attention. Admittedly, near the end-game I would just fast-forward through any of the cutscenes. There are a number of choices you will encounter, changing the story and encouraging multiple playthroughs. I love how equipping different armor (helmet, boots, etc) and weapons actually changes the look of your characters - I have always been the biggest aesthetic ♥♥♥♥♥. A nice detail is how newer seasons introduce better equipment (like transitioning from handmade/cardboard equipment to plastic) - and the appearance of each item reflects the quality level. You also have a giant mech, and end-game mechs look so much more badass than the starting one. These aesthetics accurately capture your gameplay progression from a low-budget mom & pop company to a AAA brand.\n\nControls are easy to learn and typical of turn-based tactics games. The tutorials are very informative and every element of the game is explained well enough so that you won't have to look up guides (unless you want some extra tips). The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with turn-based tactical games - the most challenging part of the game is maintaining your entire studio (specifically, your equipment) properly match the enemy's prowess after each episode. Each season is split into multiple episodes, and new seasons introduce new enemies, equipment, and other things.\n\nGameplay begins in the studio, where you can craft/buy equipment for your actors/mech to use, upgrade items in the studio for bonuses, and purchase marketing teams (which provide further bonuses). You can customize your actors and actresses' names and the catchphrases they use - like when they transform or summon their mech. As you progress through the TV show seasons, you will unlock more items to craft, buy, and upgrade. There are crates you can buy that provide random crafting materials in different tiers - crafting your own equipment is better in most cases because you also gain random attributes to your new items. Marketing teams you select will grant you bonuses depending on how many fans you have (gained after each level/episode depending on how well you perform and if you complete secondary objectives). Emails are answered in the studio hub, and some of your choices will affect future storylines and opportunities.\n\nWhen you are finished outfitting your team, you can select from different episodes to act out - some will feature mech vs. kaiju battles, others may have a guest ally appear. Secondary objectives may include defeating x enemies before transforming (once you select "transform," your team will move close together and switch to their Power Ranger-like forms), executing x team moves, or winning in x turns. Completing these tasks will grant you a bonus to fans, but missing them will not deduct anything; however, you lose fans whenever a squad member is downed (brought to 0 health). In order to transform, you need to gain enough audience power (think of it as active viewers) to fill your "transform" gauge. There are marketing companies that give you a starting boost to this gauge, accelerating how quickly you can transform.\n\nDuring combat, you will issue orders one-at-a-time for each member - once you are finished, the enemy's phase will begin, followed by the next round. You can have your characters use "teamwork," which allows you to chain together team attacks and increase the movement range of other actors/actresses. You will execute a special attack if every member of your squad attacks the same target, and you will perform a super attack if every member uses a weapon. Episodes are usually split into multiple parts, and subsequent parts will have you continue with refilled health. For some episodes, you will end with a mech battle mini-game.\n\nThe mini-game is my most favorite part - you and the enemy kaiju take turns attacking. Whenever you attack, it reduces the accuracy (but increases the damage multiplier) of the next attack. Furthermore, chaining a long attack increases the multiplier for anything you decide to do, so a good idea is to balance offence and defence - if you "defend" with a high multiplier, you will negate much of your opponent's damage. Your multiplier also affects any special attacks you have. If you get greedy, however, your turn will end once you miss an attack. When the enemy attacks, you have to defend at right moment, and your timing will determine how much damage you receive.\n\nAt the beginning of each new season, your characters will level up, gaining a new set of skills (you may only choose one if two are offered, however, you can swap them at will in the studio). Build/role types (ex: full healer, crit scout, glass cannons) help immensely if you plan accordingly, as the equipment you can buy/craft (and the skill types) really encourages focusing on specific playstyles for each character.\n\nCrafting - at least until the mid-game - presents an interesting challenge because the materials required to upgrade your mech are usually a higher/different tier than the items needed to upgrade your squad. There have been many times where I had to choose between upgrading all/most of my team or my mech. When you craft, you can also combine lower-tier materials to create better ingredients, however, the recipes are different depending on whether you are focusing on your mech or characters. I noticed that in the end-game this wasn't as much of a problem because I had a lot of excess money and could just buy a bunch of boxes (or items from the store).\n\nOverall, the gameplay is a lot of fun and replayability is high due to possible character builds/roles and branching storylines. If you are interested in turn-based tactical gameplay and transforming into superheroes, then you must try this game. You will love it.\n\nABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","December 11, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There isnt much strategy to the game but just enough to make it enjoyable though you wont be smacking your head against the wall because it is difficult. Sometimes completing all the director's instructions can be a chore but if you dont care about that and just want to 'win' than it will be a piece of cake...unless you play on the hardest difficulty, where you will need all the fans you can get to generate money and keep your studio floating.\nThere is definitely replayability because you can get a couple of different endings but it feels like most of the choices you make are small scale, it is a pretty linear story with some variations in my opinion.\nAlso, dont pay any attention to the gamergate types that complain about feminist tropes. There is one episode that has a guy kidnapped instead of a girl in the very beginning and it doesnt have any bearing on the rest of the plot, just the game creators making commentary on overplayed tropes.\nOverall I would highly recommend this game to someone who loves strategy, RPGs, power rangers, and a few corny jokes.\n10/10","December 6, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's based on Power Rangers, so it's obviously already awesome just because of that, but the gameplay is what really makes me love it so much. This is a strategy game where your characters become more powerful by either (The long way...) crafting equipment you gain from various enemies, or (The easy capitalist way) paying for equipment at a shop. This game also has a few different possible endings, so that gives it some replay value, and since this game lets you choose different characters at the beginning as well as have your own play style, you shouldn't really be bored out of your mind replaying the game like I usually am with some other games. The price isn't really too much compared to what you get out of it, because there are a lot of ways you could customize your team to work with your play style (At least 3!.... Probably more, though...).

Gameplay was both fun and interesting. The "TEAMWORK" command is a wonderful unique feature that makes Chroma Squad stand out amongst tactical RPGs. I feel like they spend too much time with meta dialogue, but it doesn't affect the story in any way.\n\nMy biggest problem is with the difficulty settings. There's too much of a difference between Easy, Medium, and Hard, and the difficulty shifts in weird ways between episodes. Medium was surprisingly effortless at times whereas Hard felt straight-up impossible during certain episodes. There's no grinding in the game, so to do well on Hard mode you need to be making the correct decisions at your studio (the management portion of the game) at all times.\n\nAll in all, it's a great short RPG that is sure to bring fire to your soul. Also you get to customize your character's names, catchphrases, and battle moves so every time my team did a finishing blow they said "GANG UP ON THEM!" Which was nice.","March 10","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's based on Power Rangers, so it's obviously already awesome just because of that, but the gameplay is what really makes me love it so much. This is a strategy game where your characters become more powerful by either (The long way...) crafting equipment you gain from various enemies, or (The easy capitalist way) paying for equipment at a shop. This game also has a few different possible endings, so that gives it some replay value, and since this game lets you choose different characters at the beginning as well as have your own play style, you shouldn't really be bored out of your mind replaying the game like I usually am with some other games. The price isn't really too much compared to what you get out of it, because there are a lot of ways you could customize your team to work with your play style (At least 3!.... Probably more, though...). Chroma Squad really gave me a lot of nostalgia, especially since I grew up watching Power Rangers, but I think I could really recommend this game to anyone who really likes any sort of strategy game or any sort of game where you can make important choices to decide what happens.

Tactical RPG combat flows well and the team-up system leads to some fun things to do even while abilities are on cooldown.  Branching story paths make for some good incentive to play through multiple times.\n\nMecha battles are a little one-note, but still fun.  Crafting system seems to have bad drops, but with proper marketing choices and investing in some of the material packs you can make it work out.\n\nMy only complaints: YOU CANNOT UNDO ACTIONS, which is so frustrating sometimes, oh boy.  That's the number one problem for me.  Also there is not enough cool stuff to spend money on in the in-game store, as each tier boils down to "defense armor" vs "offense armor".  Crafting has one or two interesting items (the Speed boots and the Team-Toss gloves) but there isn't a lot of variety outside of the gimmick items, when there could be a lot more going on.  More actor choices (and the ability to recast them mid-series) would be nice too, it feels like a very small pool of options.\n\nThe game also ends right when you start feeling very powerful so I'd like to see a 'New Series' mode (where you do a new team with a new storyline but keep your studio) or some sort of extra seasons.  Some way to keep going.  The game feels a little short.  A 'mission creator' and some sort of endless mode with escalating difficulty as seasons keep going on could fix this, and I believe the developers are looking into these sorts of ideas.\n\nIt's off to a great start, it's an awesome game for anyone into tactical RPGs or sentai/power rangers stuff, and I hope it keeps improving over time.","May 2, 2015","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

What Chroma Squad lacks in simulation elements it compensates with a neverending celebration of the best parts of Sentai new and old. If there is anything to pity its that Chroma Squad wasn't 3 different games and fans of Metal Heroes and Kamen Rider only get to revel in the last season of the storyline, but their inclusion shows just how much love Behold Studios has to offer, it can't be contained and oozes out of every scene! At the same time, if you step outside what the game celebrates you're left with an honest and simple Strategy RPG with map and encounter designs that genre veterans will find uninspired. The Episodes of the game are filled with colorful characters based on classic Sentai villains and antiheroes or pop culture and it is their presence and strength of personality that bring flavor to each individual Episode. So if you're prepared to be charmed, prepared to fall in love with the idea of being a team of costumed heroes, or prepared to be entertained by a campy throwback to how Sentai captures the hearts of children, Chroma Squad is absolutely the game you're after, look no further.","May 2, 2015","true","13.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mAce123/recommended/251130/","mAce123","mAce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mAce123/","113 products in account","Pros\n\n- The general look of the game is top notch. It's very appealing to look at.\n- The soundtrack is decent, albeit forgetable.\n- Changes in armor and weaponry are actually shown on the sprites, which makes equipping new gear feel much better.\n- The Teamwork function is pretty neat. It allows for some pretty interesting tactics in combat. Having one character toss another character in order to move them closer to an enemy is a cool way to move around the map. I just wish it was more fledged out. I feel like this would be a great feature if it was just developed a bit more.\n\nCons\n\n- The game is very easy. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and I'm having no trouble so far.\n- Customization feels pointless. It doesn't matter what you call your crew, your show, your attack names, etc. It's just there for the sake of having it as a selling point.\n- The writing is terrible. It actually has smileys - :) - written in speech bubbles. As though the characters are somehow able to pronounce ":)". Furthermore, not an hour in and the game blatantly tries to push an agenda down your throat by (poorly) criticizing the "damsel in distress" trope. A character mentions that his sister would like to appear on the show in respone to them needing someone to play the role of hostage, which another character immediately says they cannot allow, and they find a male person to play the role of hostage instead. It's never explained WHY having a woman in that role would be bad, they just say it's bad.\n- You cannot influence the episodes in any way. How you take out enemies, how many of your crew members go down in battle, how long it takes, etc... All of that only influences how many fans your show gets, and it's all completely arbitrary. (A hero falling in battle for any reason will cause you to lose viewers, while something as simple as moving a hero around on the map can cause you to gain viewers.)\n- Mecha battles are insultingly simple. You have the option to either attack or defend. You can attack as many times as you want, but your chance to hit decreases with each succesful strike. Defending ends your turn and gives you a bonus to defense, which increases the more times you've hit your opponent this turn. On your opponent's turn, you just click the mouse button at the right time to reduce damage. Eventually, you gain access to a finishin move, which deals high damage and ends your turn instantly. That's all.\n\nI came into this expecting something like Agarest mixed with Game Maker Tycoon. I have to say, I'm very disappointed. Even if you're a huge fan of Sentai shows, I imagine the cringy dialogue, boring story, and shallow gameplay will start to rub you the wrong way eventually.\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone, and it is certainly not worth the asking price. I doubt I'll ever finish the game, so I don't even consider it worth my time.","December 16, 2015","false","3.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

There there was the whole mess with release dates and stuff? Yeh? No? Well I don’t. I just heard about Chroma Squad a few days ago. This game is proof that there is just too many cool game concepts out that, while I may not have time for them all, are way too under my radar. I’m now realizing why indie developers always link other Kickstarters in their emails.\n\nChroma Squad is a tactics game based on the concept of the Power Rangers’ show. The literal making of a Power Rangers’ show. Chroma Squad, at its heart, is a TV show simulation game. You start out as the five stunt-people (of your choosing from default characters and Kickstarter backer-based characters) that get tired of taking orders and decide to start their own show. You make your way into one of the stunt-person’s uncle’s warehouse (in my case “The Fro”) and find that it has a giant-floating-spikey brain in a jar (which isn’t creepy in the least) and decide to use it as their own personal Zordon.\n\nNow it was listed in the video for Chroma Squad that you’ll get a better reviews for the episodes you record with better and flashier moves you’ll do during the show, but I wasn’t totally convinced of this until I just went around one-hitting the baddies in the second episode. (Let’s just say the tweets were bad for that one.) This part is right up my alley because my favorite moves and/or characters are usually the ones with the flashiest move sets because I am a visually stimulated person and things look cooler with explosions! That’s where teamwork comes in. If you set one of your people to be in the “Teamwork” mode and another Chroma warrior attacks, the ones waiting in that mode will join in for extra damage and a bonus to viewers added. The more surrounding a bad guy, the more damage you’ll do. If all of your buds are waiting around the same bad guy and you’ve put on your Chromatic suits you’ll do a super-special Chromatic finishing move complete with a catchphrase, light beams and power stances… good stuff all around!\n\nIt gets even deeper when you start crafting with drops from the level. Upgrades to your armor and your eventual mech are all done with common items like DuctTape, leather and cardboard boxes. I recently upgraded my mech with a cardboard box and silver duct tape and that just made me laugh. I have to admit that playing five stunt people who started their own studio and are making ends meet and working with what they’ve got is pretty stinking interesting and also kind of cool.\n\nScore: Gewd.\n\nChroma Squad is a solid title. It’s good as a tactics game, but excellent as a parody of the making of a Power Rangers show. The option to upgrade your armor, weapons and mech with common items like play-do and cardboard is hilarious and fun. It definitely sets itself apart from most RPGs in that aspect, but still it’s an RPG. There is humor and humor based on nostalgia and I enjoyed both! However, at its core it’s a TV show simulation and so it all comes down to money and fans attained by the end of each episode. Maybe it gets a little easier at the end game with more things to defeat or something, but the same issue bothers me now. Since you obviously want the most viewers and money, I find myself dragging fights out to complete achievements/goals and to max out that bar. Is it necessary? Probably not too much, but it also feels like it is. Maybe it easier for some, but that meter is not my friend at times. On another note, that may not bother me as much as it does here if I could take this game with me on the go… say on my Nintendo 3DS? That would be pretty sick! Pick-up-&-play may have been better for this game for me.","May 1, 2015","true","13.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Chroma Rangers!\n\nIf you grew up, like me, watching the Power Rangers or any Japanese Super Sentai, it's probably worth a look.\n\nThe game use a nice pixel artstyle with a lot of color... lot of chroma!\nAs far as I know, it's the first Super Sentai Simulator and the two years wait since the kickstarter was worth it.\nThere is a story to follow so it's not a sim per say but you have some freedom with the customization of your squad and studio.\n\nThe game fit perfectly in the Super Sentai genre with crazy weird monsters, lots of weird poses and a good amount of friendships and conflicts. There is also some references to other games or memes that can be hit or miss but most of the game is spent in battle or getting ready to battle in the studio. Only a few story scenes are long, most are short unless they are important to the main plot.\n\nThe Teamwork mechanic is interesting and add a good amount of strategies to the tactical gameplay. On the normal difficulty, you can go all in like the Rangers usual do and barely win or take your time and overwhelm the baddies. Only as few battle may force you to pick a more specific strategy.\n\nMy first playthrough took me about 14 hours on the normal difficulty and, at this time, there are 3 different endings with a few different stages depending on the path taken. Except a few specific choices, the game is linear.\n\nOh and there are Mecha/Kaiju battles! They are pretty simple but you can't have Super Sentai without monsters growing with those slow battles full of sparks!\n\nThis review was inspired by Chroma Squad that was inspired by Saban's Power Rangers that was inspired by Toei and Bandai's Super Sentai Series.","May 3, 2015","true","14.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The awesome atmosphere of 90s Power Rangers, Voltron and Silver Rider and the Star Sherifs is more or less lost among the repetitive grind of the game. The missions devolve into mindless running around and doing the same 4 skills on each of your squad mates over and over again, on bland, unispired, baren fields. No variaty, no interesting locations, no obsticles.\n\nThe mecha fights are a joke. You like to grind press a quick-time eventbutton 20 times, while waiting or a randomly generated percentage attack to hit or miss ? Well this is the game for you. To add insult to injury in the middle of the game there is an episode which is just mecha battles one after the other, like the developers just gave up and said ♥♥♥♥ it...\n\nThe final stage/episode is even worse. Oh do you want to fight all the bosses up until now all at once ? How about after that try to escape from a room filled with gas, while you get pummeled by a repetitive bad guys? And then get to the final boss that just spams those god damn unskippable attacks so you can watch them ...hmm 50+ times? Best day ever.\n\nAll in all - good story, cool idea, fun concept with the companies, the studio upgrades, etc.\nHorrble repetitive main game - fight 5 different enemies the whole game.... - a squirel guy, a bird guy, a toad guy, a rhino guy, a possum guy....that's it - and of course the pallet swaps...\n\nA quirky concept a good game does not make! There should be some fun gameplay somewhere in the whole mess.","April 2","false","20.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I just finished it as I type this review, their were very few things ultimately that bugged me however, nothing really that bad that I'd give it a negative recommendation, but still it bugged me.\n\nFirst you don't have one of each pieces of armor and each weapons at 'Legendary' quality, you got a pistol & a sword, I guess so those can be wielded by everyone however if you got used to wield class specific weapons its a let down that you can't have a unique Legendary weapon for each classes, also while you got one armor and two helmets for your characers armor, I found it lacking that you couldn't have boots and make a full Legendary armor, which would have been nice for the finale, but from what I seen you can't sadly, it would have been really a great idea for the very last mission at least to be able to have all your team in full Legendary.\n\nNext is New Game +, I saw the narrator after the credits mention that, it would have been great to finish your game on a level than be able to New Game + to the next difficulty level. Now the game has been out for a few months and still no  sign of that sadly. If not for a New Game + one thing that would have been great would have been to be able to replay any mission after the end or after having done them, so that you could fight again any battles, sure their might not be able to alter the storyline path you took, but just replaying the missions would have been a pretty good idea, give the game a bit more longevity. Right now the game feel limited in what you can do, since ou can't continue into a New Game + with your stuff or you can't continue in that game either , when its over its over, whatever you like it or not. I did see their is a mention of some sort of 'Episode Editor' program that would allow us to create custom episodes for endless gaming, I can't wait for it to come out.\n\nOtherwise maybe the selection of potential characters is a bit limited too, I went for a all female team and I was just able to do it, you have barely enough characters of each genders to fill in a full team, without accounting I think for the backers special characters which are... peculiar... one is an weird animal thing, one is a robot, another looked like a lazy bum, and the last is some guy with a shop discount.... but it would have been nice to have a few more picks, if I want to play a new all female team I'd be forced to go with the exact same team and the only way to change things up would be to shift whom is what... so yea, a bit lacking on that part.\n\nStill when all is said and done, this game is great, it was worthwhile for me to get it and I hope it will be expanded upon, maybe get a sequel in time, since the scene at the very end imply their could be a sequel to it, I really want it to be true, hopefully one that would correct the few issues and build up to a even greater game, but that is something we'll have to wait and see about, I really wish for it to happen, if not at least another Tactical RPG of that quality would always be welcome.","October 9, 2015","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I feel as though that if you're a huge fan of Power Rangers or the Sentai genre or a big fan of RPG games, this game is for you. It has a lot of references to Sentai shows like Power Rangers and even other super hero based things like Marvel and DC to random things like Little Mermaid and Barney the dinosaur. This helps it to an extent because after a while the references were getting kind of old and repeptitive. Also on some levels the number of enemies on the field at a time is crazy and I feel as though that the game kept making more and just had a bunch in the corner standing around till more died. It was kind of annoying in that regard to especially when you would have a supposedly strong boss, only to have him being shielded by tons of minions. Still though I thought this game was fun and the sound track as well as look were kick ♥♥♥ and I will be playing this through again at some point, and try and get a different story line. If you're a fan of power rangers, sentai shows, or rpgs, I totally suggest this game!","November 7, 2015","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every sunday on steam you can make... your own super hero show featuring 5 people...\n\nactually... they don't do that anymore? Well... THIS GAME IS STILL HERE THEN!\n\nSo basicly it's about you running your own studio and acting out every scene which will air on tv and you get fans after each match depending on how good you did it. In the studio you can make higher materials, armour,weapon and recyle older things to get back some stuff.. but most of the time you wont get anything back at all.\n\nAnd later in the game... you get your own giant mecha which you can customize and make part for as well. The thing I really love about this game is the ''ACTING'' it's so soild... and when you equip gear it changes looks for both weapon and armour, Pretty cool game I'd say.\n\nBuy it, Try it uh... love it?\n\n'well... if you don't like it you can always get a refond somehow...

The tactics you implement in fights like the team acrobatics and team attacks are true to both this genre of game and the TV shows Chroma Squad draws inspiration from. There's so many different play styles you can try thanks to the no-penalty selection of skills. By no-penalty I mean that if you want to change a character's skills alter their strengths and weaknesses you can do total 180s. The freedom to experiment with different strategies really add a lot of replay value to this game.\n\nThe crafting is very thought out with different tiers organized so that there are no useless crafting items and none of them are too hard to get. The studio upgrades, mecha upgrade, shop, and agency stuff are all great inclusions that all players to go wild with improving and powering up their characters. I also love being able to make my own power rangers  including their names, colours, catch phrases, and all that other cool super hero stuff.\n\nThe visuals are pixelly, but in a good way. Behold Studios did a great job using an old-school graphics style in a cinematic and modern way. Even though everything is a clearly made from little squares, there is detail involving perspective, lighting, and various other aspects that gives this 2D world a bigger feeling. This style is similar to games like Hotline Miami and Party Hard, if you need an example.\n\nThe music is awesome, once again capturing the vibe of those 90's shows we all remember so fondly, but being modern and pleasing to the ear. The theme songs for specific characters are all tailored quite well to who they are paired with. The story at first made me think "meh", but after a couple episodes I was drawn into being a squad of stuntmen trying to make their way in the world independently of The Man. And even more drawn in when the stakes get raised and the stuntmen squad must become genuine heros.\n\nThere are minor quirks here or there, but none worth mentioning since they've probably already been fixed as I'm typing this.\n\n\nTL;DR: if you like incrediby well made tactical RPGs and have a nostalgia scratch to itch, then you should really play this game.","December 2, 2015","true","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Centered around a Power Rangers motif and tactical role playing gameplay, it's a concept that is never taken too seriously and instead commits to delivering an experience both entertaining and unabashedly ridiculous. The developers clearly used an endearing sheaf of letters to spell its love for the sentai genre and consequently you'll be hard tasked to find a game executed with more fun and heart than Chroma Squad.

Hmm.  So does the concept work?\nGrowing up I liked power rangers - it was such a cool show.  As I grew older I really liked RPG games on my Gameboy Color.  Pokemon Yellow, Zelda, and then on our home PC FFVII.  So when I saw this game, I thought I would really enjoy it.  But it just failed to catch my attention, I never felt engaged or interested in what was happening in game.\n\nPros\nThe theme is great.  You are making “power ranger” episodes and gaining more viewers/money depending on how well you perform.\nThe genre is unique.  As I said, somewhere between a tactical RPG and a business sim game.  Very unique, and indeed a good idea.\nI think the 8-bit style (or is it 16?) is appropriate as the game is a throwback to the ‘90s.Cons\nUltimately, I just couldn’t get into the gameplay, progression, or the story.\nTHe only real technical complain I have is that I found the interface odd and uneasy.  Sometimes it's difficult to tell, according to the character selection bar on the right, which avatar correlates to various characters on the map.  Setting up the vital teamwork moves is also a little awkward and inconsistent","December 8, 2015","false","5.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

For some reason, the complexity and depth reminded me of Advanced Wars in the sense that it is fairly shallow and lite compared to other much deeper turn-based fighting games. Its not bad - it is just a certain kind of thing. I like the base management, but others have said that choices don't matter all that much. I did like the art style, but it wasn't enough to carry me further.\n\nIf you watch the trailer and it screams 'play me!', then this is *probably* for you.

I was getting more and more disappointed as I played further into the game. First a few key points of the game that are off.\n\n"Hire Actors", "Cast actors" Sorry but this is a once off near the start of the game you pick your 5 heroes which you can't change and must be in the 5 roles forced upon you. There is also no choices in villains or henchmen appear in episodes.\n\n"Customize your TV studio" No you get to pick from a small list of improvements that improve your heroes statistics, drop rate and fans per episode or unlock a skill rank that can only be used from certain seasons onwards even if purchased before that season. You don't get to choose what your sets look like.\n\n"upgrade your gear", "craft weapons" Upgrading does not happen you replace for better gear and in my play through all bought gear was better than anything that could be crafted except a few utility gear that increases throw distance or movement.\n\nAs for the rest of the game each hero only has a choice of 3 weapon to equip either a one handed sword, a pistol or their role's specialty weapon with a very limited selection of skills. During the episodes you play them out with no choices in what you do except for the very few times you change the ending path you are on. Even during a cringe worthy talk about not following sexist tropes I thought I would finally get a choice of rescue a boy or a girl but the game forces their decision on you. I really would have liked to have many choices that would affect what type of fans, how many fans you get and what the media is saying about your show. The game also has quite a repetitive feel to it doing pretty much the same each episode.\n\nAs for bugs I have had some random freezes where I can't continue the battle but can access the menu and quit out and reload my game. I have also seen directors orders not being completed where you need to destroy x amount of a boss specially summon (Bombs and Clones) but if your team does enough acrobatics and flashy moves the directors orders don't matter.\n","May 2, 2015","false","13.9"," 26 of 61 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","26","61","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgn9001/recommended/251130/","tgn9001","Guerilla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgn9001/","517 products in account","TL;DRToo ♥♥♥♥ing bad, read the damn review. If you're on this game's page you surely don't have anything better to do.\n\nChroma Squad?Chroma Squad? I’m not too sure what that means, I’m pretty sure the devs thought that Google Chrome was kind of cool and decided to name their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game after it. So yes, two sentences into this review and you know my stance on this game. Indeed, this means I can spend the rest of the review flaming up a storm -- after I go over what the game is, and what is good.\n\nChroma Squad is a game that attempts to combine crafting because all the cool games have crafting so why wouldn’t we, with elements from Game Dev Story, then they stapled a turn-based combat system on to that formula to make sure they would attract all the niches to their doorstep on Halloween, only for the youngsters to find out that this guy only gives out single mini-twizzler packs despite all the hype. So what is the game about? Well, more or less you’re a group of people who are stunt acting for *generic movie studio* in a show that is more or less Power Rangers,  and then you and your squad of ♥♥♥♥ bois who share striking resemblance to the Power Rangers decide to make their own movie studio. I kind of want to make a movie studio now too. You show up in your uncles warehouse to film, without his consent, but then when he talks to you, you realize that this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Bob Marley levels of chill. He didn’t give a single ♥♥♥♥ that we just stormed into his warehouse to film our Power Rangers rule 34. You then must shoot episodes and manage your “company.” Shooting episodes is where the turn based combat they stole directly from the Shadowrun series comes into play.\n\nWhat is good?So what is good about this steaming pile of over-hyped garbage that somehow made it into my Humble Monthly bundle? Well, the management part is okay; and by okay I mean better than getting shot in the knee caps with a .44 -- which doesn’t set the bar too high. It’s cool at first, you get to choose advertising companies, equip your group of under-qualified ♥♥♥♥s, and even change the different sayings in the game. When in combat, your group says some stuff during certain points like when turning into their actual “Chroma” form. I, of course, took full advantage off this opportunity, making the whole game look like it was written by that 9 year old on CoD who just learned the word “♥♥♥♥♥♥” and has too many red bulls on hand as well as a mother who just doesn’t give a damn. The management gets stale quick considering nothing changes. Every couple of missions they just append more items and companies making full use of the random number generator. You can craft fun stuff for your team, but crafting materials is gathered by killing in the field, and no. Just buy your ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnd for the bad.So, now that we’ve gone over the good, let’s start the real flaming. Let’s start with the most obvious thing, Chroma Squad looks like the kind of pixel art you find 90s kids making on MS Paint in Windows XP, minus originality and artistic vision. But on top of the pixel art just being straight up trash, it’s scaled all to hell. When you have a pixel art game, you make sure the display is pixel perfect, because when you scale it like in Chroma Squad, it looks like someone took each image in Gimp, scaled it down to 100*100 then back to 1366*76; my native resolution. But it doesn’t stop there. The game tempts you with good graphics. They throw on a hard-core CRT shader, because all Unity games need their “CUSTOM SHADER,” and the graphics become tolerable. The shader is equivalent to going into Hammerwatch, and switching on all the options that ♥♥♥♥ your GPU. But nope, it only lasts for seconds at a time, so pipe dream.\n\nNow that I’ve got that off my chest, let’s talk about combat. As I stated before, the combat is a Shadowrun rip-off for pixel games. They basically found a free Unity game decompiler and run Shadowrun Returns through it, stole the combat code, and placed it in their game. Yet, someone on the team didn’t get the memo, and stole all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parts out of Shadowrun and Banner Saga instead, and then replaced the rest with his poorly-done excuse of a script. So we are left with a combat system that is so unstable you’d think it’s your grandpa’s black-market dialysis machine. For starters, the best way to do turn based combat is one person from one team gets a turn, then the other team gets a turn, and so on. But not in this game. You see, the game gets its difficulty from pressing an enemy, hitting Ctrl + C, then holding down Ctrl + V for a solid ten seconds until the screen is so full of random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you’d think Harper was on the TV. So this means all of the enemies get their turn at once, and will completely ♥♥♥♥ your entire team worse than America rapes resource-filled countries then slap a “terrorists” sticker on it all the while spewing out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reasons as to why they shouldn’t lose their guns. Once your team has taken more hits than a rich heroin junkie, you can “Chromatize” and turn in to your stronger form and use the weapons you bought. You can use your weapons like once every 5 turns, even if you’re packing a 9, because apparently it takes the equivalent of waiting at the DMV to reload a magazine-fed semi-automatic weapon. Okay. Other than that, you can jump over other teammates, do team attacks, and help a brother out. You can then use a generic finisher on the boss at the end to gain some audience or some fans or some ♥♥♥♥; I don’t ♥♥♥♥ing know anymore.\n\nSometimes after you’ve finished off the boss, you are welcomed to a giant mecha fight versus the very boss you just beat that is now somehow the size as Trump’s tower combined with his ego. These fights are worse than watching cement set. At least with cement some dumb ♥♥♥  might step in it then you can get all pissy at them and tell them about all the hard work it will take to fix it before doing nothing about it. With this garbage mini game you can hit the enemy, special hit the enemy, defend against the enemy, and special defend against the enemy. My favorite part is that the enemy has about three times more health than you and doesn’t miss. So lots of rage will be had. But fret not! If you run out of health you can use “Fan power!” You get some health and finish the job basically giving zero required skill to win. So that’s fun.\n\nWhat else is on my list to smear ♥♥♥♥ from the Taco Bell bathroom on is there still left? Oh yeah, the cut scenes. If they were bad, I would just call them cancer and move on, but this is much worse. The game is “a tv series” so you have to know what’s going on in every episode. The writer constantly breaks the fourth wall between the audience of your show and the show itself, for no reason other than “it was cool when MGS 2 did it.” You can hold down enter to try and skip, but it still takes like thirty seconds to get through it, while staring at yet another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shader they included because why the hell not. It’s not even just that. The writing is more cringe-worthy than The Room’s sex scenes.\n\nConclusionI think I’ve used all the ♥♥♥♥ out of the Taco Bell bathrooms now, so time to wrap it up. The game was made by hipsters on Mac Book Pros in Starbucks leeching off the free WiFi because they’re on a Ramen Noodle every night kind of budget, working in Unity to create the “latest and greatest” pixel Unity game. It’s trash, it’s three different game concepts glued together with 10 year old epoxy from the shed, and I’d like to know how this first year University project made it on to my damned monthly bundle I paid 15 Canadian bucks for. Now that I have offended almost every niche in the first world, to the rest still reading, congratulations.","December 12, 2015","false","3.2"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","3","13","2","6"

It's not fun, it detracts from strategy, and it's incredibly frustrating. Similarly, gunmen in the game can and will kite you endlessly to the very edges of the map.

There's some really good ideas and bit and pieces that work well together, but then the game quickly remembers it's an indie title so it immediately breaks the fourth wall with some dumb meme joke and poorly placed rants about sexism. It wouldn't have been so bad had the dialogue actually followed what sentai/powerranger shows were like, but it isn't ; it's completely about these random, pre-made characters that always spew the same lines regardless of their gender/race/species. Why even let people choose the visual appearance of them if you've already created characters for them? It would have been better just to create a premade team that apes the original show's archetypes rather than blandly change the visuals.\n\nThe game also suffers in that there's too much fluff and not enough depth. You have weapons, crafting, a store and various upgrades - but they all feel meaningless. Nothing really excels and feels like it was tacked on because all rpgs must have crafting now, rather than it was something important to the game play.\n\nLastly, the art can be downright confusing or poorly imitating at times. For some reason my blonde female support character won't stop rubbing her nipples in her idle animation. It's kind of disturbing and is weirding me out. Just, standing there all day, rubbing away.

Tonally, the dialogue never seems whether to indulge in the action fantasy of sentai, or provide a narrative about the stunt crew pursuing their own career. The result is that the characters are constantly breaking the fourth wall which is not only tiresome, but spoils the atmosphere the game's (very good) graphics are depicting.\n\nThe game has been designed without level ups: where this might seem beneficial to some, they've replaced this tried and tested mechanism with a bolted-on crafting system. You become dependent on crafting gear from items dropped by enemies - worse, you have to hope that the 'random bonus' is actually worth having. The removal of level ups takes away a sense of stable progression, and replaces it with gear-dependence, which, for me, sucks the fun out of the game.\n\nThe management aspect is not developed or interesting enough as a worthwhile distraction, and the two gameplay modes (simulation/SRPG) don't mesh with each other in a satisfactory way. The lack of depth in the simulation and the lack of levelling are disempowering - you're never sure where you sit on the game's difficulty curve, and ultimately your successes do not feel like they've originated from any choices you've made. This is poisonous for any game, but Chroma Squad simply fails to provide any grit, depth or detail beyond what is an impressive exterior.\n\nTL;DR: It looks great on the surface, but goes to pieces once you get past the unique premises, references, and graphics.\n","May 4, 2015","false","2.7"," 11 of 36 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","11","36","0","1"

Its one of those things where you're very easily amused by grinds and futile mechanics things will work for you, or if you thrive in the badness of things. Like naming your squad the Peepee patroller and naming your mech the WOBBLY SAUSAGE, caps mandatory. Its stupid, really stupid, not really lucid gameplay sort of fun, play it if you're tired, bored, and its priced at the fiveish dollars its worth. Man, it's 4 am RIGHT NOW AS I'M TYPING IT, I'm exhausted and my friends are asleep  after a night of enjoyment, I'm actually having fun while gorging myself on brownie bars. Still not reccomended, but, eh, if you're a sad little man and you know it, buy Chroma rangers, cue jingle I'm outies.\n\nTL;DR: Power Rangers (but not really, its more a side detail to people cracking dank memes), dull mecha maymays, some people are mad about Social Justice, but the game itself just isn't as thrilling as it promises to be. RIP in Pepperoni.\n\nNot really as great as its touted to be. It seems for half a second it would be tactically challenging but then you realize everything you fight is just an issue of placement, which at times could be avoided if you were allowed to pick your path rather than autorouting. The item system relies a little too much on you getting lucky, and only really serves to make you irritated wih things. Squad customizations are funny for a while but you really get tired of what you see soon, and its a bit annoying when you realize into the game you put the wrong person into the wrong role. Humour is forced. Good lord is it forced, not even mentioning the heavy handed shoehorned stupid SJW messages (which really don't make sense by the way), which, really, I understand given the market of tumblr being so easy to reel into guaranteed sales, but... the humour itself gets really worn out really fast. Audience system is mostly pointless since just running a lot and using the positioning system will top you out easy enough and it just serves to drag fights on if you're going for all of the pointless little guys. Not to mention, a lot of the skills look cool! Then don't really do anything compared to the normal punching action, combined with a lack of many real skills, its best to just stick to passives save for the one starter heal move and punch things to hell. Mecha battles are excruiatingly bland and don't really carry the oomph you're hoping for, its more of a rock paper scissors game but without any chance of losing unless you somehow hit ALT+F4.","May 2, 2015","false","1.8"," 20 of 61 people (33%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","33","20","61","4","0"

There are plenty of positive reviews regarding story and sentai fanservice.\n\nThis is based on playing the highest difficulty:\nThis game is a decent turn-based game in it's own right. There isn't much strategy to it. A bit of planning is involved to complete the director's instructions, but in the end it all comes down to luck. The most important thing to making equipment, materials, all based on luck.\n\nI have one save file where a certain material I obtain in abundance, and really dont need it as it's mostly for the starter equipment, and another save file where the only material I've been obtaining is the make the same pair of gloves. If you dont keep your equipment up to snuff, your rangers are as good as dead or too weak to complete director's instructions as the episodes difficulty increase.\n_____\n\nNow for the actual gameplay. Here is wear luck becomes absolutely infuriating. Let me give some examples:\nNow, remember, you control a squad of 5 rangers.\nThe director wants you to kill all of a certain enemy within, say, 3 turns. There are about 10 enemies on the field, and you need to focus on 3 specific ones. Those specific ones need to all be dead in 3 turns. Sounds simple enough, plan out how you'll position your rangers to catch them and take them out.\nNow, let's get to the problem:\n\n- Most of the squishy enemies, unless you luckily score a critical, can't be killed by a single ranger. This means it will take two of your rangers attacking to guarantee that kill. After a ranger attacks, they're done for that turn. This means it should be no problem for you to kill 3 of the weak enemies within 3 turns. Let's not get into details about some rangers having to use up their turn just to move around and get close to these enemies. We'll just presume you'll probably be spread thin and only have a kill average of 1 enemy per turn.... wait, change that from 'kill' to 'chance to kill'. You have a 'chance' to kill 1 enemy per turn. So if you happen to miss this chance, you can kiss that director's instruction goodbye, and restart the episode. Let's type how this will play out if you're unlucky:\n\nFirst turn: you manage to kill an enemy.\nSecond turn: you manage to kill another enemy.\nThird turn, your last turn to complete the instructions, and you're only one kill away: you order your rangers to attack and... the enemy dodges. Well, you're screwed. Time to abort episode and try again.\nThis is how many of your games will play out. This may not be too bad when it's just the start of an episode. However, there are times when an episode has 3 parts and you can spend an hour of your time going through the episode, completing all director's instructions only to have some unlucky crap happen at the very end and have to restart from the very beginning.\nThat's a lot of time to be wasting over something that's completely out of your control, luck.\n\nI'll give you one of my recent episodes as an example, there are three parts. The first two parts are simple enough, the third part involves a boss that can heal itself and many enemies around that heal. You have to kill the boss within 10 turns and finish it with a finishing move. A finishing move requires all your rangers to be next to the boss and attack together(use Teamwork).\nTechnically, you have to kill the boss within 9/10 turns, since he will stun your rangers(making you unable to use the finishing move on the 10th turn, as it requires all of your rangers) on specific turns... one of those specific turns being the 10th one. Now, that seems like a pretty decent time to take out the boss. That is, if you're lucky. Let's play this out:\n\n(We'll skip the small details and say you manage to get rid of the healing minions within 3 turns. You now have 6 turns left to take out the boss, who will also heal himself for pretty hefty amount. If you're lucky, he wont heal too often. If you're unlucky, he might heal twice in a row, making all your damage done to him in a turn, null. You still should have no problems as long as you manage to keep hitting him every turn and wittle him down. Given you have proper planning, you'll be just fine!)\n\nTurn 1/6: You manage to quadruple the boss, and dealing enough damage that will allow you to outdps his heal.\nTurn 2/6: You deal enough to outdps his heal again.\nTurn 3/6: He dodges, completely wasting a turn, and heals himself. That's okay, you see that you still have a chance to take him out in time.\nTurn 4/6: He dodges again... okay, it might  be close, but just maybe you can make it.\nTurn 5/6: He dodges again, and heals. He's now at full health again, it's game over. Time to abort and do the whole episode again, taking up another hour of your time.\n_______\n\nLet me give you one last situation. In this one, YOUR luck can be your downfall in completing instructions. Let's say you need to kill 4 enemies in a single turn. Well, remember how it can take two rangers just to kill one enemy? You have 5 rangers, it takes 2 to kill one. Simple math, you can't kill 4 in a single turn. Unless... you plan ahead and simply soften them up to kill at once later. You're so clever. A tactical genius in the making. This shouldn't be a problem, you've got the plan and the means to execute it! What could go wrong?\nNone of the enemies dodge, you manage to soften up 4 of them enough to where any single ranger can finish them off in your next turn. There's absolutely nothing that could go wrong. Unless... <.<\n\nIt's the enemy's turn: The weakened enemy attacks your ranger, it's super effective! At least super effective against the enemy, because your ranger decides that of all times he's going to choose this time to do a counter-attack. The softened up enemy dies. Now you only have three softened up enemies, maybe you still have a chance. You'll have 3 rangers kill the 3 softened ones, and your other 2 rangers can double attack some other enemy. Unless... <.<\nIt's still the enemy's turn: Another of the weakened enemies attacks another ranger. You couldn't possibly be so lucky you counter attack again, could you? I dont think I need to say where this is going. You know you're screwed, abort episode and try again.\n\n\nThe game could also stand to give some actual info on the stat points. There seems to be no info on the usefulness or effective amounts for Cooldown Cost and Skill Regen. There are other stats as well that have no explanation in the game, and you just have to guess and hope they're worth investing into.\n\nIf they cut out all of the luck crap, it would be an entertaining turn-based game that actually rewarded you for proper planning. Instead, it's always a roll of the dice.\nI dont know how many hours Steam will say I've played this game, but my first save file is 11 hours. My second save file says 3 hours. So any beyond that was just wasted time from having to abort episodes.","May 4, 2015","false","18.3"," 4 of 27 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","4","27","0","15"

This development team has sucked me in many times with the premises of their games but they never follow through with this premise.\n\nI certainly would have loved a game about making my own Sentai series where my decisions determine not only how popular the show is with the combat being real tactical battles with impressive "fakey" special effects with many of its comedic moments being just the sort of crud a studio would pull to save money. Yet that isn't how the game works.\n\nBasically to understand the game you take the role of several stunt workers who have decided to make their own "power ranger" type show. You achieve this by having random fights at which you are given goals that you must succeed, there is a story but the characters involved mostly speak entirely out of character at all times.\n\nIn fact that is probably my biggest gripe about the game's comedy is that it has absolutely no grounding. The game makes no attempt to even pretend like there is a show actually being recorded because characters almost never say their proper lines and cannot shut up for a moment about their own special effects or plotting. So some jokes, such as the characters not being able to transform because their costumes are in the cleaners out of show, fall completely flat because it never feels like this is interfering with the show because it just feels like a Larp. Another joke that falls flat is their constant references to their cheap teleportation effects, which would certainly be funny if they didn't constantly refer to it. The comedy could have been this game's saving grace, the nectar that would sustain me through the simplistic combat.\n\nOutside of this the vast majority of the game's comedy are references. The majority of them are "references for reference sake" rather then folding them seamlessly in the game's comedy.\n\nWhat the game really boils down to is a tactical RPG nothing more and nothing less. The studio runs itself and your decisions are just buffs, you are not the one writing the plot, chosing the opponents, deciding on the scenes. Yet what is there is just the barest of a tactical RPG, in fact if they didn't give you the ludicrous goals at the start of every episode the entire game would be too easy.\n\nYet even in this there are some genuinely good ideas there. Viewership, which you will max a little too quickly, depends on how you fight. Boss monsters for example must be defeated by your finisher otherwise you get a stiff viewership penalty (for obvious reasons) and if you waste a finisher on a boss and don't defeat it? You also get a penalty. Yet even this can come off as forced when you cannot even transform until your viewership is high enough (what is this viewed live?) instead of just allowing the player to carefully contemplate whether taking a penelty is worth it.\n\nThese goals are usually things like "defeat all enemies before hurting the boss" which are decent ones. Yet as you go on they become quite complex requiring you to carefully map out the field. The issue with these isn't that they are difficult, and they are, but that they are the only source of difficulty in this game.\n\nYou then collect crafting items from ordinary enemies which you can craft into weapons that are usually "comedic" so expect a lot of "Bucket helmets" and "Tinfoil swords". They have their own stats as well as randomized bonus stats based on how good the item is. These are equipped like everything else and to the game's credit all the items show up on your characters.\n\nYou can get studio upgrades and even marketing using the money you earn on each episode. Marketing for the most part effects the money and viewership of episodes for a small fee. You can also use your viewers to activate additional powers unlocked by that marketing campaign which can easily turn the tide in a fight from easy to rediculously easy. Studio upgrades amount to buffs and bonuses to shooting or to crafting as well as unlocking more items.\n\nTo shoot you are given a selection of fights you must do, and you will do all of them so don't worry, and then you get into a fight. That is what it amounts to. All the shoots are usually fights with usually the characters chiming in, out of character, about what this episode might be about (as said earlier they barely keep up appearances that they are actually shooting this show).\n\nI think what this ultimately boils down to is that this game is a disapointment in every level. It wasn't the game I thought it was going to be. Yet when I tried to like the game, the game actively hurt itself. Its comedy is forced, its tactics bogged down and simplistic, and the game is as linear as heck!\n\nFor those who are going to buy this as a comedy game, I should state that the trailer for the game is much more funny then anything you are going to find in this game. So watch 30 minutes of an hour of a letsplay and base how "funny" it is on that.\n\nGet this on sale for 5 bucks! If I could get my money back I would in a heart beat. Also feel free to say this is unhelpful because this review is negative, especially you production crew.\n\n-Edit: playing it a bit more, the "acting in character" does improve but the comedy still falls flat. Mostly because the Out of character events rarely manifest in character.","April 30, 2015","false","3.6"," 32 of 115 people (28%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","28","32","115","6","2"

It has a interesting and complex combat which will seem simple at a first look but has a hidden complexity with the audience to impress. The game has very loose and meta humour so if that’s not your thing the story may be confusing and annoying.\n\nIf there any negatives in my opinion is that you cannot customize the characters and Mecha much. The mecha battle don't add to the audience bar. The update crafting system is improved from the earlier versions but ends up being more difficult to use and I found myself using the store. The final problem is that every time you start a new camping you have to go through the tutorial and due to this makes the beginning of the game a grind.\n\nEven with these problems I love this game and its really worth a go and I am going to end buying it again for Playstation 4 but if you don't feel like buying I am betting on it being a Playstation Plus game or a least small discount even if in my case I feel the game is cheap all ready.","May 3, 2015","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am gonna explain with a couple of keywords what kind of game this is (for those who are considering to buy Chroma Squad):\n\n- Tactical RPG, the tactical form in this game is centered in how you skill your characters (more than positioning).\n- Mech fights, YES MECHS.\n- Game time, I completed the game in 20 hours.\n- Difficulties, there is easy, interesting and challenging. Hardest difficulty is a real ♥♥♥♥♥!\n- Managing, beside the tactical RPG side of the game, you need to manage your characters by crafting, teching their skills, upgrading your mech, marketing, responding to e-mail where choices matter (not heavily), upgrading your studio and buying items.\n- Achievements, well done compared to most indie games.\n- Comedy & awesomeness, this game gave me laughs and goosebumps. Comedy is based on parodies of modern memes, Power Rangers and other silly stuff. I got goosebumps in the final fight, where I just got blown away by the story and momentum of it.\n- Story is well done and original.\n\nTL:DR\nChroma squad is an original indie game which has two sides of gameplay: tactical RPG and managing your party. The story is wel done and takes around 15+ hours to complete. I had ALOT OF FUN completing this game and I am happy I bought it. You need to understand the mechanics, but the moment you do its fun as hell.\n\nP.S. Don't craft anything until the later seasons, buying items is the way to go.","July 11, 2015","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having team work and acrobatics effect audience levels was an interesting mechanic that allowed to the player to decide on how much of either to do to maximize the attendance to gain more fans/money per episode. The attendance machanic in general seemed a bit easy to abuse to an extent, should have a negative factor if either is overly used.\n\nHaving different characters to choose from at the beginning for each role is a really nice touch. It allowed to add in variety to characters with the abilities that affected the gameplay. This allows the player to choose how they would like to play their games, and not have a stagnant gameplay with fixed characters for the storyline only.\n\nStoryline progressed at a decent pace and was well thought out in respect to what Tokusatsu's usually revolved around. But also adding in a bit of flare by blurring reality with fiction.\n\nOne thing that was unimpressive after a few levels would be the minion's designs. During a level that had a Boss Mob, could have had the minion's designs centered around that particular Boss in the later stages. It's understandable at the beginning since it is representing the beginning stages of a starter company.","July 11, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But not easy peasy if you let your guard down!\n+Enjoyable if somewhat predictable story that, if you dont take it too seriously, is a great experience all the way. Plenty of 4th wall breaking too\n+Massive quantity of customization. From outfit colours, to the actors inside the suits, to the effing Catchphrases to transform and the one to call your Mecha.\n+Lots of items to craft and buy to outfit your characters and give them different attributes. RPG veterans will spend quite a while in the room outfitting\n\n\n-You won't get too many abilities in this game overall for your actors. And the classes are set. Just a little thing that might just be me nitpicking.\n-If you fail an Episode, or decide to restart it, getting to the point you were at, skipping all the text is a bit tedious. I did feel like I was being punished for restarting the mission, instead of going through and failing it and taking a hit in my fanbase. But its the same for failing.\n-A few hilarious but present Graphical glitches, which luckily did not harm my gameplay. The most common one for me were my actors greeting clone version of themselves in the studio interface.\n\nLIGHTS,CAMERA,CHROMATIZE!","June 17, 2015","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought I'd have an issue that the squad really only levels up through gear you equip, but it didn't actually bother me that much.  You get a new ability every season, so that in its own, felt kind of like progression.\n\nI didn't care for the mecha fights so much, it was cool at first, but got boring fast.\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty, having little experience in Tactical RPGs, but I ended up have only a few issues until the final boss, where the difficulty amped up big time.\n\nIf you like fast paced Tactical RPG's, you'll like this.\n\n\n","June 17, 2015","true","44.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game clocks in about 15 hours (give or take) to complete one play through and is loaded with a ton of fan service and pop culture references that keep you constantly hyped and laughing throughout your journey. The blend of simulation and RPG is where the game truly shines and feels unique. You aren't only creating your dream Sentai team, you are a part of the show!\n\nOn the tactical side, the game does not get very complex, and I found the game to be quite a breeze on Normal, but honestly, that's okay. A game does not need to be hard as hell in order to be fun. However, I will note that as hype as the Mecha battles are they are pretty one sided and easy to complete most of the time. From the perspective of a fan of Sentai it makes total sense and you feel awesome beating up Kaiju for the sake of justice, but the above mentioned simplicity is why I couldn't recommend the game to someone just looking for a Tactical RPG fix. Though I would say at the very least look up some footage and if you are open minded enough you might really enjoy it anyways! Might even get you interested into Sentai etc.\n\nChroma Squad as it is may have relatively simple combat, crafting and business simulation but I strongly feel like that's the entire point of the game. The game doesn't just want you to create a Sentai show, it wants you to be the hero! So what are you waiting for? Get out there and deliver some justice! And don't forget to shout a cheesy line like "Justice is best served in a rainbow of colors!" It doesn't have to make sense, as long as you do a cool pose while saying it you'll be FINE.\nPros\n•	High replayability\n•	Fan service...fan service everywhere!\n•	Incredible soundtrack\n•	Amazing retro graphics\nCons\n•	Individual aspects of the game are simple\n•	Left me begging for more customization. (perhaps we might see more in updates)\n•	A few annoying bugs, but patches should be coming in quite soon\n\n9/10","May 3, 2015","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the gameplay itself revealed to have more depth than I expected. Currently I'm in the beginning of Season 5 - and will definitely have to replay, for following reasons:\n\n* Marketing - a key strategic component. I thought way too little of it initially\n* Resource management - especially cash\n* A well-reasoned choice of actors\n\nI found very little wrong in this game.

I could end this review here and now by saying/typing "Buy this game, NOW!", but I won't.\n\nWhat kind of game is it? A Tactical RPG. Most of the time you have five characters to control in turn based battles, each characters may move once and then hit an enemy or use some ability, or it may move twice but not do anything else. The characters are like clones of the Power Rangers and you may name them and also choose their colors, but not how they look... per se. There's some identities with different stats and looks that can be chosen for each "Ranger", but that's it. But speaking of customization, you may name your studio and also different catchphrases that your team will use during battle - for when they're using their finishing move, when they transform into the alter egos etc.\n\nThe battles in itself are really good and gets progressively harder as the game goes on, the final battle was for me really challenging, mostly due to the fact that I tried to keep everyone on their feet and I tried to meet every goal. Oh, right, the goals. For each battle you get two "Director's Instructions" that could be "Defeat x enemies" or "Win in y turns" and other things. These goals keeps the game interesting and also, if met, generates more money and fans to the studio.\n\nGraphics wise, it has a retro style, more 16 bit era than anything. Obviously it is modernized and polished to look a lot better. I liked it a lot, but then again I mostly like this graphical style. Sound though, the little I heard (mostly played it muted due to playing music meanwhile playing the game) sounded great but can't say much more than that.\n\nIn the end, if you're a fan of Power Rangers (which I'm not, so no requirement) and Mechas, you'll love this. Also, if you like Tactical RPGs you will probably like this, but the lack of depth in customization may put you off.\n\nLike I said/wrote in the beginning of this review: Buy this game, NOW!\n\nSequel, please?","May 7, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only do you have to win the fights (which are the Episodes of the Series) and please your fan-base, you also have to succesfully manage your studio. Gear, weapons and other show props such as your very own Mecha have to be build out of cardboard and duct tape, new filming equipment have to be bought to give your rangers stat-boosts and increase the production value, contracts with advertiser have to be made and Fan Mails have to be answered.

I'm glad that I did stumble acorss this, 'cuz I've had the funnest time playing Chroma Squad, the most enjoyable game I've come across in a while. In the first week of owning it, this game was what I'd play every night if I wasn't busy. It's extremely addicting, and while the story seems to start out at a good pace, things escalate quickly later on, providing great plot twists that keep the story immensely interesting.\n\nWith those opening comments out of the way, let's list the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n~A great level of customization with a plethora of actors, colors, and equipment to choose from, heck, even the mechs have a good level of customization.\n~A great soundtrack. I persoanlly am a big fan of the 8-bit/chiptune style of music, it reminds of the days of arcades and gameboys. Any chiptune lover would listen to the soundtrack over and over again. If you like the music, get the reasonably priced soundtrack. Not only does it help support the devs, but you get to listen to your favorite groovy tunes from the game anytime you want.\n~Cool graphics. if you like these kinds of pixely games or pixel art in general, this is a game for you.\n~The storyline. I've said it before: It's interesting with a great pace.\n~The play time. It took me about 22 hours to get through my first playthrough of the game, on the normal difficulty setting. And that's just for one of 3 endings that the game has to offer. Depending on the difficlty level you're playing and the time spent jamming out to the music, the time to get all the endings can range from 50 hours to 70 hours. Great amount of gameplay.\n~The achievements. There's not hundreds of them like their are in other games, and most of them are pretty easy to get, you just need to play the game accordingly. I got over half the achievements on my first playthrough. (Though I guess they could add some ones in the future that require DLC.) If you're not an achievement hunter, that's all right, it could just be a fun side quest. This game has enough play-achievement balance that you don't need to dedicate hundreds of hours to get all of them.\n~Difficalty settings. This is always a great feature to have in a game. The difficulties are casual, interesting, and challenging, ehich translates to easy, normal, hard respectively. If you're new to this type of game and/or want to focus on the story, play the game on casual. If you've played these games before and like a nice balance of story and challenge, interesting's your cuppa joe. If you like a challenge, like good planning, and you aren't afraid to lose a little to win a little, challenging is just the right fit.\n~Nice balance of battle and management. Not only do you fight with your heroes, you need to check and maintain their gear in order to beat the enemies that get more difficult as time progresses, as well as answer emails from fans, manage production companies, and upgrade your small warehouse studio as time goes on.\n~A great price. This game is relatively well priced, and will provide hours of fun and enjoyment that for most of you will be the best entertainment you've had in a while. At 15 American dollars for the game, with 5 additional for the soundtrack DLC, 20 dollars is a great price for this game. (Without DLC, the game is about 10 British pounds, 13 with DLC, for those of you in the UK)\n\nCons:\n~Though the customization is great, it would be a little better if there was more actors to choose form to play your characters.\n~Though it has a great storyline, playing it for the second time, at first, can seem kind of repetitive, and I found it hard to emotionally invest myself into the second set of characters. If you feel the same way, I advise taking a break for a month or two, so the shine of this game doesn't get burnt out.\n~Dr. Mi ah\n\nOtherwise, this is a great game, and if you were a fan of the Power Rangers when you were a kid, you're going to love this, although prior association is not required for this to be a great game. I personally thought ths was an amazing game.\n\nI give Chroma Squad a 9.7/10\n\nHappy Chromatizing!","May 12, 2015","true","61.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could end this review here and now by saying/typing "Buy this game, NOW!", but I won't.\n\nWhat kind of game is it? A Tactical RPG. Most of the time you have five characters to control in turn based battles, each characters may move once and then hit an enemy or use some ability, or it may move twice but not do anything else. The characters are like clones of the Power Rangers and you may name them and also choose their colors, but not how they look... per se. There's some identities with different stats and looks that can be chosen for each "Ranger", but that's it. But speaking of customization, you may name your studio and also different catchphrases that your team will use during battle - for when they're using their finishing move, when they transform into the alter egos etc.\n\nThe battles in itself are really good and gets progressively harder as the game goes on, the final battle was for me really challenging, mostly due to the fact that I tried to keep everyone on their feet and I tried to meet every goal. Oh, right, the goals. For each battle you get two "Director's Instructions" that could be "Defeat x enemies" or "Win in y turns" and other things. These goals keeps the game interesting and also, if met, generates more money and fans to the studio.\n\nGraphics wise, it has a retro style, more 16 bit era than anything. Obviously it is modernized and polished to look a lot better. I liked it a lot, but then again I mostly like this graphical style. Sound though, the little I heard (mostly played it muted due to playing music meanwhile playing the game) sounded great but can't say much more than that.\n\nIn the end, if you're a fan of Power Rangers (which I'm not, so no requirement) and Mechas, you'll love this. Also, if you like Tactical RPGs you will probably like this, but the lack of depth in customization may put you off.\n\nLike I said/wrote in the beginning of this review: Buy this game, NOW!\n\nSequel, please?","May 7, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of the token knights and wizards you lead your very own "Somewhat Power Ranger" Team into a tile-based battle against ridiculous themed monster.\nThing is tho - you are actually producing a TV Show. Not only do you have to win the fights (which are the Episodes of the Series) and please your fan-base, you also have to succesfully manage your studio. Gear, weapons and other show props such as your very own Mecha have to be build out of cardboard and duct tape, new filming equipment have to be bought to give your rangers stat-boosts and increase the production value, contracts with advertiser have to be made and Fan Mails have to be answered. Also your actors are not save from wordly worries such as dentist appointments, mean Ex-Producers and Cardboard Cultists...\n\nPeople who like or just watched shows such as Power Rangers will love his game for it's 4th Wall breaking, inside Humor, but also people who are looking for a new Tactical RPG with a nice management system should totally buy Chroma Squad!

Killing on a counter attack is fine but if the counter attack is countered and something dies, that is when the game locks up.\n\n2. The final mecha fight outright cashes the game when you launch an attack after a specific point. I am unable to get one of the endings because of this.

They take old ideas, revamp them, and put fun twists on them.  And they come out great.  The 8-bit graphics are awesome, so if that's a concern for you, don't let it stop you with this game.\n\nThe game is basically about your team, who are stuntmen, making their own TV studio to make a Power Rangers-esque show.  You have the 5 roles, and you pick which "person" is in each role, all with their own bonuses, so there's a lot of customizability in that. You pick colors and names, too, but that's pretty simple stuff.\n\nAnd then the fun starts.  The combat is turn based, grid strategy, and your characters get powers (more as they progress into each "season") so you start of with not a lot and end up with a plethora.  You can use teamwork to add to actions (like throwing a team member at the end of the movement range to get that guy who's JUST too far away or comboing for bonus damage on the same target).  It takes some time to fully understand, but it adds a level of depth that's VERY enjoyable.\n\nThere's a lot of customization, but I won't spoil that part, as it's hysterically funny once you find what you can actually change.  The gear is cool, too.  You have a shop, that you can spend money upgrading occassionaly, that sells gear.  It's pretty basic, but you know what you're getting.  You can also craft your own, but that leaves the effects randomly generated, so you could get something awesome (like a pair of boots that give you crazy high dodge and counter chance, ♥♥♥♥ yeah!) or something absolutely terrible (like a helmet that gives 2% dmg increase to pistols, which you stop using pretty early).  You don't sell gear, you break it down for crafting components, which I feel was on the devs part a way to motivate you to craft stuff.  It does actually change the characters looks, so fun lil bonus there.\n\nThe story is pretty awful, but in a fun way.  At first you're filming episodes just to get viewers and fans, and no, they're not the same in this game and they have very different effects on your studio.  It gets downright hilarious, and they make a TON of references to other "sentai' shows.\n\nAll in all it's a great game, and the guys at this studio really need to keep coming up with more games, because you're that breath of fresh air in this industry that they've desperately needed.  It's not going to leave with you a deep message, nor is it a game with a gripping storyline or gameplay that leaves you begging for more, but it's highly enjoyable, easily understandable, and wildly entertaining.","May 10, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Funny writing, solid tactical mechanics, and amazing art.  Just stick with it guys, even with the bug I'm giving it 5/5.   It'll probably be patched soon anyway.  This is seriously the best ranger game ever.  No joke, this is one of the best tactical RPGs I've ever played - being a Power Rangers fan is just bonus.  The attention to detail is astounding and each episode legitimately feels like an actual episode of MMPR.  You know how the Rangers usually do those flips to get into position?  It's a useful mechanic in this game.  You know how each ranger powers up and pose before doing a special group move?  They do it here :)  And I swear that's Bulk and Skull in the background...\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\nTo get pass the bug after the actors quit, just skip the tutorial in the pause menu.

The second is the actual green-screen combat with tactical acrobatics, team combos, and all the exploding rainbows a Japanese stuntman hero (or heroine. 10/10 chose Scarlett Johansson as their healer) could ever dream of!

The crafting system is multiple layers of RNG buggery and it leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth sometimes.  You can work around it but meh.\nThe pacing is fairly on point and the game never really overstays its welcome.\n\nThere are Super Robot Fights, though it's easily the weakest part of the game currently.  They're also gathering feedback and have announced an overhaul, so this point may become moot in a couple of months.\n\nAesthetics are colorful with a strong indie feel (it's an indie, kickstarted game so yeah).  16 bit and the like.\n\nThe writing assumes that you've watched at least 2-3 episodes of power rangers and have a passing knowledge of certain internet memes that came out within a specific timeframe (I had to google a couple things).  I enjoyed it.  It has the right kind of corn and ham that'll get me to sensibly chuckle most of the time.\nand again, the pacing is pretty strong despite the source material.\n\nI highly recommend configuring your super sentai team away from the defaults to fit your preferences as it can greatly improve your gameplay experience.  My team was called the Rude Rollers, they Rolled Out, and my robot was named Pablo Escobar (he shanked giant monsters).\n\nA single run may take like 6-8 hours and there are multiple endings.","February 17","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The animation is simplistic and minimized, but that's okay. This game oozes nostalgia, and coming off as "Mario Brothers-esque" is not an insult. Music and graphical interface are smooth, but some small issues have arisen with different computers. The biggest selling point is by far the writing; snark and self-referential humor make reading the dialogue part of the experience rather than a chore. As an added bonus, there is a fast forward option via pressing the enter key. It's one of the many little details that says this studio cares about the fan experience.\n\nThe only real downside I can think of is the menu system: clunky and no real way to make transitions between the various sub menus easier, but perhaps that is just the nature of a game that puts you in charge of so many details. That being said, the positives outweigh the negatives by several orders of magnitude.

It's not a perfect game.\n\nIt's got issues with difficulty, it's either a bit too trivial or a bit too hard. The mecha fights are too formulaic. There are rarely any real choices, usually just some very obvious right or good decisions, rather than alternatives.\n\nBut despite all that, it's really fun. It hooked me in for the first playthrough, and I'm going back for a second and third because there are alternate endings(though the lack of any option to keep multiple saves DOES mean you need to replay the entire thing... which is kind of a shame). The soundtrack is unbeatably enjoyable and a lot of the jokes are just plain good.\n\nIt's clearly a first-time product from an indie studio, it has rough edges, but you can feel that it's full of love despite it, and that makes you love it too.

You have several different way to customize your characters and your studio. I am having a blast with this game but the problem is that I am running into two very annoying bugs:\n\n1. Being unable to do anything if an actor or enemy dies in a chain of counter attacks. Killing on a counter attack is fine but if the counter attack is countered and something dies, that is when the game locks up.\n\n2. The final mecha fight outright cashes the game when you launch an attack after a specific point. I am unable to get one of the endings because of this. Thankfully you can have multiple save files so I am going for a different ending.\n\n\nNote: this review was written at the time of the 1.04 update","May 10, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They take old ideas, revamp them, and put fun twists on them.  And they come out great.  The 8-bit graphics are awesome, so if that's a concern for you, don't let it stop you with this game.\n\nThe game is basically about your team, who are stuntmen, making their own TV studio to make a Power Rangers-esque show.  You have the 5 roles, and you pick which "person" is in each role, all with their own bonuses, so there's a lot of customizability in that. You pick colors and names, too, but that's pretty simple stuff.\n\nAnd then the fun starts.  The combat is turn based, grid strategy, and your characters get powers (more as they progress into each "season") so you start of with not a lot and end up with a plethora.  You can use teamwork to add to actions (like throwing a team member at the end of the movement range to get that guy who's JUST too far away or comboing for bonus damage on the same target).  It takes some time to fully understand, but it adds a level of depth that's VERY enjoyable.\n\nThere's a lot of customization, but I won't spoil that part, as it's hysterically funny once you find what you can actually change.  The gear is cool, too.  You have a shop, that you can spend money upgrading occassionaly, that sells gear.  It's pretty basic, but you know what you're getting.  You can also craft your own, but that leaves the effects randomly generated, so you could get something awesome (like a pair of boots that give you crazy high dodge and counter chance, ♥♥♥♥ yeah!) or something absolutely terrible (like a helmet that gives 2% dmg increase to pistols, which you stop using pretty early).  You don't sell gear, you break it down for crafting components, which I feel was on the devs part a way to motivate you to craft stuff.  It does actually change the characters looks, so fun lil bonus there.\n\nThe story is pretty awful, but in a fun way.  At first you're filming episodes just to get viewers and fans, and no, they're not the same in this game and they have very different effects on your studio.  It gets downright hilarious, and they make a TON of references to other "sentai' shows.\n\nAll in all it's a great game, and the guys at this studio really need to keep coming up with more games, because you're that breath of fresh air in this industry that they've desperately needed.  It's not going to leave with you a deep message, nor is it a game with a gripping storyline or gameplay that leaves you begging for more, but it's highly enjoyable, easily understandable, and wildly entertaining.","May 10, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Funny writing, solid tactical mechanics, and amazing art.  Just stick with it guys, even with the bug I'm giving it 5/5.   It'll probably be patched soon anyway.  This is seriously the best ranger game ever.  No joke, this is one of the best tactical RPGs I've ever played - being a Power Rangers fan is just bonus.  The attention to detail is astounding and each episode legitimately feels like an actual episode of MMPR.  You know how the Rangers usually do those flips to get into position?  It's a useful mechanic in this game.  You know how each ranger powers up and pose before doing a special group move?  They do it here :)  And I swear that's Bulk and Skull in the background...\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\nTo get pass the bug after the actors quit, just skip the tutorial in the pause menu.  You're missing out on the extra experience you'd gain otherwise, but at least you get to play this amazing game.","May 9, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Brilliant references to 90's culture and an interesting tactical RPG combat system make this game very enjoyable. The scenario is you are stunt performers of a super sentai show who decide to make it on your own by kickstarting your own, the plot then twists from what is a tv show with stunt actors to then turn into something alot more real. The game gives you full control over your cast, studio and many other things which makes this game very interesting and different from the norm. With your team of 5 unique classes you can take down foes with a variety of unique moves or work together and form devastating combo attacks. The fact each character is a certain class is a great idea keeping you thinking about what form of attack you will make that will benefit the battle in the long run. Your characters strengths can also be upgraded with an interesting upgrade system, with a shop you can spend program revenue with to buy stronger equipment or a crafting system in which you can create equipment with drops or purchased materials to help make your characters or mecha stronger. As far as the mecha is concerned it is perhaps the weakest part of this brilliant title, although it feels incredible the first couple of times it happens the tactical tile RPG suddenly turns into a 2D fighting mechanic that feels as though it relies on luck far too often. Your accuracy ratio reduces the number of successful hits you make in the same turn, there were times however where i would hit once have an 85% hit chance and miss finishing my combo. i understand it can happen sometimes but it happened alot more than it probably should have. It made it more frustrating given the fact the enemy monster had the same attack pattern which never missed and then could also do a super attack every few turns made some of these duels long, repetitive and rather frustrating. I feel if the mecha combat was still a tile combat system where you fight in the city it could be made a lot more interesting, whats to say your viewer rating could go down based on the number of detroyed buildings via combat, or using the environment to your advantage. It would certainly make the currently bland mecha combat into something a bit more interesting. The story structure is set in a number of series in which the goal is to increase your fanbase and revenue by putting on an awesome show. You are also in charge of advertising and the studio which can be upgraded to help with the show. The idea of seperate series is great and makes the game into more bitesize chuncks that open up possibilities of extra content later on. With multiple endings the game does have replay value and the episodes in each season can be played in any order desired. The enemy designs are fantastic and some of the stories are great but perhaps more of a mixup with different scenarios would only benefit the game more, party members could be missing or sub objectives could be more diverse with perhaps saving civilians or dealing with environmental scenarios. This does happen sometimes but maybe not enough.\nThe soundtrack is a pleasure to listen to and keeps the tempo going. it plays very well along with the artistic style of the game.\n\nOverall the game is a great experience, especially if you are a power rangers/super sentai fan with some great story and combat design and an interesting yet simple upgrade system and tle based RPG combat. More diverse storylines and some work on the mecha battles would only do this game good! If they bring out more content as well this game could be played long into the future.\n\n","June 8, 2015","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a fan of sentai series, both american and japanese versions, and I see a lot of genuine love and effort put forth in the game to show off the themes, corny messages & jokes, and tropes that those shows fall into. With that, however, a love of those fanchises is felt through the effort and minor details scattered in the stages, dialogue, and backgrounds. For instance, the statue of JAKQ's 'Big One' in the convention stage or the reference to Doggie Kruger in one of the post-stage tweets. What about the game play? Well, it plays like the tactical RPGs I love (FF Tactics, Disgaea) while still have it's own take and original elements to it. I do wish there was a big more clarity in know what can and can't be done. For example, I didn't know until Episode 3 that I could customize more then the chest of my mech by clicking on the seperate parts. There are some small nuances in the game like that that take me out of the game for a moment as I may have spent my materials differently. Better explanation on fan or income conversion may be nice as well. Overall, I'm very happy with this game and pray the studio learn from this and make their next game bigger and better.","August 15, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you love the Power Rangers then this will be extra funny to you I bet. I loved the villain, loved the growth of the characters, I really just loved most of this game. They're are a few issues I have with it though for example it is annoying that if you loose your Assist member you loose 95% of all healing and can never revive anyone unles you Chromatize/power up, and the fact most of the NPC allies aren't seen or mentioned again was a little disapointing though I understood why.\nAll in all I really loved this game especially when I finished it and got to see the Villains 'dance' to the ending theme, kind of wished your squad was dancing during this as well to celebrate they're job well done but whatever.\nIf they make a sequel or DLC I am likely to buy it and I am not the biggest fan of PC gaming, but I would love to see if they keep this story going, have the timeline of this game alter the next, or if we get to see the current squad follow something like the power rangers with the changing of powers and rosters because it's mentioned in game that happened before.\nAgain really love this game and think it is at the least worth a try.","July 2, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One that kept in the spirit of sentai by parodying it, and at the same time, paying tribute to it. I've been following this game since Kickstarter, but only more recently got a chance to buy it with the Steam Sale.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it actually managed to exceed my expectations. Everything is controlled by mouse and things like the the teamwork mechanic and skills you can switch out are things I've seen in other games, but this is one of the better ones in recent memory. Teamwork is more than just an extra person to help you attack, you can also use teamwork to get to spaces much farther on the field and pull off specials using it. This really helped me when trying to accomplish the special requirements. The game never felt imbalanced, too, which is awesome because it's the easiest trap to fall in with strategy RPGs.\n\nWhen you start a new game, you're given the option of picking your team. While I wish there was more options for party members (DLC/Chroma Squad 2?), what characters they do have are very diverse and I think they have just a right amount of options for character selections. The plot itself is the exact same regardless of who you pick, so the main reason to do this is to decide your character's starting stats and which ones you would like to see for the rest of the game, which I really like a lot. The easy way out would have been to just always have them in the suit and choose their stats, or just have your five chosen for you. It even allows there to be a possible lesbian romance later on in the game depending on what gender you pick a certain ranger. Your main five are completely customizable.\n\nAs for the story itself, it's not like a mind blowing story or anything like that, but it does it's job of feeling like the power ranger/super sentai shows the game is based on. The end goal is defeating a big bad guy, and on the way, you defeat a ton of different monsters ranging from ridiculous to...well, more ridiculous. There's also trophies, multiple endings, storyline branches, and three difficulties to add some replay value.\n\nThere's one place this game falls flat for me, and I don't think it's major, because it only really started to bother me nearing the end. The humor in this game can be funny at times, and then at other times can get a little groan worthy with the memes. I don't mind a lot of the refernces. The non-comedic ones for sentai fans in the weapons/equipment/skills that referenced a bunch of different sentai series all made me smile when I realized the references, and certain jokes work really well. At one point, they reference the "What has science done" image with the Seagull with massive biceps, and jokes like that and the backstreet boys/lady gaga references work really well, but when it's just meme, after meme, after meme, it starts to get a little grating, not unlike being in the presence of an middle aged person who goes on Reddit.\n\nStill, I would recommend this to anybody looking for a fun and quirky little RPG. It's definitely worth the price. I still have two more ending paths and minor storyline branches to get, so I may update this in the future, but having just completed my first playthrough, I just wanted to share my thoughts on it.","July 2, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a turn based strategy, 2-D mech fighting, TV show simulator.\n\nThough, by the end of the 4th season (out of 5), money management ceases to exist because your set is bankrolled enough to fund the wildest expenditures with ease. Combat is also too easy, with some straight up OP characters and pants-on-head AI. The enemy will spread out it's attacks amongst your team rather than congregating together to fight a single weak enemy, thus losing is almost laughably hard.

Walter Scrubnut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derhollander/","222 products in account","For 15 or even 30 bones, you really can't do much better than Chroma Squad. Even if Power Rangers (or Super Sentai if you INSIST) isn't necessarily your jam, it hits all the right notes for making a good gaming experience through that Triple-A seems to have forgotten; It's fun. Fun. You remember that? You know, when you get giggles or smile? When you get drawn into the experience not because of the spectacle, but because the game directly involves you and lets you make it your own, that's how you make games fun.\n\nThrowing down on some details, here's some specifics of why it's already made my top ten for 2015 -\n\n-Turn-Based strategy, not RPG. Think XCOM: EU, but with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Power Rangers.\n\n-Customisation and upgrades for pretty much EVERYTHING.\n\n-Resource management that's more give-take than just your standard subtraction. It reminds me a lot of how the economy worked in Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries, a type of economy system I feel got left by the wayside in favour of simpler/easier things that don't add any weight to your decisions.\n\n-Crafting, a system that is notorious for earning my ire by basically being utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t roughly a million per-cent of the time, actually makes some sort of sense in how components are named/what goes into what. It's also not needlessly complicated, which is a gigantic tick in my "yes" box.\n\n-It's got good moments of humour in it. It's not a comedy game, per se, but it knows not to take itself too seriously, and the humour it employs has a nice spectrum, from subtle pointing out of tropes, tongue-in-cheek, to bad puns, to breaking the fourth wall, and even some nice.... "meta" moments.\n\n-The art is nicely done, and consistent. While I can't say I have any particular love for the "retro" style that just about every indie game is doing, this one has really nicely animated sprites with a lot of good character to them as well as fun and well-done environments.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're one of those indie-game wads that just can't get enough of retro-styled graphics, crafting and whatever, you should have already creamed your free-trade, locally sourced shorts just by looking at the game's trailer. But even if you're not, this is definitely a game worth playing if you just want to have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun playing games for once.","May 24, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also run a studio, purchasing upgrades, signing advertisement contracts, and crafting new gear for the rangers.

The animation is simplistic and minimized, but that's okay. This game oozes nostalgia, and coming off as "Mario Brothers-esque" is not an insult. Music and graphical interface are smooth, but some small issues have arisen with different computers. The biggest selling point is by far the writing; snark and self-referential humor make reading the dialogue part of the experience rather than a chore. As an added bonus, there is a fast forward option via pressing the enter key. It's one of the many little details that says this studio cares about the fan experience.\n\nThe only real downside I can think of is the menu system: clunky and no real way to make transitions between the various sub menus easier, but perhaps that is just the nature of a game that puts you in charge of so many details. That being said, the positives outweigh the negatives by several orders of magnitude.

I'm not a huge Power Ranger fan but this game drew my eyes quickly. I love the team based combat and the idea of a simulation of running your studio.\n\nI just finished making my first season of the series and now have an deacent size fan base. Also haveing a good company advertising for you is a major plus as you try to make your way through the seasons.Also lets you customize and craft items that you get after you kill enimies as well as customize your own Robot.\n\n(ARC SQUAD UNITE!!!) I highly recommend this game looking for a tatic style RPG/SIMULATOR then look no further I'm so happy I picked this game up and I will very willingly say this game could be the one your looking for. I rate this game 8/10 and I really think everyone thats intreasted in these genre's are in for a treat scoop it up and give it a shot!\n\n","May 5, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It harkens back to the good old days of watching power rangers as a kid!\nThe constant breaking of the 4th wall gives it that good old witty humor that I enjoy so much!\nThis story is a simple blend of comedy and silliness worthy of a Saturday morning cartoon. The gameplay is simplistic and the crafting element is simple yet satisfying when you finally craft like the ultra best gear. One problem though that I had at least in my experience is that crafting materials (especially the acryliac paint) can be very hard to get. I understand that you can buy boxes that contain these materials however it's hard to get/maintain the funds needed for these things.

To be able to make your own super powered team of stunt actors is a joy regardless of whether you're giving them serious or silly names.  The gameplay seemed relatively simple and they surely could have added a few more mechanics (an undo move option would have been VERY useful), but with what they had the game still worked fantastically.  The management aspect seemed rather easy, though my experience was on the normal difficulty setting, so I don't know what it's like on Challenging.  If you like management sims you'll probably learn the mechanics rather quickly and if you like turn based strategy RPGs then there's no reason not to give this a shot.

For such a simple game, it does give a sense of reward after each "episode" for doing the directors instructions perfectly. The boss fights are interesting and do provide a nice change of pace.

The games story and graphics are fantastic. Upgrading is satisfying and also takes a lot of thinking. Combat takes strategy and is near flawless, for the most part aside from the Mech battles difficulty spike.\n\nLengthy-er Review: Combat is great, it takes a lot of strategy of what combinations of teamwork, and skills to boost your audience meter. The game lets you customize what your squads name is, transforming motto, and actor names. This makes the game feel way more your own and adds a lot of depth. The story is silly and over-the-top enough to feel very Sentai-like. The "hub" where you buy upgrades and items is another fantastic aspect of the game. Buying new items and mech parts, along with buying new marketers who can bring you special benefits depending on which person you sign a contract with. Replying to fan emails was also a joy to do. Now onto the cons. Mech fights are incredibly challenging even on normal mode, it took me NUMEROUS times to defeat most makes in the final 2 seasons. Mech fights also lack strategy and ends up mostly being dependent on luck. For example, for each punch you start off around 90% chance to hit, then goes down to around 80% for the next punch, and so on. Problem is healing skills require you to get around a 4x combo of punches to do any real healing, and so does the +Def move. It is nearly impossible to get consistent 4x combo, myself rarely even getting 3x combos. Even with that decent sized flaw it doesn't take away too much from the game, it is still fantastic and charming. All the pro's easily out weigh the cons.\nRating: 9/10\n","May 27, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Walter Scrubnut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derhollander/","222 products in account","For 15 or even 30 bones, you really can't do much better than Chroma Squad. Even if Power Rangers (or Super Sentai if you INSIST) isn't necessarily your jam, it hits all the right notes for making a good gaming experience through that Triple-A seems to have forgotten; It's fun. Fun. You remember that? You know, when you get giggles or smile? When you get drawn into the experience not because of the spectacle, but because the game directly involves you and lets you make it your own, that's how you make games fun.\n\nThrowing down on some details, here's some specifics of why it's already made my top ten for 2015 -\n\n-Turn-Based strategy, not RPG. Think XCOM: EU, but with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Power Rangers.\n\n-Customisation and upgrades for pretty much EVERYTHING.\n\n-Resource management that's more give-take than just your standard subtraction. It reminds me a lot of how the economy worked in Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries, a type of economy system I feel got left by the wayside in favour of simpler/easier things that don't add any weight to your decisions.\n\n-Crafting, a system that is notorious for earning my ire by basically being utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t roughly a million per-cent of the time, actually makes some sort of sense in how components are named/what goes into what. It's also not needlessly complicated, which is a gigantic tick in my "yes" box.\n\n-It's got good moments of humour in it. It's not a comedy game, per se, but it knows not to take itself too seriously, and the humour it employs has a nice spectrum, from subtle pointing out of tropes, tongue-in-cheek, to bad puns, to breaking the fourth wall, and even some nice.... "meta" moments.\n\n-The art is nicely done, and consistent. While I can't say I have any particular love for the "retro" style that just about every indie game is doing, this one has really nicely animated sprites with a lot of good character to them as well as fun and well-done environments.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're one of those indie-game wads that just can't get enough of retro-styled graphics, crafting and whatever, you should have already creamed your free-trade, locally sourced shorts just by looking at the game's trailer. But even if you're not, this is definitely a game worth playing if you just want to have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun playing games for once.","May 24, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you love the Power Rangers then this will be extra funny to you I bet. I loved the villain, loved the growth of the characters, I really just loved most of this game. They're are a few issues I have with it though for example it is annoying that if you loose your Assist member you loose 95% of all healing and can never revive anyone unles you Chromatize/power up, and the fact most of the NPC allies aren't seen or mentioned again was a little disapointing though I understood why.\nAll in all I really loved this game especially when I finished it and got to see the Villains 'dance' to the ending theme, kind of wished your squad was dancing during this as well to celebrate they're job well done but whatever.\nIf they make a sequel or DLC I am likely to buy it and I am not the biggest fan of PC gaming, but I would love to see if they keep this story going, have the timeline of this game alter the next, or if we get to see the current squad follow something like the power rangers with the changing of powers and rosters because it's mentioned in game that happened before.\nAgain really love this game and think it is at the least worth a try.","July 2, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The animation is simplistic and minimized, but that's okay. This game oozes nostalgia, and coming off as "Mario Brothers-esque" is not an insult. Music and graphical interface are smooth, but some small issues have arisen with different computers. The biggest selling point is by far the writing; snark and self-referential humor make reading the dialogue part of the experience rather than a chore. As an added bonus, there is a fast forward option via pressing the enter key. It's one of the many little details that says this studio cares about the fan experience.\n\nThe only real downside I can think of is the menu system: clunky and no real way to make transitions between the various sub menus easier, but perhaps that is just the nature of a game that puts you in charge of so many details. That being said, the positives outweigh the negatives by several orders of magnitude.

It's a turn based strategy, 2-D mech fighting, TV show simulator.\n\nThough, by the end of the 4th season (out of 5), money management ceases to exist because your set is bankrolled enough to fund the wildest expenditures with ease. Combat is also too easy, with some straight up OP characters and pants-on-head AI. The enemy will spread out it's attacks amongst your team rather than congregating together to fight a single weak enemy, thus losing is almost laughably hard.

I had to take some time out today to write a review for Chroma Squad, though, because this game is pure awesome. This game is a 75 on metacritic and thats a clear under-rating.\n\nYes, I'll acknowledge that Power Rangers/tokusatsu fanboyism is strong within my heart, but you do NOT have to love Power Rangers to love this game. If you can appreciate a creative tactical RPG with fun, geeky dialogue and story lines, you'll be happy with whatever they are charging for this nowadays. Oh, and choices matter!\n\nGameplay\nThe combat system is inventive and really lets the player decide how the battles will go. It's not very complicated, but its still satisfying. Think X-com. You can play with a very basic, methodical approach to the fights, or you can open up and fully utilize all the various weapons/skills in the game. Each of the characters has a particular specialty (like most RPGs) and sunergy is key. Between fights, you'll work on upgrading your characters, equipment, base; this aspect of the game isn't particularly deep, but the developer has adjusted to make it more interesting, in terms of viable options. I would say the Mecha fights are lame, however; good thing there isn't really many of them.\n\nGraphics/Music\nI'm not really a fan of pixel graphics and all that, but many people seem to love the pixel art. These are easy to judge for yourself. For this type of game, the graphics aren't important to me. But to be honest, if the game wasn't so much fun, I would probably complain about the character models. I think the environments looks pretty great, though.\n\nThe music is pure excellence if you are looking for a fully immersive experience. I tend to turn off music on games and listen to my own stuff, but this is one of the few games that I rolled through using the actual game music.\n\nStory\nIf you are a Sentai/Power Rangers fan in search of nostalgia, you don't even need this section- it's epic.\nIf you are not as obsessed with sentai as myself, you will still enjoy the hilarious dialogue and story overall. There are some complaints in this aspect because of the imperfect English (dudes are Brazilian), and also because some of the jokes are dated internet-meme jokes, so if that would annoy you then I suppose you'll need to skip through some dialogue? People who complain about the dialogue have maybe forgotten what the dialogue was like in the shows this is modeled after. The plot will surprise you, even if you don't care about sentai at all.\n\n\nTLDR\nSimplified X-com + Power Rangers + loads of content + multiple storylines = FREAKING AMAZING\n\n\nBest $15 I have spent this year, and I'm about to buy gift copies for some friends even if they don't wana play it.","June 30, 2015","true","94.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMightyKamina/recommended/251130/","TheMightyKamina","Kumatora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMightyKamina/","136 products in account","As a huge toku fanboy, I was excited to see a video game based on Super Sentai. One that kept in the spirit of sentai by parodying it, and at the same time, paying tribute to it. I've been following this game since Kickstarter, but only more recently got a chance to buy it with the Steam Sale.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it actually managed to exceed my expectations. Everything is controlled by mouse and things like the the teamwork mechanic and skills you can switch out are things I've seen in other games, but this is one of the better ones in recent memory. Teamwork is more than just an extra person to help you attack, you can also use teamwork to get to spaces much farther on the field and pull off specials using it. This really helped me when trying to accomplish the special requirements. The game never felt imbalanced, too, which is awesome because it's the easiest trap to fall in with strategy RPGs.\n\nWhen you start a new game, you're given the option of picking your team. While I wish there was more options for party members (DLC/Chroma Squad 2?), what characters they do have are very diverse and I think they have just a right amount of options for character selections. The plot itself is the exact same regardless of who you pick, so the main reason to do this is to decide your character's starting stats and which ones you would like to see for the rest of the game, which I really like a lot. The easy way out would have been to just always have them in the suit and choose their stats, or just have your five chosen for you. It even allows there to be a possible lesbian romance later on in the game depending on what gender you pick a certain ranger. Your main five are completely customizable.\n\nAs for the story itself, it's not like a mind blowing story or anything like that, but it does it's job of feeling like the power ranger/super sentai shows the game is based on. The end goal is defeating a big bad guy, and on the way, you defeat a ton of different monsters ranging from ridiculous to...well, more ridiculous. There's also trophies, multiple endings, storyline branches, and three difficulties to add some replay value.\n\nThere's one place this game falls flat for me, and I don't think it's major, because it only really started to bother me nearing the end. The humor in this game can be funny at times, and then at other times can get a little groan worthy with the memes. I don't mind a lot of the refernces. The non-comedic ones for sentai fans in the weapons/equipment/skills that referenced a bunch of different sentai series all made me smile when I realized the references, and certain jokes work really well. At one point, they reference the "What has science done" image with the Seagull with massive biceps, and jokes like that and the backstreet boys/lady gaga references work really well, but when it's just meme, after meme, after meme, it starts to get a little grating, not unlike being in the presence of an middle aged person who goes on Reddit.\n\nStill, I would recommend this to anybody looking for a fun and quirky little RPG. It's definitely worth the price. I still have two more ending paths and minor storyline branches to get, so I may update this in the future, but having just completed my first playthrough, I just wanted to share my thoughts on it.","July 2, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wait, you do? Well... alright then.\n\nPros:\n+The dialouge: It's just amazing how many jokes they can state considering the setting is litterally being an indie studio group filming power rangers.\n\n+Stradegy: There's a good amount of it. I'm basing it off of just finishing Season 1, but basically you are given director tasks to appease audience, such as defeating X amount of Y monsters in Z amount of turns, or pulling off finishers on bosses which are very satisfying (when you Chromatize)\n\n+ THE MUSIC: My lord is this the best soundtrack I've heard in a long time. Kudos to the music makers for making such an amazing soundtrack (looking at you A little break from saving the world)\n\n+ Graphics: The graphics is a very vast and colorful pixelated style, and it's very appeasing to the eyes\n\n+ Fan System: Considering it's about an indie group trying to run a show, fans play a major role. They determine how much money you get, and that money goes to upgrading equipment which is the only way (as far as I can tell) to increase your stats.\n\nCons:\n-Crafting Equipment: I'm not knocking off the crafting system, I like it. The only thing that pesters me is that you don't get to see the stat increase or decrease until after you craft it, and once you craft it, you have to hope it does increases with hopefully small decrease in other stats, otherwise you have to recycle it and so far my rng of recycling has been pretty poop.\n\n-Options Menu: Totalbiscuit would probably sue me for doing this since that's his thing.. but the option system is kind of lacking. Sure the requirements would allow even my pc which is viewed as being powered by a potatoe could play it, but the resolutions are kind of hard to navigate and change.. for some reason, you have to let the game go full screen, change the resolution (for me I had to click alot to figure out how to make the slider work), then uncheck full screen, and then it'll save the resolution you want (though for those that play full screen all the time it might not be a problem). But hey at least it has a seperate audio slider for both volume and sfx. ^^\n\nThat's about it. The cool thing is that the company is now doing the long task of fixing many bugs... so it's good that they'll keep updating this game. Heck there's even a button to report bugs. So because of that, so will this reveiw if more changes for the better (or worst) occurs.","July 19, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You may be wondering: Why would you hate this game? Well it's not the power ranger theme cause i loved the show when i was a kid; no it's the fact i hate, and i mean "hate with a burning passion that wishes the genre to die out and never return" hate, tile based stratagy games...but when i played this...when i started playing Chroma Squad...something was VERY different. The fights never over stay their welcome in the easy mode, the challenge of the higher difficulties are fairly noticable (though they need to stop fixing what was already a good game), and it's just fun to make up your own power rangers team name and special lines. the upgrading system is all based on the items you buy or craft so you be really tanky or deal ALL the damage. my only issue is the craftable armours and weapons aren't as good as the shop items thanks to RNG-ness deciding if the weapon has an attack buff at all and lator shop items tend to be weaker in weapon but not in attack base making more about using your basic attack then anything else but it's sad saying even THAT is better then hoping to get a good weapon via craft...

For example in one of the later levels I had to kill the boss with a certain character ("A") - 4 of the 6 team members were knocked out, the 2 survivors only had a few points of health left and were surrounded by powerful enemies - but the medic was *just* able to run inbetween A and the boss, so that A could leapfrog across the screen and give the boss one last punch, which was enough to win. The game is entirely set-piece scenarios, but the whole thing was like that: if someone scores a critical hit in a round all the tactics have to adapt. The other good thing is that the combat system rewards you for using sentai-hero logic, rather than X-Com logic. It's not about finding a weakness and exploting it, it's about trying and failing and returning again in a stronger form.\n\nThere are some downsides. Only 1 gamesave. There aren't any random levels which I think is quite a bold decision: the bosses and stage layouts are little works of art: I can see that just bashing randomly-placed waves of minions would get dull. But I'd still have liked to try it - some games have a horde mode where you survive as long as possible, even if it didn't work in practice it would have made me appreciate the scripting more, I think.\n\nA side effect of everything being tightly scripted (except what actually happens in a battle) is that you can't build up or replenish resources (money and crafting materials) so if you wanted to go back and try a different character build then you couldn't (not that there are many, it isn't RPG-ish, just that you can select a couple of types of equipment for each of the 5-6 set characters). The writing is a bit odd: the overarching plot is somehow *even more* disjointed than Power Rangers, and they have tried to make *every* *single* *line* into a joke: but the layer of abstraction inbetween and the way they set each episode up to satirize the genre is ingenious - almost worthy of Charlie Kaufman at points. The stunt actors are on the way to film a scene, but monsters kidnap one of them, and when the others rescue her the first thing they ask is whether she has brought any food back (on the story's logic she was off the set).\n\nThe mecha battles are both disappointing and an excellent rendition of kaiju battles. Round 1: you win. Round 2: they win. Round 3: it's really close but you power attack charges up again just in the nick of time. The mecha's abilities upgrade, the monsters' abilities change, but the traditional pattern is honoured. They're only short, so it isn't annoying - but a tiny bit more mechanics wouldn't have gone amiss like choosing which weapons to take into which fights. In a real super-robot series they would have occasionally had the kindly scientist invent a jetpack so it could fight a flying monster, or something - just for variety.\n\nOverall great fun though.","July 18, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am gonna explain with a couple of keywords what kind of game this is (for those who are considering to buy Chroma Squad):\n\n- Tactical RPG, the tactical form in this game is centered in how you skill your characters (more than positioning).\n- Mech fights, YES MECHS.\n- Game time, I completed the game in 20 hours.\n- Difficulties, there is easy, interesting and challenging. Hardest difficulty is a real ♥♥♥♥♥!\n- Managing, beside the tactical RPG side of the game, you need to manage your characters by crafting, teching their skills, upgrading your mech, marketing, responding to e-mail where choices matter (not heavily), upgrading your studio and buying items.\n- Achievements, well done compared to most indie games.\n- Comedy & awesomeness, this game gave me laughs and goosebumps. Comedy is based on parodies of modern memes, Power Rangers and other silly stuff. I got goosebumps in the final fight, where I just got blown away by the story and momentum of it.\n- Story is well done and original.\n\nTL:DR\nChroma squad is an original indie game which has two sides of gameplay: tactical RPG and managing your party. The story is wel done and takes around 15+ hours to complete. I had ALOT OF FUN completing this game and I am happy I bought it.

Having team work and acrobatics effect audience levels was an interesting mechanic that allowed to the player to decide on how much of either to do to maximize the attendance to gain more fans/money per episode. The attendance machanic in general seemed a bit easy to abuse to an extent, should have a negative factor if either is overly used.\n\nHaving different characters to choose from at the beginning for each role is a really nice touch. It allowed to add in variety to characters with the abilities that affected the gameplay. This allows the player to choose how they would like to play their games, and not have a stagnant gameplay with fixed characters for the storyline only.\n\nStoryline progressed at a decent pace and was well thought out in respect to what Tokusatsu's usually revolved around. But also adding in a bit of flare by blurring reality with fiction.\n\nOne thing that was unimpressive after a few levels would be the minion's designs. During a level that had a Boss Mob, could have had the minion's designs centered around that particular Boss in the later stages. It's understandable at the beginning since it is representing the beginning stages of a starter company.","July 11, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

FWIW I think they did a great job of having consistent high-quality pixel art.\nThe sound track is great too!\nStory is good, has multiple endings (and the game play is good enough to go through and get them all), good humor, and if you are there just for the tactics, there is a fast-forward though the dialogue.\nGame play is excellent.\nWhen I first recieved this game my expectations were that it would be good, but not great, but I figured I might as well give it a try, since I got it.  My intent was to play for just half an hour before bed, since I had to get up early the next day.  The next time i had bothered to look at a clock, nearly four hours had passed. I'll take the old addage about time flying as objective evidence that the game is fun as heck. Since building my new gaming rig, I have actually played it more than any other game.\nThe game is not perfect.  I have encounted a few bugs (nothing that made it crash, and any complicated software will end up with at least one small bug.)\nThe games i play over multiple times is limited, this one easily made the short list.\nYou don't have to be a fan of any of the tv shows that inspired the game, or particularly fond of turnbased strategy games to find the game enjoyable.\nThe hard difficuly offers a challenge and rewards a strategical approach, medium is more forgiving. It is a game that i think is accessible to a wide audience.

It oozes so much personality and it manages to both pay tribute to and satirize the super sentai genre and all sorts of other aspects of pop culture. It's a product of deep love and understanding of an entire subculture that most of us are barely aware of but the passion placed behind it transcends the limit of your knowledge and even personal taste to the point where it is impossible not to appreciate what you're seeing before your eyes.\n\nThe only reason not to play this game is if you really dislike turn based tactical combat.
