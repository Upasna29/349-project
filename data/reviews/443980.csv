They mixed SAO, Minecraft, and fanservice in order to attract the demographic of ecchi anime gamers. Sometimes it looks like they literally ripped Minecraft screenshots to put in the game.\n\nArt isn't bad, but is sometimes inconsistent since they use at least three artists and their styles are sometimes not consistent with each other. This is especially true in the colouring and shading. If you're bothered by this, it will probably throw you off, though I only saw it happen once in the time I played. Also, you are not going to see anybody with less than a DD bust in this game, unless it's literally the MC's mom. If you want variety, this isn't the place for you.\n\nThere is nothing special about the story since it's just a vehicle to get you to the boobs. The writing is sometimes awkward, and there are more adjectives for things than you can shake your purple prose bible at. I will give them props for having some creativity with the world (literally called Burokku) though they mostly used Minecraft elements to justify it.\n\nI am not usually into ecchi, but I do like ecchi with good stories or comedic writing. In this case, this was just not for me. But if you're part of the aforementioned demographic and are OK with just going for the fanservice, give it a go.\n\nEdit: In case you guys want a preview of what the game looks like, I did a playthrough of the first half of the game. https://youtu.be/kJthKFXPPFA","February 19","false","1.9"," 47 of 62 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","47","62","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kesseki/recommended/443980/","kesseki","Kesseki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kesseki/","477 products in account","Burokku Girls is a visual novel about breasts. As the story goes, you’re a young man trying out your genius father’s ultra-immersive VR simulator. Absolutely nothing happens, and you go home.\n\nThat would actually be more surprising than what really happens, which is that you get sucked into the game itself with no way to return home. Within minutes you’re tripping over some big-boobed warrior lady and being attacked by fireball slinging mind-controlled minions. There’s a PLOT that involves some women from beneath the ground who are trying to take over the world, and it does get surprisingly dark at times. The writing was decent most times but occasionally plodded along with humdrum details and dialogue. You probably aren’t here for the writing. There are a bevvy of characters, including aforementioned warrior lady, flirtatious bunny girl with magic powers that defy explanation, and some kind of tsundere Senran Kagura escapee. There are just a few choices to make throughout the story, so you're going to need a hand free at some points to actually pick one.\n\nSome of the CGs look a little wonky, but the art is generally clean and well done. I cannot believe I’m actually seriously reviewing this. Sometimes I felt that the Minecraft-esque blocky backgrounds were too different stylistically from the otherwise colorful art. There is also no nudity, but that never stopped me from enjoying myself before. Yes, you could see more with a google search but that’s not the POINT, okay?\n\nAs for the music, the game cycles through a handful of tracks that are forgettable for the most part, although I really liked one or two of them. At the very least there's nothing here so offensive to the eardrum as to reduce my opinion of Burokku Girls.\n\nThe ending is a cliffhanger, which is to be expected (according to my friend who is a fan of Silver Cow Studio games and big boobs in general), but I felt like things were just getting interesting.\nI’m recommending it on the basis that if you know what this is and it still sounds appealing, you’ll like it.\nShort version: Breasts. You have to scroll through useless text but there are breasts. Loli lovers stay hatin'.\n\nFor everyone contemplating a purchase just on its merits as a VN, it's pretty average.\n\nI'm going to give it a thumbs up and suffer the judgement of people on my friend's list. Is it to late to say I only idled for the cards?\n","April 8","true","8.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","19","23","9","4"

O.k. Now to be flamed for this being the nature of the game. But seriously, I played thought all the story lines, followed up and thought I would give people some help on what to expect.\n\nFirst of all the screenshots say it all. If your expecting some hidden Lolicon or something. Sorry, this game is pretty much a minecrafty looking world with giant chested women. Yeah, long and short of it. Sorry. So if your not looking for this, well stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing.\n\nThe nudity is pretty lack luster, and this is just your not about to get a hard core sex novel or that. Really the novel seems like causal hearted fun.\n\nFirst the story, Yeah. It does seem like every video game and anime about entering a video game ever. The nice thing is, the main character is aware and pokes fun at this at points. So it makes it enjoyable to know it is self aware. The characters are interesting for there own points, and while short. The story was enjoyable. More reading like an animated book then a multi-choice adventure. The art is decent to pretty good mattering your taste. Though the feel can give you that first game vibe. (It gave me it.) It is well put together. Compared to others I have seen with disjointed story or really just trying to be a money grab. It does seem the team behind there did have care in there product.\n\nSecond, It is short. It almost feels incomplete at the end. Now if this will be patched or lead into a sequel will come to point. I would look forward to this continuing being the story is light hearted and fun. I mean it is dark at points, but what good story isn't. Once again, this feel to me like a group trying to get on there feet. They want to show a product and move on to make it more. Which I would hope this does take off. The emotions into the story are enjoyable, and even though a lot of people contest it, saying it is Flat or empty. I did take the time to go though all the paths and really, It seemed someone had love in the project.\n\nSo the question of should you buy it. Well I can cover this in simple. If you beleive the product is good and you want to support future installment, buy it at full price.\n\nIf your in the following list. Well then wait for the sale.\nYour a fan of breast sizes over a D cup.\nYour looking for something enjoyable to spend an afternoon with.\nYour more a fan of Ecchi then Hentai.\nYou like the idea of self aware stories that involve entering a gaming world.\nYou like to look deeper into the lore of the story and question how the world works.\nNeed to get your boyfriend something, becuase you missed Valentine's Day.\n\nIf your in this list, you should avoid this... or if you know someone in this following list that loves visual novels. Buy it for them to troll them.\n\nYou like long deep stories that you can spend hours on.\nYour looking for an endless amount of paths and choices to control your journey through the story.\nYour a lolicon fan / hate abnormally large breasts.\nIf your looking for a triple A novel that has millions to blow on a game.\n\nAll in all, I would say give it a chance. It takes about 3 hours plus to clear everything if you save in the right spots.  It is pretty nice to just sit back and have the laugh. Dawn is pretty good dynamic for Asahi, and I do find it laughable that it seems no one can balance in the story. Though just read it for yourself. I think if you fit in the audiance this is for, this will be enjoyable. If your not, you will probably feel offended and right a bad review but really. It's a nice casual story, don't take it serious and have a good time.","February 22","true","3.6"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","19","31","2","0"

The art is generally nice, though inconsistent. Music is surprisingly pleasant. Story is generic and honestly kind of dull. Easily the biggest problem with this game is the pacing, which is incredibly, painfully slow. There is also no option to skip previously read text.\n\nIf you are a die-hard fan of ecchi or girls with very large breasts, wait until the game goes on sale or is featured in a bundle. Otherwise don't bother, there really isn't anything else to see, and at full price even for a fan of this type of game I would not recommend dropping nine dollars on it.","February 21","false","10.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

They will be shoved in your face all the time.  Your character will inadvertantly grope every single one at some point, or have his face mashed in the middle.  All the time.  At least twice per character.  There is some plot reason behind why they're so massive, but it's left down to maybe two lines and dropped for the rest of the game.\n\nThe VN is very linear, with only two "branches" that I saw.  I'm sure the first one had no effect on the story, and the second just changes your ending.\n\nThe writing itself isn't actually that bad.  They took a Minecraft-esque world and made it believable, with characters that live in it.  The MC gets an eleventh hour super power that is actually pretty cool and actually frightens half of the good guys that see him use it.\n\nThe downside is actually what the developers focused on too heavily.  The sex appeal.  Yea, you're going to draw in crowds with it, but the Sakura series already took care of that.  Nobody really wants giant mammaries all over the place.  Had the chesticles not been such a focal point, with writer spending more time fleshing out plotlines than describing a pair of breats in two paragraphs, it would've turned out much better.","February 19","false","2.2"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","13","27","2","1"

The art style is nice (I believe there’s more than one artist involved, so NOT ALL sprites have the same quality… Some are good/decent and others are kind of awkward). BG was great, and BGM was really nice, although very short/limited.\n\n4/10, I gave one extra point because of the “bouncing” effect. That made me laugh so much, I think I cried a little.

The cons HEAVILY outweigh the pros. Sorry, not sorry.\nGoing to start here with the /PROS/ of the game:\n-The game does very well with relating to the expected audience(even though I'm not an 18 year old male). Story begins very casual and makes it so the player can feel they are in the place of the main character.\n-The art was rather impressive! I had my eyes glued to the characters due to the suppleness of skin and the nicely exaggerated body parts. 10/10 in this department. Background was also very interesting to look at! Wasn't the typical background you'd see in most sims these days. Backgrounds actually had character! (which is RARE)\n-That "boing" noise that is often accompanied by anime ♥♥♥♥♥ bounce animation\n\nNow for the /CONS/:\n-The storyline was painfully boring. It was generic and predictable. Not only that, the story moves at a snail's pace. Every 5-10 min in-game I'd exit window just to look at something else or else I would have went crazy!\n-Story literally had two times where a choice can be made.... LITERALLY TWO TIMES. I'm not here to read stories. I could literally go to AO3 for that for FREE.\n-Game was ridiculously short.\n-Characters were dull and not memorable whatsoever. All i remember is dynamite-in-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ girl.\n-Art was Impressive ONLY at certain parts. I was only impressed when you are first introduced to them but the rest is rather... lacking. It's apparent that there was more than one artist enlisted because the art would go from a 10 to a 1 then to a 5 then back to a 10. Along with that, I noticed some rather poor background editing. I get that you copy and paste the minecraft trees but at least dont overlap the closer trees with farther trees. This is not lack of knowledge, it's just plain lazy.\n-A lot of things went unexplained in game and I was honestly so bored of the story that I could care less about the 'What Ifs'\n\nI reeeeaally tried giving this game a chance. I really did. It had a lot of potential but was just put together very poorly.\nI gave this game 30 solid minutes before I played this ♥♥♥♥ like cookie clicker. I'll admit, I'm a very impatient person but it does not take a lot to impress me. Of course, the big anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ were a huge plus but everything else killed it for me.\nI would not recommend this game to anyone.","February 20","false","7.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","0"

This confuses me, since Time Tenshi's cliffhanger ending still hasn't been resolved with the sequel yet, but what can you do, right? If you haven't played Time Tenshi, the basic gist of these games is a focus on a deep "plot" and "well-developed" characters, by which I mean "great big gazongas". The actual storylines aren't bad, but at times they feel like more of a conveyor belt for floppy funbags, and it's safe to say that if you're not buying it for the sweater puppies you might want to look elsewhere. I didn't really like the story of Burokku Girls as much as I did Time Tenshi, but it was still decent outside of the occasional moment where it fell too deep into anime cliche. This game is notably darker than Time Tenshi, however, which might be off-putting for people just looking for a good wank. But the real question is, does it end on a cliffhanger like Time Tenshi?
