"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/345640/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4010 products in account","What is Block Legend DX?\n\nWell, wrong question. The question rather is, what is it not? And the answer here is: "A motivating RPG". And that could be so easy to change...\n\nBlock Legend DX is a "match 2" RPG. On your grid of 7x7 squares you click on blocks to remove them, where two or more similar blocks next to each other can only be clicked. Now I am only around half an hour in, but got bored with this.\nAround that is some kind of RPG, or rather a fighting and leveling simulation. There is no story that is in any way necessary to enjoy the game. Sure, I don't play Skyrim for the story either, and still would recommend it wholeheartedly, but Block Legend DX has not enough variety here.\n\nThe graphics are held in an 8 bit style or early 16 bit style, but clearly distinguishable as retro styled by having several modern elements to them. This can be seen on the screenshots on the store page.\nThe music is fine, but not memorable.\n\nSo let us come to the gameplay itself. With the match 2 gameplay you run your hero or heroine through various levels automatically, use the elements on the 7x7 board to attack enemies, rarely make any choices that go beyond the immediate situation. Yes, it is zen-like in the regard that you live absolutely at the current moment. But this is also where the game fails to deliver: You get not enough rewards to keep you motivated. You collect some stars that you can invest for future runs, but only into items you found on your runs. Also, each time you die your hero is reset to zero. This would not even be an issue if there was any way to prevent your death by grinding or something, but there is not. I would rather call this a match 2 roguelike than an RPG, and that is only if you imagine a Rogue where you progress automatically and have almost no strategy involved.\nWhen you get to a battle, you have a certain amount of turns before your opposing creature deals damage. There is no variety in that damage either, it is on a per creature base. Now that is fine, but I would rather have seen something more RPG like. Maybe not necessarily something even more random like critical hits, but varied enemy behavior. For example there could be an enemy that comes first and runs away but yields high experience if you manage to kill it, just like those blocks in Lufia II. Or maybe some enemy that heals itself completely once per battle at the expense of 2 or 3 of his future attacks. Or, or, or.\n\nThen what could be done to make the game motivating? Well, easy: Let the characters become stronger permanently as you play. When I beat the first level, let me get some weapon or armor I can equip, etc. Just let there be ANY form of progression that makes you feel like "Hey, I played this for 15 minutes, I died, my character is back to the beginning but now I start at least with an additional shield if I pay those 3 stars prior to my run."\nStars are gained very easily, but without much to spend them on after the half hour I played - only a drink that helps me for 2 or 3 rounds - it feels like senseless grinding already.\n\nSo what remains in the end is a nice basic concept for a game that has some potential but does not use it. Too bad, Block Legend DX could have been something as enjoyable as 10,000,000. The almost complete lack of persistent progression as well as the partially high difficulty make this game unfortunately one that I can not recommend picking up. Since the fixes are so easy, one can only hope for a patch with a free addon, maybe as a separate game mode even, that gets rid of the complaints I have. If that is implemented, it could be worth even the asking price. Until then, either wait for a cheap sale or for another bundle with it.\n\n-----\n[CORRECTION BY A READER:\nbaddog993 5 hours ago\nUm you do get to keep whatever you buy. It does costs stars but it is their. So if you get a potion you can buy it the next time you play. Its the third screen where it says none 2 times.

Didn't work.\n\nThere's barely any strategy involved beyond "Oh gee, better click some hearts/shields now".\nOnly having to match 2 and not swapping/pushing but merely destroying them doesn't help.\n\nThe RPG aspect is there on the surface, kinda. You level up and some other numbers increase. Nothing you'd actually\nnotice when playing. From what I can see, you don't get anything else when leveling up apart from your stats increasing.\n\nApparently, no story to tie this together. Pick a character, pick a location, go click around in this big square for half an hour or until you finally get bored. Nothing more to it, really. The most exiting thing is getting to to the shop, too bad he only sells buffs that really don't alter your play-style or stats beyond 1-5 rounds of play. (And even then, they barely do.)\n\nAnd in the end, it's still a mobile game where you have to unlock stuff by getting premium currency, only that you now can't buy the premium currency.

The strength coming from those tiles is important, as is managing your field of play, due to the field carrying over to the next battle and for experience gain. Do I go for experience gain when those same tiles become attack tiles in the next fight? There's a lot of strategy under the hood here, and will a bunch of unlockables and different enemies, the sameness of the puzzle mechanics is able to hold up over a period of time. Reasonable fun, even if it's got a mobile counterpart. You may want to look if the mobile counterpart is worth your time, but this apparently has got improvements over the mobile version including boss rush/battle modes, and I can't argue that.

From Tetris to Adventure of Lolo to Talos Principle to Tetris Attack to Yoshi's Cookies to Puzzle Quest to Monkey Island. I love puzzle games from PC to console to mobile platforms. I've played more than I can count.\n\nNow, I own this game on both Windows Phone and Steam so don't let my play time fool you. Also, the Windows Phone version has beem broken for months with no update in site.\n\nWith all that out of the way, I can say that this game is just not fun. There are two elements to this game and I will cover them in the following two paragraphs. Those elements are "RPG" and "puzzle". Frankly, neither work and I will explain why.\n\nThe RPG elements are bare bones and might as well not exist. Im not just talking about the experience and leveling system either. I'm talk about the entire "RPG" experience that's presented here. The story is non-existent.. literally. There is no dialog or NPC interaction besides stores. No, you can't buy weapons or armor or accessories either. You fight monsters in random battles but there is no depth to the monsters. There's no elemental element or monsters that are weak against such and such. Nothing. In fact, you will almost never even take your eyes off of the puzzle field to look at the monster. You CAN level up and when you do so, you get one point you can put towards your stats and that's really the only RPG element you will experience to any meaningful degree in this game.\n\nThe actual puzzle game is another barebones mediocre experience. I thought about writing a huge paragraph here detailing why the puzzle aspect of this game doesn't work and I really thought about comparing this game to some of the greats like Tetris Attack or Puzzle Quest but then I realized I can sum up the entire puzzle experience. All you do in this game is click blocks. You don't get to manipulate the board like in Puzzle Quest or Tetris Attack and you don't need to plan your moves and think ahead like in Tetris, Puyo Puyo, or Super Puzzle Fighter. Do you see two of the same blocks next to eachother? Click them. What next? Hope the blocks that spawn in, spawn in your favor. That's it. It's a surprisingly empty experience. Fighting monsters means clicking sword blocks or magic blocks as they appear and fighting bosses means clicking any blocks as fast as possible. You'll generally lose on boss fights because you take more damage faster than the right blocks can spawn in.\n\nIt's a hollow and utterly pointless experience. No aspect of this game feels competent enough to keep your attention. I really really REALLY wanted to enjoy this game. This game should have been made by looking through the DECADES of puzzle games we have and influences should have been taken from a dozen games. The reality is that what we have here is a game that feels like a mobile game that came from 2004; like something you would have played on your Razer phone.\n\nI'm sorry for my harsh review but I really wanted this game to be good.","March 8, 2015","false","4.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

It has the potential to be a great little casual puzzle game, but it's not quite there. While the unlockable characters satisfy a decent variety of play styles, it's not worth starting off with set weapons and items most of the time, especially since they can be randomly picked up at shops without having to spend precious star blocks. The difficulty curve is also unforgiving as opposed to challenging, plus the game has been noticeably buggy since launch (and a few of the biggest issues have gone unfixed to this day).\n\nProtip: if you're a Mac user running 10.7.5 or older, avoid this like the plague if you don't want the game to crash on you all. the. time, which is has been doing to me since the most recent patch, all the way back in May.

Games like 10,000,000 or You must build a boat but in a tactical and slower pace.\n\nCompared to those 2 games where you need to be fast, In Block Legend DX, you must carefully maintain your board so you  have something to use or don't get stuck especially for the final boss. Another difference is this game is also a rouge-like, so when you die, you're going to start a new game. You grind for the star blocks which is the only currency in-game, it is used for everything like:\n\n- Character unlock\n- Dungeon/Place unlock\n- Starting Item and consumable\n\nWhat I don't really like is the third one, having to pay for the starting item and consumable. Not only you need to grind for unlocks, it makes the grind slower if you opted to bring a starting item/weapon.\n\nI really like the idea in this game, also the difficulty is ok to me since you actually need to think rather than using your reflexes. You need to actually prioritize stats, and not do a jack of all trades build, but the progression kills it for me. Too grindy and that cost for the starting item/consumable is too much. Finally, the difficulty spikes: Unlike 10,000,000 and YMMB, those 2 games  have a nice difficulty spike, but this game, I can't even pass the third boss because once you there, you only have 2 turns to do ♥♥♥♥ while he does 20dmg+ to you.\n\nFor the PC port, I don't recommend this game.

Partly because I prefer the Bejeweled-style gameplay to the Candy Crush one that this uses, but mostly because I found the persistent improvements to be more satisfying than unlocking new characters and levels.

Find at least two matching tiles and stuff happens. But there is so much WRONG with this game, that I cannot enjoy all of its positives. If you want those, read one of the positive reviews. This game has tried my nerves long enough. These were all the negatives that just keep slapping me in the face. And I’ve TRIED to get passed them:\n\n- Escalating costs to every unlock in the game. For example, unlocking a character would first cost you 9 star blocks. Then 12, the 35...it just seems to keep going up. This is made worse by the fact that...\n\n- You only earn one star block per boss you best in battle. You can get others by completing quests, but depending on setup, this could be doomed to fail because most of them rely on sheer dumb luck if you complete them or not. Even then, the most I’ve gained from a quest thus far is 3 at a time. There is the enemies which test your nerves, but a little later.\n\n- You know how it most, COMPETENT RPG’s you can have a weapon AND armor? This game makes you choose one or the other. You can only hold one equitable and one consumable item at a time.\n\n- The enemies are also a pain in the ♥♥♥! Their scaling is awesome compared to how poorly you scale. The bosses scale EVEN HARDER (like they should), but the problem comes in when eventually, you will reach a point where you are unable to keep up and you WILL DIE. The fact that the previously mentioned one piece of gear at a time thing only makes the worse.\n\n- There is no real feedback when you go to use items that destroy rows/columns. When it comes to consumables, you click on them, click the OK button and they go into play. When you use row/column destroying items you only see the cancel button. Nothing else changes to show that you’re in the midst of using the item, like the cursor could change, or the row/column could change color as you’re moving over the blocks.\n\n- This last one is just a knit pick, but why are their tablet/smartphone terms like “swipe” in a game that is on the PC!?\n\nI could go on. But this review is getting long, and if I go further, I will have officially put more work into this than the developer put in the port of this game.\n\nBlock Legend DX is a legend alright. A bad one. I’m usually one to give a smartphone game a shot on the PC, but this time my faith was misplaced. In short, the port is terrible and the developer should feel terrible.","March 5, 2015","false","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/recommended/345640/","PhyreMatrix","PhyreMatrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/","941 products in account","This game is advertised as a puzzle/JRPG. Its an alright puzzle game but I’m not quite sure it fits any JRPG elements. Lets first start off with the puzzle aspect of this game. There’s very little skill involved between battles and the game constitutes of clicking on matching blocks to attack enemies, heal and defend. There’s only 6 block types: treasure chest, gold, attack, magic, defend and heal. When you aren’t fighting enemies attack blocks transform into experience until your next battle.\n\nIn essence the puzzle aspect of this game is more of a roguelike / time trial. In between facing foes you’re basically making a mad dash to match as many blocks as possible to level up. And the blocks you get are random with very little ways to influence them. There are a few items that might get rid of a certain block type or change one block into another but overall items are pretty random and not at all easily accessible as item costs are fixed and show up randomly. So you’re very likely to reach a store selling a high priced item when you just start out on your journey.\n\nThere is also equipment available for purchase but it’s awkwardly done in that you don’t get to equip your item right out the store. It goes into your inventory that can be accessed in your next playthrough. While we’re on the concept of price and purchases you are given random quests that you gain star blocks through. Star blocks are used to buy items, characters and stages at the start of the game. You can earn them mostly by doing side quests or defeating section bosses. Remember the various equipment I mentioned that you can purchase during your quest? Well when you start a new game you now have the option of… purchasing it AGAIN with star blocks. So technically purchasing equipment in the field unlocks it. You have to purchase it with star blocks every time you start a new game if you then want to equip it. And note that you can only have one item and equipment at a time.\n\nI feel like these crippling in game cost mechanics are leftovers from the app side of this mobile to PC game. It’s not a freemium model but sort of acts like it. The game never asks you for real money but the way the in game economy works it’s definitely a lot harder and less enjoyable not being able to purchase stuff.\n\nNow on to the RPG side. RPG to me has the impression that there’s going to be a story in there somewhere. You start the game and you just keep breaking blocks. You only see NCPs to buy stuff from them and that’s pretty much all the interaction you have with the residents. There’s no dialog to speak of, no characters to get to know. You do have HP, MP and gain experience but that’s the extent of any RPG elements present in the game.\n\nI will say I enjoy playing this game for what it is and not what it’s pretending to be. It’s a grindy, casual tough as nails puzzle game where luck and speed play as big a role as any skill you might have for these types of games. It won’t appeal to RPG fans but if you want a bit of a time killer then this will suffice for a short casual playthrough when bored.","March 12, 2015","false","5.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonstruckmuse/recommended/345640/","moonstruckmuse","Muse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonstruckmuse/","377 products in account","(While this review also draws from the time I've sunk into the iOS version, after playing DX I can safely say that what I've written applies to both the original and DX versions of the game.)\n\nTLDR; If you want a game as complex as Puzzle Quest or other similar titles, this isn't what you are looking for. But for $5 (or $2 for the iOS version (minus a few features), you can have a fun experience with a game that is charming, and has more depth than you would think from the mechanics. It also has great music, very charming writing and humor, and a consistent and polished art style.\n\n\nThe Map/"Story" System:\nLet's get one thing out of the way; there is no story. Instead, you are controlling a hero who is progressing through a 2D land on a side-scrolling path. Each land has two towns, one boss at the end, and various enemies that pop up randomly based on the area. Each town has three randomly selected NPCs which offer various services. After you defeat the boss, you are taken to a randomly selected land (with the difficulty scaled up with each boss you defeat). More lands can be unlocked to explore for your first run as you earn and spend Starblocks. While there isn't any story, the various dialogues for the bosses and monsters are where the writing shines, and the goal is more arcade-style ("get the best score") than plot driven ("save the world").\n\nYour Hero:\nYour hero has a single equipment slot and a single consumable item slot, which start off empty, and you can buy or earn items and equipment as you go. The first two heroes have no bonuses, but as you earn Starblocks you can use them unlock more heroes that have different advantages and disadvantages, and require different gameplay strategies. As you unlock and use more characters, you have to learn how to utilize the right stats and blocks for each one, to suit their abilities. As you level up you can upgrade their stats to make them more powerful, of course, and upgrading certain stats benefits some heroes more than others.\n\nGameplay and Board Mechanics:\nYour board stays consistent throughout the game, from when you begin to when you eventually, inevitably, fail, including during and in-between battles. This is a large part of where the strategy lies, because some blocks change what they do when when in battle versus when out of battle, and you have to make various decisions based on that. For example, when not in battle, the sword (physical damage) blocks turn into experience point blocks. So do you use the time spent between battles to rack up experience and level up quicker, and leave yourself without much physical attack power when the next enemy appears, or to arrange your board to do the most damage? Or do you use the time in between battles to build up your defense, heal yourself, or to earn money and treasure?\n\nMatches are made by tapping two or more of the same adjacent blocks. Racking up combinations ups the benefits of the blocks. The blocks above the ones you cleared drop down and new ones appear at the top of the board. While it seems simple at first, you quickly learn that you need to carefully plan out how to get the largest combinations by chaining the same block groups, or arranging the board into massive groups you can clear with a single move. These strategies quickly becomes necessary if you want to survive past the first boss or go into the hardest dungeons.\n\nThere are two meters you fill as well; your defense meter and your treasure meter. The defense meter is raised by matching shield blocks, and reduces damage taken in exchange for defense points. (Example: You have 3/5 in your defense meter, and are attacked for 4 damage. You receive 1 damage and your defense meter is reduced to 0.) There also is a treasure meter, which is filled by matching treasure chest blocks, and gives you a random consumable item to use.\n\nStarblocks:\nStarblocks are the main "bread and butter” in the game: what you aim to get. They allow you to unlock new characters, lands, or start off with a previously used item or piece of equipment on your new run. Mostly, you get these by completing various tasks (such as not attacking for 30 turns, defeating an enemy in one hit, etc), and by defeating bosses.\n\nTowns, NPCs, and Dungeons:\nIn each town, there are three randomly selected NPCs which offer various benefits in exchange for coins, ranging from buying armor, weapons, and consumable items, to delving into dungeons or changing the land you are in. (Dungeons are essentially a gauntlet of several enemies in a row, without any time to arrange your board and clear tiles in between battles.) You can only use the services of one NPC per town, so you have to choose which one has the most benefit to you at the time (such as going into a dungeon to gain more experience before the boss fight, or buying armor to raise your defense, etc).\n\nAesthetic:\nI honestly find this game to be one of the most charming battle puzzle RPGs out there. The music is fantastic, reminiscent of older arcade RPGs. Each character is polished, with unique animations and skills.

This one, though, gets a couple of things wrong that push it into unplayable territory.\n\nFirstly, it's very, very clearly a mobile port.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  But to play using items costs "Starbucks" or whatever, which you earn by doing quests.  Absent in the steam version is presumably the microtransaction store where you can buy more Canadough to unlock them.\n\nSecondly, it's not terribly deep.  After playing vastly more strategic match-3s like HuniePop (which isn't very deep, but vastly more engaging than this), this is simplistic, at best.  The strategy boils down to "match lots of hearts and shields".\n\nLastly, though, and most inexcusably is the fact that the gameplay is sluggish, unresponsive, and disengaging.  Every time the monster does something, it flashes a huge red warning on the screen and blocks your input.  Given that I play these games with a Wacom tablet and have no issues playing FAST the lockout of input every time the monster does something renders this basically unplayable for me.  Given that the game forces you to match hearts/shields AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, explicitly making it go slow is mindboggling.\n\nGive this one a pass.","February 27, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","2"

I reviewed it when it first come out and it was a busted mess of a game. The star system did not work. Potions did not work. Bosses scaled up way to quick. Among other bugs inside the game.\n\nWell I see that he updated the game and now it plays just fine as far as I could tell. The star system has been fixed. You can now buy stuff or not and it doesnt change the buy option. Before if you won a few games and didnt buy anything it would raise the stars needed to buy stuff. So if it costs 9 stars to buy a new character and you won a star and died. When you came back to buy it the character you wanted to buy would be raised to 26 or more. Making it so that no matter what you could never buy another character as it would keep going up and up. This has been fixed. I bought 2 characters and it was still very reasonable.\n\nThe other thing that has been fixed is potion. Again something that was busted before now works. I tried the health potion and some other potions and they all worked just fine. Also bosses feel like they scale up a lot slower now. Before it was death at the 3rd boss no questions asked. So another fix.\n\nI am a big fan of this game. Some of the negatives I have read on here has been the game has little strategy when it fact it has a ton of it. Almost every character has a speciality so for example a wizard requires a lot of green potions to do the most damage. Swords will hurt the monster but not much starting out. When you level up the wizard you can pick the strength option will allow the swords to do much more damage. The other complaint is nothing is carried over. Again this is not true anything you buy you can purchase the next game for your character. Potions and weapons.\n\nThe only thing I have not tested has been the gambler. In the early build it would be no gamble as it was always bad. So I do love the graphics and the music/sounds. I do wish it had like a basic story of rescuing a fair maiden or something along those lines. Who doesnt like being a hero to a fair maiden?\n\nSo Yes I can recommend this game now that its playable. Its easy to pick up and play.  For anyone who played this and found the many bugs and gave up. Try it now. Its very playable.","February 27, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a great and well-thought out, simple game that is incredibly addictive.  This game is small and will run on just about anything.\n\nAnd for all of those people who are complaining about how the game isn't engaging and all that other nonsense....it's a casual puzzle game.  It's not meant to be played for hours and hours on end (even though I sometimes do that as a distraction to other thigns).  It's a short and simple game, meant to be picked up, enjoyed, and put down before moving on to other things.  I don't really understand why this is such a hard thing for people to understand.\n\nA few tips:  The DX doesn't only refer to this game as a port from some other console, new features were added to it. If you scroll down to the bottom of the character list, there are some extra characters down there.  If you are having a particularly hard time with things, try using Unity-chan.  She starts with a very high vitality stat, doesn't need to be unlocked with stars, and will probably give you a higher survivability.\n\nStars aren't meant to be something that you just get constantly to unlock stuff.  They aren't particularly hard to get, but you don't get them in large quantities.  This is done as a simple 'effort and reward' system.  If you spend the effort to unlock something, you will most likely enjoy how that changes gameplay for you.  It's not a part of microtransactions or other nonsense, it's just something to reward players who play the game long enough to unlock stuff.  Quests are easily cycled through in most cases, and if a quest is proving too hard to fulfill, you'll eventually come across an npc who can change it for 100 gold.\n\nLastly, items have a huge impact on the game.  You unlock things as you purchase them in the game for coins.  You can then start with those items for a guaranteed advantage on your next playthrough at the cost of stars.  If you are having trouble getting through something, don't be afraid to buy items and experiment with them so that you can use them later.","March 2, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

You start off with about 2 characters with different stat distribution in strength, vitality, agility and intelligence. The character encounters random monsters and you break blocks to gain gold, deal physical damage, deal magic damage or heal.  There are also encounters with merchants to buy things such as special power, equipment upgrade or changes to your puzzle board.  At the end of the level, there is a boss which can be fairly hard.  After you beat a boss or completing certain "quests" you get stars to unlock more characters or different maps.  Game is fairly simple to learn but gets complex at higher levels.  The music is those 8-bit styles just like the graphics.

I can't really stand those Bejeweled and other Facebook/mobile type games, but when you add the RPG elements it becomes a really clever puzzle game that offers more gameplay rewards than just bumping up your score. Instead of getting pointless points, performing combos allow you to do more damage and show you the extent of how strong whichever character you're using really is. It's a bit  roguelike, it can be very challenging in later stages and each playthrough is unique. Whenever you start a new playthrough you pick your character, your level and whatever bonuses you can afford (with starblocks, no in-game purchases in here. Not sure about the mobile version though) and start fresh. It has a decent difficulty progression, though the game tends to "seem" like it randomly spikes in difficulty.  I haven't gotten too far with the game because like I said earlier, the later stages of the game get pretty damn hard, but in all the time I've spent playing I've never been bored and I've had a lot of fun with it. I'm not the only one though, I've showed it to some off my family that like those mobile-type games and they all really like it after explaining to them how the RPG mechanics work.\n\nOverall this is a pretty fun "matching game." It's really fun to play but if you're going to buy the Steam version I really recommend a tablet laptop or anything with a touchscreen, this game really needs a touch-screen to avoid that there carpal tunnel syndrome. If you don't have one I'd recommend getting the mobile version, preferably on a full sized tablet but it could work just as well on a cellphone.
