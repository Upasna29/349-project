This game is brilliant and possibly one of the best games I've ever played. Level design is amazing and unique, boss battles are epic, gameplay is addicting and fun, graphics and sound blend perfectly with each other. It's also really hard and challenging, in a good way.\n\nIf you're a fan of twin-stick shooters, you have to buy this masterpiece.","March 28","true","13.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The pacing, is fresh and frantic, with different enemy types and an ever changing arena.\n\nThe morphing arena is brilliant and really switches up the gameplay and your overall strategy. One minute your in an expansive room, the next your rubbing shoulders against the wall. I love it.\n\nThe sounds and visuals are very crisp, with satisfying sound effects when you fire your weapon. And the music is good too, however I do wish there were more tracks.\n\nOverall I love this game, and it is CRIMINALLY UNDERATED! I wish more people knew about this game, because I think it would be a nice addition to the other twin stick shooters. With a multitude of game modes, achievements, and local coop, I will be spending a lot of time on Trigonarium.\n\n9\10\n","November 19, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And I said 'I really wish there was a co-op game with triangles, squares, circles that shot triangles, worms that shot homing triangles, squares that roamed randomly, and ninja star shaped figures that liked you but didn't liked to be shot at and had acid like colors with a sweet high energy trance soundtrack.

The arena morphes as you progress through the levels and makes it much more challenging.  The power ups are short and powrful by collecting yellow   hexagon and to power up upgrade fire power you collect the pink hexagon and there's a quick dash mode to ram through every emenies that get caught in the way but there is no bombs.\n\nThere's also boss fight after you complete/survive the waves.\n\nDon't judge this game by lack of pretty/colourful graphics because the gameplay is just top notch for an indie game.","December 23, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I want to be helpful so I will keep this short and focused.\n\nAsteroids for grownups on LSD may represent the controls, the purpose, and the environment. Only one other metaphor is missing but I couldn't remember any games that did it. The maps you play on run a pre-programmed series of changes that alternately confound and isolate. Big open map starts and you are spinning and dodging to avoid enemies as they home in on you, then a warning sequence begins and you have to figure out where you think you should be. A level transformation won't kill you but it could leave you in a wholly isolated -tiny tiny- box of sadness for a few seconds. And while you are there, your new mini slice of the whole map is still spawning enemies in a 3" x 3" anxiety pool. When it happend to me I thought I might have found the fatal flaw in the design concept, then my prison cell burped homing death triangles at me and I just spun, fired, and laughed.\n\nI like to shop on Steam for the 0.01 - 5.99 range of games looking for gems. This game, for the number of game modes (and each of the game modes has options for how you play that mode) and the pucker factor, is a gem.\n\nI think I paid 2.99 for this title and I was satisfied in the first few minutes I played it.\n\nHave fun--","January 7","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
