Real roads from somewhere in the middle east with balloons everywhere. Real cars on the screenshots and videos, but badges are missing in the game ( to avoid paying licencing I suppose ).  The 'rubberband AI' seems to crash constantly. UI design looks as if it was drawn by a 12 year old with crayons. His favourite colours were obviously toxic green and pink.\n\nI wish I could say something about the handling, however the game doesn't really have 360 controller support. It does seem to detect the input, but there is no way to reassign key mappings. I used to accelerate with the 'X' button back in 2002, trigger support please. The arrows seem to control both the car AND the chase camera. I dont understand how in a team of 10 people that made the game they all thought this is a great idea. If I want to steer my car left, that also rotates the camera left and I have no idea where am I going anymore.\n\nOn the plus side, congratulations to the developers for trying. This is the first game I have ever played from their country so I applaud their ethusiasm. However they should have started with something simpler. A Mario Kart clone maybe?\n\nMy review is negative for the obvious reasons, but by all means please buy this game. I suspect it will be taken down due to licensing in the next few weeks. Now is your chance to get it and show it to your friends after you have finished watching 'The Room'. A cringe classic in the making.","July 3, 2015","false","0.8"," 60 of 76 people (79%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","79","60","76","39","1"

My review is officially negative unless the developer addresses many of the concerns I have.\n\nIt's alright.  I mean, the gameplay is pretty good considering we are not dealing with something AAA.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n- Controller mapping does not work as intended.  I can't figure it out, and the default controls are not ideal (X on 360 pad is for accellerate while triggers don't really do anything).  I can sort of change some settings, like changing the throttle to a trigger was okay, but when I go to set handbrake to 'B' it will skip back to the previus menu as though I hit 'B' at any other time.  If I hit 'enter' on the keyboard on any button it thinks there is an axis on the controller pressed slightly somewhere and every button will get mapped to that axis if you try.  Luckily the default controls are manageable enough to play.\n\n- Controls are too sensitive, basically unplayable without a way to lower sensititivity dramatically.  I was able to get through a few races by just tapping left and right ever so slightly, and it's not too much to ask since the races are mostly straight.\n\n- Crashes often.  Every 2 races my game locks up.  Very unstable.\n\n- Graphics options don't make a lot of sense, but they're serviceable I guess.  Crank it up and hope for the best, it at least can play at a high framerate and look decent.\n\n- Things in the background flicker like crazy.\n\n- The entire game can glitch out.  One time I went to race and my car wouldn't go, you could hear my engine rev but my car wouldn't drive.  Same with everyone else in the starting line, we were all frozen in time at the starting line and slowly creeping backwards (I assume the wind) and all turning ever so slightly into each other.  For like 10-15 seconds and then suddenly we all got our gas working and we sped off and raced.  HIlarious game.\n\n- The reversing in the car doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  I can't seem to figure it out, I keep hitting the wall and not knowing how to back up.  You press a button and 10% of the time it seems to back up.  It says you are in the reverse gear.  But it's okay because the AI is pretty broken and they are dealing with the same issues.  A few of the cars will just be stuck in random places and you're never lonely on the side of the road.\n\nThe Upsides:\n\n- The tires look amazing.  Before you race, you can steer left and right and you can get a glimpse of those tires!  They truly look great!  Very high poly models and the rain on them just looks amazing.\n\n- It's pretty fun racing, considering how bad it could have been.  It's playable, it makes you want to keep playing to unlock all the cars and levels.  If we could get a few control tweaks it would be even better.\n\n- Everything is locked by default, so it's fun to sit through it to earn new cars to drive.  Plus they all have different paint jobs.\n\n- THERES TWO SUZUKI VITARA'S IN THIS GAME.  Can't wait to unlock those.  Is there any 4x4ing though?  Seem sort of out of place.\n\nThe game is obviously broken as hell but I'm glad it exists.  If you catch it on sale sometime definitely pick it up.  I can't recommend full price but it's got potential.  A lot of it's issues can be fixed.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=w6ZLzT24IZk&t=537","July 1, 2015","false","0.8"," 44 of 58 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","44","58","9","10"

It's a shame because I actually think the car physics are good and I like the music. There's a good game in here that just needs a bit of help to get free!\n\nHere are my suggestions:\n1. Put a slider in for controller sensitivity.\n2. Put a slider in for controller deadzone amount.\n3. Test your controller customization screen with an xbox360 controller. Trying to customize the controls with a 360 controller is near impossible. I think you guys have set it up for a controller to use the buttons to accelerate whereas most xbox controller players will want to use the triggers for throttle and brake. Trying to set up the triggers is impossible on the current control customization page.\n4. Menus.. they should really use controllers, too. We like it like that.\n5. Please add sound volume controls so we can turn down the engine noise and turn up the music! You have this lovely soundtrack that we can barely hear during the race - seems a waste of that lovely soundtrack!!\n6. If you release the soundtrack I'll buy it.\n\nThank you.","August 1, 2015","false","3.1"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

It already took that award home and placed it on a shelf next to menu created in MS Paint, dull AI, slowly responding steering and 1990s graphic. And wait, we're driving through a tunnel, let's make car's engine 3 times louder and laggy, because that's what tunnels do, right? I also still don't know how to rename my character, it always resets to 'MyShofer'. And have I mentioned that AI is really bad? I'm not even sure how is that possible, but in the first real race (my time: 1 minute 40 seconds), the second car finished at 2:00, third at 2:50! Just stay away from this one until developers do some major rework.","August 22, 2015","false","0.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","21","27","5","0"
