Get it if you want something simple you can beat in 25-30 minutes without too much hassle. I will recommend it, because it is a well made game, it just lacks content right now.\n\nPros:\n- Nice, simplistic design\n- Calm background loops that don't get annoying\n\nCons:\n- Difficulty of the first 25 levels is all over the place, there seems to be no linear increase in difficulty\n- 25 levels is too short for a title like this. I played through it in 25 minutes, I am sure you can do it faster\n\nSuggestions:\n- More levels\n- Increased difficulty\n- Difficulty modes that increase game speed / modifiers\n- Highscores for levels","March 13","true","0.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","2"

You cannot move diagonally, nor can you change the speed at which your square moves through the maze. Once you start moving, you cannot stop, you can only change direction. The levels get increasingly difficult, and if you collide with an object or the wall you must start the level over. It is a simple concept but surprisingly challenging.\n\nIt immediately made me think of The Irritating Maze (arcade game from 1997), which itself was based on a Japanese game show. This game is not a clone of that one in any way, but the general concept of the game (moving through a path and avoiding touching anything) is similar and if you liked The Irritating Maze you'll probably like this game, too.\n\nOverall this is a fun game, a casual game that you can play for a few minutes at a time and progressively unlock new levels.","March 16","true","3.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It is very difficult to describe in words =()\nFrankly it was a game only to 2 lvl 1 attempt. Did 10+ approaches to lvl 2, has reached the turning fins, I thought finally !!! And without going broke in the rotation =((\nI contact the developer and ask for our little bears do to pass the game.\nAt that soon I received a response and changes in the complexity of the game! Very satisfied with the developer, as well as music in the game, and most toy!!!\nTo some extent that I always missed since Tetris  =()","April 12","true","1.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","4","8","4","0"

I would recommend this game if you like this genre although once finished don't expect to come back and play more because the levels are set in stone, there is no randomization. Maybe the developer will add more levels in the future, although a suggestion to the developer would be to include a workshop with community made levels and think about multiplayer.","March 14","true","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
