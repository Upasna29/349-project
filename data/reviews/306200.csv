It's a bit shallow and a lot of the options like where you build things are fixed. Your path of growth is more or less laid out for you.\n\nThe graphics, however, are quite nice and the characters are adorable. The atmosphere and lack of urgency is relaxing. It's, in every sense of the word, a casual game. It's also a gentle introduction to city-building for someone who has never played one before and isn't sure they want to drop $10-20 on one of the more genre-defining titles. Like I mentioned before, the city-building aspect is rather limited, but it's quaint.\n\nYou get what you pay for and it's not a bad game to add to your collection.","June 5, 2014","true","1.8"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","37","38","0","0"

Not because the game is bad, it's not great, it is a fun casual strategy game, but it was a disappointment because it was a downgrade from a previous Alawar/Buka Entertainment game.\n\nThe Promised Land is a previous game from Alawar/Buka that was released in 2012, it was a game that I really enjoyed for what it was.  With this game I was hoping for more of the same but maybe a bit bigger of a scale or maybe with some more depth.  The Happy Hereafter however seems to be a downgrade on The Promised Land rather than improving on the formula that made me a fan .  For this review I'll touch on a few of the points that I felt really soured me on this game compared to the one that made me buy this game.\n\nSo the game is about starting off a colony, managing the workers that you have to finish tasks given to you so you can upgrade your buildings and continue progressing.  Right off the start the worker system showed a big downgrade from the previous game.  The workers are all generic and it doesn't matter what each one is doing, in The Promised Land, each character had a description, stats and preferred job(as well as disliked job).  Each worker in The Happy Hereafter is interchangeable, it doesn't matter what job each is doing and you can just throw them wherever and it doesn't make much difference.  In The Promised Land you had to plan out where each new worker went and what the best fit was to maximize their ability to collect resources and perform the best for your colony.  Each worker in The Promised Land could also gain experience making them better at certain tasks which again added depth in worker placement.  Workers could also be stationed in one area and they would continually work that area and if they ran out of resources they would patiently wait till resources spawned again.  In The Happy Hereafter if a worker tries to collect resources from a depleted area they will just wander back to town and if you didn't notice it (there is a pumpkin head character they hide behind) then you have an idle working doing nothing.  And lastly on the workers,  You can not assign more than one worker to collect resources from an area other than the very last resource you can collect, it really prevents you from progressing and puts you in a situation you don't need as many workers as you could have space for as most of them will stand around doing nothing.\n\nThere isn't really as much story as The Promised Land either, there wasn't much in The Promised Land either to be fair but again something lacking in this title.\n\nArt is great in both games, again not much of difference or upgrade, but it's not terrible and is nice to look at.  It was pretty good in their previous game so why mess with it.\n\nThere is also random enemies that will try to pillage your storage area.  These are more annoying then fun to deal with.  They are also incredibly easy to deal with and pose no real threat, a couple of clicks and your back to the game.\n\nThe resources in the game for building and upgrading as well seem to be poorly balanced.  I had max workers on all areas to collect as much wood as possible and I was still constantly running out of wood, while having large stock piles of food, stone and gold (as well as other resources).  This could have been an easy fix by allowing more than one worker to collect resources from the mill, instead I had to constantly micromanage the workers to have one collecting while another was delivering.  As much as that might seem like it ads some difficulty or complexity, for me it just seemed tedious and takes away from the fun of these types of games.\n\nTo sum it all up, The Promised Land is 3$ more on steam, but you'll get a lot more out of that game compared to this one.  If you are looking for a short, casual, indie resource collection, strategy game, I would suggest The Promised Land over this game.  If you already have The Promised Land and you are looking for something very similar or better, skip this game entirely as I just didn't find it be near the quality or fun that The Promised Land was.\n\n\n","October 10, 2015","false","6.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

Basically the player builds a city for their zombies friends by setting the zombies to work, gathering food, farming, cutting wood, quarrying stone, and collecting gems and money.  The point is upgrade everything, when everything is upgraded the game "ends".  There are a few quests that need to be done such as helping a witch or growing a tree.  It is a bit involved since to make money one needs to use the laboratory, workshop, and kitchen.  And while managing all that the main warehouse gets attacked periodically by flying pigs, shining knights and grim reapers who steal the food.  The player must defend the main warehouse by clicking on the thieves until all have been defeated. (Flying red pigs with a black mane that remind me of Monty Python's flying pigs.)\n\nBest thing about this game besides the lack of any time limits, is that it is more or less an open type world where the player controls who and what is being done.  Plus the town square can be built however the player choses by buying street lamps, paving stones, fountain, and benches.\n\nA simple easy game for when one wants a break from time/resource management games with timed linear fixed campaign levels.","April 26","true","10.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hattereth/recommended/306200/","hattereth","Mad Hatter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hattereth/","692 products in account","The Happy Hereafter is essentially Virtual Villagers - Lite set in Halloween Town.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good game on its own.  But there are a few lacking components and bugs that make it not as impressive as other similar titles in the genre.\n\nFor starters, it's incredibly short.  So short, that I finished it in two nights.  If you follow the quest order you can probably get another hour or so out of it, but that isn't a good thing.  There are a lot of stretches of time where you're doing nothing but waiting.  It certainly isn't as long or as tedious as Facebook games, but it lacks item collection or achievements like Virtual Villagers to help pass the time.  If I had known from the start to improve resource gathering facilities the second the tech was available, I probably could have shaved off almost another hour of play.\n\nSecond, the bugs.  And there are more than a few that can be annoying, if not progress slowing.  On occasion there are times where villagers stop gathering from resources at the bottom of the map.  While it makes sense for them to stop gathering when a resource has run dry and is in the process of regenerating, they don't always stop for this reason.  I found myself at the start of the game constantly having to reassign someone to harvest wood at trees because they just decided to stop working after collecting one load.  With a little luck I was able to get them to automatically harvest, as they are supposed to, but it did get annoying and tedious, especially at the start when you are entirely reliant on these nodes for resources.\n\nAnother bug that is annoying, but not game breaking in any way, re units sliding around or getting stuck on decorations.  Sometimes when you tell a unit to harvest something, it will show the gathering animation but they will slide all the way back to the town square.  This doesn't prevent them from completing their job, but it is annoying.  Also, idle units have a habit of getting stuck under things.  Benches, lights, buildings.  It is easily fixed by picking them up and telling them to do something, and doesn't harm your production since they were idle, but it is another minor annoyance that one would think could be easily fixed.\n\nThe characters are interesting and it's obvious that a great deal of effort was put into their creation, but they are sadly under-utilized.  Each character has one, maybe two quest chains, that are incredibly short, and then they are never used again.  The mermaid has I think 3 or 4 quests, spread across two "chains."  I say "chains" simply because the first chain has 2-3 quests for her and the second is a single quest given by the witch.  Once completed you will never see her again.  It's sad to see detailed characters and environments used so sparingly.\n\nUltimately, I have to say this game is a "Pass."  While it can be fun, for its length, bugs, and simple play-style, there are just better games of the same genre.  At sale price, it was a nice distraction; at full price it would still be ok, but for a few dollars more you can get similar games with more depth and over-all entertainment.","September 30, 2014","false","4.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

I didn't really expect much and thought it'd be a very mediocre, forgettable, indie game.\nI'm so glad I was wrong.\n\nThe Good:  It looks like a handpainted style game with a more cartoonish flair, and it's got a very cute whimsical soundtrack to go with it (the music that plays in the game, to clarify).  I love the fact that it has quests/missions in the first place, and they never make you feel too rushed but give you enough pressure so that you want to hurry up with whatever needs doing. The quests are worded in a very quirky style and made me chuckle a few times! I loved the fact that there were cutscenes within the game and they varied from traditional style cutescenes to an image artsy style cutscene, almost like a graphic novel. You start with 3 little "helpers" and it goes from there, depending on your resourcefulness and needs, and by the you can have many more, each working on permanent jobs or temporary ones. I like that you can always reassign who does what and when. And lastly, you NEVER have to save (omg what!). That's right, you can exit whenever you feel like it or whenever you draw parent aggro (girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, hubby aggro!), and when you log back into the game it starts exactly where you left off. Wish more games did that, instead of the runaround some games do to try and never let you exit their games. Yes, I'm looking at you Assassin's Creed. Also, there is a vendor system in place, where you can sell and buy. Comes in handy!\n\nThe Bad: bugs! Now, I only encoutered 2.5 bugs. One was when I first started the game, I was not able to use magic on an altar. I simply restared the game twice and never encountered this problem again. The second bug was when I was dragging a worker to a location, I got a popup tutorial (I had not ticked tutorial off at this point) and my worker disappeared from my screen! Turns out she ended up on a "dark" undiscovered part of the map. I got her back when I discovered the area, but it did take me a while to get there. And the 0.5 bug was more of a glitch "oversight" on the developers part. One of the components for building crystal houses is listed as "stones" but instead requires "gems". I was trying to upgrade my houses to a rank 2 but was unable to, I had plenty of stone, so I bought from gems from the trade post and sure enough I was able to upgrade to rank 3. Now the last bad thing, is the length of gameplay. It's short (about 6 hours) if you are playing to do the missions/quests, however, once you beat the game you have the option to keep playing.\n\nWorth it? In my humble opinion, I would recommend anyone to buy this game. While it is short compared to most games out there it's got a lot of replayability, the game keeps you engaged and interested, and you can tell the devs put a lot of hard work into the game, so quality is on your side! Plus, at 4 bucks (3.99 US dollars) you can afford you buy it and hate it, but you will probably like this one.

Games like this are like a flash application to the websites. Nothing new I not opened, but was happy. Bought as soon as I saw. I knew that the game will be short, easy and cheap. Hooked idea that this "strategy" about zombies.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple. You give a world where almost everything is done for you, you can't choose what and where to build, so the buildings appear always in the same place. The extraction of resources standard, exhaustible resources. Buy new jobs and send them to work. Improving industrial buildings, residential and other. For beauty, you can create beautiful objects, meaning in it, but just for fun. The quests you are given upon the opening of new locations (as of beginning openly little). Tasks on extraction of specific resource specified number.\nThe characters are funny and the animation is the same sweetheart. There are little splash of four pictures. The plot is missing, but interesting to play.\nThe world was made 2D, 3D characters\nThe negative side of the game:\n1. The game is short\n2. Some resources are significantly less than those that are needed. For job often give gold, and which is so very much.\n3. There is possibility to construct buildings where want.\n4. The limit of buildings by reason of paragraph 3.\nMay I wrote cons of the game, but this is minor. The game is relaxing and uplifting\n\nThe game is fully completed.

Ничего нового я для себя в ней не открыл, но прошёл с удовольствием. Купил, как только увидел. Я понимал, что игра будет короткая, легкая и дешевая. Зацепила идея, что эта "стратегия" про зомби.\n\nГеймплей крайне простой. Вам дают мир, в котором почти всё уже сделано за вас, нельзя выбирать что и где строить, так что постройки появляются всегда в одном и том же месте. Добыча ресурсов стандартная, ресурсы истощаемые. Покупаете новых рабочих и отправляете их на работу. Усовершенствуете промышленные здания, жилые и прочие. Для красоты можно создавать красивые объекты, смысла в этом нет, но ради забавы. Квесты вам дают по мере открытия новых локаций (по началу открыто мало). Задания на добычу конкретного ресурса конкретным количеством.\nПерсонажи забавные и рисовка то же милая. Бывают коротенькие заставки из четырех картинок. Сюжет отсутствует, но играть интересно.\nМир сделан 2D, персонажи 3D\nОтрицательные стороны игры:\n1. Игра короткая\n2. Некоторых ресурсов заметно меньше, чем тех что необходимы. За задания чаще всего дают золото, которого и так очень много.\n3. Нет возможности строить здания там где сам хочешь.\n4. Лимит зданий по причине пункта 3.\nПусть я и написал минусы игры, однако это мелочи. Игра расслабляющая и поднимающая настроение\n\nИгра пройдена полностью.

For a younger audience, this could potentially be recommended, with caveats - but that doesn't make it a good game in the genre.\n\nDeveloper Alawar and publisher Buka Entertainment are well known amongst casual gamers. Farm Frenzy and Treasures of Montezuma are two of the most well known series they've worked on, and the rest of their respective lists of mostly mediocre yet decent enough games are pretty long. They also collaborated on The Promised Land, another resource management game, but one I actually enjoyed; it was *heavily* reminiscent of Virtual Villagers, and even without ever managing to come close to the fun mechanics and attention to detail that made Last Day of Work's game a hit, it provided a few hours of entertainment.\n\nThe Happy Herefter feels like a game that attempts to capitalize on the moderate success of The Promised Land, and fails. There is nothing innovative about the resource collecting, building, crafting, quest fullfilling treadmill the game puts you on, and there is also no attempt at permitting the player any input or attempt at strategy. You follow the cues, you fullfill one (re)quest after an other, everything with an arrow pointing at things just in case you missed them. Except when you do miss them, because quests are worded awkwardly or mechanics are insufficiently explained. Certain mechanics also feel too much like busywork to be fun, like resources that deplete very fast but only for a few seconds - long enough for your toons to wander aimlessly around not knowing what to do and needing to be dragged back. There is a distinct lack of polish here, in the copywriting, in the UI, and in the mechanics, to the extent where it feels like no one really playtested this game.\n\nSo if you have younger kids, and if you are willing to sit around for a few hours helping them when they get stuck because something is worded wrong/awkwardly or a mechanic is badly explained, then this might be a fun game for them. It's utterly linear, impossible to go wrong, somewhat cute, with a silly story, and not too long. If on the other hand you're an adult casual gamer, might I suggest The Promised Land? Exactly in the same vein, just better executed and more polished.","May 27","false","4.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There's little and/or no mouse control for "Edge" scrolling. There's plenty of mouse control for "Click & Drag" scrolling. I prefer "Click & Drag" scrolling it makes everything a bit easier.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam’s Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it’s Booster Pack Creator. Badge can be crafted and upgraded with these trading cards. This feature is only available for Steam’s version of this game.\n\nFinal thoughts, I definitely enjoying playing this game all the way through to the end. As for the replay value I would say it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","November 16, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Unfortunately, the way they've gone about this is to triple the level of micromanagement. For resource gathering there are basically three categories:\n60% Short run: These resources have 5-10 units of the resource, so your people make 5-10 trips before they stop working. They will regenerate gradually, in this time they add to the one-shot category.\n25% Stable: These resources are able to support up to one worker permanently .\n15% One shot: There are a fair amount of resources, but they can only be harvested once before they need to regenerate.\n\nBetween the above, one-time resources and, one time production queues, there's a LOT of telling your villagers every. Single. Thing. To do.  At least they return to the town center so they are easy to find.\n\nPeriodically, you village is "attacked" by sprites that spawn from the same location every time and proceed to your warehouse to steal resources. The way to vanquish them is simply to click on the repeatedly. This is pretty silly, but I guess it's better than trying to incorporate some kind of extreme micromanagement tower defense...\n\nThe biggest problem I had with this game is that it was very hand-holdy, basically the entire game was a tutorial. There was a main game quest for, literally, every single building and upgrade. When it comes to these kind of village sim games, half of the point is that the map is very small, static, and unexplored. So, you're constantly thinking, 'dude, just leave me alone'. Obviously you're going to need to build a workshop type building at some point, and obviously you will need to upgrade it, it's not necessary to treat me like I'm four. You play games like this to explore and problem solve. That does not happen here. Even the things you know you will need to do at some point, like clear brush (without any special tools, just with hands), cannot be done until the main quest sprite places an arrow over it. That's pretty frustrating.\n\nThe interface and game, itself, is pretty bug free. Sometimes when one of the millions of quest windows pop up, it clicks through the world and pulls people off of whatever they were doing, but it's not a big deal. The greatest oversight is the wording in the quests. For example, there's one where you need to sell wood. Okay, wood is an actual resource that you get from trees or sawmills, but the quest actually wants you to sell planks, which is a production item made from wood. So I spent a good deal of time thinking that quest was broken. It only occurred to me it might have been referring to something else after a similar situation with a cooking assignment.\n\nUltimately, the game was not "unenjoyable". It was alright, although could have been a bit better. I have played 4.6 hours of it and that's exactly how much content there is. For the dollar-twenty I paid for it, that's pretty good, but I would have preferred it had more challenge, less tutorials, and more replay value in exchange for a higher price tag.","December 17, 2014","false","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

However, the reasons why I cannot really recommend it (even to fans of the genre) are basically these:\n\na) It seriously lacks replayability. Once you play through the "story", that's all there is to see. No other missions, no sandbox mode, nothing that usually make games of the city-building genre interesting.\n\nb) It gets repetitive. Fast. It's like grinding through levels on a WoW character or playing a Facebook/mobile F2P game: build, upgrade, upgrade more, gather, build, rinse and repeat. There is no real depth whatsoever and the "challenge" is basically optimizing your material production so you'll be done with the game as soon as possible.\n\nc) Short. You are done with the game in 4-6 hours or so, depending on how quickly you learn the ropes and how well you manage your workforce and assets.\n\nThough it is very cute and the graphics and overall theme are very appealing (which is why I bought this in the first place), I'd only recommend this for younger players wanting to get introduced to the genre. For anyone else, there are better city-builders out there.","August 3, 2015","false","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

By letting your townspeople collect resources you are able to progress by constructing new buildings and upgrade existing ones, attract more inhabitants and discover the surroundings of your village.\nThere is a story, devided up in a lot of missions, which is mainly about developing your town and getting to know the characters you come across whilst playing.\n\nWhy I do not recommend the game\nLet me start off by telling what I like about the game. I enjoyed the graphics, the characters you come across and some of the missions. There are also scrolls and statues to be found that give you bonus material upon completing the game.\n\nThere were, however, a lot of things I did not like about The Happy Hereafter.\nThe story is basically a tutorial that lasts throughout the entirety of the game in the form of missions: gather this, build that, go there, andsoforth.\nSecondly, gameplay consists of dragging and dropping villagers onto the resource to gather, buildings to build or research to complete. Nothing more, nothing less. You do not know how much resources there are left to gather per location and how fast they regenerate so as the map expands due to exploration, revealing new resource locations, this becomes increasingly tedious work.\nThe game is also not balanced. Villagers grow hungry during gameplay and eat your gathered food, but if you periodically perform a bit of magic in the circus their appetite is reset. Resources are plentifull in the midgame and apart from the bore to collect them, are quite easy to stockpile. There are some enemies that try to steal resources, but defeating them is easy enough.\nLast but not least, I have encountered a few bugs. Some made the villagers non-responsive to me trying to drag-and-drop them, but I also had to start over once as the barrier I needed to clear in order to progress would not budge, no matter what I tried.\n\nAll in all, this is a game without enough varied gameplay, lacking a real story, poorly balanced and occasionally bugged. Though I like the concept, I cannot recommend this game.","August 30, 2015","false","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I might have been able to beat it sooner. This is a decent game to buy as long as you want something short, nice, and relaxing to try out. It's even a great game to put your kid to play. If you enjoy being a god of the underworld with cute graphics. This is a decent game to check out.\n"I'm giving this game a score of 6 out 10." -BitAngel91\n\n[Pros]\nMakes you feel like a god of the underworld\nGame play is just smooth\nA good time killer\nGraphics are cute and relaxing\nMusic is also relaxing[Cons]\nAfter you beat the game, you just have the option of restarting it.\nThe game is very short.\n"If you guys feel that I am poorly judging this game.

It doesn't mess with gameplay at all but with such a beautiful setting.. you would expect a bit better display. Other then that, it's a cute little gem. I enjoy sitting down with a hot cup of tea and pecking at my quests for an hour or so. It mostly kills time when you have nothing better to do.","October 6, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The quests, cut scenes and map progression kept me interested, ah la carrot on a stick. Only a few minor bugs I found - a quest that couldn't be completed, minions bugging out and not being able to find their way to the depot from a section of the desert area (but could be manually redirected), and minions that had the same name. Seriously, I ended up with at least three minons named 'Phil'! Phil 1 - top hat, Phil 2 - green hair, and Phil 3 - top hat with slightly more weight on his right leg... I'm kidding, I really couldn't tell Phil from Phil.\n\nWhich leads me to my main critisisms of this game -  when I finished, I got the feeling the developer had run out of ideas, or time, or...something. The ending was a little disappointing in the way it "wrapped things up" (I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't elaborate on specifics). Unfortunately, the way it concluded left me feeling unsatisfied - like I hadn't been rewarded for all of my hard work. Well, the minons' hard work...whatever. Also, the invasions (which I assume were included to keep the player on their toes) were easily overcome with a few clicks, and didn't really bring the element of stress to the table that this genre usually brings. In fact, there weren't any moments where I felt stressed or was punished for my mis-management. I'm not saying it needed to be super difficult, but maybe just slightly more challenging, or even offering a challnge scale option. However, I suspect it was the developer's intention to make the game relaxed without being boring. I think younger audiences will find this the right level of challenge though...unless they're some kind of child genuis.\n\nAll of that said, I'm still going to recommend this game - it looks great, it was engaging, it was cheap to purchase, and I had fun -  all qualities I value as a casual gamer. It would have been super amazing if there were some achievements included and some improvements to the above mentioned. But in the end, it's a casual, 'busy-work' kind of game that is worth checking out. If the hereafter is anything like this game, sign me up! As a master of course, not a minon. Cutting down trees and mining will never be my thing - in this life or the next.","January 2","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
