I don't know why they would just make a 'find a match' option and would put players together as soon as possible to play together online. Plus the PC controls are clunky.\n\nso as of this moment in time, i would suggest waiting a month or two before getting the game, and let them tweak, fix, and update the game to make it less buggy, more controller optimized, and hopefully add a lobby system.\nOr just get the PS4 version and not the PC version if you want it now.\n\nMore info here[www.ksalue.com]","July 31, 2014","true","2.3"," 65 of 80 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","65","80","0","3"

I was not disappointed.\n\nPure Pool will no doubt draw many comparisons with the other pool game on Steam, Pool Nation.  I've played a ton of Pool Nation and I think Pool Nation looked cool but was very arcade when you got right down to it. The crazy swerve shots and jumps you could do and were REQUIRED to do for certain challenges were fun but no where near realistic.\n\nPure Pool is much more grounded in real life.  Your view is locked to what you would see if you were aiming a shot on a real table, aside from the aiming lines of course.  There is no overhead view or birds-eye view of the table.  You can "Stand Up" from your aiming view and walk around the table and move the view about as high as I could go if I was on my tip-toes over the table but that's it.  It feels very real and makes aiming a shot much more difficult.  Long shots the length of the table take skill just like in real pool.\n\nFrom what I've played of Pure Pool and I'm loving it so far. My only criticism of the game is that it has clearly been designed with a controller in mind. I would highly recommend this game be played with a 360 pad as the keyboard controls are not awful but slightly sluggish when compared to the responsiveness you get with a pad.\n\nI like that the game has strived for realism though. The way you move around the table as you would in real life and your view being is limited, no overhead view, only being able go as high as you could on your tip-toes to survey the table.  It really does feel like real pool.\n\nLike I said, I love it. I'd highly recommend this game. One of the best pool games I've played since the days of Virtual Pool 3. This game is as close to real life pool as I think you will get without buying your own table for the back room.","July 31, 2014","true","7.4"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","49","55","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naoisan/recommended/300610/","Naoisan","Naoisan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naoisan/","522 products in account","This is a really fun game that oozes quality in every aspect and imo the best pool game that is currently available on Steam. It also has a strong focus on online multiplayer and it's quick and easy to find a game against someone. [EDIT: Online is pretty dead at the moment, so beware of that before buying]\n\nIt has FANTASTIC graphics, easily the best out of any pool game I've ever seen. The depth of field effect in particular is excellent and very visually pleasing. There's real time ball reflections and incredibly detailed textures so much so I swear you can almost feel and smell that fresh pool table cloth ahhhh.\n\nThe sound is solid with a good meaty smack when the balls hit each other. There's quite a nice jazz soundtrack with a subtle but convincing crowd ambience and along with the great visuals and lack of UI creates a really engaging atmosphere.\n\nPhysics seem good. The balls always behave as I would expect them too. They seem to have a solid realistic weight to them and I haven't noticed any weird quirks. I have on occasion made a ball bounce off the table from whacking it with full force which is to be expected and it is good to see it simulated, rather than having the balls arbitrarily stuck to the table. But don't get me wrong there's no weird floaty aracade physics.\n\nThe controls may feel odd at first but with practice it feels intuitive. It supports both controller and mouse and keyboard, although many people have expressed that the mouse and keyboard controls are clunky and awkward to use. I personally use the controller in which you hold the right thumbstick down to distance your cue and slam it forward to hit the ball. It feels very satisfying once you nail it and I think this is about the closest a game has captured what it's really like to hold a cue and hit the ball; there's no arbitary power bar here. Be warned that there's no overheard view however, it's strictly first person view which I don't mind personally as it feels closer to playing real pool.\n\nPerhaps it's not as in-depth or as realistic as something like Virtual Pool 4, but it is very fun and my personal favourite pool game yet. It is hands down the most immersive pool game out there. My only real complaint is there's no Snooker, but hopefully that's coming in a future DLC.","July 31, 2014","true","36.8"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","0"

Keep in mind that some of my issues might have been addressed by the time you've read this review, but I'll try to keep it as current as possible.\n\nPositives:\nVery clean visually. Probably the best looking pool title on the market.\nPlenty of table customization. Logos/patterns are easily turned off, and there's several colours of cloth available.\nThe cloth feels closer to the real thing than any other pool sim I've played. I can actually see/feel the backspin grip into it.\nPlenty of content to keep you going, especially at the price point.\nFair £/€/$ conversion rate.\n\nNegatives:\nI feel the game lacks a bit of cue power. It would be nice to be able to really nail a ball.\nThe AI can sometimes take too long with each shot, with a weird faux aiming "effect" that just eats up time.\nInverted controls for adding English to the ball/moving the ball - Not a settings issue.\nSometimes, the game just doesn't seem to want to accept inputs, especially when wanting to add English to the ball.\nMouse & Keyboard controls are pretty poor.\nMinor graphical issues.\n9 ball rules are incomplete (no push-out, 3 fouls, etc).\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it. It will be a very good game once the few little issues it has are ironed out, but right now, just treat it like an unpolished gem - The core is there, and it's very, very good.","July 31, 2014","true","8.4"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","27","37","0","0"

The thing about the physics when you drop to the bottom of the ball to have back spin and do a power shot it should spin back hard but never does. It lacks many things that virtual pool 3d got right like the spin shots around opponents balls. Is it fun Yes! The game needs a patch badly the field of view is lacking a lot and thus far I haven't seen a table with the diamonds to help give reference to bank shots that would greatly improve the game. My biggest complaint is Mantis App Crashed. Please attach a debugger. and we're not given anything more than that to work on why this game crashes. And it crashes a lot, specially when you are about to win a match then black screen then crash report. So you lost all of your advancements. Lowering settings helps but doesn't fix. I have an Intel 960 with 24 gigs of ram and Nvidia 650 with 2gigs of ddr5 ram so I more than have a rig that can run this at max settings. Now the good points, It looks really nice all the table options and felts lets you take charge of how you want to view the game. The aim has a nice angle pointer to show you when you have your shot lined up. The music is nice and not distracting. The amount of swing you put into the cue is great. I do recommend the game cause even with its faults it's a pleasure to play.","August 2, 2014","true","30.4"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","1"

It's a good pool game with problems. Mainly unreliable online play, frequent crashes (although not for everyone) and poor mouse controls.  I recommend using a controller.\nI wrote this review in August.  Since then, nothing has changed.  It still has many annoying problems.  The developers don't provide any info on when things will be fixed or even if they're making any progess.  They didn't even seem aware of their own game's problems.\n\nMultiplayer:\nFinding a match is currently difficult.  There isn't a lobby to speak of.  Instead, you challenge another player and wait for them to accept or ignore.  There's a Quick Match option but I've never found a game this way. If you get into a game, it might play fine. More likely, you'll experience one of the many possible bugs or server issues. You can't mute mics.  There is no in-game chat.\n\nPresentation:\nThe actual pool is very pretty.  The best I've seen.  The UI is not.  It could be improved a lot.\n\nAudio:\nPersonally, I don't like the music but some people really do.  I turn it off.  The pool sounds are fine.  No complaints there.\n\nGameplay:\nWhen it works, it plays great, for the most part.  Sometimes you can't see a shot as well as you would like but it's mostly fine.\nThere's a career mode which is just ok.  It's just a bunch of different game types against various AI.\nThe AI isn't great.  It pretends to be human so it can be slow.  It also can't do bank shots, doubles or plants.  It can get out of almost any snooker and doesn't play tactically at all.  It just makes amazing pots but it's very beatable most of the time.\nYou can play US 8-ball, 9-ball, UK 8-ball and a few others like killer and various potting/speed challenges.\n\nSo, it needs work.  If it was an early access game, I'd say it's a great alpha, a decent beta.  Released too early.\nThe devs don't say a lot so I'm just hoping they'll get this game up to a decent standard.","August 27, 2014","false","76.3"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","19","28","2","2"

There is customization, as of now it doesnt seem as exstensive as Pool Nation but this game has a lot that game didnt.\nSo I recomment the game to the fans of great pool games, just letting it be known at this time it has its issues... but so did Pool Nation on its release.","July 31, 2014","true","4.3"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keselol/recommended/300610/","Keselol","Lujan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keselol/","265 products in account","While the game mechanics itself are good, there are way too many negative aspects to this game to actually recommend it. In other reviews you can read all about the great graphics, nice music, good physics. However, most reviewers fail to name the negatives, of which there are plenty. Let me name just a few points which will frustrate you every time you encounter them.\n\n-The menus are extremely wonky. It sometimes takes the game well over 5 seconds to do what you told it to do, which may be as simple as restarting a gamemode you just played. Sometimes the menus don't even work and you just keep pressing Enter without anything happening (this happens a lot when you attempt to enter a multiplayer game, the menu switches between "Quick Match" and the game mode selection screen).\n\n-There is no fullscreen. If you try to play full screen the game crashes on start up. Using Alt + Enter you can get to fullscreen, but only up to 1280x720.\n\n-You can't turn off the sound while ingame. You can turn down the sliders, but there will still be really soft sound in the background. To enable or disable sound you have to restart the game.\n\nThis game feels (and probably is) a very, very poor console port. The gameplay is solid and you will probably enjoy it, but the menus and especially the lack of full-screen is extremely frustrating. How they thought this was an acceptable product for sale is beyond me, because there are lots of probably easy to fix issues.","August 18, 2014","false","7.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","4"

The graphics are beautiful and surprisingly my computer can run it well on medium. There are currently alot of issues as stated with many reviews such as matchmaking where I have faced off against the same person 4 times in a row (After I back out and search again) and some are saying it is CPU but I don't know. The gameplay is very nice and smooth with very precise mouse controls. If the CPU thing with matchmaking is true and you want to play against other people then I would recommend holding off for a bit but if you don't mind that then there is also  career mode which is essentially tournaments although I haven't checked them out yet. There are also a lack of customisation but that doesn't matter to me but if it does to you then you may wanna hold off aswell.\n\nIf you just wanna play a game of pool online or offline and don't care about customisation then this game is perfect for you right now. 7.5/10.\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMsMn-UxXt0","August 4, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","9"

This one wins them all by virtue of completely believable physics, a fantastic, beautifully designed environment, and a focus on online gameplay.  As Foolinjection's review points out, there is no top-down veiw, keeping the gameplay as pure as possible. You can stand up and walk around the table, kneel down to check ball placements, but you must return and line up your shot the same way you would at a real pool table.\n\nPros -\n-VooFoo is extremely well-versed in creating amazing looking, physics-true pool games.\n-"Pure Pool" plays like its name. No cheat view to line up and shoot from the table lamp's eye of sight.\n-The price for this game is VERY reasonable, even while not on sale!\n-Rich focus on online gameplay.\n-Achievements, trading cards, controller support!  (I play with gamepad and it is very functional and responsive)\n-VooFoo DNA is a remarkable way to play against your friends or other challengers from online play, even when you are offline. It learns the play-style of players and is basically an AI version of that player!  Revolutionary! EXCELSIOR!\n\nCons-\n-the UI is needing much improvement.\n-inverted X axis on placing cue ball. There seems to be no workaround except for turning your brain into a mirror perspective when finding good placement on the table.\n-unlike Hustle Kings, no option to play your music library instead of theirs, the cool jazzy soundtrack isn't horrible though, and you can always set the music volume down so you can pipe in your tunes from elsewhere.\n-sometimes my connection to network isnt great, this is probably my janky DSL though.\n(+EDIT+ seems to be the server. Lots of people complaining- devs need to update optimization)\n-the game can prove to be pretty difficult if you are grinding for stars and achievements. Probably not a "con" for everyone,  but my wife gets stressed out when I've been cussing for an hour and a half about how all I want to do is pot two balls in the side pockets consecutively!\n...and finally...\n-you're reading this review,  and not playing it! Just get it, already!!\n\n(EDIT)\n\nAlright, after looking through forums on this game, it seems many people are having trouble with it. Either on the program itself working on their machines or on network gameplay. Lots of people having problems with controls and complaining about UI.  I do get where they are coming from, but I have hope that VooFoo and the publisher will be releasing optimization updates and patches for improving those situations, and hopefully an improvement to the UI is in the works.  Also there is only one venue for playing as of now.  I still insist that I'm having fun playing and still would recommend the game.","August 17, 2014","true","25.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

But from playing the VPH series (where you move the screen around freely with the mouse instead of having to use different buttons/combinations to manipulate movements), this was much slower going and pretty frustrating at times which obviously takes away from any fun. VPH also had a much smoother machanic on the cue stroke.

One understands that they might go for a realistic tone in a dark, posh subterranean bar to make it moody but...to this extend is silly, it hampers gameplay.

That's most definitely the case here.\n\nFirst let me state that I am running 3GB of video memory on a Geforce 770GTX. I can max out most games without experiencing any sort of lag at all, not the case with Pure Pool.\n\nThis game literally has no pro's because it is not playable. It didn't detect my card at all (similar problem with pool nation) instead it defaults to the motherboards on-board Intel graphics chip which is fine for everything except running games.\n\nYou can't change the options, nor could I locate an easy way to access the options (of which there are few).\n\nThe game will force you to watch a ridiculous intro after a nauseating load time at the beginning. It loads you right into free play which I’m sure is one of the reasons the load time is horrid. I also experienced lag when trying to control the cue stick, very similar to input lag with HD televisions when you try to play certain PC games on them. This makes it almost impossible to line up your cue real time. I should also state that aside from my video card memory I am running 16 gigs of ddr3 ram (maxed out).\n\nI don't know why a developer would put out a game, boasting about it's graphics when you can't even utilize the hardware you need to for those graphics to not hinder the game-play. I might have gotten this game on sale but I still want my money back because this is absolute trash.

Firstly there is a fixed viewpoint when potting which makes playing the game difficult and unatural. While I understand this may be somewhat realistic in a video game IMO this is an issue. Also the menu system is very clunky and unintuative which makes navigating the various game modes a real chore.\n\nPlaying with a controller is more responsive but playing with a mouse and keyboard is not easy\n\nAs of writing I have also been completely unable to access the servers.... which isn't the best first impression.\n\nOverall though with a bit of patching this could be easily the best pool game out there as the physics and feel are the best out there by far.... sadly it isn't at the moment..... Pool Nation is and I would suggest get that instead.","July 31, 2014","false","1.4"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","16","35","0","7"

It looks great, visually beautiful, music is smooth and relaxing. However, as a pool game and not a display peice, no. Anyone that has told you they played real pool for ANY length of time and says this is realistic either has lied about playing, or is just so desperate for a pool game they fool themselves to believing it. I HAVE played pool, many times, here is the truth of this game:\n\nThe controls, oh where to begin, lets start with *SLOW* aiming that accellerates just as you FINALLY get the shot lined  up, causing unneeded and unrealistic delay. Also the picking of your next shot done automatically, stop it..it dose a bad job of it, and causes MORE delays with the alread mentioned bad aim! The AI, someone was on BAD drugs here, scaling difficulty is non exsistant as a rookie level 1 AI could clean house, or a top tier AI could miss shots nobody would miss. It's just a mess. The table and physics, oh dear....well the table's feedback is terrible, feels like playing on a rubber covered cardboard box, the feel is not genuine, and that could be forgiven if not for the failure of the physics. Jump shots that well..don't, backspin that jumps, balls rolling UP the pocket onto the wood and back down onto the table? Come on, do you know your chances of doing that realisticaly? I do, it's so minimal you can not imagine, unless you TRIED to and are GOOD. To make this game good, they need to pretty much redo the works, but they won't.

I wouldn't recommend playing this on windowed mode with a mouse, which was what I used this because it didn't support 2560x1600 fullscreen.  Aim is poorly based on your mouse position each turn, if your mouse isn't in the center of the screen, each of your shots are off aim.  It's very difficult to realign the mouse, whih you shouldn't need to do.  Seems poorly thought out for mouse users.  Maybe it runs better without a mouse, but even if it played more smoothly, i too fast paced and uncomfortable for a casual game.  I would say it's not as concise as other available pool games like Pure Pool which in my opinion, sets the bar for a pool game.\n\nOn a side bit, what's with the stereotypical characters?

The air was smokey, there was 70's porno music playing. Was at my local pool hall? Nay. I was playing Pure Pool on Steam. I was so excited to begin my career as a professional online pool player when this game was gifted to me.\n\nAs soon as it installed Microsoft .net Framework 4.0 and Direct X, thank god for that, I launched the game and it all went in to a nose dive from there. Imagine a flaming turd falling from approximately 38,987 feet. The rentry speed was vast. Pieces of turd were falling every which way, hitting innocent women and children unlucky enough to be caught in it's path. It smelled. It was awful. Everything about this game made me miserable. It made my computer miserable. It broke the resolution settings on my computer and I had to resort to pounding my fists on the keyboard to make something, anything happen. I finally got into a game with a friend which took about 47 minutes. 2 shots in all was well, a little laggy, but ok. After that it said he left the table and lost connection to the Pure Pool server. At this point the flaming turd had fulling engulfed me and my eyes started to bleed. From there my roommate attempted to install the game and his rig is literally ancient. The game broke his computer before the install was complete. This flaming turd caused his computer to freeze and he is now currently without a gaming computer. Please help the cause for this gamer in need by visiting his kickstart.

I recommend it for 5€ or less, and only if you're a patient pool player.\n\nThere's just pool, no snooker. The interface/menu is quite poor, the aiming is cumbersome, and controlling the shot's power with a mouse can be frustrating. Then there's the strange camera, that sometimes doesn't allow you to watch your own shots. Some rules are also strange (to me), and there's no way to change any of them.\n\nThe game tries to be very "pure", with no arcadey elements or even trick shots, but for example there's no chalk, and the different cues (novice, pro, etc.) all feel the same to me.\n\nLack of feedback from developers is a big minus, even the forums seem quite dead.

Second game, the yellow would not display properly and when trying to hit it, the cue ball would not move correctly. Issues with the physics after this point. Gave up.\n\nPlease fix this game as you are being paid good money for a faulty product. The longer you leave it the more your score will go down on Steam and people will revert to your competitors and accuse you of ripping them off, as you say you will look at issues but it's not happening.\n\nA real shame as it's a nicer game than Pool Nation FX. Please fix it or give me my money back.","December 28, 2015","false","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Absoltuely perfect for local multiplayer. I recommend using a controller, the PC controls are ok but controller is the way to go. The music is absolutely amazing and the devs have given quite a bit of extra content for free. Graphics are great (as you can see from the Store images) and there are some fun gamemodes to try. I know some people have suggested that you cannot hit the ball as hard as you would want but I personally do not understand that complaint. I've never wished I could hit it harder, and it's even possible to launch balls off the table if you want to. There must be some agreesive pool players out there! Anyways, I don't remember what I paid for it (I'm thinking around $5-$7) and I feel like I've absolutely got my money's worth. I'd definitely recommend this game for the $7 range. The normal $13 is fine in my opinion, especially if you like pool and/or have someone that wants to play it with you. But if you see it on sale, pick it up! If you can grab the soundtrack with it, I'd also recommend picking that up. Perfect to listen to in the car if you're driving in the rain or at dawn. Really can't praise it enough.\n\nAlso the game runs great for me. I've had a cheap GTX750 and a GTX980 and it's been a smooth 60FPS on fullscreen whenever it's on my screen.","February 10","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tables play as if they are made of bricks and the balls are way too light. This game can be fun with friends but not against the ai, if you miss a sigle ball heck even if you don't pot anything on the break the computer will clear the table. Game has been this way since I first purchased it, I was hoping it would get better over time but I was wrong, nice going devs I wasted money on this and I'm guessing others did too.","January 20","false","41.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
