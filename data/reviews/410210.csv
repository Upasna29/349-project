I loved the Wipeout games, is this a modern take on it?  Sadly not even close.\n\nThe first problem I encountered is that there are no insturctions on how to play.  I selected the first of what appears to be 3 stages, got in a match against three other racers... and sat there.  The other ships zoomed off, and I was pressing my keyboard and mouse trying to figure out how to move.  I quit out of the game and looked for help, tutorial, anything.  In the end trial and error by pressing every key on my keyboard I discovered "X" was the magic key I needed to press to figure out how to go forward.\n\nAlright, so no controls are posted.  That isn't a great sign.  Still, now I finally know how to play.  Get ready world.... Wipeout clone here I come.\n\nOh, no, wait.  You only can choose from one ship.  The controls are sluggish.  The tracks are boring.  Wipeout used the vertical element in its track design to great effect.  This game has only a few race tracks to try, and they are bland and no fun to race on.  And at all times I felt like I was fighting poor controls.\n\nThe worst part though in this generic knockoff tragedy, worse than the lack of instructions, the poor controls, the bland music and the boring race tracks.... is that even once you take the time to really master the game it isn't fun or satisfying.  Hitting an enemy ship with a weapon does not have any sort of satisfying impact.  Hitting boost arrows never leads to those "breakneck speed chains" you would expect in a title like this.  In fact, at the end of the day you don't seem to be able to go very fast at all.... in a racing game.\n\nI liked some of the particle effects, and it about ends there.  This game is a chore to learn how to play, and even once you do there is no fun waiting to be had in the mastery of the mechanics.\n\n1/10","May 14","false","3.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Simply a minimalistic white background with triangles and numbers. I had to figure out by myself what I was looking at. There's absolutely nothing intuitive in the game. Not to mention the fact that we're obliged to sign up on the devs website before even thinking about starting a race... in a game that doesn't even features multiplayer. But the worst is yet to come...\n\nSince there is no option menu I also had figure out the controls by myself. Left arrow and Right arrow are for changing direction but what about acceleration? Isn't it the Up arrow? No it's not! Why would you use the Up arrow in the first place!? Thanks to Shinryu's review on Steam I've been able to start a race without wasting too much time looking for the acceleration key (which is "X" by the way).\n\nThe two first races I played simply look bland, short and repetitive (be careful not to race out of the map). Thanks to the very narrow track there is simply no way to complete the 5 laps without hitting the wall every 5 seconds. Here, the steering would need some tweaking.\n\nThe visuals are minimalistic at best but at least they fit with the sci-fi setting. During the race I experienced some framerate drops which is unacceptable for a game that looks like a game made in the late 90's (the early 3D cards era). But since it's using the Unity engine, what was I expecting? Also, if you use video capture software the game will freeze during recording.\n\nOverall, I would only recommend this game if you're a masochist that promote "no taste gaming" like me.\n\nI dare you to watch this 3 minutes video to the end!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcMBeg7KRZ4\n\nRating:\n2.0","October 21, 2015","false","2.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","4"

The graphics are ok, some say they are ugly or outdated but to me it doesn't matter at all, I really like them. It's like a simple, old silly racing game and it's ok, but nothing more than ok.

He was so sick of being in the pits of the race instead of actually racing. Well, this all changes.  On Febuary 26th 2094 Sam gets his big break. in the middle of the Spacetona 500, sponsored by Sprint and Can-Am, the driver experiences some heartbreaking tragedy as his grandmother passes away and is announced over the comms inside the ship. Feeling undetermined he pulls into the pits and resignes as driver for the m&m's car number 18. As the crew and managers scramble to find someone you volenter as the driver, and is accepted. Now the game starts when you are thrown into the race and you end up winning. 3 weeks later you find out the driver has killed himself.\n\nAfter the amazing proformance you are premoted to the driver of the m&m's car, the most laughed at and least winning car. As you do more races and earn a reputation as the saviour of m&m's, you start to get new cars and even get invited to the Sprint Galactic Cup, the most prestigious racing championship of them all.\n\nOverall the controls are well explained and well mapped, the graphics made me think i was actually there, and finally the story was so well written it was the first game to ever make me cry.\n\nOverall rating 9/11 Loved it.\n\n\n\n\nNone of this actually happens however and this game is ♥♥♥♥ 9/11","January 31","true","7.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","6","8","8","0"

Hey, it's cheap, not well known. I wanted to try it out and see if it was at least alright.\nIt's not at all alright. This is worse than most games on early access. You don't even get any controls! I had to go to the community hub on this game just to try and figure out how to accelerate. Eventually I figured out how it's the X button, with left and right arrow keys to move.\nThe graphics aren't good either. Graphics aren't everything, especially for cheaper games. But being a ♥♥♥♥ game and not even having decent graphics? ♥♥♥♥ that. Don't pick up this game unless someone gifts it for you, or if it's on sale for less than 50 cents and you want some cards.\nTL;DR : It ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, don't bother with it.\nHopefully the devs will make a better game.

No tutorial or guide of any sorts, unorthodox and uncustomisable controls, the races are too hard with no adjustable difficulty, and so many game-breaking bugs for such a small game. I like the art style and music, but that's purely personal preference. I bought this because, despite the mixed reviews, I thought it would be fun to farm the trading cards, but if you're planning on doing the same: DON'T, especially if it's not on sale.

Most people use controllers for racing games.\n- No options at all, for binding the controls, etc.\n- Graphics are PS1 level.\n- Very unforgiving, if you hit a wall once it slows you down to nothing and you usually cant regain your place.\n- The physics are wonky, if you hit a boost it goes straight in that direction instead of being able to drift around corners.\n\nIt's a nice proof of concept but it needs a lot more work before it can be a decent game.","December 29, 2015","false","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had to go to the community hub on this game just to try and figure out how to accelerate. Eventually I figured out how it's the X button, with left and right arrow keys to move.\nThe graphics aren't good either. Graphics aren't everything, especially for cheaper games. But being a ♥♥♥♥ game and not even having decent graphics? ♥♥♥♥ that. Don't pick up this game unless someone gifts it for you, or if it's on sale for less than 50 cents and you want some cards.\nTL;DR : It ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, don't bother with it.\nHopefully the devs will make a better game.

There are a lot of things missing from Ampersand that should be present in any respectable racing game. Hell, there are a lot of things missing from Ampersand that should be present in any game that involves driving, period. A common complaint I hear about this game is that there's no tutorial or manual explaining the function of the buttons or powerups. This is true, and a very valid concern, but I find it much more concerning that Ampersand eschews basic functions of driving such as braking or reversing. Considering an easy 25% of the speed boosts on these tracks will slam you directly into a wall, these would have been helpful things to include. If there's anything nice to be said about Ampersand, it's that it is at least priced in proportion to its quality.","March 24","false","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Otherwise...\n\nGameplay:\nI've only played a solid seventeen minutes of Ampersand; the rest is me idling for trading cards so I can make a profit off of this abortion. It doesn't reveal to you the utterly enigmatic controls: left and right arrow keys to turn, X to boost, and Z to use power-ups. You have to get "points" to advance to the next stage which requires placing in the top-three of a given race...which is impossible thanks to the absolutely sluggish controls. So essentially, you're grinding for points on the same two tracks on the starter grid in order to finally progress. Also, I don't know if you have to use the points to purchase vehicles, but the vehicle selection screen outright does not function. If you do indeed have to use points to unlock vehicles, there is no such indication. Furthermore, the powerups are awful; you get a two-second boost ability that does practically nothing, some lock-on machinegun that does even less in the way of destruction than the Death Star in Return of the Jedi, landmines that are more detrimental to yourself than others, a shield that breaks more quickly than your father's condom, and a rocket launcher that, surprise, launches rockets. Your ship also has some arbitrary health system that gets chipped away by taking damage from volleys of enemy pea shooters and ramming into walls--the later of which is inevitable thanks to the aforementioned wacky controls. Essentially, my most recent encounter with a red light at a main-street intersection was a more action-packed racing experience than Ampersand.\n\nStory:\nYou are a bored 17-year-old male who watches more pr0nz than television and wanted to buy a slipshod racing game as a joke. You come to regret your ill-advised decision until you tap into your inner Jew and realize you can profit off of the transaction by selling Ampersand's trading cards and promptly refunding it.\n\nGraphics:\nThis is a PS1 port. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nOverall:\nThis game gave me breast cancer even though I'm a dude.\n2/10","January 1","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I can excuse the mediocre graphics and the bland music, the gameplay kills any enjoyment you can have with this game. Your ship constantly accelerates and decelerates on its own while you are holding down the X button. Turning successful is very hard to accomplish. Not even the enemies can turn properly. There are no brakes in this game and the boosts only hurt your chances of making a turn. However, you need to use the boosts in order to win.\n\nTo sum up the gameplay of this game in one word, it is boring. I was fighting the controls and the layout of the track more than I was fighting against the other ships. Speaking of the other ships, I hardly saw them at all during my races. After the 2nd lap or so, everyone moves at a constant pace. No one is passing anyone nor will the 1st place ship give up their lead to me.\n\nOverall, I don’t recommend this game to anyone. There isn’t anything redeemable about it.\n","January 1","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise...\n\nGameplay:\nI've only played a solid seventeen minutes of Ampersand; the rest is me idling for trading cards so I can make a profit off of this abortion. It doesn't reveal to you the utterly enigmatic controls: left and right arrow keys to turn, X to boost, and Z to use power-ups. You have to get "points" to advance to the next stage which requires placing in the top-three of a given race...which is impossible thanks to the absolutely sluggish controls. So essentially, you're grinding for points on the same two tracks on the starter grid in order to finally progress. Also, I don't know if you have to use the points to purchase vehicles, but the vehicle selection screen outright does not function. If you do indeed have to use points to unlock vehicles, there is no such indication. Furthermore, the powerups are awful; you get a two-second boost ability that does practically nothing, some lock-on machinegun that does even less in the way of destruction than the Death Star in Return of the Jedi, landmines that are more detrimental to yourself than others, a shield that breaks more quickly than your father's condom, and a rocket launcher that, surprise, launches rockets. Your ship also has some arbitrary health system that gets chipped away by taking damage from volleys of enemy pea shooters and ramming into walls--the later of which is inevitable thanks to the aforementioned wacky controls. Essentially, my most recent encounter with a red light at a main-street intersection was a more action-packed racing experience than Ampersand.\n\nStory:\nYou are a bored 17-year-old male who watches more pr0nz than television and wanted to buy a slipshod racing game as a joke. You come to regret your ill-advised decision until you tap into your inner Jew and realize you can profit off of the transaction by selling Ampersand's trading cards and promptly refunding it.\n\nGraphics:\nThis is a PS1 port. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nOverall:\nThis game gave me breast cancer even though I'm a dude.\n2/10","January 1","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it's a TERRIBLE Wipeout.\n\nYour ship doesn't actually go where you are pointing.  I mean it does, but when you corner and you would expect your ship to point in that direction and momentum slowly moves you that way... it doesn't.   You still point the other way but you move weirdly to the one side.\n\nNo controls page.  No options.  Nothing!    No tutorial.   The first course is incredibly hard, but it's made worse by the bad control systems.\n\nThe only reason i have hours in the game is the cards.","February 6","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no explanation of controls, I had to figure out that x is acceleration and z is use powerup through hitting random keys. The hovercraft is extremely hard to control; it slides around the map while the computers have no trouble avoiding walls. There is no indication of how one gets points or even what these do. I thought it would be 1 point for third, 2 for second, and 3 for first, but I got third place on the first track and second on the second and only recieved one point each time. Some other hovercrafts are locked as well as the 4th and 5th maps but I have no idea how to unlock them. The powerups are unexplained so I would just use them immediately upon getting them, but even if I could see what happened I have no idea how effective they are or how to use them strategically. It is very hard to cathc up to the computers, the only way I was able to do it was by passing them after they had blown each other up, but this means that getting first place is seemingly impossible. Overall this game could be a lot better if it was a little more polished but at this point I'm just glad I got it for 14 cents.","December 22, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, had to ignore it to make corners.\n-Very little motivation for performing well in the game, other than to play more of it: no sense of victory when you beat the first place goal in a level, and the AI opponents don't really feel like opponents tyring to win...more like lifeless husks just doing their thing.\n\nInstead of playing this, just watch a video of Wipeout or F-Zero on youtube or something.

Even at the 0.59c I bought it for it's not worth it! There is absolutely no options menu so you cannot check controls, or change display settings or turn off the god awful music. Steering is all over the place and there is no controller support either, just the letters X and Z on your keyboard and the left/right arrow keys to move. If it was an early access game I'd say ok, it needs more work, but since this is the final product...I cannot recommend it at all.
