While this doesn't have the depth of a Hearts of Iron game, it's still a hell of a lot of fun to build massive stacks of armies and steamroll every country that dare stand in your path. It all really plays like a board game, the seasons that limits such actions as spying or subversion to the "RISK" like combat system. It's definitely a good game for those days when you don't feel like spending a whole weekend fighting WW2 in HOI but rather conquering the world in just an hour or two.\nP.S. Don't attack the AI too early. Big mistake.\nReview and Tutorial:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-4liP6LbfI\n\nUPDATE TO THE VIDEO:\nSorry about not mentioning the event system that is in the game, someone clarified for me that there is an event system already set up in it! :) Add that to the pros.","July 28, 2015","true","10.1"," 107 of 115 people (93%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","93","107","115","15","5"

Would it be Yes, Ja, Da or Hai that the world will be referring for a positive answer?\n\nColonial conquest is a turn based strategy game set in the late 1800’s.  Upon choosing between France, Germany, Russia, England, USA and Japan, you will be presented with a map of the world. You will have four turns per year corresponding with the four seasons.  For each country you acquire during the year, its economy will be added to your treasury just in time for spring.\n\nHow funny it is, that not only flowers rise in spring! - Armies do too, you know! Now it’s time to purchase more troops and ships from your factories and plan your next move or you could build fortifications in the countries you already occupy. Hold on, make sure you have enough money to spy on the next country who will need to have language lessons. Maybe you will help other countries who might fall under your enemy by sending them money. Bribing is also an option but that will cost you a fair bit!\n\nUnforeseen events during the year can help you or can go against you. The cost of the troops could be cheaper that year or you could lose 10% of revenue in certain countries, as an example. Many other things may occur in a year.\n\nGreat soundtrack, I really like the classical pieces in this game. They create a great atmosphere and put you in the mood for conquering the world.\n\nFive levels of difficulties in regards to the AI, From Soldier to General. One thing you could do is invite five of your mates and see which nation will win (playing on one computer, as I did many moons ago playing the original game on my state of the art ATARI ST computer!!) MARVELLOUS MEMORIES!!\n\nColonial Conquest is very easy to play which makes this game extremely addictive and fun.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Easy to play\n-	Addictive and fun\n-	Great soundtrack\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No trading cards\n\n8.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

While I can't recall the name of the game this one seems to be closely modelled after, it was released circa 1985-86. I would load it off of a 5.25" floppy to play it on my dad's Comodore 64 or very early IBM when I was a pimply-faced youth who thought INXS, The Church and U2 were good music. The Church is still ok, I guess.\n\nAnyway, enough nostalgia. You play as one of six countries: the UK, Germany, France, USA, Russia, and Japan. Just as in that old game, the UK is the best team to play, as its units are the most combat effective, but also the most costly. The combat effectiveness of the remaining five countries is roughly in the order I've listed them. While cheap units might be nice when fighiting lots of indigenes, they won't try to invade you. So  given that you need to send ships to conquer the whole planet, and each ship is laden with 1,000 troops, troop quality really does matter.\n\nBut otherwise the strategy is the same as the old game. It's somewhat like Risk, except troop and ship quality vary by nationality. You can subvert neutral countries, as well as bolster their defenses, and both actions require cash money. Your country's resources are not deliberately upgradeable, but you can build forts. Random events can also improve the productivity of your home regions, or make troops and ships cheaper. Random events can also destroy your foritifcations, eliminate half your forces in a region (though the revolt still leaves you in control of it), and other somewhat pestery predicaments.\n\nWHAT'S NEW?\nWhat does this game do better than the first version? The graphics overall are improved. It also has the ability to scroll in and out the map scale on the fly. Additionally, there is some impassable terrain, usually in mountain ranges, making it more fifficult to blitz across the continents. There might also be an ability to randomize the combat effectiveness of the different countries, but that isn't entirely clear. I'm pretty sure that the four seasons in one year mechanic is new. Not sure if the season actually matters, though, for combat or movement purposes.\n\nOVERALL SCORE:\nSo, I'd give it a 6.8/10 on the Ontario university marking scheme, which translates into a C+ to USians. Heck, maybe even a 7/10, which translates into a C+/B-. If you want a blast from the past, this will do it. If you can get it on sale, so much the better. I paid 10.99 CAD for it, and I still got a good 6 hours out of it before I wrote the review, and will likely play it again.","September 13, 2015","true","8.0"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","39","44","2","0"

They certainly got their hands on a good artist.  What you see in the screenshots is exactly what you get.  Unfortunately that is the ONLY thing you get.\n\nWhat the game promises, and what it delivers, are two very different things.  The video on the store page suggests a cunning and strategic game of influence and military control over the uncivilized regions of the globe, but don't be fooled: The game itself plays rather like a game of Risk where you can't see your opponent's pieces and every coastal territory is adjacent.\n\nThe game proceeds through 4 seasons each year, with the Spring phase being where you do everything, and the Summer, Fall and Winter being largely wastes of time.  Troops can be moved around in every season, but it is only in the Spring that you can perform essential actions such as Espionage, Collect Income, and build troops (which can be used immediately).\n\nEspionage is the ONLY way you have of learning about the world. The stats of all provinces are mysterious to you.  That troop numbers might be hidden to you is understandable...but their Income and Victory-Point value as well?  It is impossible to make any strategic decisions in the game without espionage, but this can only be done in the Springtime and anything you neglected to scout then remains invisible to you for the rest of the year.\n\nAttacking territories has a strong defender's advantage.  The defending troops get to fire first and inflict losses first before the remaining attackers get their chance to fire.  In fortified territories the defenders get two rounds in the opening phase of combat, and in industrial centers they fight at double-strength all the time.  It is entirely possible to have your entire attacking force be massacred in the first wave if you bring insufficient troops to the fight.  But that's a big IF.  You see, a player will quickly figure out that if you attack with ENOUGH troops, you can just eat the first wave of fire, and then obliterate the defenders on your turn.  Anything less than overkill is wasted lives.  The power of an army is proportional to the square of their numbers, and you would be a fool to attack with anything short of a "Stack of Doom".\n\nOptimal play will then result in each player gathering their troops together into a massive army coupled with a massive fleet with which to ferry it to any shore in the world.  The game becomes like a blind-folded  knife fight.  Guided by weak and out-of date intel and random guessing, the armies flail at one another hoping to stab each other's vital territories when they are insufficiently defended, block imagined or anticipated moves, and attempt violent retribution when injured.  Against an AI with random moves, it is nothing but a guessing game.\n\nNow though I might fault Argonauts Interactive for any number of game design sins here, a little bit of internet research revealed that this is a re-make of an old SSI title from 1991 also helfully called Colonial Conquest.  All of the games sins are in fact ORIGINAL SINS.\ncorrection: Argonauts actually changed the combat formula in this version in a way that negatively impacts the game balance.\n\nThe product that Argonauts Interactive is bringing us is a Faithful Re-Creation of that old game.  Some praise is due to them for reviving a retro-gaming classic. ...But they don't need all that much more praise, since they already had a successful Kickstarter campaign.  And really: if you're going to resurrect a classic game from the '90s, shouldn't you pick one that was actually good?\ncorrection: the original was from the '80s and is in fact decently enjoyable.\n\nWhat we have is a skilled team who have brought us a broken classic.  The original wasn't any good, and so the remake isn't any good.  This game has the potential to become good, but this can only happen if the developers abandon their nostalgia and change this into a NEW game.\n\nUpdate:\nI have done some research on the original game, and found to my surprise and pleasure that it did NOT descend into a blindfolded knife-fight.  The 1985 SSI classic is a better game than I had been lead to believe.  Better than this game in fact.  The developers made a mistake in their implementation of the combat system, and this change wrecked the game balance present in the original.  A windows-compatible version of the Original can be found here for comparison: http://lightquick.co.uk/coconet-version-1.0-ssi-colonial-conquest-is-back.html\n\nThere is still much work that needs to be done before I can honestly recommend Argonauts-Interactive's game.","August 3, 2015","false","57.0"," 66 of 94 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","66","94","3","7"

But in the end if you have ever played RISK with players whose only strategy is to make a giant hoard and bust loose every few turns then you know how this game plays.\nThere is really only 1 type* of combat unit (Infantry) and every battle more or less becomes entirely dependent on who has the larger stack, (with only a small consideration for forts and terrain). *(Yes there are ships but they are really only used as transports for your 1 type of land unit; and this is made tactically dull as any coastal province connects to any other coastal province in only 1 turn.)  So perhaps slightly more depth than RISK but certainly less than another board game classic like Axis & Allies.\nThe premise of managing an economy is also enacted too thinly as there are far too few things to spend your money on; infantry, ships, forts, or spies – that’s it. The card collecting strategy in RISK has as much or more depth.  Could we not have cavalry, artillery, fort upgrades, both transports and fighting ships, factory placements, research upgrades perhaps leading to aircraft?\nBased on the current price of the game $7.99 USD / $10.99 Cdn compared to the play / replay value I cannot recommend this game.\nFun: 4/10\nTactical Depth: 2/10\nHistorical Value: 2/10\nPlayability (does it run): 8/10\nReplay value: 2/10\nOverall: 3/10","January 21","false","6.1"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","31","42","0","4"

It's got a lovely charm to it and it's great to play for an hour or so and pick it up again later. Of course, for the price you're getting quite a small and basic game. It's fun to play, however I think it would have been brilliant if you could play with friends over the internet.\n\nThere are 4 seasons every year in this game, just like real life. You can do pretty much everything in the Spring such as raising an army, build boats, spy on other countries, support other countries with economical help, pay off armies to desert the country which weakens the country and fortify your currently owned countries.\n\nThis adds quite a challenge to the game, you can't just build a massive army every turn you get. It's strategic. You have to save your money every year and purchase what you need in order to take over as many countries as possible.\n\nEach civilisation is basically the same, apart from where you start and what prices your army / navy is.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a fancy, polished risk-like game, I'd certainly reccomend this game; afterall, it's not that expensive at all and if it's not for you, get a refund before you put 2 hours into it.","August 1, 2015","true","2.9"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","1"

I hope the developers continue to improve and expand on it.  I wish that there was just a little more to it.   To really hold my attention it needs three simple things... Artillary, cavalry and officers.  The artillary and cavalry would give it that "rock/paper/scissors" aspect so that it's not just a numbers game... and officers could affect the efficiency of your troops (A Sergeant for instance could add 10% to your troops making a force of 100 fight like a force of 110, escalatng from there) Generals could be expensive but any officer that survives a battle could get a field promotion. SOmething like that that could give it a little more strategy.\n\nThat being said I really enjoy the game it's a great palette cleanser after a session of EU or TW.","October 9, 2015","true","35.7"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","1"

Sign me up.\n\nUnfortunately, the game barely handles on my primary computer. I suffer large interface latency; for example, there is a pronounced time-delay between mousing over something and that something being available to be selected. It's annoying to have to wait 5 seconds when I want to do the fundamental tasks of the game, like build armies or move troops. And the combat experience was just awful, because I wasn't sure who was firing and there was lag and frame-drops abound.\n\nThis experience drove me to not recommend this game. Almost.\n\nI decided to take a more fair approach, and test the game on my laptop. The game runs fine on my laptop. In fact, the game is quite enjoyable on my laptop. I played it long enough until my laptop overheated and crashed, but that's pretty much my fault for living in a hot environment.\n\nActual criticisms for the gameplay stem mostly from the interface feeling awkward in certain spots. For example, when accidentally selecting an option for a region such as moving troops, there is no visible way (that I could find) for cancelling that action. Using the escape key works, but that went against my primary intuition.\n\nAlso, there is a strange bug when entering values via keyboard for moving troops. It always subtracts one from that value, so when you say to move 50 troops to an area, it only moves 49. For what it's worth, the slider still works fine.\n\nOverall, I will have fun with this game. Its super appealing to me and the game is pretty polished. I'm just hoping for the compatability issues and bugs to be worked out so I can enjoy it on my desktop.\n\nIf the devs see this, my desktop is an AMD FX-6120 @3.4 GHz with a nVidia GeForce GT 630 while my laptop is an intel i7 4700 @ 2.4 GHz with a nVidia Geforce GT 750M.","July 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","2"

Unfortunately, in the case of Colonial Conquest, this attempt went too far and missed the mark. It is by far one of the most shallow strategy games I have ever played. Essencialy, the playes chooses one from out of six colonial powers and basically keeps piling up troops and navy to protect its territory and invade the other. The minors powers are just up there for the grab, and the AI is simply incomprehensible in its strategy even in the most advanced levels. Think of Risk without any specil objectives other than amass the most territories. Strategy fans will be certainly frustrated because the game is simply lacking content, whereas people looking for more casual strategy game, with an easy to grasp learning curve will find out that Colonial Conquest is simply unfulfilling.","December 25, 2015","false","6.7"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","6","20","0","0"

There's 4 turns per year, one for each seasons. You do not need to maintain you army so it's possible to build up an insane amount of troop which some time you need. With you money you can train troops, build forts and do 2 kind of 'political' actions.\n\nTo goal of the game is to get a set amount of victory points by capturing zones. Each zones is worth a random number of VP and revenu.\n\nI've seen a couple of weird thing, like small neutral provinces with more troop then any super power. Panama had over 30k troops. If you own most of the map (90%+) you can build about 2k troops per year (unless you are Russia which build troops for half the prince of the other nations). So controling the world it would take you about 15 years to just match the force of a minor neutral nation and that would not even be enought to scratch their defence. That pretty much was a buzz kill for me.\n\nYou can also kill one by one the troop in neutral countries as a political action for the price of training 2.5 troops (5 for Russia) which make this action absolutly useless. You can also give them money so they can buy troops to make it harder for other nations or you could buy the troop for you to conquer more land and get more money for more troop... so yet an other useless action.\n\nAn other point is there is no real political mechanic in the game everyone is at war and that is it.\n\nOn a final note the AI is just horrible play on hard if you want at least a tiny challenge.","January 7","false","14.4"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","4","17","0","0"

Basically a remake of the SSI classic with the same title.\nPicture it like a stylish and more sophisticated version of Risk without the complexity of Paradox games like Victoria. The game is set in the Victorian age and lets you play any of the major powers of that time. Each nation plays differently which is a great plus. Germany fields strong armies while Russia has weak but cheap troops. Some nations are better attacking, some defending. Some have expensive, weak navies, other excell at naval warfare.\nThese differences force you to play to your nation's strengths and weaknesses. Awesome!\n\nIf you want to conquer the world in one evening, you will enjoy it.\nIf you only enjoy monumental grand strategy games that take weeks to finish, then don't even think about buying this.\n\nI grew up with games like this on the Commodore Amiga (back in those days we thought "Kaiser" to be a complex game). My favourite games today are Hearts of Iron and Victoria 2, but I can still appreciate old-school games like this.\nIf you're not sure that you'll enjoy it, go watch some youtube-videos.\n\n----------------------------\nLearning curve:\nThat's another perk of these games. You can just load the game and start. It's very accessable and intuitive.\n\nHere's a guide I wrote on suggested opening moves which will show you what I mean:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491002648\n\n---------------------------\nState of the game:\nStill a bit rough around the edges, but most bugs have already been fixed just days after release. Developers' support is phenomenal. They actively communicate and listen to the customers and provide constant patches.\n\n-----------------------------\nUpdate 31/07/15\nJust finished my first game.\nNaval warfare is bad. Ships are basically teleporters. 500 ships teleport 500 units from A to B, regardless of range or hostile fleets on the way.\nShould they fix any of that I will update this review. Until then I will deduct a point.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nUpdate 05.08.2015\nGiven up on the title until there a major changes. The naval teleports completely destroy the game. The devs are working on the issue though. They seem to listen to the community and hopefully will fix it. Until then I will lower my score.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nUpdate 07.10.2015\nAnother patch, another wasted opportunity to substantially change the game. Risk offers deeper strategy than this one. Teleporting units from one coastal province to any other on the globe completely destroys the game. The devs promised a lot, but didn't deliver.\n\nTotal score (updated)\n3/10","July 30, 2015","false","9.3"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","19","3","16","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordZounds/recommended/341030/","LordZounds","Lord Zounds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordZounds/","587 products in account","This is a bad game.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely simplistic, the interface is atrocious and the mechanics are obfuscated to the point where nothing makes any sense.\n\nThe gameplay is centred around cycles of four turns. In the first turn of a cycle, you buy soldiers and boats in your starting provinces. You can also do other things this turn, although it's generally pointless. You can commit "subterfuge" to gain a province by dumping slightly more money onto that province than it would cost to hire soldiers to take it. You can sign peace treaties by dumping money onto other countries, meaning the AI won't attack you until you're ready again. You can fund neutral provinces to slow down your opponents (by dumping money on said provinces), but because you're spending your money it slows you down as well, so it never makes any sense to do this. You can fortify a province, although it never seems to be worth it as retaking a province is generally less effort than defending one. Finally, you can spy on provinces. Spying on provinces is the only way to get any idea how many soldiers you might need to conquer a province. It's not particularly expensive, but it takes so many clicks to spy on each province that it becomes too tedious to bother, when usually they only have a few soldiers anyway.\n\nIn the next three turns (as well as  on the first turn) you can move your soldiers and boats around. Boats can travel from any coastal province (almost all provinces are coastal) to any other in one turn, making the geography irrelevant as almost every province might as well be adjacent to one another. Attacking provinces is basically guesswork, hoping they won't have too many soldiers relative to the number you send. As mentioned above, you can spy in the first turn of the cycle to see how many soldiers there are, but even if you do this they've probably moved by the fourth turn of the cycle. Battles are a confusing mess where it's never clear exactly why you won or lost, and the after-battle report doesn't explain things either.\n\nAfter the fourth turn, you collect income on your provinces and do the process over again. Between turns the game tries to spice things up with random events, but every event just seems to be "-10% tax income in *province*", "Gain fort in *province*", or "Lose fort in *province*". The AI doesn't really know how to do anything except senselessly invade random provinces. Eventually, you conquer enough provinces and win the game. This is all done while struggling with the interface, where everything seems to take several more clicks than it should. The game looks and feels like it was made for touch screens, yet as far as I can tell is not available on mobile devices, where it would be more at home (although still inferior to much of the competition).\n\nThere is no reason to buy this game, especially not for this price. If you really want a mechanically barebones strategy game on Steam, just buy RIsk. It's no masterpiece, but it's a tried and true functional game that has all the complexity this game has once you get past the first 5 minutes of struggling through broken side-mechanics.","October 6, 2015","false","3.7"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","7","27","0","2"

Personally, I don't think so. The fleets are mainly used to ferry your troops around, and occasionally to defend against naval landings on islands. The extra areas are still big and generic. The historical references are starting positions only and go straight out the window as soon as you end that first turn. Forts are a great defensive advantage, but you will end up just building the things all over the coast because you have no idea how many soldiers the AI has and the enemy can come from litterally everywhere to any other coastline, the defensive bonus becomes negligible when you end up just throwing bigger numbers at them, and the random events are basically a whole lot of "Nothing really happens" or "Your fort disappears". Not seeing anyone else's armies just means you're going to end up guessing and just hoping for the best.\n\nIn the end, there is not much strategy to be had, and it does not simulate anything.\nIs it a neat boardgame? I suppose so. Is it a "Conquest simulation"? No. Not unless you also claim the janitor is a "Senior Sanitation and Maintenance Officer First Class"\n\nDo note that the only multiplayer there appears to be is local, on a game that would very much be helped by online multiplayer. There also appear to still be bugs.\n\nIf you absolutely love and adore Risk, you'll probably enjoy this. But for anyone else, I just can't recommend it. It grows stale quickly and you will find yourself mostly just throwing armies around in the hope that it does something. And if it doesn't work, you're going to just try again with a new army a few turns later. Rinse and repeat until you've conquerred the world.","August 8, 2015","false","4.6"," 9 of 33 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","9","33","2","6"

There is no good way to use strategy to beat another persons army, only numbers.","May 22","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I spent hours in the barracks playing the SSI version with several friends. This new version is not too far off the mark. There are still enough bugs to make it clunky, but enough playability to be a new favorite. Would like to see the bugs fixed before any new features are added. Especially the attacking bugs.","May 20","true","46.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It cover the entire world map.  You can do the historical senarios such as the begining of WWI and the Age of Colonialism or just do World Domination,  You can not bet the entertainment value for the price.","May 29","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
