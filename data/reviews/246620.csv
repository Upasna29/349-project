Just exactly how the player chooses to tackle this is up to them.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe player can choose to slowly infect the population, remaining undetected and non-lethal, and then strike once much of the world's population is infected by evolving lethality to kill fast and unexpectedly, making it difficult for the world to react and cure it in time or just try to kill the world as fast as possible which usually results in losing the game as many of the more isolated countries such as Greenland will shut their ports and airports making it very difficult to infect them.\n\nContent\n\nThe player is not presented with just one disease type, but many. These disease types range from a neurax worm which allows the player to manipulate infected hosts to their advantage to the necroa virus which allows the player to unleash a devastating zombie apocalypse on the world. It doesn't stop here though as there is a rather extensive community workshop with countless unique diseases thanks to the scenario creator which is available to every player who owns the game.\n\nMore coming\n\nThe developers of this game are also working on a multiplayer mode which will see two players battle it out to see who's plague is superior. The game is also regularly updated with new content and bug fixes.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Plague Inc is not perfect, it offers great replayability with different ways to beat different scenarios and higher difficulty modes which can really challenge the player. The price is rather steep so I would suggest waiting until the game is on sale to get the best value for money. 8/10 - Great game","November 8, 2015","true","78.9"," 271 of 279 people (97%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","97","271","279","14","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/246620/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPlague Inc.: Evolved; let me first start out by saying, this is exactly how the Early Access model should be done. This game is an absolute treat to play.\n\nThe main idea behind the game, if you don't already know (I’d be surprised if you didn't to be honest), is to develop, mutated and transmit your very own disease. You can choose which symptoms you would like your diseases to have, how you would like it to be transmitted around the world and many other different options. There are a number of different kinds of diseases you can choose, my favourite has to be the zombie plague; each of the different modes offers different symptoms, abilities and ways to transmit your creation as well.\n\nThe graphics are essentially a 2D world map; you don't need anything else for this game, the UI and HUD are very nicely put together and you can get all of the information you require within a key press.\n\nEach of the different modes have been carefully crafted so that no game ever feels the same; this game really makes you think, would this symptom thrive in these conditions? How can I get my plague to travel to the other side of the world when all of the airports are closed? The possibilities are endless.\n\nThe game can also vary in difficulty; each different mode has 4 stages of difficulty; and boy oh boy does it get hard in the brutal stages. You are best of cracking out a guide if you want to tackle some of the harder stages.\n\nI have played about ten hours so far; this has enabled me to complete all the different types of diseases and modes on offer, done a couple on Brutal difficulty and worked on a few achievements. There are still roughly 100 more achievements to collect along with the scenario modes to play; and given that they game is still in early access, I fully expect there to be more content added soon too.\n\nI can 100% guarantee that anyone will enjoy this game; it’s a perfect pick up and play game but you can also get mind numbingly deep into the inner workings of diseases and plagues without having to do six years in medical school.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

There are still missing features, most notably the Necroa Virus type, Tutorials & Scenarios. But allready the game is highly playable and damn addicting.\n\nYou are a plague, you infect people and evolve and the aim is to infect and kill everyone on earth in the end. There is strategy involved in picking the right mutations for your plague, keeping a low profile, not killing too many before you are discovered and later killing them fast enough before they can develop a cure for you.\n\nThere are several different plague types, Bacteria, Virus, Prion and more. They require different ways to evolve them to be sucessfull. The Neurax Worm which was added with the last patch was the most fun for me. The hunting for achievements was fun as well, altough alot of them arent implemented yet.\n\nThe game originally was made for mobiles and is now ported to the PC. It feels pretty good and polished for a port.\nIf i had one negative thing to say about the game then its about the bubble clicking, which gets tiresome and annoying after a while. Also it feels a bit too pricey, ~10 Euros would have been a much fairer pricepoint in my opinion.\n\nYou can get a mobid kind of satisfaction out of beeing sucessfull in this game, knowing that you just wiped out a whole planet. I just couldnt resist getting it, and overall i am sure i got my moneys worth out of it.\n\nAs long as you dont expect deep strategy you will have a good time with this game.\nIts a nice timewaster with suprising complexity below its shell.","March 7, 2014","true","43.3"," 103 of 123 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","103","123","0","10"

The short answer: If you like strategy games, or are fascinated by the idea of creating your own pathogen to destroy humanity, buy this game, especially during a sale.\n\nThe details:\n\nThe base game is a genetic strategy game where your goal is to infect the world and destory it before they can do the same to you. It offers plenty of options for doing so, and the game is simple enough in the lower difficulties for newcomers to get a basic idea of what to do, but in harder difficulties, it is challenging enough for even veteran players to have a difficult challenge. The game has many different plague types and modes to try, including user created plagues.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is also fun, sporting many strategies that counter other strategies, with quite a bit of depth. Would advise AGAINST newcomers to the game from playing that mode first, as it is much more intense of an experience compared to the main game.  Against friends or randoms, the multiplayer is a great addition to an already great game.\n\nI've played this game ever since 2012, whenever the game first started out on mobile devices and there was only 6 plagues and 3 difficulties. This game has kept my attention and still manages to be a fun distraction and experience to come back to time and time again. So, if you seem at all interested, pick it up, it's a strategy game that's worth the price.\n\nP.S. This game will make you hate Greenland. You will understand why.","December 1, 2015","true","11.2"," 49 of 49 people (100%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","100","49","49","14","0"

It is very one-dimensional and once you've figured it out (should take about 15 minutes at most) that's it.  Sure there are levels and things to unlock, but the bottom line is that it should only be purchased on sale.  I paid full price and I regret it.\n\nThe rundown:\n\n-Fun, but the same way a single level of mario is.  You can do it a few different ways and win.  You can unlock things and play it again (in the same way) and win.  Satisfying the first three times and not much more.\n\n-Educating, but not in a good or useful way.  It gives legitimate details about pathogens but nothing else.  Like reading the cliffnotes of "all about disease"\n\n-Entertaining in exactly the same way smallpox was, take that as you will.\n\n-Replayability is hugely limited due to the limited nature of the game.\n\nI'll admit to enjoying it the first two times through the rest of it wasn't so enjoyable.  I know I only show a few hours of the game but that's all it takes.  There's a basic strategy that takes you though twenty minutes of playtime and that's it.  Buy it on sale and enjoy it but NEVER pay full price or you'll be left with the knowledge that you did nothing but pay for an undergrad to fail his midterms.","November 28, 2014","false","3.3"," 696 of 1,031 people (68%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","68","696","1","19","26"

The graphics and gameplay are rather simple but the end goal is to dominate the world with those little red circles of infection.  Timing plays a huge role in evolving and deevolving traits depending on the type of infection.  For instance, if your plague is too severe before you attain widespread infection, humans will begin working on a cure before you have time enough to infect everyone.  Conversely, if you are too wide spread through transmission abilities, you might not end up with enough DNA to be lethal enough before a cure is found.\n\nThe Planet of the Apes add on is very interesting.  I'm still experimenting with it but unleashing a virus that makes apes more intelligent and combat humans is quite entertaining.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/246620/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","Plague, Inc. is a smooth playing simulation and real-time strategy game. It is highly intriguing and elicits quite a few time-sensitive questions on a relevant topic today... for everyone. Whether you are concerned about Contagion, Plagues, last-days scenarios, or bio-terrorism; Plague, Inc. is there.\n\nIt doesn't take too many play-throughs to realize that not all diseases are created equal. But, the game does draw you to multiple play-throughs, as you spin out each scenario, captivated by the results of minor changes in your strategy. The game starts with a basic menu of disease types in the main-game portion: Bacteria, Virus, Fungus, Parasite, Prion, Nano-Virus, Neurax Worm, Bio-Weapon, and finally Necroa (Zombies) and the Simian Flu for those who want to turn Earth into the Planet of the Apes.\n\nThe game is overflowing with feature-rich side scenarios; from real diseases past and present like The Black Death and Smallpox, to the fantasy diseases like Pirate Plague and spreading Christmas Joy, and myriads of others. And, if that weren't enough to keep you busy with the 142 achievements, they have included a workshop, so you can download community made scenarios and/or create and share your own.\n\nHigh Strategy:\nThe premise is simple enough. You create a new disease and your goal is to watch it spread around the world. Naturally, since it is a game, you can't win by simply covering continents. You must wipe out humanity for a victory. You are able to name your disease, and choose the genetic traits, as well as the symptoms and the transmission traits for spreading the disease, whether it is something that spreads from insects, birds, by air, or sea... etc. Then, as humanity fights for a cure, you try to stop the cure before you've covered the planet.\n\nDie-Hard Fan:\nI originally reviewed the game in early access. The game has gone through many updates, and since then I was able to participate in the alpha and beta testing phases for multiplayer, which was added to the game along with the full release. So, I've updated this review to reflect all changes.\n\nThe game has given me more than 150 hours of fun in early release, and now with over 300 hours in-game, I am still exploring all the fun and challenging levels. When I first started exploring this fascinating game, I found I was able to beat the Virus and Bacteria easily; finishing off both in one play-through each. But, I found the Fungus Disease and the Black Death scenario both to be very difficult to spread before they were cured by Scientists. But, they all are accomplished with time. The game definitely contributes to obsessive personality traits, like repeated hand-washing, and 12 hour gaming sessions.\n\nI managed to turn the Earth into a 'Planet of the Apes' with my own Simian Flu on the 2nd try. The first time, I had tried to develop the rampage gene. It didn't spread far before the humans managed to develop a cure. Too aggressive! So, I slowed it down a bit, and worked on the Simian side of the coin; developing colonies of apes, and making it spread among them, while increasing their intelligence. When the Earth was covered, I added deadly symptoms to finish it off with one quarter of the ape population surviving the human drone attacks, which were colossal-scale.\n\nNarrative:\nThe game is imaginative and rich in story, not-surprisingly since plague is the story of civilization. The main game plays out on a world map. If you watch the news bits, and little popups, you see that some countries begin to execute and/or bomb whole cities of the infected, out of hysteria and fear. The disease spreads in real-time, as you are making changes in the control panel to try to counter-balance the reactions of the humans to your disease. But, there are speed and pause buttons for those who want to control the action. Also, in the single-player, opening up map and disease screens automatically pauses the game so you can get back to bursting dna bubbles when you are finished making changes.\n\nI've already decided that Greenland is the place to go in the case of world contageon. They are so isolated that many games are lost simply because Greenland closes their ports to prevent the plague spreading.\n\nGraphics & Sound:\nThe graphics are first-rate; utilizing a variety of color and fx cues to help you monitor the situation as it develops. The different countries are covered with the color of your disease, and then turn to black as the humans there all die. The control windows are amply stocked with a variety of graphs and charts to analyze your disease's progress, and at game's end, to analyze why you won or lost. The music is intense and dramatic. Different sound bits include children singling "Ring Aaround the Roses" which was a children's song from the Middle ages about the Bubonic Plague.\n\nMultiplayer:\nYou can choose games with friends, random matches, co-op or versus mode. Leader boards let you know how your opponent ranks. The multiplayer community is already spreading and many more are dying for a chance to win the co-op brutal achievement. These achievements, though easy to obtain if you have a good working partnership, would probably be more difficult if you don't chat or talk to the other player to coordinate. You can't play "by the seat of your pants" here. It takes team-work.\n\nPros:\n*High Strategy and realistic simulation gaming at it's finest\n*Multiplayer Vs. & Co-op\n*Extreme Replay Factor\n*High level of control-The element of choice makes you feel like a Superman in game. When you make small changes, big things happen.\n*Friendship forming- You will develop close partnerships in the multiplayer co-op, because you won't win otherwise.\n\nCons:\n*You will not finish this game in under 100 hours. My testing buddy 100% it in under 200 hours, even with all the beta testing hours. I'm not finished yet.\n*Though guides are certainly helpful, having a list of steps won't guarantee success because your timing and decisions effect results.\n\nVerdict: Plague Inc is an awesome game that makes the scientific/academic investigation humorous.  You get to enjoy what would seem on the one hand an evil and diabolic plot to exterminate the world, and on the other a biology experiment. I highly recommend this game for everyone above age 12. I rate this RTS game a 10 out of 10.","July 5, 2015","true","302.4"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","45","47","3","5"

The PC version has features added which the mobile version doesn't have unless you buy them (the different viruses) differences listed below:\n1. PC version includes the Necroa Virus, Neurax Worm AND the Simian Flu. For the mobile version you need to buy them which costs $8.96 (incuding base mobile game).\n2. PC version has a new UI.\n3. PC version gives you a bigger screen, and if you have touch you get a bigger touch screen. (Not a big deal though)\n4. Custom scenarios, if you are getting bored of the regular plagues the game gives you, you can play scenarios the steam communtity makes, or you can even make your own.\n5.

Updated frequently, Plague Inc: Evolved is a Strategy and Simulation game where you control a plague in an effort to wipe out mankind. You can evolve, and devolve one of several, plagues, viruses, and worms, in your quest to destroy the world. There are multiple game modes which have their own strengths and weaknesses and require different strategies to win. Converting the world into Zombies with the Necroa Virus, or Enslaving the human race with the Neurax Worm are just Two examples of the variety Plague Inc: Evolved offers.\n\nRecently Plague Inc: Evolved released a 1v1 multiplayer mode, where you can play against others. This mode offers different options than the single player modes and can be a lot of fun. There are so many different ways you can go about playing this game, it can become quite addictive. I would recommend if you enjoyed the App version to get this game for the PC as you will not be disappointed. If you are new to the game, and enjoy killing or enslaving billions of people, this game would be right up your alley.

But hey, maybe it's actually worth the money?\n\nThe game is an advanced version of the old Flashgame Pandemic II, which was a great game of it's time and I truly enjoyed playing it. Actually, that's the only reason I decided to get Plague Inc anyways. Now, Plague inc is a bit more advanced then Pandemic, no doubt. The mutations system ismore complex, the graphics and algorythms much superb...\nBut it doesn't add much else.Once you figured out the basic route, the game is literallyjust clickclickclick-wait-win. Every single time. The different plague types only change that at a minimal level.\n\nLook at my game time. I havejust finished the game, unlocking the cheat plagues (those giving you godmode anti-cure or unlimited evolution points). How? Just by doing the same thing a dozen times over again, with every plague the game offered.\nAnd that's it. And they charge 14€ for that.\n\nNow, a big point for me was the Multiplayer mode. I could really see potential replayability value there...\nBUT it's not even remotely implemented yet.\n\n\nSo, my resume: Great concept (duh, they imported it from a great and innovative old game). Fun gameplay. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ repetitive and no further content to keep you playing. In it's current state, 2-3€ sounds like a nice price. If they really go up ahead and add a GOOD multiplayer mode, I'll gladly change my review. But till then, don't buy this.\n\n\nPS: Quick update:\nThey STILL didn't add the promised multiplayer, but instead keep throwing in 'more different plagues' that play usually exactly like any of the others, adding nothing new to the game.\n\nPSPS: 6 months later, they ACTUALLY added a multiplayer. Albeit I feel trolled by the fact it's not the 'human vs virus' multiplayer I was actually hoping for.","February 22, 2014","false","7.8"," 1,092 of 1,735 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","092","1","0","89"

The virus can do this by itself, with enough time (you will absolutely fail in the end), but you can also evolve it by upgrading several of the many upgrades. For example, you can let birds or other animals and rodents carry the virus to other places and countries, or you can make it less vulnerable to humid environments. The goal is to infect and kill every person on the earth, by all means necessary. And all of this is done in a very realistic way, and it's a blast to play, let me tell you.\n\nOne thing that should absolutely be fixed, though, is the fact that pop-ups (mostly for tutorials) pop up in EVERY SINGLE game you play.

Though the enjoyment you take may be a bit... questionable, I think?\nI mean, you eradicate humanity with a disease. Trying to imagine how people would suffer from your creation would make you sick. Thankfully, all you see is world map and few other windows.\n\nThe difficulty the game provides is very flexible. Either go for a smooth killing spree or struggle with cure progress.\nThis game also features A LOT of upgrades for each disease (there are quite many of them which you can unlock).\n\nCome to think about it, it's a strategy game. You start somewhere and expand until you take over the world. Or in that case, kill everyone (though it's not always necessary).\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode. Both versus and co-op are fun to play and can give you quite a challenge.\n\nI'm not really sure what else I should write about this game. Maybe workshop support? Millions of custom scenarios and an editor to make your own? Yeah, I guess I should mention that either. Oh wait, I just did.

Glad to see they're adding some new things to their PC version. So lemme just recap the good things:\n- You can name your disease "Cuddles" or something ironic like that\n- You act as the god or scientist on a sattelite, upgrading the abilities, symptoms, and the types of spreading of the disease while watching over the world, making sure your virus spreads by any means necessary\n- Any player can play this game pretty easily once you get the basics handed down. If you're just a casual gamer like me then just go to casual mode, or if you like a challenge and realism go to Brutal mode to test your knowledge on how a disease outbreak can destroy the earth (in the game of course :P)\n- The game itself doesn't require a good PC to run, I'm running this on my laptop which has a medicore graphics card and it still runs fine with no issues.\n- Loads of information on the screen, both based on your disease and world events (news, cure research, activity, etc)\n- The disease tree allows the player to add a more personal touch to their disease and it doesn't force you to stick to a certain pattern to win, contradictory to what I just said it all depends on your knowledge on how an epidemic starts. For example: a disease that can only be spreaded through water and hot climates will eventually be cured if the traits are kept that way because the world is smart in this game.\n- Diseases in the game have a pretty "realistic" nature. If a disease can be spreaded through kisses and hugs it can do that. Be careful though, humans are realistic too, and will eventually thwart your plants by stopping people from hugging and kissing each other eventually. Plan your diseases carefully and upgrade them to the best of your abilities, or personal taste. Make sure to stop the humans from finding loopholes to your epidemic by finding loopholes in their ways of curing people or at least stopping the spread.\n- Controls are pretty straight forward, just point the mouse and click. No need for mulitple key bindings if you don't want too, but that's up to personal preference to dictate whether it's good or not to have a game relying on a cursor most of the time.\n\nNow lemme recap the bad things:\n- Trying to attempt this game in real life (by that I mean actually starting a real disease) will get you in big doo doo\n- If you can't understand what disease is and how it spreads, as well as basic disease terminology, this game may be difficult for you\n- Blindly picking stuff from the tree is bad, I've been there and had my disease stopped on Casual difficulty (the easiest difficulty in the game). Reading IS required for the game since the symptoms and diagrams provide you with hints on what each symptom and trait your next choice have and how they behave.\n- Recap: Reading is required. Not too much but you need to at least have a basic understanding of reading and some big words. If you don't like reading, then this game isn't for you.\n\nAll in all this game is great! I hope they keep developing more things to add to it. Been a fan ever since the app came out for phones and tablets, still a fan for the PC version :D","November 30, 2014","true","7.7"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","41","52","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rosina/recommended/246620/","Rosina","Rosina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rosina/","101 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReally excellent game.\nIt's a simple plague simulation game that involves a lot of strategy to try to infect and destroy the world. The infection patterns are quite realistic. To start off, the plagues are fairly simple bacteria, but you unlock crazy plagues (allowing zombies, for example).\nGames are pretty quick, running 10-30 minutes from my experience.\nYou can name your own plague, creating many hilarious phrases to pop up during the game. Stick to singular nouns or proper names and you will get some amazing combinations.\n\nFor anyone worried about it being early access, there is more than enough content to keep you busy for a very long time. If the creators hadn't told me it was unfinished, I wouldn't have known. I still look forward to updates (which the developpers are keeping up with), but it's not an incomplete game without them.\n\nOn a science note, the only real problem I have with this game is how mutations occur in all the Plague cells at once. In actuality, a mutation would only occur in one instance and then have to spread again from the new patient 0. It makes the "infect everyone then evolve deadly symptoms" tactic to lose some of the magic.","March 13, 2014","true","16.0"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","0"

With all kinds of different disease/virus types, gene modifications, and the choice of which symptoms you want your disease to display in its patients.\nDifferent ways the disease can be transmitted, resistances to temperatures and different climates.\n\nI like to think of this as a kind of "total world-destruction solitaire". Take that how you will.\nSome of the game is very skill-oriented, where as some times on harder difficulties you may rely on the chance of your disease spreading to other continents and having to re-try several times, if not sever dozens of times. So that's the luck part.\n\nThis game is very in-depth strategy that puts you in the role of a vengeful, wrathful evil god (or perhaps scientist, who knows?)\n\nIf you ever played the popular flash games Pandemic or Pandemic 2 years ago and enjoyed them, this is your game.\n\nIt draws obvious inspiration from those games, but adds even more depth and realism to the strategy involved.\nMore ways to destroy humanity, more information on how your destruction is coming along, better visuals.\n\nIn all ways imaginable it is a beefier, better re-creation of Pandemic into a higher-tech envinronmnt than just flash games would be able to bring you.\n\n\nOverall, for being in early access, I still feel like I got more than my money's worth. Plus, there's new content being added, constant fixes, and upcoming multiplayer with versus and co-op.\n\nEasily a 10/10\nHighly recommended","December 5, 2014","true","74.5"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

Really glad to see it in the steam store!\n\nIt's an interesting - if grim - plague simulation/strategy, wherein you get to "conquer" the world with a different kind of "empire."  Despite how unbelievably morbid the concept is, it's actually a pretty fun game.  It's good for a casual way to pass time, and its harder difficulties offer a lot more challenge for those who really enjoy strategizing and thinking about the next move... because one wrong step can actually throw your whole game and see your plague destroyed.\n\nBeyond that, there's a bit of learning to be had as well, if only because the information pages on each of the countries are like little encyclopedia entries that offer up real world information.  Of course you don't HAVE to read it, but it's pretty awesome that it's in there.\n\n10/10 for sure, even as early access.  It's a complete game.  It's fun and engaging.  You might even learn something while you're frightening yourself with the strange ease of wiping out humanity.  Unless you turn up the difficulty, in which humanity becomes a little more tenacious.  :)","October 31, 2015","true","6.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

It's one of the most complete games I've played. Rather bug-free as well!\nTo the game: I don't feel like explaining what this is about, you can find that info elsewhere, easily.\nAs for the price-tag, if you're planning to explore the game to it's fullest, i.e.: do all or most of the achievements, you can spend a LOT of time with it. I spent about 50 hours in game (counter shows more but idle and so on..) and that's about how long it took me to do all of the achievements. And these get really hard in the end! But it adds to the fun for me. For people who are uncertain as to if this game's worth the money, I recommend just trying out the phone version. Yeah, the content on the mobile version is largely the same, but due to the nature of touchscreens and the capability of phones, it's rather dull on phone - I feel. Sometimes you just lack the tempo to do certain tasks in a certain speed on touch, while on PC it's much easier with all the hotkey and mouse controls. It's simply more manageable. Aside from that, on mobile you have to pay for "DLC", while on PC you get everything for 14 bucks. Also you have triple speed here on PC, while only double speed (max) on phone. To everyone saying this is a slow game, I recommend upping the game's speed, you'll have your hands full with work, especially on higher difficulties.\n\nIf you're the kind of person that's not even interested in playing a game to it's fullest, someone who's like "yeah I'll try every mode out once on the easiest difficulty and move on" then no, this game probably has very little to offer for you and thus rather low value in regard to it's price.\n\nAs for the multiplayer that's still in development; I feel multiplayer on a game like this is needless. But apparently, people seem to enjoy it (unlike me). But I guess MP is, in today's world, a high value proposition for most of gamers.\n\nAnyway, if you've liked what you've read and seen, maybe stumbled across this review, I can wholeheartedly recommend buying this game under the above circumstances.\n\n","January 10","true","70.5"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","27","34","2","1"

I think that despite it being in early access, this game is already quite ready for sale, with no glitches or crashes, but the devs are fixated on creating much more, including multiplayer. I played the game a many times and found that its methods were highly legitimate, as the different events that often occur such as the Olympics allow the plague to travel more quickly to other countries around the globe. I particularly like the way your plague can evolve into a greater, more deady, and more infetious disiease (I once made everybody s**** their pants in public). The game's "street veiw" is not as cool as I had expected it to be, but the graphs and such that display the amount infected, deseased, and healthy, as well as the depiction of the country's state of emergency both helps and entertains. It is fun to watch people fall disaterously to your evil, diabolical plague. This is my opinion of the coolest strategy game I've played for a very long time.\n\n8/10","February 25, 2015","true","10.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","23","28","3","0"

Well, there's a reason for that. This game is bland. It's the same thing over and over again. Doesn't matter if you play bacteria, virus, bioweapon, or parasite. No matter what you start as, you well end up doing the same thing: getting cough and sneezing, upgrade water and air transportability, increase cold and heat resistance, get a single point into drug resistance and maybe a point into slowing research, wait until the whole world becomes infected, then upgrade to total organ failure and whatever else you choose to accompany your leathality.\nThe real "trick" of the game is doing just what I said, but do it quickly. There is little to no challenge to it and there's no reason to deviate from a certain "be all end all" disease build unless you want to roleplay that your disease is unique which causes paranoid people to stay up all night ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants. Regardless, you'll end up getting coughing, sneezing, and segway into total organ failure (and I know you will).\nThe game costs more than the mobile version and has less content with little to show for. I know it's "unfinished," but these silly early access games keep biting me, and other gamers, in the ♥♥♥. By the time the game becomes something fun or original, I would have already been left with a sour taste in my mouth with no want to play it again.","February 27, 2014","false","3.5"," 363 of 628 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","363","628","3","46"

You have to either infect 100% of the world population or have the other plague getting wiped out by making humanity focus on the cure for the other plague or kill all it's hosts (passively or actively).

The game is clearly something unique and interesting. You can develop your own strategies, which you actually need to do for each disease type. Bacteria and viruses I find are very similiar to what they are in real life - so for example viruses are mutating very quickly which is actually true based off of real life studies. I highly recommend the game for the unique idea, good gameplay, low hardware requirements and of course the hyper-realistic world. I hope the game will get better and better as I did find few bugs or errors with the workshop maps which could be caused due to the Scenario maker and not the author him/herself. I give the game a solid 9/10, would recommend.\nPS: I did play the game on my friend's account for a long time until I could actually buy it.

The game pretty much speaks for itself. Though the game sometime feels like it is designed for smartphones, it is very fun nonetheless.\nNO SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nPros:\nThe Idea of Plague Inc is very unique and the concept is very nice.\nThe Gameplay is fun and addictive.\nThe Variety between the types of plagues is good.\nThe Zombie and Planet of the Apes Plagues are a ton of fun to play with.\nThe Atmosphere at the end of the game is very chilling. As the last humans are dying, everything on Earth stops which can give you such an erie feeling.\nThe Steam Workshop makes this game 10 times better. User Created plagues with custom timelines and traits are very awesome.\n\nNot Sure:\nI don't like clicking on my screen every couple of seconds to catch the bubbles. This clearly is a mobile mechanic in which you need to keep clicking on your screen. When you level up, eventually there is a gene which automatically pops the bubbles for you which a must have.\n\nCons:\nThe Game does get repetitve after you figure out the formula for the game which doesn't take that long.\nMany major countries are missing from the map.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nOverall, Plague Inc: Evolved is a very nice game. Though it does get repetitve after a while, there is plenty of fun to be had playing this game.\nI give Plague Inc.

IF MY OPINION CHANGES DRASTICALLY OR WHENEVER THE GAME IS RELEASED FROM EARLY ACCESS, I WILL REWRITE THIS REVIEW.\n\nDo you or have you ever despised humanity? Do you like video games but you're tired of the same old shoot em ups? Do you want something (fairly) new and unique? Well, my friend, this is the right game for you!\n\nCreate a disease from a variety of disease types (which you have to unlock... fun), select special traits for your disease (also unlocked... more fun), select your difficulty, and infect Patient Zero. You then choose some skills to evolve your plague to make it more lethal, easier to infect others, or resist outside forces (i.e. temperature and drugs). Unfortunately the governments of the countries aren't very keen on the idea of you eliminating the human race, so they'll shut borders, airports and harbors and try to cure your disease, so you'll have to race against the clock to infect the world and evolve enough lethal symptoms to kill the world. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, there is a bit of strategy on choosing which country to infect, whether you want to be able to infect by air or water first or if you want to invest some points to get bonus infectivity in colder countries. More strategy comes when you get traits for your disease, since they add bonuses to infectivity, extra DNA points, and a couple more nifty abilities. Each disease has some varying traits, like virus evolving frequently, biodisease being so deadly you have to suppress the lethality, nano-virus being built in with a kill switch that you must race against, and there are much more. It's worth it to unlock the diseases, since some of the cooler ones like Neurax Worm (mindcontrol) and Necroa Virus (zombies) are unlocked a bit later and it's always fun to mess around with those. There are also random events that happen that will affect the game, making each experience different.\n\nThe display looks nice and it's easy enough to see what's going on. There's a cool little body chart that shows you where in the human body your disease affects. You can see what's going on in all countries, how they're combating your plague, how their cure research is coming along, and if the government is still stable there or if it's falling apart.\n\nThere are also scenarios where you mess around with stuff, mostly stuff like little to none plane transmission, a mirror version of Earth where all of the countries characteristics are reversed, a virus that's DNA is damaged, affecting its transmission, and some more. Steam Workshop also makes an appearance, letting you create your own scenario. The communuty for this game is pretty large and I can see multiplayer being popular when the dev releases it.\n\nThere are some problems I had with the game, most of them small however. Mostly minor stuff like Portugal being part of Spain, Alaska being part of Canada (to be fair, the dev makes fun of this in an event so I dont care about that :P), Hawaii being nowhere to be seen yet, minor stuff like that. I can see this game becoming a bit repetetive, but it hasn't become that for me yet. One thing I would like to see, though, are different... I guess maps, you'd call them. Stuff like the continental USA with all of the states instead of the whole world, the providences of Canada, a map where the melting of the ice caps has flooded the world, stuff like that. That would make the game more replayable.\n\nRegardless of any criticisms I may have, Plague Inc Evolved is a breath of fresh air with plenty to offer and more to come. 9/10. Never has a game made me hate a country for no good reason like this one has. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Greenland... Anyway, get this game now. It's worth it even at the full $15 or your regional equivelant. Just know that this is an Early Access game, so the game isn't complete yet. However the dev updates frequently, so it could be coming out of Early Access soon. Either way, though, it's worth getting. So get it. NOW!","December 23, 2014","true","47.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

Otherwise, the game meets its own goal but I can't recommend it since it's painfully static and repetitive. I spent 2 hours playing it but it felt more like 20...\n\nToo long part\nThe game has very fascinating background and it's very exciting to discover everything it has to offer at first. But as you go on, you realise that while the content is wide, it's also quite shallow. You basically spend your time staring at a world map and some pulsing red dots progressively expanding over time.\n\nThere are also red, orange and blue bubbles to pop every now and then, which in all honestly seems like a very very desperate attempt to make the gameplay look more dynamic. I imagine this whole concept works amazingly on mobile devices but it's just not good enough on a PC.\n\nAnother way to spice things up is various events which occur in a more or less random fashion. Most of these are opportunities which can be abused to spread your disease faster. Problem is that these events tend to happen on the other side of the globe and you don't have enough resources to react in time.\n\nI also feel like there is a huge gap in the difficulty levels, as Normal can basically be beaten by not actively doing anything at all while Brutal seems almost impossible in comparison. If humanity starts working on a cure and you havent infected every single person on the planet yet, you basically lost the game because you usually don't have enough resources to deal with the cure development and security precautions. At Brutal and Mega Brutal difficulties the discovery feels very random which is what makes it so hard and infuriating.\n\nFun thing to note is that island countries become impenetrable fortresses once the cure development starts and you haven't infected anyone in there yet.","June 17, 2015","false","2.1"," 106 of 179 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","106","179","5","8"

That being said, I think the devs did such a great job with creating the atmosphere for this game with how the game is visually displayed. I played this game way back when there were only a few different game modes and I have enjoyed watching this game develop and progress the way it has. On the preview screen where you can pick your disease type (aka: game mode) they give you a preview of what the virus actually looks like. I think this is such a simple touch but it adds so much to the game. It won't leave you wondering what in the world a prion looks like haha. They show you the diseases being transmitted and they show you how many people are dying and becoming infected. They show you pictures of the world becoming devastated. It's really cool and simple.\n\n*Sound: (10/10)\nAgain I have nothing really to complain about or to critic on for this section. They add music which creates the atmosphere for the game, they add sound effects for when you collect points, when people start becoming infected, when they develop a cough you hear people coughing; it's really subtle though, don't worry. Plus half the time you're too busy wondering what your next move should be to even listen to the background noise but with out it, would this game be the same?\n\nHours to complete: (10/10)\nThis varies. It depends on how long it takes you to infect everyone, how long it takes you to kill everyone, how long it takes you to read through all the transmition options and abilities as well as learn them. How many different times you had to retry to beat the disease, etc. However, you can get so much play time from this game. Not only are there 10 different disease types to chose from, there's also 4 different difficulties for each one. Not to mention the 139 different achievements there are.\n\nStory line: (10/10)\nIt's pretty self explanatory. You're controlling a disease to devastate and kill off humanity. That's literally it. I will give it originality points for sure.\n\nGameplay: (6/10)\nWhat? You didn't really expect me to give this game all 10/10 did you?? No matter how much I love all the little details and everything in the game the most important section is the gameplay of course. So let's start off with how this game works. You pick your disease, you name it, you pick where in the world you want your disease to start infecting, you wait for DNA points (this is how you upgrade your disease) you select how you want it to transmit, you select how you want it evolve, you wait for everyone to become infected, you resist their cure efforts, you select your symptoms, you wait for everyone to die, game over you win. On to the next disease type. This is literally the entire game. Now there are a few different disease types that do follow a different order in order to beat it, for example, the necroa virus. (aka: zombies) but for the most part, you're following the exact pattern I just listed above. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game and there's a lot of customization involved, but will you be playing this game for 6 hours straight? Probably not. You'll most likely get bored of the repetition with in the first few hours. That being said though, it is a nice game to have if you're bored with the other games you have and need a nice little break from them. Or for procrastinating like I am at the moment.\n\nPrice: (7/10)\n$14.99 currently.\nThe price is meh. You get all the customization, all the achievements, all the unlimited hours of game play, etc etc. But why it hasn't fully sold me for this price is only based on the fact that I can't find my self playing this for hours straight. I don't want to pay $15 for a game I'll get bored of within 2 hours and have to come back to later you know? If that doesn't bother you then go for it, if it does, grab it when it's on sale.\n\nOverall:\nI love this game and have for years.\nI would recommend this game to people who like:\n> World domination\n> Achievements\n> Customization options\n> Casual games","February 20","true","5.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","15","17","3","0"

What I like is about this game is that it's a game that requires you to think and use at least a bit of strategy. Also, it has quite a bit of replay ability to it (if that makes sense), and it can be somewhat addicting at times. I'd really recommend playing this game is you have some spare time.","October 18, 2014","true","98.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
