"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/370920/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewCosmophony is a small rhythm game with five songs to play, where you control a small ship, and need to dodge incoming obstacles. The concept is simple, the controls even more so, but the difficulty curve is one of the most abrupt I've seen in rhythm games.\n\nThe Pros:Good Music - The most important aspect of a music based games is, well, the music. It's a collection of five Drum&Bass songs by the same artist. There is sufficient diversity between them to entertain, and the melody is catchy too!\n\nLovely Design - The game adopts a minimalist approach when it comes to graphics and UI, and damn, it looks good and makes it easier for your eyes to notice screen elements more easily. Here your reflexes are really important, and a good plain color contrast between obstacles and the road is welcomed. Minor shading is also present. The menus look very sleek and I like them too.\n\nEntangling Challenge - If you could pass each level on the first try, it would only require you 25 minutes of your time to complete the game. However, that can easily turn in quite the few hours because it is very challenging. But it's the good type of challenge - the kind that has you replay the level again and again because surely a stupid game isn't better than you. Come on, you can do it!\n\nFree OST - You can get the song files for free as a DLC. Be sure to get it from the app page.\n\nAchievements - There are only five: Complete level X. Which is great for achievement hunters... assuming you can complete the game.\nThe Cons:Insane Difficulty Curve - Level 1 is easy. Level 2 is a bit harder, but manageable. Level 3 requires a couple dozen tries to get accustomed to, Level 4 is... holy $#!^. Level 5... I haven't reached yet.\nConclusionYou pay 5 bucks (coupons are fairly common, too) for five songs and a nice reflex game to encase them. Free OST, great deal, good if you have time (and nerves) to kill.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/recommended/370920/","blaxpirit","BlaXpirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/","516 products in account","I kept going back and forth on this game, even considered giving up on the last level. But I've been enjoying it immensely the whole journey.\nBecause the video trailer is misleading (in a negative way) and tells you nothing about what Cosmophony feels like, I encourage you to see my gameplay video (no commentary). I hope you can understand how enjoyable it was to play the game in this manner.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=564193901\nThe first two levels allow you to follow the tune to a great extent and can be perfected by anyone, and the game is totally worth it for that feeling alone. The following levels, though, made me feel confused. At first they just seemed like a bunch of random obstacles. But understanding came with time and practice. A big component in this game is memorization (yes, the levels are not generated; same every time). Usually I'm an opponent of memorization, but here it's very pleasant, because the levels are indeed tuned to the music. Knowing what comes next in the music is vital for knowing when to expect the obstacles. And the so called "muscle memory" helps with the obstacles themselves.\n\nTo complete a level (a bit under 2 minutes each) you need to go through it from the beginning to the end without failing. It's a bit annoying that the difficult parts are usually towards the end. But the game can't be blamed, because there is a practice mode with plenty of checkpoints and free traversal between them. For more casual gameplay you don't even have to play outside of the practice mode. Even so, the final levels can be a nightmare to complete if you don't get into the right mindset.\n\nCosmophony is played mainly with 2 directional buttons which let you switch between the 7 lanes. Then there is the shoot button which you should use whenever there is a special kind of obstacle in front of you. This mechanic is very simple and there is no penalty for spamming the button all the time, or just evading these obstacles. Even so, this mechanic is beneficial to the gameplay. If you want to make the game even more interesting, you can try to shoot to the beat instead of just spamming, like I did in my video. Destroying every destroyable obstacle is the requirement for "perfect" completion of each level, but it's not something that everyone should do (there aren't even achievements for this).\n\nAnother thing I would note is that, especially in the later levels, the music's rhythm sometimes corresponds to when the obstacles pass you, and not to when you need to move away, so you need to make a big mental effort to not press the keyboard button when you hear a beat, but instead anticipate it and move before it.\n\nGraphics are nice and clean. Music is made by a great Drum&Bass artist Salaryman.\n\nIn conclusion, I really liked the game, but I realize that it may be just because I'm part of the target audience and because I worked around potential annoyances to make it interesting for myself, so can't give it a 10/10.\n\n★★★★★★★★☆☆","November 28, 2015","true","10.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/370920/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","Cosmophony is a difficult but satisfying rhythm runner with psychadellic visuals and a fantastic Drum and Bass musical soundtrack. I am a huge fan of all rhythm games and this is no exception.\n\nI would describe Cosmophony as falling into both the genres of runner and rhythm. It is relatable to the style of the likes of Temple Run and Subway Surfers. The screen itself moves by itself and you can only control your ship to move left and right. You have to avoid the objects that appear in your way. Through this you will also encounter so called enemies that you can shoot. The enemies don't actually attack back though so that's why I don't like the title of enemy for them.\n\nWhat I prefer to call "enemies" is stars or collectables. This is because the reason for killing them is 100%ing the level. If you manage to shoot every star then you get 100% on the level. So this is an extra incentive to get them all.\n\nYou are helped along in Cosmophony by it's rhythm element. All the obstacles and enemies appear in patterns that are with the beat of the song. Everything seems to sinked fantastically well to the beat and really makes it a lot easier to follow the flow of the game. At the start of each level seems to be about a 30 second simple intro sequence to get you into the beat. This definitely helps instead of chucking you straight into the difficulty. However after dieing loads of having to repeat the level from the beginning everytime you get really bored of this simple start.\n\nThe pyschedellic graphics and the soundtrack go together perfectly. The soundtrack is entirely drum and bass. It has a wide variety of differences in the tracks and has points of slow music and points of fast beat. Within the background while playing you get an assortment of colours and strange effects. You sometimes get images in the background or get the colours be distorted. I love these effects but I can't help but think they could have used them a lot more than they did.\n\nCosphophony is very difficult. Each level get's progressively more difficult. You will have points in the level where you are having to extremely rapidly press opposing buttons to avoid a barrage of incoming barriers. You will die a lot and you will have to restart each level a hell of a lot of times. Despite how difficult is though I never found myself getting angry with it. I was always determined to get to the next level. I'm currently on level 3 and i'm still determined to complete it and get to level 4.\n\nThe game includes only 5 levels. This may not seem like much but each level takes a lot of retries to beat. But despite the fact of this I think they maybe should have included a few more than 5 levels or given the option for people to make there own. The only achievements as well are for completed each individual level. I mentioned earlier that you can 100% each level as well but there aren't achievements for doing this. So therefore you don't have too much of an incentive to do it. I think they could have made more of an effort in putting in more achievements to add in a bit of replayability.\n\nReally there isn't a huge amount of content in Cosmophony but the content that is there is done to almost perfection for the rhythm genre. If your as big of a fan of the rhythm genre as me then I would definitely recommend this game to you. I mean the price of £3.99 isn't too much to ask of you really. Although if you don't like difficult games and having to repeat\neach level multiple times to win it then this game is definitely not for you.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided with a free key by the developer to write this review.","September 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToGJerot/recommended/370920/","ToGJerot","Jerot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToGJerot/","579 products in account","While I enjoy it, I feel like a lot of the difficulty comes from memorization more than actually being a difficult reaction/precision game. Mechanics change mid level with no time to react, targets are hidden and require specific movement to setup a way to reach them. (Trying not to spoil anything) On the fifth level the timing of the gimmick mechanic seems really dodgy one moment and fine the next. I know where I'm supposed to be positioned at what time, but its hit or miss if the game reacts like I expect it to. Might be better if there wasn't any delay between key presses and lane switching but theres a small delay that is easily noticable when trying to quickly move from one side of the screen to the other. Makes hitting some of the timing goals a lot harder than they need to be.\n\nThat being said its cheap, the music is good, and its definitely an interesting game. If it ever goes on sale I couldn't recommend it more. But 5.50 CAD is probably the upper limit on what I'd spend on 5 levels with no level editor. (User generated content would be amazing, and if that ever happens, I'll be buying a copy of this for all my friends :p)","July 17, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game itself is simple and only requires you do dodge and shoot. Without a shadow of a doubt, there are more interesting endless runners out there.

I do not mean to revise this, so expect a messy review.\n\nCosmophony is, in general, quite a fun rythmic shooter. I actually found myself needing to use the music to manuever throughout the levels! There are 5 levels, split into 10 sections each which you can practice individually in the practice mode.\nGraphically, this game at first gave me a bad impression, but then i ignored the graphics and started to see through to the gameplay.\nMy biggest complaint about this game is that the level can launch things at you so quickly that it almost seems unfair the first few times you play. It could call itself fair by saying that you could get past these obstacles with ninja-like reflexes, but it still is something that will make you rage. There's also quite a difficulty spike once you get to level 4.

I got a coupon for this game and thought I'd try it to see how it was.\n\nIt's not often a rhythm game feels as high-intensity as this does. With a spectacular Drum & Bass soundtrack (that's free dlc as of writing this review) and three buttons to control the main gameplay, this game's easy to pick up and enjoy.\n\nThe gameplay strongly caters to moving and firing your 'ship' to the rhythm of the song; it's not very apparent in earlier levels, but after level 2, the fact that the levels are based off the rhythm are what make the otherwise impossible levels a playable, enjoyable challenge. One thing to note is that the game gets pretty hard pretty fast; then again, there are only 5 levels, so each level counts for 20% of progress. Of course the first 40% of the game would be easy; at level 4, naturally one would expect a game to become very difficult towards the end of the game. One thing I enjoyed about the game is that during each level, it's easy to ask "How can it get any harder than this?", only for your mind to be obliterated into tiny little bits when you reach the next level, especially after clearing level 4; I personally believe Stage 5 is preparing me for Dark Souls. To get a feel for just how hard the game gets, I looked at the global achievement stats; 7.3% of players have cleared level 4, and 2.9% of players have clared level 5 (as of writing this review).\n\nAs stated before, there are 5 levels, and 5 achievements; one achievement for clearing each level. And like Geometry dash, there's a practice mode (complete with checkpoints) so you can practice different sections of each stage to your hearts content before attempting to clear the level in one go.\n\nI paid just shy of $2 with a coupon, and as of right now I feel every penny was worth it.

The music is amazing and the mechanics can be fun, but by the final level you have a certain specific path that you can't deviate from at all, and it becomes entirely about remembering what comes next and what specific moves to make when that happens, with the music giving you cues. The previous level is similar, but with a little more room for variety, and the first three are more like other rhythm games. Those I played though on the first try for 1 & 2, and a restart or two on 3.\n\nOverall I did have a good time with the game, and I'd recommend it to people who don't get frustrated easily, like D&B (or uptempo electronic music in general), and can handle a challenge.

Its really fun and the music is pretty great but I must mention a few things for any prospective buyers:\n- It's extremely difficult and  by that I mean there aren't many stages but you will spend a lot of time repeating the same stage over and over in order to complete it, and the only way you get to the next one is by beating the previous one on normal mode which means beginning to end, no mistakes.\n-Some of the timing is extremely close and many of the stages set you up in ways where pure reflex will not get you through it, as you will discover that a certain way was a trap and you have to go a different way instead, or the timing is so extremely close and something is moving at you so fast that the only way you will dodge it is if you know thats it coming already.\n-As each level consists of segments of the song (checkpoints) which repeat different patterns you will be hearing the same short part of the song over and over everytime you die which will be alot, so just be warned.","July 29, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the few games I can crush my son at: if you play twitch shooters like COD or Destiny, your reflexes are too jacked up to relax and move rhythmically.  I laughed so hard watching my "multiple headshot COD killstreak" son writhe and twitch spasmodically while dying in the first 5 seconds of every level, and raging while I breeze through levels, bobbing my head to the music.\n\nVery short, though.","April 17","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
