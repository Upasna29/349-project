There are fewer things in this world as satisfying to me as building a system that can automate a task so I don't have to be directly involved once the system is running. Set it and forget it.\n\nThis game does that really well. After I get a production chain up and running, it just take infrequent checking to make sure it's still meeting the needs downstream.\n\nThe issue is, they don't keep running. In the current build of the game, the buildings (not just 1 specific one, but any and all of them) stop producing or stop delivering items. Output stops, so the chain breaks, and everything downstream that relies on that building stops working.\n\nUp until I got to Tier 3, I was able to keep an eye on everything and keep deleting and readding the chains as they would break. With Tier 3, I have 4 islands running and I can't manage it. I've had to wipe and start over 3 times because it got so broken, buildings collapsed because their needs weren't being met, and there was nothing I could do to catch back up.\n\nThis is the only bug I've found, but it's game breaking. I can't continue to progress in the game while this bug is in the production build of the game.\n\nThat said, I will be monitoring DAILY for an update to come out so I can resume playing.\n\n8/10","May 14","true","11.0"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","33","34","0","1"

At first glance the graphics are very minimalistic and when you first start the game up you might think this a negative. I think it's a rather well thought through design decision. As the game progresses past the setup of your first few buildings the screen quickly gets filled with information, but the simplicity of the graphics design makes it easy to keep track of it all. There's small visual ques on the buildings that show you the rate of production or if there's a hiccup somewhere and production has stopped. Clever design that quickly becomes second nature to read.\n\nThe music adds a soothing backdrop and I quickly find myself in the tycoon game spirit of just wanting to optimize this one thing, just one more supply route to sort and it'll be perfect, but you're never quite done. You keep chasing that next big payoff while trying to manage your resources. Your goal never seems out of grasp and that makes this game rather addicting.\n\nI will say that at first this game bombards you with information. It's not immediately obvious how things connect and what you need to do. But the tutorial is amazing. It shows you the steps without being too long so if you forget and come back to the game later on you can quickly blast through the tutorial to be reminded of the motions.\n\nThere's a great depth to how far you can go with the streamlining of your production and the devil is in the details. It's all about the blueprints. You set each building up to produce something and there's generally a blueprint for it. There's default blueprints which you can use to get a basic idea of a setup, but beyond that you'll want to fiddle with them a lot to up production and thus your cash flow. I love the idea of the default blueprints because they let you get on with the game quickly and help you save some 'oh ♥♥♥♥' moments where you've missed a vital part of your production chain. I also love how you can change them and build your own setup using a variety of fun tools for your workers. Who doesn't want to use a jetpack to quicken the process of goods delivery in a supply chain?!\n\nI see some people are having trouble with the text size, but this is because the game launches at a low resolution. Simply bump it up to where you usually play your games and all the text is easily readable.\n\nAs I'm writing this there are some issues in the game, as is expected with an early access game. Some menus overlap eachother in an annoying way and some internal workings need a little bit of streamlining, but I've not had any crashes or hiccups or gamebreaking bugs. I'll be keen to watch this game develop and evolve because even though some edges are a little bit rough right now you can really tell there's a true gem at the center of this production.","April 2","true","3.7"," 50 of 64 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","50","64","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/luckz/recommended/454060/","luckz","luckz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/luckz/","4748 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBlueprint Tycoon uses the production management systems you might find in games like Factorio or Stronghold and dials it up to 11 with the addition of a SpaceChem-style puzzle of instructions that has to be completed in each building in order to produce resources. You are required to engage in both the building placement and building ratio exercises that will be familiar from the initially-mentioned games (or from Big Pharma, which has been described to me as a 'building placement puzzle game'), while also striving to upgrade your production technology, making sure your buildings are operating in a logically efficient manner, and so on.\n\nYour workers and researchers (as well as other henchmen) require both food and pay; if you continually fail to satisfy their needs, they will abandon you for greener and presumably jollier pastures (i.e. it's quite possible to lose in this game).\n\nIn the release version, there is both more content (via additional scenarios) and a much improved playing experience. The launch saw Steam Achievements added as well, which made me replay the content I had previously plowed through, and I'm positively delighted with the changes. Buildings now clearly communicate how much they are producing versus how much they theoretically could be producing. You still need to do the mental gymnastics of figuring out how to solve this (for example, my iron ore mine eventually had a full output queue not because of some transportation problem but simply because I temporarily had no need for iron ore and all my stockpiles were already filled up), and there's still a few minor snags (UI bugs mostly), but overall it's much improved. The tutorial has been split up into separate parts explaining different concepts, while the Steam Workshop provides the potential for endless extra content. The only thing I could still complain about is the rather monotonous music, but you can't expect a varied soundtrack for $3. Hours of fun!\n\nA review copy of this game was provided by the developer.\n\n\n======================\nPrevious complaints (Early Access build):\n\nThe big problems present in this Early Access release all are of a User Experience (UX) nature. The interface makes it hard to figure out how the building ratios should be to each other and how optimised your production is; often the interface is clumsy when it comes to managing routes and production; when there is a warning message associated to a building, there is no easy shortcut to find the affected building, and buildings that are not producing for one reason or another so far don't communicate clearly why this is so. A lot of manual troubleshooting is required if your production process hits an unexpected snag.\nBecause of clarity issues with regards to the interface, the "plan" stage of "plan - produce - profit" is moderately unavailable at the moment.\n\nThe music and the graphics assets give off a strong placeholder vibe, but the game's very name betrays that that is sure also intended by the developer.\n\nConsidering the game has been available to the public for mere days, and the developer's track record patching previous games, I'm confident these points will be addressed in due time. For what it's worth, the game retails for a pretty nice low price.","April 7","true","11.2"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","2"

Its not about building and managing a single facility. Its more of... managing a whole array of different industries. But I digress - its a "Factorio Lite" with a sub-level building aspect you find in SpaceChem but then again, I dont think this would do the game justice\n\nTo start: YOu get an Island and a mission - produce a certain good a number of times. Based on the Scenario the Item you need (or rather the chain of Milestones leading up to it) are more or less complex. Starting with get some workers, Research an item for a better contract, get more workers, do more research... The things are usually similar but always need careful planning to do, because your resources are either limited to a certain part of your Islands or the biggest and most non-renewable resource - Space - might run out.\n\nNow, while your tech level inceases, so do your possibilities - and the needs to get those possibilities running, and with that your systems get oh so complex. And once something stops its the fun of debugging.\nOnce my Jewelery-factory didnt do jack because it had no gold ingots. Turns out the gold ingot factory couldnt handle its waste management because it was still outsourced to the mainland, but my ships did no longer load trash\n\nThe Graphics are simple, but they dont need to be fancy - you can see everything you need. Everything is marked in a way that describes the building and thas all that counts.\nthe game comes pre-packed with 6 scenarios, 3 tutorials, 3 regular campaigns and a Campaign Editor to ake your own scenarios to share on the workshop\n\nOverall: if you like continous problem solving and optimization, theview of a machine that ends up well oiled and working and are on a tight budget this is your game.","May 15","true","6.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerrien/recommended/454060/","zerrien","Serg [goAggro.com]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerrien/","178 products in account","I'm on the fence about recommending this game. For its price, you can get a few hours out of it, but, personally after playing it, I was left with a few questions as to where certain features are.\n\nThere are (from what I was able to see,) 6 campaigns. The first 3 are tutorials, the latter 3 being actual scenarios to play through. Each scenario is like the previous scenario, except 'bigger,' which, doesn't necessarily mean better. Instead of expanding gameplay, each scenario is just more of the same, with more requirements and longer production chains.\n\nThere is no freeplay or sandbox mode.\n\nYou are told how much 'profit' you are missing out per-tick, which causes (for me,) a mental overhead of trying to min-max each industry, only for the missing profit to spike again after unlocking the next 'quest' inside a scenario. I can accept missing out on profit, as long as everyone is happy and I can work on another part of the mission without a big reminder of how not-perfect my current supply chain is.\n\nIn the tutorials, there is a demonstration of 'optimizing' each building, except, most buildings come with a premade optimal default you can select. I got excited after seeing there was a potential of 'optimize' my buildings, except, in the first two scenarios, the premade default is good enough/the best and no optimization is needed.\n\nI didn't really understand the relationship between workers, income, and consumption. I usually just overbuilt until someone complained, as I didn't have access to any sort of meaningful stat: "Workers consume 1 food per day, and this building produces 5.2 food per day."\n\nI was hoping buildings would be able to produce a range of materials depending on the blueprint selected, closer to SpaceChem. Instead each building only produces a single resource.\n\nFurther, I was hoping we could toss more workers into a single building and change the blueprints to account for these new workers. Instead each building has a fixed amount of workers, so there often isn't even a reason to change the default blueprint.\n\nMinor, but it got on my nerves after awhile: too much bright blue. I like the idea, but it was a bit annoying to stare at the sea of blue-tiles for a few hours straight.\n\nIF it was in Early Access still, my vote would've been 'sure, maybe.' Since it's out of Early Access and there may no longer be any support: 'stay away.'","May 17","false","1.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

Get goods to the right place, in the right amount and at the right time. Everything is connected to it and it's essential.

In the conclusion you have a one big mess and don't know how to change things so you simply give up if you are not a masochist.

I'm right on the cusp between 'positive' and 'negative' on this one.\n\nBasically, if you're familiar with them, this is a variant on the Anno series games.  That is, it's about building complex supply chains, and dealing with the logistics involved in moving lots of stuff around.   Like Anno, it's split up among uslands, with different islands being good at different resources.  Unlike Anno, the islands are TINY.\n\nThe fundamental engine is pretty interesting, but the space problem is so overwhelming that I end up not having very much fun with the game.   It's just.... it becomes such a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to try to work around yet ANOTHER space problem.  There's never enough room for stuff, so you can never build what you really want.  Getting through a level of Blueprint Tycoon ends up feeling like work, because it's just this endless hassle trying to figure out where to squeeze something else in.   The way the buildings all have fixed entry and exit points only exacerbates the problem, making it fairly impossible to use space very efficiently, when using space efficiently is THE thing you have to do.  It's very frustrating.\n\nAnno has similar complexity in their economic model, but you've got like ten times as much space to work with, and you don't have the facing/spacing issues.  I find those games a LOT more fun.\n\nI'd enjoy BT more if the islands weren't so tiny.  But, as is, I got a few hours out of it (it says 19.6 right now, but I actively played it about eight), and I'm done.  I just can't face the tedium of trying to build up yet another economy on five or six postage stamps.","May 29","false","19.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","7"

Endless Loop Studios have also previously developed Survivor Squad, Survivor Squad: Gauntlets, which are top-down survival-horror tactical squad based games and Gamecorp DX also a management simulator\n\nCurrently, there isn’t really a story but the basic premise is that you take the role of a Logistics manager given the task of completing various scenarios in the most efficient way, therefore, maximising profit. Whilst in the current alpha version (0.08) there only exists a tutorial and one scenario, it takes a fair amount of time to complete both of those. There are of course many more scenarios planned as well as a scenario editor with Steam workshop integration to extend those much further.\n\n(for more see preview: link at top)\n\nOverall, I have to say this is a very promising game, it has a fairly long way to go (0.08 remember) I definitely think Blueprint Tycoon is going to be a lot of fun, whilst currently, it feels very casual and could benefit from a form of multiplayer in the vein of Offworld Trading Company where you compete to produce X at the cheapest price at the fastest rate. There is a lot to love here, add to that a lot of people – myself included feel the game is rather underpriced at the current £1.99 price tag. I’m very excited to see what comes next with Blueprint Tycoon. Also, the former coder in me loves the various endless loops that the initial loading screen has for the developer splash segment.","May 3","true","17.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This game is also in early access and this review is current for the game version of April 3rd, 2016.\n\nBut now that the disclaimer is above and my bias gone, I must say that I really enjoy Blueprint Tycoon!\n\nWhen it comes to gaming, I am a huge fan of games like RimWorld, Factorio, Spacechem, Big Pharma, and many others. It is beyond my own reasoning that games, like Spacechem, I love but yet play very little of due to the level of difficulty or increased effort in games with poor integration in teaching a player how to play. Spacechem was a game that screams in its influence into Blueprint Tycoon, from using the blueprints in individual processes at the many locations that produce and accept goods in BPT.\n\nNow that being said, BPT does incredibly well where Spacechem failed. Spacechem was tough to learn due to the type of tutorial that it used to teach a player. BPT excels in teaching a player the basic concepts, then eases you in objective based learning on how to play the game. It took myself twenty minutes to learn and play, and further learning was then done on my own without help of the game. This is what makes BPT a lesser complexity then Spacechem, but the same level of depth in regards to what the player is doing.\n\nWith all that, BPT is complex, entertaining, and ever growing. In this early version, the game does have a long way to go but already has plenty of signs of incredible promise and a devoted set of creators. I look forward to playing this game more, touching on emotions and enjoyments from my days playing Theme Hospital, (attempting) Spacechem, and Big Pharma. Creating webs of production and supply, with that hint of business and logistical planning to create your island paradise. A game much like Anno, with a different level of depth and complexity, also has pushed influence into this game. Your island needs strong presence and attention, with the need to keep your people fed and trade strong.\n\nThere are a few downsides to the game however, in this early dev version (Obviously a work in progress) saves are buggy and can cause corrupted loading. Sometimes objectives are not good on explaining themselves, nor trigger completion when the player does the task. It is a little buggy, but never the end of the world or crashing out. A huge note here, this game is for early access and is obvious in its road to a complete game.\n\nFor the price paid present, it is an incredible display of what the creators want to go in their final complete game. I think it would make for a great game for those who loved games like Big Pharma, Spacechem, and Anno.\n","April 3","true","2.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

There is no proper introduction (which is not good), but once I got the hang of it, it was really great. As the name already implies, the blueprints are the USP of this game and this is indeed true. They are important enough for the "bigger picture" during a mission, but still require you to invest quite some time to improve the default blueprints.\n\n\n- At the moment it is possible to overcome one of the biggest hurdles of the game, which is meeting the needs of ALL groups of workers, by researching everything and then simply getting rid of the complete researcher (and needs) + lab (vials) prodction lines. Feels wrong, but makes it easier\n- The complete UI is still not finished yet (I hope). Controls feel very clumsy at times, especially managing routes can become bothersome. Also the blueprint editing could be improved a lot (step-by-step debugging of setups etc, remove all moves with one click)\n- Performance issus when it becomes very complex\n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment...\n\nIn sum, this is a great game in its alpha and definitely worth playing (especially considering the very low price - (I bought it for < 3€))","May 16","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It almost feels like a stripped down version of Factorio.\n\nI don't want to say it's real drawback is lack of tutorial, cause it has one, and games in which they hold my hands for hours drive me insane, but, there's definitely a bit of a lack of flow to the UI and context clues don't give you much of an idea of what to do.\n\nPerhaps enhancing the warning system, like when a building isn't connected, it should ALWAYS tell you, not just at first when you're going through the tutorial.  Like, if there's no path to a building, or a building doesn't have a blueprint.  It seemed like these alerts stopped showing for me and they would have been useful the entire time.\n\nThis game works a lot like writing a program, and if the compiler fails, it should spit out a bit of an error.\n\nOh, you've built an unused building over here, demolish it or make it useful!\n\nIt kept me playing for much longer than I expected it too, and I do rather like it despite it's stripped down minimal nature.

Ive seen videos of people completing the totorials on youtube, but I cant even FINISH the first one. I get to the part where you are asked to build a coal harvester next to the iron harvester so you can produce iron ingots. I build the coal harvester where I am told to put it and then nothing works after that. The game doesn't recognize Ive done this step. Ive set up roads to it and made a route for workers to collect it, but the harvester doesnt produce anything to be collected. EVER!!! Ive tried uninsatlling, reinstalling, try a new game, verifiy game cashe integrity. NOTHING, still the same problem. Not only the first tutorial mission but every mission does this at some point. Tried the next tutorial mission, got to a point I need to produce uprade tokens, the game will not produce the tokens. I have the matrials. They are ready to be picked up, but nothing happens and cannot make progress. Its unplayable for me at this time and frankly I wish I had never bothered with this game.

I had a lot of fun figuring it all out and the more that's added to this game, the more I'll keep coming back to it.\n\nOne thing I'd like to see (and perhaps it is somehow there and I'm just missing the feature) is some kind of Sandbox mode with contracts you can keep fulfilling.. or fulfill for certain lengths of time and then they expire and you have to get new contracts... I dunno, just something with a little more freedom.\n\nBeyond that, great game... can't wait for more scenarios!","May 13","true","9.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

I'm happy I applied and got to see a great game in the making.\n\nLove the idea, wanted to participate in the testing the moment I heard about the new game from Endless Loops Studios.\nThere's a lot of work needed here but this game is in Early Access. There is time.\nFrom what I've seen the Developer listens to the people testing it right now, takes advices and suggestions implements them.\nActive both on forum and with the updates.\n\nNow the game.\nIt may seem hard to understand but you get used to it fast thanks to the tutorial.\nThe routes will be harder to understand. Still struggling with them, but hopefully detailed tutorials on them will be made by the community/dev.\nWhy should you buy this game and not other tycoon games of the same genre?\nBlueprints! It's a casual, fun game. You can spend hours in the tutorial alone (if you want to find issues.. almost 2hours here and I haven't finished the tutorial.. and not because I am a bad player.. Just focusing on helping and finding issues.)\nYou can hire workers and in order to keep them happy they need to be fed and paid! (duuuh)\nYou can create your custom blueprints to maximize efficiency. Same goes for contracts. You can choose what to deliver and how many pieces of each.\n\nYou can research new stuff, go to other islands and much more.\nThe only minus I could find in this game would be time taking to complete it/get bored. But I haven't reached that point yet and I'm sure I will not too soon. There's too much to learn/test/do right now.\n\nEDIT:\nFinally completed tutorial (not because I'm dumb but because I test the game more than play it right now)\nGave a shot to the Scenario before finishing the tutorial and I was lost... Really really lost :)\nNow that I finished the tutorial I understand more of it and will sure have a fun time with the Scenario.\n\nThere's not much to do after a certain point and yeah.. it gets a bit boring, hoping to have some new quests or something to keep you interested in playing, sort of a story mode even though I don't see how one could have a story mode here.\nEnjoyable game, Still recommend it. The price is fair.

As with the Settlers, there are many layers to how you build, what you build when and how you manage your resource chains.\n\nIn addition to the production chains of buildings, there is a sub-production element within each building.  This element allows you to manipulate the chain of production within each production building.  Each building starts off with a default (which is pretty efficient), but there are ways you can tweak the chains to make them more efficient (sometimes doubling/tripling building output).  This is a novel idea and one I quite like to get lost fiddling around in just trying to eek that little extra from my buildings - but the default blueprints are pretty effective as they are.\n\nWith the Settlers you could eventually get yourself in a position where a thriving city could fall and crumble because of space resrictions and having to force that poor little settler to walk from one side of the city and back again with his cargo.  Eventually the roads would upgrade (if travelled enough) and finally your settler would gain a donkey to help speed him on his way.  In Blueprint Tycoon you get hot air balloons and trade ships instead.  Trade ships allow you to transfer large amounts of cargo between islands (but are restricted to a start island and an end island - building circular routes is helpful, and perhaps the developer could implement a return cargo slot) whereas hot air balloons are pretty good for doing cross-island hops from storehouse to storehouse.  This allows you to spread out your production over larger areas.\n\n\n+===+ SCENARIO EDITOR +===+\nAs promised by the developer, there is a scenario editor in the game.

Generally, it's the same kind of gameplay you get in games like Caesar 3 or Anno, but streamlined, and with little imaginative differences. For example, production buildings themselves have a little puzzle to them, reminiscent of SpaceChem but not nearly as difficult, which lets you optimise them if you want, although I've stuck with the defaults it gives you so far and not had trouble.\n\nEarly Access is no lie though - it's pretty rough around the edges. Stuff overflows the menus and windows sometimes, the notifications in the only scenario are way too frequent and distracting, and some of the UI is barely there at all. My biggest problem is a lack of clarity: that there's no way to see what a production building needs before placing it, you can't see what resources are on an island before buying it, when looking for a resource you can only check one island at a time, etc. I'm sure these will be ironed out as development continues but for now it is a bit frustrating to play.\n\nIt's hard not to recommend it at £2, and I look forward to seeing how it develops.","April 5","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Generally, it's the same kind of gameplay you get in games like Caesar 3 or Anno, but streamlined, and with little imaginative differences. For example, production buildings themselves have a little puzzle to them, reminiscent of SpaceChem but not nearly as difficult, which lets you optimise them if you want, although I've stuck with the defaults it gives you so far and not had trouble.\n\nEarly Access is no lie though - it's pretty rough around the edges. Stuff overflows the menus and windows sometimes, the notifications in the only scenario are way too frequent and distracting, and some of the UI is barely there at all. My biggest problem is a lack of clarity: that there's no way to see what a production building needs before placing it, you can't see what resources are on an island before buying it, when looking for a resource you can only check one island at a time, etc. I'm sure these will be ironed out as development continues but for now it is a bit frustrating to play.\n\nIt's hard not to recommend it at £2, and I look forward to seeing how it develops.","April 5","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a lot of work to be done by the developer. However, the game is already stable and is full of features.\n\nThe gameplay is lightweight compared to similar games. Original and simple to control micromanagement makes this game promising. At the moment there is no much inside except a tutorial (which is well-done) and one scenario. The game is in it's development, still stable. Don't miss this one!\n\n// End of review\n\nMy wishlist to the developer:\n- The goals (targets) must be easier to learn and evaluate. I do not get it. What is reputation and what is the consequences? How can I understand is contract OK or under supplied?\n- Better icons! :-)\n- Sandbox regimes, random maps, tight goals.\n\nAnd some crazy ideas to the developer:\n- More resources with different life-cycles. It is useless to dig into micromanagement (to the blueprints) when everything is very fast. Long-growing crops with unstable production would add complexity and weight to the blueprints.\n- Non-linear production lines. For example, different crops should be milled on a single mill. That would make blueprints more important as well (so that, one would adapt blueprints to increase production multiple times).\n- May be the tools should be produced and have a limited life-span (or boosters to the tools).\n- External economy. With a simple system like this one it is easy to mimic real-old-world trade relationships. It would be great to introduce gold (or coins) so that one can buy resources abroad and earn coins with selling resources. The demand/supply may be random. You may introduce a bank node that accumulate and spend these coins. You may add a trader node that sets the prices for goods based on gold needed. That would be great to calculate PnL and to optimise production capacity to it. So that, thanks to bank and trader node, one can import some of the goods abroad, produce something, sent part of it to the contract, trade another part for gold to earn coins back.\n- Anyway, even without crazy ideas, the game is nice, inspiring and relaxing. Thank you!\n\n// End of wishlist.","April 24","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mutantbadger/recommended/454060/","Mutantbadger","Spaghetti Dive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mutantbadger/","557 products in account","I really really like the idea behind this game, I really do, but it lacks a certain... something.\n\nAt it's core, the game is a mix of Spacechem and some of your typical top-down management sims in which you are tasked with the gathering, refining, and selling of products per the scenario you're playing in. In addition, you also have to manage your workers and keep them fed/happy by giving them food and stuff.\n\nThe problem I have, though, is that in the base scenarios the default blueprints are typically the most optimized so you rarely need to change anything. The same problem exists in some of the user scenarios, but those can be changed per the desired difficulty.\n\nI felt like the game should have had you using "bad" blueprints to start with so that you were actually enticed to improve upon them yourself. I did find myself improving a few blueprints, but typically they are near the end of the production chain, which makes them have little actual effect on the overall production speed.\n\nMaybe I haven't played enough yet to see some of this, but the game kind of gets tiring fast if I play it for too long. The UI certainly needs some work as it looks as if it were ported from a touch-screen platform. That said, if the UI was better, the game would improve significantly.\n\nOverall, I liked the core idea behind the game but ultimately I was left wanting.","May 17","false","7.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Just no. Even at three bucks, it can't justify the cost.\n\nThis a poorly produced game. It stutters and lags, the supply chains break without apparent cause, the ui is finnicky, the tutorials are poorly made and can be broken. The gameplay could be alright though. It's essentially a clone of Spacechem, with more laborious and less intricate puzzles. The game has no art assets to speak of, and while the argument that a game in this genre doesn't need to look pretty is certainly a valid one, it's not an excuse to not even bother to try.\n\nIf this is something that caught your eye, do yourself a favor and pick up Spacechem instead. Or an old copy of Settlers 2 on GoG. Or Anno 1602.\n\nI'm not going to request a refund, because hey, it's three bucks and more power to the dev.

You use those to build a nice small starting base of operations. Those guys needs good; which you then supply untill you are ready to advance to the next tier. Thos eguys need other goods; some needing your first goods as a basis. All's fine and well while you use your excess goods to make some cash untill you can advance yet another tier.\n\nThen it starts to hit you; building space. No worries as there are other islands to develop as you progress yet another tier and start to notice that your infrastructure isn't all that great.\n\nYet another tier and the juggling ensues with you trying to keep all tiers of population happy while still maintaining a proper infrastructure.\nBefore you know it you've been playing this game for quite some hours, restarted several times to improve on your logistic system, tore some hairs out of your head wondering why you're making a deficit, cursed those researchers for tearing theire homes down because they didn't have their meat for a cycle or two. etc etc etc\n\nPro's\n* Easy to learn, hard to master\n* Simplistic graphics so it really doesn't take a monster rig to run and it does have it's charm for people who like Indie's\n* VERY interactive; nice to have a management game that requires some modicum of attention to make sure everything\nkeeps working\n\nCon's\n* Early Access; development means it's not shining in it's fullest with some ackwardness in the UI and some bugs (though I, personally, haven't found any yet) but the devs are hard workers so this con will disappear in time\n* Unclear tutorial (there's tools for various blueprints that never get explained properly)\n* Simplistic graphics (even though this means lesser computers can also join in on the fun you DO have to like the simplistic nature of it...it REALLY IS a pen&paper style game when it comes to graphics)\n\nMost of the con's will disappear with further development, I'm sure, adding more scenario's (even though the first will keep you busy for a while).

Haven't played it till the end yet so might be possible that I need to edit some things in this review.\n\nPrice is low, either because its early access or because this is what it is.\nThe game needs a little bit more polish and then its totally worth a release version for €3,- to 5,-\n\nIn my opinion the game could be a lot more though!\nThe building and logistics are great and work properly, I think the art style is cool and matches the title. I don't quite get how to optimize the internals of each building yet because the default blueprint seems good to me but perhaps that becomes more obvious when you get to higher tiers later in the game.\nThe tutorial is pretty good and does well at explaining the basics while still allowing plenty to be discovered on the first real map.\n\nWhat I'm missing is the tycoon part!\nAs a long time tycoon fan, I expected this game to be about making money, but its not.\n\nThe money part is more like a resource balance game: You have to pay your workers and therefor you export some goods. There's no point to make more money then what your workers need, because when the money bar is filled you don't earn more...\n\nBesides paychecks your workers also need food and a marketplace to dispense the food. Either I'm completely missing something or there is something wrong here... We pay workers, give them food and also bring it for free? No taxes?\nI would rather:\n- give them food and a home, no money\n- a home and money, let them buy the food at my markets\n- just give them money, they can rent my homes and buy food at my markets\n\nBuilding should cost money and construction materials, not just construction materials. This would activate the 'tycoon loop'  Need more money to build more to make more money to build more. Buildings should get progressively more expensive to build with each tier, so that you actually have to wait a while sometimes to have enough cash. It would also make it a bit more interesting to make maximum use of each building instead of just plopping down multiple of the same being a no brainer.\n\nUpgrading buildings and buying new land cost tokens. These can be build in your main building and cost some materials or are received every once in a while with a supply drop. I don't think these add anything to the game as it is now. Research - Materials - Money should be enough.\n\nBecause I can't find any info about the development (road map, plans, idea's) I can't really say where this is headed.\nThis could be a great tycoon with loads of hours of fun and replayability in it, or will it stay an inexpensive fun little game with a completely justifyable price? Who knows... Either way, nothing to lose. Recommended for this price in this state!","April 2","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only problem I have is that I keep having to restart mid-tutorial. It would give me an instruction then freeze on me. I might just be an idiot and not be doing the correct process but after doing the stage two or more times using the exact same building process I've come to the conclusion that its the messages freezing up. *ahem* I did NOT start writing this review before checking if the game had automatic quicksaving features so I knew BEFOREHAND that I could go back to a previous day. I've been searching for a light hearted game that I can play while my mind can wander, relax and think. This game has everything I could possibly want in a casual game, more actually and for that I am pleasantly surprised.\nSo other than the tutorial glitch which might just be idiot error, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a casual building game that has almost dumbass proof controls.\n\nNote: After playing for a little longer I found at least one game breaking bug. For some inexplicable reason, some of your production facilities won't transport their goods to needed areas. Instead, they just acrue product until their bunkers are full and stop, sit there doing nothing except emptying your bank and cause frustration because when you get big enough you can't even find the damn suckers.

There's a tutorial, but for some reason I came away from it not really knowing anything. It dives right in and tells you how to build X and connect it to Y to make Z money, but it doesn't really explain why, or any of the scope of what you're supposed to do. It's like educating someone on common literature before telling them what a book is - they'll probably figure it out eventually, but it's not immediately apparent.

Haven't played it till the end yet so might be possible that I need to edit some things in this review.\n\nPrice is low, either because its early access or because this is what it is.\nThe game needs a little bit more polish and then its totally worth a release version for €3,- to 5,-\n\nIn my opinion the game could be a lot more though!\nThe building and logistics are great and work properly, I think the art style is cool and matches the title. I don't quite get how to optimize the internals of each building yet because the default blueprint seems good to me but perhaps that becomes more obvious when you get to higher tiers later in the game.\nThe tutorial is pretty good and does well at explaining the basics while still allowing plenty to be discovered on the first real map.\n\nWhat I'm missing is the tycoon part!\nAs a long time tycoon fan, I expected this game to be about making money, but its not.\n\nThe money part is more like a resource balance game: You have to pay your workers and therefor you export some goods. There's no point to make more money then what your workers need, because when the money bar is filled you don't earn more...\n\nBesides paychecks your workers also need food and a marketplace to dispense the food. Either I'm completely missing something or there is something wrong here... We pay workers, give them food and also bring it for free? No taxes?\nI would rather:\n- give them food and a home, no money\n- a home and money, let them buy the food at my markets\n- just give them money, they can rent my homes and buy food at my markets\n\nBuilding should cost money and construction materials, not just construction materials. This would activate the 'tycoon loop'  Need more money to build more to make more money to build more. Buildings should get progressively more expensive to build with each tier, so that you actually have to wait a while sometimes to have enough cash. It would also make it a bit more interesting to make maximum use of each building instead of just plopping down multiple of the same being a no brainer.\n\nUpgrading buildings and buying new land cost tokens. These can be build in your main building and cost some materials or are received every once in a while with a supply drop. I don't think these add anything to the game as it is now. Research - Materials - Money should be enough.\n\nBecause I can't find any info about the development (road map, plans, idea's) I can't really say where this is headed.\nThis could be a great tycoon with loads of hours of fun and replayability in it, or will it stay an inexpensive fun little game with a completely justifyable price? Who knows... Either way, nothing to lose. Recommended for this price in this state!","April 2","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is very deep and allows lots of creativity in your tycoon. The graphics are great as they make the game feel simple even though it is the complete opposite. The simplistic look also allows the game to run rather smoothly for people with rather rubbish computers such as myself.\n\nHowever, don't go into the game thinking it will be easy and a great background game, as it takes quite a while to get the hang of things and is not for the faint hearted.\n\nI wish that the game was explained a bit better, as the tutorial is a bit confusing when you first enter the game. The writing is also very small on my computer and there is lots of it, so I just think that if the words could be expanded slightly and thinned out, so there are no points where you pause for a minute or two just to read, slowing down the action in the game.\n\nOther than that, I think it is a well thought out game and definately something to get.","April 3","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With an extremely appealing visual style similar to Prison Architect, you'll find it easy to use the UI to understand exactly what is working or not within your Factorio style production line.\n\nBlueprint Tycoon isn't without its flaws though, with no real purpose to what you are doing besides maximizing profit and efficiency, you'll be left wondering why you're doing what you are. This isn't a real complaint however as when you get stuck into the game, that thought rarely crosses your mind.\n\nWith its appealing gameplay, I'm sure this game will find a home within a niche audience that loves to micromanage their games.\n\nI am however left feeling that the Blueprint system isn't the main draw to this game, Perhaps concentrating on building a more interesting settlement with diverse buildings and plots would be the ideal focus for this engaging little indie title.\n\nOverall I would heartily reccomend this game to those that enjoy playing Simulation and Strategy based games, if you're looking for something with more substance plotwise, I would look elsewhere.\n\nCheck out my YouTube video on the game here: http://www.youtube.com/user/johnnotjohn","April 12","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Didn't experience any blockers or crashes so for an alpha release I think it is solid. Just some minor issues, the developer is patching actively (apr 2016)\n\nIt could use some more content but in terms of what you get for your money the game is way too cheap, there's quite some fun to be had. When there are some more scenarios, missions and goods to create I would expect the game to be more expensive for what you get.\n\nYou can compare this game best to factorio, it has less depth than factorio but it is much more user friendly and has a smoother user experience which makes it a lot of fun to play!","April 9","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are however several issues, that in themselves aren't that big a deal, but all together might make this undesireable to some people. For example, the music is good, but the loop is broken so it stops a few seconds before it should. The UI has some issues, like lists being too long or buttons not working.\nI find the lack of tooltips disturbing, especially when there is a new icon in a production building, and I want to hover over it to know what it is about.\nHowever, it is still worth playing at this stage, and for 2.99£ it is a bargain, with just a little work, I'd price this game at 5£ or more.

I've played through the tutorials and aside from a few tiny litle issues with understanding what to do, the game is lots of fun and hasn't lagged once. I haven't checked out any of the scenarios as yet, but from I can see this is going to be a great game to sink some time into. I would definiately recommend giving the game a try now!\n\n\n\nEarly Access Review (No longer applicable):\n\nLags terribly, even during the tutorial. I admit I do not have the latest model PC, but games that are more graphically intense run a lot better than this does on my computer. There were a few bugs too. Sometimes it didn't recognise my clicks so selections would not be cancelled, and it wouldn't let me move the menu/boxes around even though it said I could so blueprints etc would be hidden behind the text box making it frustrating.\n\nThat said, the game does seem like it could be fun. I liked what I played, and I wanted to play more. Unfortunately even if I could run it properly there is only the tutorial and one mission. It is an Early Access game though, so hopefully given time the game will be better optimised and the kinks will be worked out. But as the games stands now, I cannot recommend it.","April 6","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
