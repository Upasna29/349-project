The various search scenes haven't you look for 20 items, just to get a special item. Every item you need is tied to the story in some way. The various puzzles can also be quite challenging, but always doable.\n\nThe game has 2 flaws: The biggest flaw is it's playtime, 2 hours is plenty to get through it. The other flaw is it's open ending, leaving the door wide open for a sequal that probable never comes ;_;","March 6, 2014","true","4.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Good fun, but I finished the whole thing in about 4 hours so I recommend buying when it's on special.\nThere are many other hidden-object games on Steam - e.g. the Nightshift games - which have a bit more in the way of plot.","December 9, 2012","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fun hidden object + puzzle game - not terribly difficult, but does require a bit of brain power for some of the pattern recognition.  None of the puzzles are timed, so there is never a crazed sense of urgency.  Crashes for me every time after completing the final puzzle (only know that it's the final one due to searching online for the cause of the crash).  Worth it if you want a brief break from playing something else and it's on sale (not worth more than a few bucks tops).","April 27, 2014","true","2.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It is a fun little timewaster. Don't pay a lot for it.","July 6, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
