The different components of the game gradually increase for a casual gaming experience, but don't mistake all the levels for easy. Because he can't jump, anything one block tall is a wall to him. The large campaign is great and the level creator is fairly convenient with hotkeys for each block in the game. (There's also a menu of them for those who can't remember.) Overall great game, and if you think you can beat all of these puzzles without a walkthrough, I wish you good luck!","March 28, 2015","true","8.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","2"
