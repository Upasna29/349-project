"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadocchi/recommended/324170/","Shadocchi","マジレズ✰Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadocchi/","334 products in account","Pyrite Heart's an interesting VN because it seems like a lot of other otome games, but when you get into it, it lacks the personality or flair of those games. Whether it's because the set-up steers into the inciting argument within three lines or whether it's because the protagonist actively picks a fight with everyone and everything constantly, Pyrite Heart feels like it's missing something – and it may be heart.\n\nTo me it feels like Pyrite Heart took the easy way out on every turn. Instead of setting up the princess' personality at home, it immediately throws her into school. Instead of creating an opportunity for a natural relationship to happen, the princess forces it, attacking the first guy she sees, making him stand out as the main guy instantly but obviously. Of course, the protagonist is a very aggressive character, and that would be fine if she didn't feel like a shallow take on tsundere with more stubborn traits and an inferiority complex added in quickly. The love interests feel similarly shallow, with the option of either perfect-but-sensitive class president or sporty-and-mostly-loyal secret servant from home.\n\nWhile the dare's time limit of a week is realistic for some silly dare, it takes way too much away from what could happen in the actual story. Drama is quick and incredibly easy to see coming, and the whole premise of royalty is kind of confusing since it's presented as the Japanese Imperial House but seems a lot like a take on western royalty.\n\nSimple choices and good art be damned. This game is too quick to jump on reasons and challenges to give purpose and drive to its events, and in doing that leaves out some of the most important things you could find in an otome game: a moment of sincerity, a feeling of getting closer to someone, a semblance of fun.","September 27, 2014","false","2.8"," 209 of 247 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","209","247","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/324170/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Pyrite Heart is a cute, short yet vain visual novel without much depth or gameplay option. It certainly lacks character variety or story diversity. It might be considered eligible on means of display - with pretty enough art style, yet I find myself failing to recommend it due to it being completely stereotypical and uninteresting.\n\nHere we have tsundere princess Ahri Remono: the snobbish, know-it-all heiress of the royal family. After getting into an argument with his elder brother, the crown prince, Ahri takes his brother's challenge to survive outside of the royal palace like an ordinary high school student for one week. For the duration of that one week, she has to attend an ordinary high school without the aid or observance of any of her servants. No one is to know that Ahri is a princess. As she has always been ready to do so, Ahri accepts the challenge and ventures out to learn some lessons, and possibly find love "unexpectedly".\n\nUnexpected? Nah, not really. There are only 2 romance options to begin with and there are no significant characters beside those boys, Ahri and the crown prince anyway. A VN with 4 characters altogether. That felt a bit pathetic contrary to visuals and display of the game being in remarkable quality, accompanied with enjoyable soundtracks. Art style is beautiful and lively. It's like wrapping a lame, common gift in wondrously glamourous wrapping paper. It creates expectations only to fail living up to them.\n\nI must say that the story is incredibly short, with only 2 quite obvious branching paths. Each romance has a good, bad and a grand ending reachable through 3-4 dialogue choices. As it goes with any tsundere, there is a brief period of self-importance and aggression coming from Ahri towards the romance option, and a realization period with tears of desperation and frustration. It depends whether there is a happy ending or not, but the formula is foolproof. It is cute, but it's nothing interesting. There is nothing to shock or surprise you, no secret to discover, nothing unforeseeable. Thus, you get bored of watching Ahri and 2 glamorously pretty boys either flirt or argue eventually.\n\nIt is nothing extraordinary, or remarkable. It sure is a sweet little game for your 3 dollars if you are strictly into VN gameplay and wouldn't like to miss anyone of them. As a final verdict, it is sadly passable.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 29","false","1.8"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","43","45","2","0"

(Go to the bottom for reason of standing on a neutral ground)\n\nThe storyYou will play through as a spoiled princess Ahri who's been shelterd all her life. And after a bet she made witth her brother about being able to survive in the outside world for a week, she transferred to a "common school". There she meets a fustrating rival and an unexpected nuisance.\n\nAudio and Visual elements\nVisual elements  For a short visual novel there is alot of CGs which is surprising. Art style is good impactful and smooth art style being used.\nAudio elements Music are relatively avergae nothing really crazy or good.\nBut on 1 of the route i really loved the piano music being used there the piano really adds so much emotion to the situation i was rather surprised of them using a piano music in this short VN\n\nReasons for a neutral stand1. The ending felt too rushed it is like they just wanted to publish this as fast as possible, I felt that if they put in more effort in adding more content to the story this would surely be a straight up positive review.\n2. They could have done better in terms of branching out after the happy endings i really wanted to see more because there is still alot of room for more content but it is just "The End" and you get met by the credits.\n\nTo sum upThe story is really cute and enjoyable in fact I found myself smiling throughout the whole playthrough but it is not worth at full price so i highly suggest to pick it up when it is on sale.","October 21, 2015","true","5.1"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","30","31","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeveeheart/recommended/324170/","eeveeheart","Eevee <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeveeheart/","525 products in account","Firstly, I play quite a few dating sims and visual novels so I have some basis of comparison. This game feels like it wasted potential. With solid artwork this game is very visually appealing but that's about where it ends in terms of good points. In one sitting of about an hour I beat the entire game and got what I assume to be all the endings and paths. Two good endings each ending with one of the males and the alone ending. Mind you I had the game skip all seen text but it's doubtful anyone would want to read it again. Ahri the main character has serious character flaws that seem to resolve too quickly. When they say you're spending a week out of the castle, you literally spend a week discovering your flaws and fixing them to a degree. While the dialogue can be interesting the characters just seem under developed. They're not horrible but it feels like one added bucket of water to a shallow pool of water in terms of depth of character.\n\nOverall for the price and play time, even on sale I would not get this game. It's far too short with only about 5-8 choices to make. From what I can tell there's only one or two choices that will determine which of the two male characters you end up with. It's also obvious which choice to pick to get a good reaction from the guy. Just having two guys is also dull and boring. You don't even get a make friend option. So basically you spend a week falling in love or realizing you have feelings for a servant and then devote your life to them. Uh-huh... Sounds like high school alright...\n\nBasically, while this game is cute and has amazing artwork, you're better off looking at screenshots for that. Save your money and maybe it will be in a bundle or something soon.","November 26, 2014","false","1.2"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","44","55","2","0"

The art department is solid, nothing to complain about it; bishies, check; mandatory cute kitten, check; good backgrounds, check.\nThe script: somehow clichéd, though less so than others thanks to the protagonist's personality. It has its moments.\nThe eyecandy is there, and it's not overemphasized.\nScales well all the way up to 1080p in fullscreenmode, perhaps higher, haven't tested that.\nSteam cards, I guess.\nThe bad:    Very short, expect to finish a playthrough and still have cards to drop (well, perhaps not now with the 2 hours rule, but back when I played this it took me two playthroughs and then some idling to get the cards, that's how short this is).\nThe script: somehow clichéd, though less so than others thanks to the protagonist's personality. A tsundere protagonist is not something everyone will stomach, and many of the lines used to convey that feel forced or just ridiculous.\nYou only get to pick one out of two routes, each has two endings and all end rather abruptly. Thus, there's very little replayability value. ERRATA: There are actually six endings, as pointed out by Alexia in the comments (who also made a  handy guide about it). Even so, I feel that the replayability value remains quite low.\nAs others pointed out, this used to be free and voice-acted. This is no longer the case on the Steam version.\nThis is a very subjective opinion, but I found the protagonist unsufferable. Not because I dislike the tsundere archetype, but because I really found her unsufferable.\nTL;DR:\nA short otome VN which does its job relatively well but feels rushed and leaves you with a "they could've put more into this" kind of feeling. To recommend, or not to recommend this game? That is the question: and at the standard price tag I'll have to go with Nay. Wait for it to go on a hefty sale (or bundle), or skip it - unless you're the "gotta catch 'em all" kind of person.","November 25, 2015","false","2.3"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","3"

I didn't hate this game, but I wouldn't say I particularly liked it either. My biggest complain would definitely be that it's far too short. It takes less than a hour to get through the whole story once. Furthermore, it only took a couple of hours to view all the story paths.\n\nYes, this is a romance visual novel. This is not to be confused with a sim game, because there aren't any stats or daily choices. There are two guys to choose from. During the story, there will be prompts for choices during high points of events. What you choose determines if you end up with a guy at the end. The choices are pretty obvious. The gist is: Don't be a jerk to the person you want to end up with. There's basically a good and bad ending for each guy.\n\nAnother complaint would be the misuse of the word "love."  I really hate that in stories, when people have known each other for, like, two seconds, and they say they're "in love." This story's duration is only 1 week, and yet there's characters proclaiming they're in love at the end. It would be "like" at best and infatuation at worst. I'm not saying that they couldn't make this game for that short of a duration, but it is ridiculous to use the word "love" in these circumstances. I would've enjoyed the game a bit more if they'd just had the characters proclaiming "like" instead.\n\nDespite all its bad points, there are some things I did like about it. The main character's personality is very flawed. I like this, because many stories have main characters that are almost too perfect, and therefore, not realistic. By the end of the game, she's learned some things and become a slightly better person. While the romance choices (the two guys) aren't exactly unique, they're definitely not of the most common archetypes either. The best thing about game was the humor, I think. The game made me giggle. If a game can make me giggle, it can't be *that* bad, right?\n\nWould I recommend it?

There's a minor continuity error involving the first two choices, and a possible similar error on Ryuu's neutral ending, which is a little sad considering the very limited number of branches in the game. However, the good endings are sweet and Ryuu's good ending in particular is nice.\n\nThe characters are mostly good, but there's some inconsistency- mostly that Ahri seems to be a lot more demure on Kenta's route for no particular reason. Ahri's character drawns on a fairly annoying trope but she's surprisingly appealing, easily the most tolerable version of the "naive sheltered princess" because 1) she's not painfully naive about everything to the level of "what is this human door you speak of" 2) her ego is actually backed up by hard work and skill and 3) she's actually capable of introspection and noticing when reality doesn't square with her illusions. Kenta is nothing groundbreaking but if you like the type of character he is you'll probably like him.\n\nRyuu and Ahri's interaction on his route is the highlight for me. Probably the best writing in the game is Ryuu and Ahri's verbal sparring, and it's nice to have a romance with a relationship based on finally finding someone they consider an equal. Also Ryuu looks really good as a butler.\n\nFor £4 I feel like I easily got my money's worth and I enjoyed playing it.","October 3, 2014","true","2.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

One playthrough takes easily less than an hour. The game is too fast paced and ends abruptly. Much too fast to really get attatched to any of the characters. Actually, they really don't even give you time to learn about the characters before the game ends.\n\nAnother problem I have with this is relatability. Sure, I'm fine with the main character being royalty, but she's basically a failed tsundere. There was nothing for me to connect to, which is a big thing for me when I'm playing otome. I NEED to feel like I could be put into the shoes of the protagonist.\n\nI let my sister play through this a few times as well, and she had very similar opinions to my own.\n\nThe only REALLY good thing I can say about this game was the art. It's quite good compared to a feed other visual novels and there are a good amount of CGs for it's length. I only wish I could view them in a gallery after the game instead of having to screenshot them, or replay the game to be able to view them again.\n\nI can't say I'd reccomend this game, but if you're still interested, this game is not worth $5.00.

I finished it in 45 minutes and despite liking the characters and story, I was just getting into it when it was all of a sudden over. I also think that making the player choose a character to be friendly with before knowing the characters is not a great idea.\n\nIt was entertaining yes, the art was fantastic but I would have really liked a kiss scene at the end for Ryuu. The romance feels rushed and I don't think you could really bond with someone and fall for them in the space of a week! The story takes place over just one week and there just isn't enough story.\n\nI like the character Ahri because she is the kind you love to hate. I just wish there were more of it. It gives you a taste but doesn't deliver. Also I think it would be better with more artwork for the different situations ESPECIALLY the ending. The ending is always the best artwork! Ahh well. Overall it isn't TERRIBLE, but it isn't something I would recommend. I wouldn't write off all future games from the developers as if they can improve their pacing and flesh out the characters more, it would be awesome.","January 26, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being the competition seeking girl she is, she makes a bet with her brother that she can go to a normal school for a week, just like the “commoners” do, instead of being home taught, like usual.\nYada yada yada, at school she soon finds a rival, Ryuu, the class president. Her servant, Kenta, is also here because her brother sent him to take care of her and now you gotta pick which one of those two hot guys’ lips you want to kiss.\n\nThe two guys are pretty cute. Good picks, if I do say so myself.\n\nAhri though, is one of the most annoying characters I’ve ever seen in a video game or visual novel. She's self-centered, sassy, selfish and, well, overall just a female dog.\n\nNow, you might be saying right now, “But Fruitsniffer, Ahri’s a Tsundere. That’s what makes Tsunderes so cute!”.\nBut I say no. Just because your character’s a bootyhole doesn’t mean that she’s a Tsundere. That’s not how it works...\n\nOkay, maybe that’s exactly how it works but that doesn’t change the fact that your main character is still an annoying piece of excrement and I don’t want to play as her.\nI mean, I’d be lying if I said that there’s no character development at all. It does get better... eventually.\n\nAlright, maybe I’m being a bit too harsh though. Ahri definitely has her cute side and can be an ok person. It just takes a while until you get to see that side of her.\n\nThe writing was just ok. Nothing special but definitely not vomit inducing either. There was some dialogue that was pretty cheesy but I guess that’s expectable when you’re playing an otome visual novel.\nThe main problem I had with the writing is that it's just nothing new. We've seen a story like this in so many other otome visual novels that it gets old eventually and a bit boring I guess.\n\nThe art is pretty good and there were some nice CG scenes.\n\nThe game itself is actually pretty short. I managed to get both main endings in about 1 and a half hour. In that short time the visual novel managed to get pretty emotional though and I guess it somehow touched me. Maybe I was just caught off guard by Ahri occasionally not being a total female dog though.\n\n\nTo summarize, Pyrite Heart is an ok visual novel with ok writing and pretty neat art. It's just nothing new, to be honest. The main character makes or breaks the visual novel for you and if you can’t deal with her attitude, this game is definitely nothing for you.\nIf you think Tsunderes are cute though and like it when anime girls are bootyholes to the love interests, I think you’re gonna like this one.\n\nOh, and one more thing:\nWhen you buy the game on steam, you get an exclusive digital hug pillow of one of the love interests, which you can print on a pillow cover. Who wouldn’t want that?\n\n\nSo, Should you play Pyrite Heart?\n\nMmmmh... Yeah. I guess. If that’s your kind of thing. And if not, at least get it for the sexy pillow cover.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Steam censored my review so I removed the offensive words and replaced them in italics.","January 16","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

To an extent. I feel like there could have been so much more done to make the game longer and more heartfelt, but unfortunately it falls a bit flat as it is extremely limited. This game is  definitely one of those "You get what you pay for" games. The game itself is very short and very limited. Unfortunately because it's such a short game, it doesn't have  the charming effect that most try to push for, it lacks 'sincerity' and everything feels choppy and awkward, especially with Ryuu's best ending.\n\nPROs\n- Gorgeous art and graphics\n- Music is decent, and doesn't take away from the game.\n- Kenta is a sweetheart\n\nCONs\n- The ending is sudden and jolting.\n- VERY SHORT; (2-3 hours to get all endings)\n- Lack of character development to varying extents\n- Ahri is irritating, although slowly becomes a bit more palatable towards the end.\n- Characters are all archetypes.\n\nVerdict: This game is a decent starting point if you're just getting into Otome / Dating Sim games. It's simple, to the point, doesn't require too much decision making, and emphasizes the story (or lack-there-of).\n\nUnfortunately for those of us that aren't new to Otome games, this game just falls extremely flat.

As my first foray into an animation style that apparantly cause dispondant teenagers to disown their own culutre and declare themselves japaneese, I was underwhelmed.\n\nEssentially, my understanding of anime is that busty girls with odd coloured hair and no resemblance to asain or american females, fight monsters while equipped with revealling mech suits. I'm also privy to the knowlege that there is a large amount of dark themes, surpirse twists, impossbly hard to remember names and the ever famous tentacle monsters. This game has none of that. This was 30 minutes of disapointment.\n\nWhat I got was an adventure that comprised of reading a book worth of dialouge ( I know now that it is something refered to as graphic novel game, but that doens't derive from the fact that it is a game and should at least have some function of interactibillity). If your game is going to comprise mainly of dialouge, atleast make the dialouge...good. It was superficial at best, forced if you will. They just pushed the ideal that our main character, is smart, determined and a strong independant female without giving us an actual reason to believe it.\n\nI counted about 3 options of choice throughtout the game. Do I stay to play basketball, how do I answer a quiz and do I hand him the pan of baked goods. Do I? Do I even care by this point? So far I've read my way through a week of her school life and as far as sexual appeal of the game goes... its lacking. I'm assuming this is an age friendly version of anime, or the rumors I have been hearing about the representation of females in animet have been false.\n\nAt the end of the day, it leaves a bitter taste. Missed oppurtunites of choice and interactibillity which would have been welcome in the plethora of text. I'm glad this was purchased for me by a friend as I would be angry that I wasted my money on this 30 minutes of tripe, and while I can't commend the gameplay, I can't really complement the drawing talent either because a) there is next to no animation and b) apparantly most animes look like this so it's clearly not a unique art style, or at least difficult for your average artist to draw in 30 minutes.\n\nAll in all,  2 out of 10.\nHorrible plot (Apparantly with multiple endings, each 30 minutes long to find.)\nUninteresting characters\nUnsatisfying end\n\nJust another crappy game clogging up the steam archives.\n","July 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Llama Law states that a game must have at least a 1:1 ratio of dollars spent to hours of content. Pyrite Heart only has two possible love routes (or no route if you fail miserably). Each route only lasts about 25-30 minutes meaning that even the $1.49 I spent on the game wasn't 'worth it.'\n\nRegardless, a decent way to spend an hour if you have nothing to do. Good art, good backdrops and an 'ok-ish' premise. The main issue with this game, and the reason it will be rated so low, is the writing. You play as a snobby princess who, in the course of a week, will flip the script 180 degrees, grow a heart and fall in love. While this is not unrealistic, the lack of content and the speed at which it is delivered (again about 25 minutes if you're a fast reader) leads much want in the heart of the reader. 5$ isn't worth it, $1.49 might be, buy it on sale if at all.\n\n5/10 Overall meh.","March 29, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not all, but some. It's not unrealistic, just unsatisfactory when it comes about in a game you hope will have a bit more thought or feeling.\n\nSaying that, I fully enjoy it. The artwork is beautiful, the personalities work for me (especially the protagonist's, which doesn't necessarily waver), and the results are very cute. It's a VERY short game.

Not the most engaging VN you can get on Steam but it's a fun romp.\n\nIt's a very short game and the price reflects it. Production values have no significant detractors, though the music doesn't seem as effective in setting the mood and is mostly standard. The art assets are markedly more enjoyable, that being said. There aren't a lot of surprises, it's a pretty predictable story with easy decision making, and with use of the skip function and auto-scrolling you should be done all the endings in one sitting.\n\nThe characters are somewhat stock as well, though as the climax approaches there's enough emotional payoff for the time invested. I streamed it for friends and the general consensus was that they weren't expected to emote with this game in particular. Has to be worth something.\n\nIt's not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, it just isn't able to accomplish much within its playtime, and its price reflects this.

The story was no masterpiece but it was simple, pretty light hearted, and even humorous at times.\n\nI'm not sure why others gave this low reviews.

It sounds very much to me that people were expecting too much for what they paid.\n\nIt's simple, straight forward, and tells a cute story, however short that might be.

While it does leave one wanting more, "wanting more" is not necessarily a bad flaw to have since what is present is well executed.\n\nI'm a fan of the otome/visual novel genre in general, and Ahri is certainly a protagonist worth watching. She's spoiled, headstrong, loud, demanding, and competative, which is a nice change of pace in a genre awash in waifish, insecure female leads. She's definately the star of the show, with the boys present mostly as catalysts for how she grows and changes during her week in the real world. Unfortunately, the two boys don't get quite the same treatment - they're nice enough fellows, but they don't show the same depth of character or change as Ahri does.\n\nAs short as it is, the game has limited replay value, and you'll exhaust all the options in two to three hours, depending on your reading speed. I would've liked to see it expand out a little bit, but for the price tag it's certainly not bad. The music is good, and so is the art.

I have a soft spot for tsundere protagonists so maybe I'm a little biased but I found Ahri's tsun to dere transformation adorable especially in Ryuu's route, not to say that Kenta's wasn't just as good but I think favourite routes are normally down to personal preference. I don't think a route with the brother woul dhave gone amiss but not everyone likes that whole route's subtext.\n\nI think the art for the game is some of the best I've seen in an otome game made in the west but I'm pretty sure other reviews have mentioned this and how well it's all been done so I'll leave that where it is and say the CG's in the game are just as beautiful as the sprite art and for such a short game I was suprised at just how many CG's there actually were.\n\nThe music is nothing too spectacular but good enough to warrant a mention and how quickly it can set a mood. After checking this game on VNDB I was told that this game was voiced but there were no voices on the version I got so unfortunately I have no comment to say on that.\n\nThe character of Ahri can be hilarious to watch if you likes tsun's that is, meaning she will be arrogant quite a bit (she pulls the Tiny Tyrranical Tsundere Grade S part very well, dont know what I mean? Tv tropes it) and be aloof and cold to the class or the guy you chose not to pursue but when paired with a guy this is were the dialogue and story shine~ The banter and just the backwards and forwards between the duo has left me laughing so hard at times. There are some very legit sad and heartfelt moments in the game including Ahri but it was a nice addition to this game and stopped it being an entirely rom-com based game but not enough to shadow over that.\n\nI think that if a little extra time was added at the beginning of the game to establish more about Ahri and her life then the game would have been more immersive but for what we got I think it's worth the price, also is it just me or does Ahri look a bit like Nyotalia England?","February 25, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The choices are also far too simple.

I would give it 6.5/10.","January 7","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed the artwork thoroughly, though I do wish there were more choices and more story, because this was an extremely wonderful idea for a visual novel. I would definitely recommend this to newbies to the visual novel experience, it was a 6/10 I think.\nThe artwork was cute and charming.\nThe characters were humorous and loveable, although more background and story would be appreciated.\nHopefully the creators of this add more in the future or learn more and create an even more wonderful novel in the future.","January 4","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything about this game screams quality and adventure. While Bethesda hasn't exactly got a track record for delivering bug-free games at launch, this has been a pleasant, polished and amazing experience so far. A much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system that's amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do.

The story and characters are unoriginal, which could be salvaged if the writing was decent but it's also very underwhelming. The truly disappointing feature of this game is its length. To get all possible endings you are looking at approxmiately one hour of playtime. Total. Perhaps I would be more forgiving/interested if I wasn't so bored of overdone anime tropes, so if you still enjoy the tsundere thing and don't expect anything other than nice art you might enjoy this game, considering the low price.","June 23, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With that, she heads to a normal school where she instantly wants to challange the smartest and most popular guy in school since she is used to being the smartest at the palace. Also, she finds out her brother sent in her most trusted servant to keep an eye on her. In this week, she either falls for her first ever rival or the servant she never realizes she's needed. Does she win the bet with her brother?\n\nOverall, this was a decent otome game. With only 4 characters (at least with pictures) and 2 options, it's not a long game to do. I did this for almost 2 hours and did 3 of the routes (there is probably a good, great, and bad ending to each guy), but that's stretching it since I decided to make it fun with voice acting. Story is nothing new, but it could surfice for some people. The main character at the beginning annoyed me to no end, but she has great character development by the midway point. There was also something off putting with one of the routes, since she met one guy earlier that week and is in love already in one ending. The other guy makes sense with their backstory, but not the other guy and her. It's not all bad. With that character development, some humor, and the beautiful artwork, it still makes a decent game. I would just suggest getting it on sale (probably over half priced) to get your money's worth.","May 20","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a cute, sweet little visual novel. The protagoist's personality is hard to stomach at first, but her character gets better as you go. There are only two guys. One's choices are simple and obvious, the other's choices are kind of confusing and you have to do oddly specifc things to win him. Certain "I love you"s come way too fast, and one of the endings is really tragic/bittersweet.\n\nIf you can get this on sale, it's a nice way to spend an hour (the art is lovely), but otherwise EH.","June 4","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
