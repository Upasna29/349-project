Just played it and enjoyed 100% of the experience. Good mechanics, great artstyle and nice sound effect. Very lightweight and great game to play, with very well thought out levels. Who said you need to be AAA gamedev studio to develop great game. More games like this one please.\n\nHighly recommended\n10/10","March 15","true","9.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"
