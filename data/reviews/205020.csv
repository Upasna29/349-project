The story follows Lumi as she goes to the city called “Lumino City” and tries to find her missing grandfather. The gameplay is similar to a typical point and click adventure and it’s not hard to get the hang of. Not only is the artstyle and soundtrack amazing, the puzzles in Lumino City are perfect, not too hard or too simple. You should be able to play Lumino City on really any PC. The only problem I had with Lumino City is that you cannot cancel an action once you started it. This got very annoying while misclicking, but this is a very minor complaint.\n\nPros\nGreat difficulty\nBeautiful artstyle\nEasy to get the hang of\nAmazing soundtrack\nGreat pacing\nIntriguing story\nSimple gameplay\n\n\nCons\nCannot cancel actions once started\nNo graphics/audio options\n\nConclusion\nLumino City is a beautiful point-n-click puzzle game, with an intriguing story and great difficulty. If you are looking for a really cool puzzle game that is not super easy, Lumino City is what you should get. This beautiful game is not all looks, the puzzles and story are amazing. The $20 is well worth it, and if you see this on sale, definitely pick it up.\n\nVideo Review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7FpsCA1XH8&feature=youtu.be\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

It usually does things amazingly well, or very poorly, sometimes both at the same time.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the art design. The world is very attractive, and you can tell that a lot of time and work has gone into making the world and puzzles. The manual you get is also very detailed and impressive.\n\nThe worst thing about the game is the character movement. A lot of the time you don't know where you can and can't go, and even worse, when you click the wrong spot, it won't let you pick a new spot until you've arrived at the wrong spot. This along with the character's slow movement speed is a mild form of torture.\n\nThe puzzles were very creative and some were quite rewarding. The downside is that some were simple and tedious, meaning that you would know exactly what to do, but it took a while to complete all the actions required to solve the puzzle. Others had somewhat arbitrary solutions. The gear puzzles were awful for this, because you could connect gears to turn the gear at the end, but it would have to be done in an exact way. There was no flexibility for multiple solutions. Worse yet, there were times where you had to add gears that did nothing at all. That's just pointless and it ruins the puzzle for people who have a brain and aren't solving it with a solution guide.\n\nThe story and music were underwhelming. The plot without spoilers is that you play as a child fixing problems for adults who are too incompetent or lazy to fix them for themselves. I wanted to enjoy the game more, but it was just too tedious for the most part, and the fulfilling puzzles were too scarce.\n\n","August 2, 2015","false","5.8"," 63 of 92 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","63","92","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skorch82/recommended/205020/","skorch82","Bl0rch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skorch82/","365 products in account","This game is pure genius.\n\nWell, maybe not so literally, but it's up there. It's a point and click adventure/puzzle game where you play the role of Lumi who is off to find out where her Granddad ended up. Your trek begins at the entrance to *drumroll...* Lumino City and immediately starts of with a rather tame puzzle (graph theory majors need not apply).\n\nThe game sports not too difficult of a challenge puzzle wise, but just enough to keep your brain sharp. It doesn't take long to figure out how to solve most of them, but even if you get stuck, your granddad was nice enough to leave you with a 1000 page handyman's guide, (which contains a whole lot of nonsense actually), but contains hints as to how to solve each puzzle, if you can decode what page number they are on. It's simple math formulas based on the puzzle you solve, but it's still pretty ingenious. "Going to the book" seems very 7th Guest style to me, so that's pretty neat.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing. It's not over the top as to be annoying, just well suited for the puzzle you're solving and the area you happen to be in. Some catchy stuff here.\n\nThe visuals are awesome. Remember all those little carboard houses and things you used to make as a kid or would simply dream up and wish you had them? Well, albeit physically impossible, this game has brought a sort of quaint fantasy world that melds Pleasantville with Little Big Planet and managed to keep it from being hokey. It's almost like you're playing inside of a giant dollhouse, or something built out of tinker toys. The mixture of gadgets and propaganda you'd find in the 50's adds a nice touch.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple: you point- you go. That's pretty much it. There's no (very little) backtracking, so if you can manage to get to a new area, chances are, you found all that you need. The game limits the backtracking you have to do by making past areas inaccessible once you move on- preventing you from moving on until you have everything. It's a little linear in that regard because it's not true to the adventure games of yore, when you could legitimately break your game by forgetting something in the beginning (which is a ♥♥♥♥ move we all secretly loved). The puzzles are difficult, but not so difficult you just give up and resort to cheating, which is refreshing.\n\nGive this game a try, you won't regret it.","December 4, 2014","true","5.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leovic/recommended/205020/","leovic","leovic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leovic/","237 products in account","A highly creative and endearing puzzle game that has some minor issues.\n\nLumino City is basically a game built upon clever and almost realistic puzzle problems. I say almost realistic because it grounds its puzzle logic in basic arithmetic and mechanical systems but still exagerating it for fantastical effect. Think of the logic in say a Rube Goldberg Machine. And that's what I love about this game. Fun yet challenging puzzle solving.\n\nAnother striking thing about the game is the stop motion aesthetic and graphics. Lumino City is set in a mixture of exagerated 1950's tech but with a nice of touch of an English countryside town. While playing this, I've felt that charm and  grabbing wit of say the film, Toy Story. Good old wholesome aesthetic that really captures the imagination of why a community would be built around such strange and wonderful machinery. However the graphics ties in nicely with my biggest gripe with the game. It runs at locked 25 fps. I guess that's because they filmed the stop motion animations at something like that. And I'm fine with my AMD R9 290 chugging a pitiful 25fps if the game kept it at that. But during level transitions, cutscenes, and ordinary scenery object movement, it constantly halves it the framerate to like 12 fps. That's bad especially when you have a few puzzle dependent on precise point n' clicking. Which brings another gripe, input seems so vague. My guess is because the game was built as a mobile game instead of your average PC adventure game. I often miss clicked points of interest just because what you click is based on a general area and not the point you clicked. Think of touch screen input and the problems with that and you'll have an idea as to my problems with input in the game. Also, there is no resolution options, audio options, or any of that stuff in the game. Just defaults to your primary displays resolution. Again, a sign that they mostly built the game around mobile devices.\n\nBut after all that I still love the game. The first game they made, Lume, was charming but a fleeting experience. And this one seems to have taken the charm, wit, and fun of the first one and just amplified it for a lasting effect. Sure, my completion time says this is a short game. Hey, a lot of adventure games are short so why would you expect this to be 200 hours long like a Civilization game or DOTA2. But that's beside the point. If your a fan of the genre you'd understand why adventure games have a different pace to them compared to other games.\n\nOh, about the story of it. There's not much plot other than say the Lumino City's story. Your not going to be having exposition long cutscenes. You do talk to characters but mostly it's a one off thing. Characters are tied to the environment and scene they're in so you mostly won't see them again. But that doesn't really bother me because I realize that the story of Lumino City itself is a lot more engaging than the individuals you meet. Though they are interesting enough to reinforce that environmental story telling the game's got going for itself.\n\nSo conclusion , I love it and I hope that if you've read this review I manage to inform you as to why I think it's a great game. Oh, and the soundtracks fantastic so get that soundtrack edition if you can.\n\nIt seems to have not sold well. But I hope the developers, State of Play Games, manages to make another like it. If not a\nsequel but something as charming as this game with a little more attention to the pc version, then yeah that'll make me happy.","July 3, 2015","true","5.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/205020/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 81%Lumino City is a game that instantly grabs the attention with its unique, imaginative art style. The price tag is undoubtedly steep, but it is attached to a rather long game with a plethora of surprisingly difficult puzzles.\n\nLong version:In 2011, a game called Lume awed its audience with its fun and creative art design, filmed entirely at a hand-made paper and cardboard house. It took years for to finally get a sequel, but a single glance tells why: the game takes place in an entire city now, crafted with even more detail. Just building this set probably took years, and it’s a marvel of architectural design and crafting.\n\nGreat art style alone wouldn’t make a game though, as Lume painfully proved it. So we finally get a full-fledged puzzle adventure with a huge number of unique brain twisters. They share one fallacy of Lume, sadly: none of them are ever explained, so sometimes it is a task to figure out the basic mechanics before any attempt can be made at the solutions themselves.\nThis problem is present in the levels too. There are no hot spots, so most of the game time is spent clicking frantically to finally find that one interactive pixel that holds the key of progress. Sure, this turns Lumino City into an old-school puzzle game that doesn’t hold the player’s hand, but it also makes game mechanics feel dated and frustrating, preventing us from fully immersing ourselves in the magical atmosphere of the scenery.","January 6","true","4.9"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/recommended/205020/","FreakOramaXD","FreakOrama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/","737 products in account","Lumino City is the kind of game that when you look at it at first you think "Woah, it looks really pretty!" with how it uses real life objects and structures to its world, then going into the game and playing it, you find out that it's a really adorable puzzle game.\n\nTo come clean first, I'm not a big puzzle guy, and I only legitimately finished half of the game with it's puzzles, and the rest of it I 'finished what I can' til the end, ehm.\n\nObviously it's main attraction is its looks, and it actually does look really nice with its real life structures, and specially seeing it moving because of the characters interaction with it. The second attraction is its puzzles, with all of the them in each level starting easy and ending exceptionally hard, and how the those puzzles are connected in some way with the environment and its story. The last attraction is its exploration, its journey, and its simple small story.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the game is that there is no hint system in place, or it at least it wasn't made visible if there is one, for people like me that aren't so hardcore gamers in the puzzle genre. Another issue I found is, when you start an action like climbing stairs, or walking to another area, you cannot cancel that action, which isn't a big problem but I still found it a small nuisance nonetheless.\n\nEdit: Apparently there was a hint system. The hints are and spread around in a massive book you carry, explaining the puzzles you're stuck in, so that solves that issue. Guess the book was too overwhelming at first glance to notice there was hints in it.\n\nOverall Lumino City is a great puzzle adventure game with handcrafted passion that's to be admired, with puzzles to satisfy the puzzle loving gamers, but not so much for the casual crowd, and for the price it's going for, I'd personally go for 15 dollars, but I don't think the current price is bad either for what the game is.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","December 19, 2014","true","11.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

I have nothing against the game in-particular in this aspect, I just often get stuck on a puzzle or part of the game very easily and end up taking lengthy breaks before working myself up to having another go. That happened a few times with this game and although it’s tedious for me and my feeble little brain, I actually consider it a good quality amongst puzzle games.\n\nThe puzzles were interesting, challenging and at the most part, bar a few tedious ones for me (Morse code kinda ♥♥♥♥), fun. I would say in terms of the point and click games I have played this has been one of the games with the best puzzles.\nIn terms of a hint or help system, I couldn’t really figure out if there was one (Which I guess within itself says a lot). You’re given a “handy manual” but for the life of me, I couldn’t figure it out. Luckily for me, taking breaks between getting stuck was good enough for me.\n\nThat said, most point and click games centralise around story. This game doesn’t. I felt that with this game the centre was most definitely the puzzles. There is still a story, and it’s not horrifyingly bad, but it is definitely not the spotlight component.\n\nThe graphics and style to this game definitely come second in terms of importance to me. A lot of work was put into building this game and every time I came back to it I was no less impressed with how well it has been put together. The style is so unique and beautiful that it’s hard to not enjoy this game if only for that. The entire setting is warm, colourful and homely.\n\nAll in all, it was a great game and I’m glad that this full length game was released, which helped to make up for it’s demo-lengthed predecessor “Lume”. The devs did a great job with this one, I look forward to any future games they release.\n\n\nTL;DR : Puzzles are interesting, challenging and fun. The story is slightly lacking, although not terrible, but that’s only because of the focus on the puzzles. The graphics, style and work put into this game is amazing and it’s a definite must-try for fans of the point and click genre.","May 7","true","6.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It's diverse to say the least, and possibly some of the best in I've ever come across in a point-and-click.\n\nBeside the puzzles, Lumino City has a cute story but uncomplicated story of a girl searching for her grandfather. The game looks absolutely gorgeous, yet requires no graphical power from your computer, as it was produced with one massive hand-crafted diorama which has then been captured on film.\n\nI have a few nitpicks, mainly the janky and sometimes unresponsive movement through the environment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talelore/recommended/205020/","talelore","TaleLore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talelore/","145 products in account","This game is very atmospheric and charming. The art style is amazing and the audio/music is too. The puzzles are (sometimes convoluted but mostly) decent and have a very tactile feeling to them.\n\nHowever it is frustrating to have to fight to get the game to do what I wanted it to. Expect input lag. Expect to misclick and have to wait upwards of 15 seconds to be able to do anything. Expect glichy areas where it takes upwards of 40 clicks just to get her to open the damned drawer. It took me forever to figure out why sometimes I couldn't open up my inventory. It's always hard to tell where exactly to click to get something done, making navigation difficult. At one point during the victory animation of a puzzle I clicked the back button to go progress in the game, but I apparently backed out too quickly and had to DO THE PUZZLE OVER. A brilliant game but you really have to fight with it.\n\nOther complaints include the fact that all of their generated graphics (characters, speech bubbles(?)) are noticibly uglier than the rest of the game. There are also a few graphical errors (teleporting birds, boats rocking on a loop that isn't quite complete and then jerking back to the start of the animation loop). Another thing is that they say it should take about 10 hours to complete, but I'd say this number should be closer to 5. It took me just over 5 hours and that included the time it took for me to search around online to try to find a way to progress (it turned out that I just had to keep clicking the same spot over and over until the game finally decided that I had clicked the hitbox I needed to click).\n\nOther than the frustration that comes with every minute of playing this game, it is a nice game and it does have interesting puzzle mechanics and a nice atmosphere. Wouldn't really recommend for the price.","December 6, 2014","false","5.3"," 33 of 60 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","33","60","0","0"

Just moving through the different scenes will make you smile.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay can be frustrating, even annoying. Most of your challenges are puzzles of the mathematical or graphical sort, and while some are ridiculously easy, some are obtuse.\n\nThe point-and-click adventuring is barely worth mentioning: your inventory will never contain more than two items, and moving back and forth between areas is slow. The controls are especially maddening: you never know quite where you're supposed to click, and clicking in the wrong place will send you -- slowly -- in the wrong direction.\n\n"Luckily" the story is linear and you always know that you just have to complete a puzzle to take you to the next location, so if you get too frustrated you can look up a walkthrough.","May 21","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Everything in the game is a real life object that was built and filmed by the developer. The result is simply gorgeous and makes every new environment a joy to explore. It's amazing to me just how well everything is lit and animates. Combine this with a truly stellar soundtrack, and you have one of the most aesthetically pleasing games ever made.\n\nHowever, the gameplay doesn't quite live up to the other aspects of the game. For the most part, it's standard adventure game fair, for better or worse. Generally the puzzles are well designed and the game gives you just enough information to let you figure things out. Many of these are little cut away minigames, which really added variety to the game.\n\nUnfortunately, this is occasionally not the case and there is no clear idea of what to do next, what is interactive, or where you can go in the environment. The result is that you end up just clicking on everything you can until something happens. These sections frustrated me a lot and really took away from the fun of the game.\n\nOverall I would still recommend Lumino City. Just be aware that sometimes you will get stuck and it may be better to just look up the arbitrary solution than try to solve it yourself in order to enjoy the game.","March 31","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is great looking in itself from start to finish. Everything from the first logo that appears, the menu screens, cutscenes, cute in-game books and pamphlets, is a bombardment of art. You can tell the people who made this have quite impressive artistic talent. Apparently they made most of the scenes with actual miniature models with a tilt shift effect and then used some camera drives for the cutscenes. Finally overlaying the game and it's characters on top of that. I do love the way it all looks. I hope they make more games this way in the future.\n\nEspecially the vintage-computer rooms near the end of the game reminded me of Lost (the TV-series), very cool! The characters are pretty simple in style but still very likeable, especially the captain and looking at the boy with the binoculars who was looking back at you. The athosphere is fun, It was like.. like a digital version of being in the boyscouts. I even made myself some paper airplanes according to the instructions from "Glider Insider" found in the library in the game. I Havn't had this much fun in a while and enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nThe main part of the game are the puzzles, which are very fun, and range from easy to medium difficulty. The puzzle difficulty is definately good for any younger players and also for anybody who hates getting stuck in a game like this.\n\n8 / 10 - fun little game!\n\n\n\nLastly my two little negatives (which are inconsequential, really);\n\n- First one is for the soundscape of the game in a few places, for instance in the bar while playing the flipper puzzle the music there got a bit annoying and repetitive. For the most part the sound effects and music are good.\n- The second one because the game got stuck twice during a 6 and a half -hour playthrough. Once when entering the library, it just didn't load the library screen, and once when I opened the book from the inventory during the lighthouse puzzle (it was overlayed with the lights from the puzzle couldn't see a thing let alone close the book).\n\nHowever I don't think there are any gamestopper bugs as the game autosaves and lets you continue from the beginning of the scene, which is never very far, so that's good!","July 5, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game takes that and mixes it with a beautiful story to create a truly magnificent game.\n\nThe puzzles in the game were not too difficult in which the game also offers clues through dialogue, an in-game book which is accessed through maths problems along with the hints from the puzzle. For me the puzzles were fine and were rather fun to do, as all clues are in the area where the puzzle is situated.\n\nNow for the obvious part...the visual style of the game. The set designs are made from real bits of paper/cardboard in which allows the game to set itself in a rather unique design. It's very easy to the eye and very well co-ordinated with the lighting to make it really pop out. Along with the actual design of the sets, the animation plays a huge part in the overall feel of the visuals. Each movement you see just flows naturally and allows for a smooth playing experience.\n\nThe sound within the game is rather beautiful. It is composed of some rather nice and relaxing pieces in which when combined helps put you in the world of Lumino City, where it is a place with a very calming nature around it. Throughout the game you can interact with objects which play additional music which mixes well with the ambient and background music.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic game and the amount of effort that has gone into the design is truly outstanding. If you love puzzle games immersed in a very creative world world, then I would highly recommend this.","August 31, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

A Puzzle to Progress game that makes you delightfully giddy to solve each one.\n\nPros:\n-Lighting, artwork, and scenery motion were a testament to the hours put in filming and photographing.\n-Unique game concept links immediate scenes with challenges that are intertwined.\n-Multitude of thought provoking puzzles give the player a sense of worth in each victory.\n-Intuitive focusing of the camera for each scene does not distract player with needless clicking.\n-Neatly contained inventory focuses necessary items for the tasks at hand\n-Overall, an amazing gameplay experience with replay value if for nothing but the scenery.\n\nCons:\n-Considering the story and depth of play, I wished it would last much longer!\n-In some cases, font was difficult to read given kerning and speed of text.\n-There are a few places where unnecessary items seemed to be necessary.\n-You will always want to move the character just to see the camera change foci.\n\n\nThis is no wonder it won and was a finalist of awards.

What a huge undertaking to build the models and film them, then incorporate them into the game.\n\nThe story is simple, but cute, and there are some cool bits dropped in to create depth about the city.\n\nSo yes, I loved playing it, and if you like puzzle games/arty games, I think you will too.\n\nHOWEVER, there are a couple bummers:\n\n1. The price tag is not worth the game, IMO. I got it on sale so I can't complain, but I would never pay $20 for this game. I personally think $10 is the most it should retail for. That said, I completely understand that the time and effort it took to build this game was huge, and the devs and creators deserve to be compensated. But it's still too high a price for the experience.\n\n2. The game is buggy. I had freezes happen several times, and I had to restart the game and click differently next time. Also this one time I approached a puzzle and it was already solved...so that was a bummer.\n\n3. Its also annoying that Lumi had to get all the way to her destination before you could move again. Not that big a deal, but at times I wouldn't know where I was allowed to go so I would click all over, and it would take me wayyy back to where I didn't necessarily want to be, and I couldn't stop her or redirect. Again, not too big a deal, but it did irk me a bit.\n\nAnyway, if you are rich and have the money, or if it is on sale, yes, get it, play this game.\n\nP.S. Lumi is kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥...\n\n8/10 -Would steal bicycle again\n","August 2, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On top of the fact that the game was so short, some of the puzzles did not seem thought through very well. On about a third of the puzzles, I was basically looking up the answers in the book that the main character is given at the beginning of the game because I could not figure out what to do. There were several instances where the movement system would not move right, and various other bugs like your character (and other objects) not being able to stay flat on a surface while the camera was shifting around the scene, that led me to believe the developers weren't very committed to creating the very clean experience that the game portrays itself to be. And while I did think the hand-crafted set that the creators crafted was really neat, it was not actually that big in the end (leading to the game being shorter than I expected). Some of the craftsmanship of the set was a bit rough as well (improperly sanded edges, gaps between wood, and the pipes connecting the mailboxes look like they were thrown in without much care). Another thing that irritated me a bit was the lack of Steam achievements and trading cards, but I suppose I won't hold it against them. The soundtrack was entertaining, not really any complaints there. Overall, I would say it's fun, and I would recommend it, but certainly don't pay any more than $10 for it (that price even seems to be a bit much to me, to be honest).","June 16, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a real treat for the eyes, too.  My wife and I took our time with it and finished in about 8 hours.  It could be completed much faster, but if you do that, you're missing the chance to really appreciate the little details.\n\nThe puzzles that can be repeated until you figure them out (no game overs) and short episodes make it a relaxing casual game.  Some people experience glitches getting through one puzzle about 1/2 or 2/3 of the way through (we were stopped in our tracks) but emailing the developer via their website solved our problem.\n\nI saw a few people make negative comments about the end of the game (conclusion of the story).

What makes this game so special is the visuals - just look at the screenshots for this game and you'll know what I mean! All the characters in the game appear to be 2D paper figures, whilst the background that they walk is actual imagery of real-life models, which is why the game looks so great. The puzzles aren't too difficult, but at the same time they're not easy.

While you do not need to play the excellent although a bit short first game to enjoy the outstanding second one (which has a solid length of around 10 hours), I would recommend playing both in order as both games are excellent. Lumino City features physically hand-made environments that are filmed at various angles to provide the backdrop and the results are nothing short of spectacular: bright and popping colours, superb vistas as the camera pans around and the outstanding visual design delights at every turn. The sound design accompanies the puzzle solving perfectly and enhances the feeling of strolling through the various areas calmly solving the brain-teasers along the way. The puzzles themselves are very inventive and the presentation is very polished without being excessively easy or - for the most part - excessively hard. The story is also well presented and the witty dialogue by the people you come across even in the background conversations and little bits of information scattered around in the flavour text (such as how a harmonica works) is all very interesting. I encountered a few minor bugs that required me to reload one area without progress loss but did not find other bugs in the otherwise highly polished game. This game won the many awards listed on its store page for good reason, everything from its delightful presentation, solid gameplay, entertaining story and setting to the unique and excellent visuals punctuated by equally excellent sound design and music make it a must have, highly recommended!","July 5, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It could be completed much faster, but if you do that, you're missing the chance to really appreciate the little details.\n\nThe puzzles that can be repeated until you figure them out (no game overs) and short episodes make it a relaxing casual game.  Some people experience glitches getting through one puzzle about 1/2 or 2/3 of the way through (we were stopped in our tracks) but emailing the developer via their website solved our problem.\n\nI saw a few people make negative comments about the end of the game (conclusion of the story).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/205020/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","Lumino City is a great puzzle game.\n\nIt provides a fairly expansive environment to explore, with a wealth of puzzles to solve, and the great thing is: They're actually puzzles. This isn't just some "run around until you can find the item that you need to progress, then combine them in just the right way" type of game. The tools you need are provided in each scene of the game, and you are left with a puzzle that you need to solve in order to progress.\n\nThe puzzles themselves range from fairly easy, fitting cogs onto a board in the right way, to fairly tricky puzzles requiring  logic. All of them (bar one, in my case) were solvable without resorting to trial and error until the solution was found, which is a good thing in a puzzle game like this. There is also an in-game help book that can give you hints if you're stuck, without giving too much of the solution away.\n\nA big strength of this game is the art. The visuals were actually created in real life, then photographed into the game, which gives it a really unique look that I haven't seen much of elsewhere. This coupled with the great sound and music design make for a very nice play through experience. The writing of the story is also very good, with a lot of humorous elements combined with some more sincere ones, it adds a lot to the characters of the City.\n\nMy one (and only) major gripe with the game is that there are parts of the game where you can solve a 'scene' in different orders. Say there are 3 puzzles. If you solve it in the order with the third last everything is fine. But there are cases where, if you solve the third puzzle first, the game either refuses to let you progress or it simply crashes on you. You then have to resort to the forums to see what exactly the 'correct' solution is.\n\nAside from that, this is a very good game if you like actual puzzles without all of the running around aimlessly looking for the solution, and it just looks and feels great.\n","February 25","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lumino City is a mixed bag for me, but the audio and visuals definitely put it into the camp of worth your time.\n\nThe music is fantastic in the game. It mixes well with the cardboard aesthetic to bring together a great game to experience.\n\nThe puzzles are sometime great and fun to solve while others seem arbitrary with extremely little context as to what you are trying to solve. Why is never a particularly pertinant question either. I just stumbled into puzzles and solved them or used the built in solution system to help me through.\n\nI really was hoping for some sort of guiding story. It seems strangely lacking when the world is actually pretty rich, but in the end, the story is "go find Grandad" and they explain the actual story he experienced in the final credits. Not great, but also not the focus. This leads to me feeling uninspired to keep going in the game by the end, but I did really want to get to the ending myself.\n\nOverall, it's definitely worth some time. For more puzzle oriented people, it may be fantastic. If you are just somewhat into puzzles, it's worth playing for the aesthetics, but a guide or walkthrough or something to get you through personally frustrating puzzles will likely help to keep the momentum.","February 27","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The people that live in this tower got animated and added to the scenes and deliver a really heart touching mini story and harmony between these.\n\nWhat is the game about? We play the young woman Lumi who is trying to find her grandfather the handyman. He taught her everything about fixing things, solving problems and using different machines. This leads us to a great variety of puzzles and problems that we will solve in several hours, of course depending on how fast you can progress though these.\n\nThe graphics style is amazing and though the fps are capped to 25fps, it is fitting to the game and look. As I said, the tower was actually built and then captured in pictures and videos, then the people living in that tower got animated and added to the scenery. This is a great style to bring this game to live and the people have some really funny and heart touching interactions with each other and you too.\n\nA fitting soundtrack supports the game and gives a great atmosphere for solving the puzzles. You will love the soundtrack!\n\nI had no problems with the game in terms of bugs, but with the final chapter I was not able to progress on a ladder, if I don’t click immediatly on the next step. Restarting and clicking directly let me progress and see the end.\n\nA truly memoriable game which you can purchase for 20€ on steam.

On top of the fact that the game was so short, some of the puzzles did not seem thought through very well. On about a third of the puzzles, I was basically looking up the answers in the book that the main character is given at the beginning of the game because I could not figure out what to do. There were several instances where the movement system would not move right, and various other bugs like your character (and other objects) not being able to stay flat on a surface while the camera was shifting around the scene, that led me to believe the developers weren't very committed to creating the very clean experience that the game portrays itself to be. And while I did think the hand-crafted set that the creators crafted was really neat, it was not actually that big in the end (leading to the game being shorter than I expected). Some of the craftsmanship of the set was a bit rough as well (improperly sanded edges, gaps between wood, and the pipes connecting the mailboxes look like they were thrown in without much care). Another thing that irritated me a bit was the lack of Steam achievements and trading cards, but I suppose I won't hold it against them. The soundtrack was entertaining, not really any complaints there. Overall, I would say it's fun, and I would recommend it, but certainly don't pay any more than $10 for it (that price even seems to be a bit much to me, to be honest).","June 16, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For instance, I had a baker get stuck in his window with no interactions available with him to continue the story. I had to just exit the scene and re-enter it. Fixed the problem. Continued as normal.\n\nMy only other gripe would be that it sometimes takes a bit of time running back and forth between puzzles and doing things. This would be because of the way the game is. You click and need to wait for the character to complete the action completely before being able to continue and click again. If you purchase this and get to the waterwheel, you'll see what I mean.

The details in the little things you find here and there are just breathtaking.\nThe music is great.\nI haven't seen anyone mentioned it in the reviews but personally, I like the characters and their dialogues as well.\nThere is a wide variety of puzzle, each presented in a unique and charming way. Some of them are a tad bit challenging but not entirely unsolvable.\n\nHowever, there are some cons I'd like to point out..\nCharacter navigating. It's really unclear where Lumi can walk to and where she can't reach. More often than not I found myself sighing and clicking furiously at a location that I think she could reach, but in the end couldn't.\nAlso, I find that the font of the characters' dialogues are just too small...I had to strain my eyes to read them.\n\nGreat game.","January 1","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visual design is quite intriguing and I like the way the areas are connected to one another.  I also really like the way the hint system is incorporated (not that it's ever really needed).  I sometimes would look at the hint for a puzzle after I solved the puzzle itself to see what that page of the hint book looked liked.\n\nWhat I don't care for is that there's really nothing going on in the story, and there's too much dialogue when there should really be next to none.  The game is about showing us the world not listening to a woman complain about her husband using too much salt on his hamburgers.  That stuff does nothing for me.  Also the more traditional inventory style puzzle you must complete to get to the combination/slider block/what have you sorts of puzzles are a bit annoying.  Running back and forth over the screen to give this item to that person is tedious when you have to go up and down ladders and wait for the world to rotate.  That's all quite fun the first time on each new area, after that I'd rather she somehow just warp, I guess, or even better, just have everything you need to unlock the next puzzle on the same screen.\n\nIt's beautiful, but shallow I suppose.  Buy it if you want something to look at, not if you want to crack your brain on some hard puzzles or laugh at witty dialogue.","November 20, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tools you need are provided in each scene of the game, and you are left with a puzzle that you need to solve in order to progress.\n\nThe puzzles themselves range from fairly easy, fitting cogs onto a board in the right way, to fairly tricky puzzles requiring  logic. All of them (bar one, in my case) were solvable without resorting to trial and error until the solution was found, which is a good thing in a puzzle game like this. There is also an in-game help book that can give you hints if you're stuck, without giving too much of the solution away.\n\nA big strength of this game is the art. The visuals were actually created in real life, then photographed into the game, which gives it a really unique look that I haven't seen much of elsewhere. This coupled with the great sound and music design make for a very nice play through experience. The writing of the story is also very good, with a lot of humorous elements combined with some more sincere ones, it adds a lot to the characters of the City.\n\nMy one (and only) major gripe with the game is that there are parts of the game where you can solve a 'scene' in different orders. Say there are 3 puzzles. If you solve it in the order with the third last everything is fine. But there are cases where, if you solve the third puzzle first, the game either refuses to let you progress or it simply crashes on you. You then have to resort to the forums to see what exactly the 'correct' solution is.\n\nAside from that, this is a very good game if you like actual puzzles without all of the running around aimlessly looking for the solution, and it just looks and feels great.\n","February 25","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, the artwork is lovely and it is clear a lot of effort and love has gone into making it.\n\nThe puzzles I think are interesting rather than challenging in what I would consider a 'Mensa style' (shapes, colours, logic etc.) and no challenge is particularly harder than any other.\n\nI found the ending to be the most disappointing / frustrating thing about this game and in my opinion, it's a real anti-climax.

Lumino City is a mixed bag for me, but the audio and visuals definitely put it into the camp of worth your time.\n\nThe music is fantastic in the game. It mixes well with the cardboard aesthetic to bring together a great game to experience.\n\nThe puzzles are sometime great and fun to solve while others seem arbitrary with extremely little context as to what you are trying to solve. Why is never a particularly pertinant question either. I just stumbled into puzzles and solved them or used the built in solution system to help me through.\n\nI really was hoping for some sort of guiding story. It seems strangely lacking when the world is actually pretty rich, but in the end, the story is "go find Grandad" and they explain the actual story he experienced in the final credits. Not great, but also not the focus. This leads to me feeling uninspired to keep going in the game by the end, but I did really want to get to the ending myself.\n\nOverall, it's definitely worth some time. For more puzzle oriented people, it may be fantastic. If you are just somewhat into puzzles, it's worth playing for the aesthetics, but a guide or walkthrough or something to get you through personally frustrating puzzles will likely help to keep the momentum.","February 27","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals really pull you into the game as does the music. Although it may seem cute for kids, it really is an older kid to adult game. The story is great, so far, and really keeps you wanting to move forward. Everything feels alive. I'm still playing.\n\nThere are some bugs when clicking on certain things. For instance, I had a baker get stuck in his window with no interactions available with him to continue the story. I had to just exit the scene and re-enter it. Fixed the problem. Continued as normal.\n\nMy only other gripe would be that it sometimes takes a bit of time running back and forth between puzzles and doing things. This would be because of the way the game is. You click and need to wait for the character to complete the action completely before being able to continue and click again. If you purchase this and get to the waterwheel, you'll see what I mean. It's a minor thing, but just a little annoying at times.\n\nThere is a great deal of satisfaction upon completing the puzzles and seeing/hearing the visuals come to life.

Good puzzles, unique and amazing artstyle, fitting and relaxing music.\nI'm a point & click veteran and I can't praise this game enough. It had everything it needed plus more.\n\nLet's start with the puzzles (most important part imo): They are logical (you don't have to jump through idiotic hoops to solve them), they are not too easy but also not too hard. Overall you get the same difficulty level throughout the game.\nThe art is amazing. It's some mixture of props and computer animation. While I've seen this before, I have to say it's done extremly well in Lumino City, while also fitting it's world. The lovely atmosphere is underlined by the relaxing music.\n\nThe plus(ses): Contrary to most puzzle/adventure games this game runs without a direct hint/help system. At the beginning you find a book that includes solutions/hints for the main puzzles. The crux of the matter is that you can only access them by solving another puzzle/math problem. The restricted accessibility encourages you to give it another try while it doesn't destroy the mood by giving solutions too willingly. Imo a great trade-off, done superiorly to any game I've seen before.\nGreat gaming experience. Hard to explain, but the game comes with a lovely atmosphere and great puzzles that never pull you out of the fluid/smooth experience. The only time I came across something similar was in Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.\n\nEnding thoughts: This game is mostly about it's puzzles, so you shouldn't expect too much character/story wise. Little girl solves puzzles to find her grandpa, that's mostly it (you also run into characters with side stories but nothing too big). There are end credits that also give you more of a background. Overall the game ran pretty well on my system (win7 64bit) and I ran into no bugs or crashes (feb '16).  Only thing I've noticed was the (partly) juddery end credits.","February 2","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a point-and-click, featuring only a little bit of, mostly environmental, storytelling, but makes up for that with a lot of puzzles.\nThe puzzles are challenging. You are rarely told what you have to do and sometimes information, crucial to the understanding of the puzzle, is hidden somewhere else.\nThere is a section where an old man teaches Lumi a guitar song. The player has to memorize the notes and play them from memory afterwards. If you make a mistake, the old man will repeat the part you flunked, but you have to play through the entire piece at once, without any guidelines, if you want to proceed.\nParts like these make me feel like I'm taking seriously. I don't need a pop-up telling me what to do, if I take longer than ten seconds to solve a puzzle and I don't need someone telling me exactly, where to click or which button to press, at any given moment.\n\nAnd in case you really don't get the puzzle, there is a pretty clever way to give you a hint.\nAt the start of the game, Lumi acquires the Handymanual, a book filled with hundreds of pages of strange gadgets sketches. On the second page is an index of equations, corresponding to the games puzzles. The needed parameters can be found in the surrounding area or the puzzle itself. The solution of an equation is the page number, where the puzzles solution is noted.\nOf course, no one tells you how the Handymanual is used; you are told how to open it, no more.\nI don't want to go into a lot of puzzle examples here. Finding things out for yourself is the most delightful part of this game — And I can assure you, every puzzle in this game can be solved by logical reasoning and only little trial-and-error.\n\nWith Lumino City, State of Play delivered a game of "Why not?". Why not hide puzzle solutions in a book several hundred pages book? Why not grow potatoes on the top of your roof? Why not combine a lighthouse with a windmill? Why not attach small houses to the side of a cliff?\nJust trying something out is fun and Lumino City conveys this message pretty well. While the game is linear in its core, the player has to be curious, play with the given appliances and ultimately find the path for himself.\nIn my opinion, this is exactly how a puzzle game should be like.\n\nRead more of my reviews at:\ntheguygaming.com","April 30","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's really unclear where Lumi can walk to and where she can't reach.

As I played a bit more of the game I got the hang of where to go and found that the game actually has a built in guide to solve all the puzzles which is a book found in the main character, Lumi, backpack. The book, which is a beautiful art piece by itself, has an index with simple math questions that usually require counting specific items in the puzzle and the resulting number is a page with explanation / solution to the puzzle - quite brilliant.\n\nIf you like puzzles, picking up Lumino City is a no brainer.\n\n(P.S, I noticed steam does not show the actual time I played the game, which is about 7 hours.
