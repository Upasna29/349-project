I played this game for countless hours back in it's prime, back when I was in high school. I made some friends, I made some enemies, I saw so much world drama, names like Wizzled came second nature to my knowledge. (This guy apparently bought thousands of dollars of stuff from the cash shop, then taunted GM's saying they could never ban such a huge supporter of the game. Long story short, he eventually got banned iirc. Never learned if he managed to get back on.)\n\nI will say right now, I absolutely love Perfect World. It's probably the nostalgia talking, but I've never spent more time in a world than I did with this one. It's music, it's locales, just casually flying around and chatting with people... I've never felt the same way about an MMO as I have this one. (I currently play FF XIV, and as much as I love it, I can't seem to bring myself to converse with others on the level I did back on PW.) I've never clicked install so fast in my life... however... this is not the game I fell in love with...\n\nRight off the bat, the character creation has been absolutely butchered. All of the old hair-styles have been removed from the character creation screen. Apparently you can still get them with ini file editing... but what the hell is the point in that?! I can't make a character without actually seeing how I'm editing them...\nNot to mention, the slides have been absolutely destroyed. Even back in the day, you could make really strange looking characters, from twig apendages, to boobs twice the size of your head, but they were never in the incredibly rediculous range... now... oh my god now... these sliders... you can make the stuff of nightmares... Shoot, the default settings are horrific on their own.\n\nThe original starting zones have been completeley done away with, and replaced by a One for all beginer zone, that I never actually managed to get past due to a dungeon-esque instance near the end that I couldn't find a party for. (This game is old-school, no party finder. Gotta do it the old fashioned way.) Not to mention, the new starting zone just feels... wrong. This may be because I've made SO many alts and played through the original 3 starting zones hundreds of times, but this new one is just... ugh... I miss walking into my race's home village at lv 2-3, and just conversing with the large number of players that were always just hanging around those zones for no real reason.\n\nI've never truly understood how Vanilla WoW players felt until now. Going back to a game I loved so dearly over four years later, and seeing it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized so badly... (I'm pretty sure the game is under new ownership, and that probably has a huge part to do with my feeling really uncomfortable with the game as it stands now.) It almost physically hurts.\n\nI want to recommend this game so badly, but it is no longer the game I loved, and it's too aged to be of much interest to most newcomers these days. If it were to get some huge quality of life changes, such as a party finder, level synch, and a return to the old character creation system, I would recommend this game without a second thought.\n\nIn the meantime, I DO at least recommend looking up the OST for this game. I found myself booting up PW so many times just to listen to the background music while I did my homework in high school. It is so relaxing, and atmospheric... Going back to listen to it now gives me chills, and makes me yearn for a time where this game was great.\n\nI'm going to try to give it some more time, maybe the changes will grow on me. But as a long time old school player of this game, my first impression is that the game is worse off than it was.","April 19","false","15.7"," 736 of 796 people (92%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","92","736","796","47","49"

Well after spending literal thousands of dollars I was still getting one-shot by people who spent more money, or had p-mod friends.\nI kept coming back the the game, for some reason, until one day they compiled the servers(due to too few people playing), and they merged my server with an EU server. My ping shot up from 200ms (on an American server, yes their servers are real bad) to 500ms constant. When I asked support if they could move me to an American server they declined. "That's just something we can't do" they said.\n\nWell it took having a company that I contributed thousands of dollars to spitting in my face for me to finally realize how garbage the game is. The classes are unbalanced. It takes $2500+ to get viable end game gear. You only ever do 3 dungeons more than once. More than half of the content in the game is long since dead (some items and npcs literally have no use anymore). There's no way to get money outside of buying it. The graphics are straight outa 07, and optimization is bad. I have a lot I could say about this game, but the biggest thing is  STAY AWAY FROM IT\n\nTL;DR: Garbage game. Garbage graphics. Garbage PvP Balancing. Garbage PvE. Unmeaninful (Garbage) quests. Pay to win  incarnate . I wouldn't recomend this game to my worst enemy, the most fun you can have while playing it is autopathing around the massive empty map at world height for hours.\n\nOnly plus is the soundtrack.

For how much money they ask players to spend they could hire some proper translators/writers.\n- Terrible time sink. You're literally forced to spend many hours to progress anywhere. It's possible to avoid some of this, by spending, you guessed it, actual cash.\n\nIt's a smart setup by the game makers but players will inevitably end up spending a lot of time and money (or even more time) into this game only to find out that past the starter levels which are just an introduction to the game mechanics, it becomes an unbalanced PvP-heavy game with lots of people gouging the in-game market to get ahead of others by necessity. It's all the bad aspects of an unbalanced MMO with a pretty, Eastern presentation layer on top.\n\nSo, even if I'd want to give this good marks, I simply cannot. Their recent updates have only made it worse despite some of the redesigns they've done to improve characters. Don't waste your time on this, there are much, much better MMOs out there.\n","April 21","false","0.4"," 69 of 88 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","69","88","5","0"

The world is vast and beautiful, though my first return in several years indicates it has not aged well.  The P2W elements have become very strong since my hayday, and the transaction cost for gold to cash currency has become so great that the in-game auction system cannot even support the high cost people require.  This leaves people at the mercy of direct player-to-player trades, which are very poorly implemented (if the other player disconnects mid trade, you are stuck with their listed items, how is this an issue in 2016?) and extremely risky.\n\nThis game had its prime, the only reason it has finally come to steam is to try and squeak out some more profits for the developer.  The combat is dated, clunky and slow.  As a Guild Wars 2 player, I can never return to such poor UI and control options.  Every other modern MMO has upgraded as well, so there is no reason to test such an old F2P game, that does not do anything to ingratiate free players.  Try one of the dozens of other free MMOs available.","April 22","false","1.2"," 55 of 69 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","55","69","3","0"

It is the largest Pay to Win game ever created. You must spend thousands of dollars just to compete on this game and they are not shy about it. For example you have a character that is in his end game gear with decent refines all your skills are maxed and stats are good. If you fight a total cash shop player (R-9 or R-999 which costs thousands in real world money) you may do 200- 300 damage per hit on the R-9 Geared toon BUT when they hit you it is for 150- 200 thousand. That shows you how off balance the game is. Even the PVE is this way. This game does not even try to disguise its greed in any way. Please avoid this game.

I do like that you can fly and swim, and can also engage in combat while doing so, and how there is effort put into pieces of equipment that actually are represented on your character when equipped. While the game definitely is massive and has tons of content, the graphics and combat system are dated and can't be compared to modern MMO's. Questing is as generic as can be, go here, kill that, pick that up, explore this, come back to the NPC for your reward. Low level matchmaking especially in the tutorial zone (which in my case was needed for the job advancement and end of tutorial quest) was nonexistent and I was unable to successfully form a party for the dungeon which I wound up tackling by myself in the end. The biggest turn off for me however is the aformentioned Pay To Win elements mentioned in other reviews, as refining your equipment to have better stats as a paying player is much safer, easier and more convenient than if you were a completely free to play player, provided you have the money to shell out. Overall, I can't recommend this game as there are much better and fairer Free to Play MMO's out there.\n\nI've also written a more detailed review which you can view by visiting the website below:\nhttp://freetoplayreview.com/perfect-world-international-review","April 26","false","16.0"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","30","37","2","0"

I admit that I spent quite a bit of time in PWI, as I made many friends there and every now and again I still listen to the PWI music. However, I can't recommend the game to anyone else. In fact, I advise for anyone considering this game to stay the heck away from it. Here is why:\n\n1) This is a Pay2Win game. It's as simple as that.\n2) The PvE is garbage. The content is crap, same boring, pointless, often mis-spelled quest dialogue, followed up by more boring, unoriginal quest dialogue.\n3) The PvP used to be the reason to play PWI, but the thing is, unless you pay real money to gear yourself, you will never be able to compete with the others on the PvP field. It's not a skill thing, it's not an rng thing, it is very simply a money thing. If you don't pay, you don't get end game gear. Pay money, get viable end game gear.\n4) Game currency doesn't drop, ♥♥♥♥ exp gains, ♥♥♥♥ gear unless you pay real money for gear.\n\nI am a bit nostalgic when it comes to this game, as I remember sinking countless hours (and many, many dollars) into it back in the day, but the new version of PWI isn't even worth the download, imo. The game is old, a lot of the features that were in it before were removed (character creation is looking really lacklustre... didn't there used to be more hairstyles??). I don't know what happened to the starting villages, and the entire game just feels extremely dated. I remember this game fondly through rose-colored glasses, but PWI as it is now is just a waste of time and money.\n\nTL;DR: Game is dated, old, boring, garbage. PvE is absolute crap. PvP is Pay2Win. Gear in the game is Pay2Win.  PWI is just a garbage Pay2Win game.

I loved it!  Going back to it now, not so much. After logging on after not actively playing for a few years, so many things have changed about this game and I don't think these changes are for the better. It's a shame because a few years ago I would have recommended this game to anybody.\n\nEven back in 2011 and 2012 the game was very pay to win, but definitely not as bad as it seems to be now. If you wanted the best gear at the time and you didn't want to grind countless hours for it, it was going to cost you about $1500 if I remember correctly. Yes, real money. Many people at the time would actually spend this crazy amount of money just so they could be the best and one-shot everyone in PVP. I can't imagine the cost of the gear nowadays. It's unfortunate that the game is ruined by this factor. I think it could have so much more potential if players didn't feel like they have to pour thousands of dollars into the game just to get a shiny set of powerful gear.\n\nThe one thing that I will always love about this game is the music in it. It's so beautiful and I recommend checking it out even though I don't recommend playing the game!\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they feel like spending a significant amount of real money closer to the endgame stage. It just doesn't seem like it would be fun anymore.","May 14","false","1.6"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

I like the PVE elements the most, so I don't worry too much about the cash shop.  The thing I don't like about this version of the game is the company.

Quit playing because with each update it became less and less of the game that I enjoyed so much. Fewer and fewer people were logging in and the bosses that you can't defeat alone became one on one because finding help was nearly non-existant unless you waited forever and spamed the chat for help.

I'd recommend private servers, especially since I play on one now, but those are often modeled on the premise that you already played PWI and know some of its aspects, like instances or where to get a certain item, which can be an issue if you've never played PWI, but if that doesn't bother you, then by all means come right ahead.\n\nIt may show only 1.4 hours on my record, but I assure you I unfortunately have thousands upon thousands of hours put into this game ever since I started playing it when I was so much younger (and when it wasn't on Steam - wasn't on Arc even), and it pains me that a game that gave me so much joy and so many memories has been reduced to this.","April 22","false","1.4"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sereniama/recommended/442110/","Sereniama","Cynical Hetalian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sereniama/","17 products in account","Product received for free\n\nLet me be honest here. Perfect World is probably one of the greatest F2P games I had ever played back in the day. When it came out on Open Beta for the Americans and everyone else around the world outside of China, it was hyped. It was a REALLY fun game, the story was lacking a bit, and there was some mistranslations here and there, but it was a refreshing feel. The races were quite unique (especially the Untamed. I LOVE the Untamed. Venomancers are my favourite now because of this game.), the areas are BEAUTIFUL at max graphics for a free to play game, the world is MASSIVE, and the monsters and NPCS actually look pretty good.\n\nNow, honestly, this game could have more potential. For instance, the PVP and PVE is... weird. Okay, so you CAN'T avoid magic or arrow damage, and they act like homing missiles when you fire your bow/crossbow/slingshot/magical spell (And i think its really weird how there's class exclusive weapons for bows and arrows when ANYONE can use those, but not crossbows or Slingshots... like wtf?). There is also lack in variation of uniques for the original 3 classes. Especially for mages... EVERYONE WEARS A FREAKING STAFF OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT! When I saw some things on Perfect World Item Database, there was weapons like Whips, Staffs, and even Shields. Of course, they were probably canceled weapons. I even saw a blacksmith mention tridents and some other weapons, those were canceled too. To be honest, it would be fitting if the Venomancers had whips because their race description says they're seductive beings too, so it would make sense. Because if they have aspects of a succubus, it would fit.\n\nThe PVE I felt is lacking... to be honest, the way of defeating a boss really isn't that interesting. There needs to be more strategey and more safespots for bosses. The fact that if you go too far away from ranging or maging it, they REHEAL. WHY?!?!?! I think every mob needs a magic or ranged attack or not heal and have a stupid AI for the beginner levels, but at harder levels, they gain more of a magical/ranged attack, or even use all three. It's broken, and I think it needs fixing.\n\nOverall, this game is quite average, but I felt it really turned around after 2010. The community is still alive, but the game is really easy now... and pretty quite simple. I just hope someone out there, Perfect World II is being made, and all of these changes can be implemented. Maybe even get a story, since this entire game has VERY LITTLE basings of a Main story. Spiritual Cultivation is confusing at times when it talks about the story. To be honest, if it was a main story from level 1-105, it woudl be nice. Maybe make Fengsha the final boss of the main storyline? Then maybe for level 105s, a new story to go up to level 150? Because i feel that is what the game really needs. So we can keep engaged, and such. Would be also great to have an ironman mode.\n\nAll in all, this game is a 5/10 for me. I mean, I'd play it, but wouldn't. That's why I really don't reccommend this game... It's up to you. I mean, I still play it, but only sometimes.","May 15","false","30.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Obviously, they should fix that for those who didn't want to download their launcher and is downloading it from Steam. Another is, if PWI offer you something, usually redeeming the item is through ARC's site or their launcher and not here on Steam. So if you want their free offers, you'll have to keep that in mind.\n\nMy years of this game is a full running 8 years (almost 9), I quit or rotated around different MMOs that offer better aspects. Don't get me wrong though, PWI itself has its own kinks that makes people keep coming back. The pretty art style, the fashion (if you love to dress up that is), the customization (you can find more on their ARC forums how to make it better customized for your character). The mounts are beautiful as well, the new features they try adding makes it extremely OP in PVE and PVP.\n\nThe downside of this game is, if you are the type who want to be end game, to be THE BEST, to be able to do whatever without a squad half the time, it is PAY TO WIN. Mind you, you can farm it all up within time if you have a set mind for it. But the aspect of those who do pay to win is not learning how to really control one's class properly and you may end up disliked for those who have been around longer like myself. Hell, if you are new I'll even tell you this - no one really helps one another anymore unless you find that special someone who had offer you in All Chat.\n\nPeople who are giving thumb downs for a FREE-TO-PLAY is because they don't look into it completely. I'll be honest, I'm giving it a thumbs down for those who are reading my review, because you can find something much better to play and find more propose in gaining something rather spending money into it just to be THE BEST.\n\nIts my personal thoughts honestly. You can play, try it out, give it your own personal thoughts before anything else.","May 15","false","18.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Anyone looking for fun fantasy world to fully solo it like me, go elsewhere or play just to level 20 :)\n\nTried using graphics button and settings here on steam before loading game after a problem of not everything shown on screen first time, it refused to confirm my settings. I do not have a wide screen monitor and the game via steam will not allow me to play unless it is set on wide screen apparently.\n\nVia Arc this is a playable game, via steam it is not. It doesn't allow any customizing via steam for me.\n\nOverall the game itself, is now play to win, has much fewer people playing at all these days (they have merged most of the servers for the few left playing), and I have ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS HATED that dungeons and cultivation REQUIRES TEAM PLAY...so no you will never solo this game until you get to level 100s and have had to team play every single 10 levels twice or more since level 20.\n\nYeah you have to find a team yourself...goodluck when there is barely anyone online at all, and half are lower level than you and cant help and the other half will run you through a dungeon at warp speed and clerics and duskblades (which run slower than all other characters) get left behind just trying to folllow and no time to pick up drops (some even steal your drops--and you gotta pay for having barely any backpack space so usually you are full and cant even pick up much in any dungeons) once full you gotta dump stuff or wait till you get back to town for your own safe or to sell to a merchant.\n\nDid I mention having a full backpack and full safe? Yeah everyone does, some even have extra characters just to hold things, since you gotta either craft everything or buy it from another player who crafted it (from potions to armor to weapons to accessories)...and yeah you gotta craft it since the drops are crapola.\n\nYou can farm for overall 10 levels worth of experience just trying to up your craft skills so you are then allowed to craft higher level gears. which yes another 10 levels worth of experience for the materials to craft it (by then you are 20 levels up and need to up your craft skills again for newer gears....they began giving new players great gears free that carry them up into about level 40 without the player needing to craft like it used to be, then you get stranded in level 40 needing to go back for low level materials from evironment and monsters in order to up your craft skills right at the moment it is hardest to up craft skills to get to the next level in crafting (so yeah newbies at level 40-50 you will need to craft your own grears and it may take you a few months (to even a year depending how much you play and wanna mindlessly farm....fewer free players farming for materials and selling cheaply now, so they cost a lot and most of the time no one is selling them at all, so yea pay to win players you too will now have to farm since no free players means no one is farming materials....to gather enough materials to up your craft skills to do it, even though you can get to that point in just 1-3 days depending how much you play on those days.\n\nConfusing right? Yep. Mindlessly farm for months on end hoping to up your craft skills since no one is selling materials or lower than 100 gears...no matter how much in game gold or boutique gold you got. No one online at all outside of the busiest town in the whole world at some points in the day and night (most of those offline selling stuff in shops). (I played east coast usa server--used to be 3 servers, now just 1 and still barely anyone online playing, especially at night). Sure people will say nah there are people, level 100+ people, barely anyone under level 80, so not a chance in tartarus of finding a dungeon team your same level to battle any dungeons below level 90. And most 90+ level players are tired of running noobs through same old lower dungeons, since they got all the reputation they need and get barely any other incentive for doing it.\n\nIf you wanna still try playing this game (which is fun up to level 20 when you gotta do your first team dungeon), play it via Arc not steam for better customization of graphics. Enjoy the first 20 levels, then go to a different game or create a new character, since after that team dungeon the game just goes downhill requiring too much farming and team play to enjoy after that. Did I mention I HATE TEAM PLAY!!! I prefer SOLO PLAY AT ALL TIMES! Just because I like fantasy adventure type free world game play doesnt mean I wanna play with other players, its okay if it is entirely optional, in this game it is absolutely required if you want to go up in levels and strength.\n\nSo anyone looking for fun fantasy world to fully solo it, go elsewhere or play just to level 20 :)","May 22","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The world chat is always full of talk, the guilds are always competing for land, the housing system was just introduced, and no I don't have a house yet.  I started playing when it was in Malaysia and switched over to PWI after they opened to the US.\n\nSomethings I cry about losing, but over all, I really missed it for that year or so that I couldn't play.   The music still haunted me.  The landscape was in my dreams at night.  I was one of the people who used to put the server page up to listen to the music while I cleaned house years ago.  The music for that page is gone, but some of the original music can still be found on the original map.\n\nThe only thing I can say is be careful not to spend everything you have on this game.  It will suck you dry if not careful, but it is still possible to play without too much cash.  Just don't try to get top spot in P2W fashion unless you are willing to sink thousands into it.  Just find a good guild where people are willing to help you get through your cultis and you should be fine.","May 20","true","356.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So the graphics might be dated to current technologies.  They have done a good job enhancing the support for higher resolutions.  Performance of the game varies depending on the settings you choose vs what your computer can handle.  I own a mid to low end pc in terms of specs.  I manage to get anywhere from 30 to 50 frames after tweaking the settings to my likings.\n\nThere are many features added over the years that enhanced the experience for players.  Most notably is the removal of the trainers in favor of leveling your skills on the fly.  You still pay for the skills, just no more needless trips back to a trainer to improve your skills.  They improved the Autopathing to avoid obsecles when on foot.  Making it easier to find quest objectives.   The numerous rewards available to players new and old helps keep people interested in playing new characters.  Since everyone gains access to the basic level Aerogear and Mount no one needs to spend real cash to experience the game.\n\nSpeaking of spending real cash.  The boutique houses many cosmetic and enhancing items that improve the gaming experience quality.  Ranging from Fashion to better Aerogear and Mounts.  Despite the many reviews that say this game is Pay to Win, I like to set the facts straight.  PWI uses the boutique in such a way to make the game easier not to win.  All content is available to you in game without purchases necessary.  Sure the use of the Boutique will accelerate the game for you, but it wont improve your skill or give you an unfair advantage.\n\nLittle more details on what I mean by Not being Pay to Win.  The complaints many have is the fact that Rank 9 Reputation Gear you get in the game require the purchase of boutique items.  This was true years ago, but most of the requirements can be met through alternative means.  So if you are willing to work for it you can easily avoid the need to purchase anything using real cash.\n\nWhy you don't need to use real cash, you can trade for the gold that is used in the Boutique without purchasing real cash currency Zen.  Completely by passing the need to pay cash.  Hence why I said PWI is not Pay to win but Pay to accelerate your progress.\n\nI hope this review was helpful and unbias information for players who are interested in the game but might be swayed not to play because of the poorly judged reviews.\n\nPS.  I like to mention that all content that is in this Game are available with zero purchases.  So you can play without a pay wall.  PvP mostly dominated by establish players.  If you are incline to be PvP orient expect to work hard to reach the desired level of competition.  Otherwise PvP is a permission base system, Unless you choose to tag yourself as hostile target.","May 3","true","365.7"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","16","34","3","2"

Indeed, it's hard and expensive to get the end-game gear + maximum refinements, but PWI has a lot more other things to offer.\n\nThe road to level 100. Going through every level, enjoying every quest and exploring the areas and listening to the soundtrack. Oh yeah, PWI has a lot of beautiful areas where you can find yourself standing and staring at the landscape. Or just listening to the beautiful music.\n\nEvery new Dungeon that comes each 10 levels and wondering what new things can I discover here. Joining your first squad and do a dungeon, defeating your first boss.\n\nJoining your first Guild/Faction. Making friends.\n\nBe scared of some huge bosses which later they'll become solo-able.\n\nLots and lots of fashion.\n\nFarming your own gear and feel like you worked hard for it.\nThese are just a few things that come into my mind. If you don't play for being the best geared player on the game (being the best in PvP), then this is a great MMORPG you should play.","April 27","true","0.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","9","20","3","0"

But honestly I rarely play anymore.  Got too expensive for me.  Met some great people in there who I'm still friends with after all these years, one I still play games with every night.  And yeah, we go in there to kiss every once in a while and to check out new stuff as it comes out, but otherwise we just haven't played it much.  As for those complaining, hey, it all depends on how you play it.  I have extreme high level characters down to little baby ones over several accounts, and if you go in looking for a game to play like a career so to speak, then it can be a rewarding one.  Expect lots of work if you want to play "right" and expect to be bored if you want to power level to the top.  Simple as that.  You get out of it what you put in it.  Personally at this point in my life I rarely go in the game, but it was a lot of fun back when i used to play it so many hours every day.  You CAN make it, without spending real money, but expect to spend insane amounts of time working at it.  I was one who did a bit of both.  I probably spent a good $700 or so in there over a few years when I was playing it every single day.  (Had herc and nix and sadly paid full price.)\n\nPWI has a few things going for it no other game I've played has.  Firstly, character customization is fantasic.  Down to being able to modify the ini files if necessary.  (I prefer to see male tideborns with facial hair, thank you.)  Vanity-wise the clothing is fantastic and one of the cool features.  My main character has an enormous wardrobe and way too much fashion for me to say without extreme embarassment at the money spent.  :P  And finally the romance in the game is outstanding and honestly the reason why I still have PWI installed on all three of my pcs.\n\nIt's an old game and it does show its age at times.  The translations can sometimes be a bit aggravating, but overall, is a very social experience and for me it was a lot of fun.","April 29","true","0.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

That was of course years ago, now days there are just so many better MMO's out there that the only reason I see  anyone going back is 100 percent pure nostalgia.

The game was released in circa 2005 and it's till good till this day.\n\nThe people who dislike's this game are probably some kid's that are sad because 11 years old game have bad graphic's but good gameplay. You'll enjoy doing the quest as they are well made plus the story is OK. The map is big.HUGE! I've never played a game with such a big map only euro truck simulator. The map is detailed and the graphic still looks very nice. The one who says it's pay to win it's not. It's true you do have to input some money if you wan't to buy but it's only fashion. Like a skins for cs go, it doesn't do nothing but it makes you cool. I don't know how can one dislike the game because he/she is so dumb it cannot make an account.\n\nThe game might get boring but theres always happening something. You'll have a blast killing so many monster's, leveling up al the characters, leveling up their skill's and so. Back in the day the game was completely full, over 10 server's all full and quite laggy. You can't do nothing if there is 200+ ms ping as there are still many player's. Not new but some since 2013/1015 because they still play. The soundtrack is one of the best in every game that's for sure.\n\nJust try the game before critisizing it.","April 28","true","37.1"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","7","20","0","0"

Someone that has no experience at all in any mmorpgs will enjoy this game but will take very long to catch up. When i made my stormbringer (which was one of the new class last year), it took me 1 month to get it to lvl 100 with just quests and dailys (didn’t need to play 24/7 for that). Then it took arround 2 other months to make it able to pvp and it worth it because I enjoyed pvp with it even if I didn’t bother to gear it properly.\n\nAs for r9rr(endgame gears), most people now are able to get r9 with farming or merchanting when you learn what to do. Myself I managed to gear up 3 character with full r9rr +10 with 12 weapons and decent cards and gems (which is the average gear now in pvp). But in my opinion, this game is worth playing. All the new people i met in game were liking the game, gearing up isnt that hard if you find how to do and is good at it. I know many people that made their char about 1 year ago and geared them like mine or even better in 1 year or less because they knew what they had to do. So if you learn fast and is good in mmorpgs you should take arroung 6-7 months to be able to pvp with the average people, 6-7 months to catch up in a 8 years old game isn’t that bad in my opinion and it totally worth it! I play since 2009 and I still enjoy the game even if it has no more surprises for me now since I know it almost perfectly. I enjoy making new characters to level them up and even working on them to be able to pvp on it.\n\nAlso, myself and many other people that I know often help low level players. There's also many guilds for low levels that help each other and work together to get their stuffs. If you want, I play on Dawnglory server (Europe server) and you can pm me ingame (Seeker_King) for information or help.\n\nSee you in game!\n","April 21","true","550.2"," 15 of 37 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","15","37","2","1"

The game has changed a lot, and much more content has been added. PWI is NOT pay-to-win. That's a false assumption made by those that wish to be 'THE' best with no competition at all and failed to achieve that. Sadly there's many of those around.\n\nPerfect World International is great once you learn the mechanics, although this takes time and patience. It's also a great way to socialize with the large playerbase. Reaching 'endgame' takes a lot of effort though, while a large part of the playerbase have years of experience and work put into their characters.\n\nHaving played this game for more than eight years, i recommend anyone curious to try out the game to avoid setting impossible goals for yourself. Take it easy, take your time to learn how to play the game. PWI might be a little difficult to learn in the beginning, but the fun you can have with your friends in the large open world and many caves are near limitless.

But that's where things kinda end for me.\n\n\nHere's what's changed in the last 7 hour non-stop game run i just did after jumping on for the first time since 2006! :D\n\n*POSITIVE POINTS*\n\n1: I managed to remember my original credentials (which is AWESOME!) and my barbarian is still very much useable, which i'm very greatful for as i had maxed out his bank and inventory slots, and had gotten a small account shared bank for it. On top of that he's my primary weapon/armor crafter. However the control scheme had been altered *severely* and i had to make a new character to get the hang of the new scheme that the game now runs.\n\n2: I've found out something that many of you veterans may over look when you get back into game. There's an "Earning Time" counter that keeps track of enemies you kill in a region (the timer is based on combat log, so if you're in an engagement it counts those seconds, not the overall time of being in the area.). While this timer is active you earn EXP, spirit and drops! Which means a level 50 can potentially earn concentrated glue from the level 35 monsters without the major drop in chance-rate we used to encounter where it became almost impossible to procure materials. This is amazing! I'm very glad for this change. However testing with a new-found friend from the olden-days as well, whom has a level 90: The counter still goes even if you do not acquire drops from the kill. This more than likely means one-shot regions are still not a viable source of material acquisition for level 90's, so make sure you level your crafting/blacksmith/armor and such, while you are below 60, at least until level 4 so you're using things that are available from level 40+ monsters This *should in theory* make it so you can continue leveling even maxxed out on your character's overall level if this testing proved anything...\n\n3: gameplay overall runs smoothely, the game hasn't gotten much bigger than it was 6 years ago when i stopped playing from boredom, but has had many new features added to it and quite a few new quests to keep players going.\n\n*NEGATIVE POINTS*\n\n1: The tutorial zone is tedius as all hell, I'm sorry... the graphics are nice for the region sure but the monsters (especially the Devil Towers in the SilverFox's sunlight Cave/final dungeon in the tutorial) are lacking depth in many reguards. Attacks have little effort put into their detail/effects, monster movement is glitchy and they walk through walls like they always did. I would think with being around since early 2006 as Alpha, going into Beta in 2007 until 2009 and then in open gameplay since 2009, you'd have at least *some* grasp at A.I pathfinding and model clipping. But nothing has changed in that reguard.\n\n2: Auto-Pathfinding is still just as clunky as ever, if not worse. Running into trees, clipping walls and getting stuck, flying causes severe confusion in the auto-pathfinding code which causes your character to randomly dip, turn around, rise and simply stop heading towards the destination. Also jumping causes the Auto-pathfinder to 'back-track' the space you jumped over which causes wasted time.\n\n3: enemy attacks still cause just as much headache for mobile character sprites. "Freeze" (immobilizing/hold) abilities cause your character to jump back multiple spaces after being hit, like a lag spike ocurred between being hit and the A.I firing, which after this long in developement, should have been fixed long ago. Burn statuses cause unwanted sprite-glitches which cause attack sounds to clip/become choppy, health limiting abilities [like the one used by the Silverfox] cause your charm to continue being used if it chops it by half [since it thinks you're at half-health]. On top of that many quests are misleading or lack much thought behind it, as if it was put in at the last moment. Grammatical errors are plentiful, monster kill-counts are minimum at best even when leaving the tutorial paths.\n\n4: The addition of the new gear is great! However you've truly smacked the ability to craft weapons in the face by making people wait to even begin crafting until out of the tutorial zone, since there are no metal/plant materials to be dug up in the region. This means players must create level 1-15 equipment when they're already level 20+ and makes it completely useless to even other players since they too are above level 20 from the tutorial region. In other words, wasted materials and equipment.\n\n5: the removal of safe zones in PWI's main world, which forces new players, and any player under 20, to retreat to the celestial world... This is by far the most irking move i've seen and the biggest gripe i must point out. I've got multiple level 12 accounts which were used to assist newbies get started up and to stockpile materials since level 40's couldn't get needed materials like leather and conc. [concentrated] glue at their level, now they can't even fight monsters in the world because everything in the "beginner" camps are level 20 if not higher. This should've been left as starter zones, specifically to help break veterans returning now that you're on steam and to help newbies who didn't want to work with the celestial grind.\n\n6: The crafting system seems quite useless with the new equipment added. Many 3 star blue equipment fails to compare to the 1 star blue level 2 equipment from the celestial realm. a Level 6, 3 star 4 socket BloodFang Sledghammer (513 damage with no gems) fails to hold a candle to the 580 damage of the level 2, 2 star blue battleaxes given to new players from the celestial tutorial world. That sledge is for level 45 players, being out classed by a weapon for level 16, which is kind of sad when you think about it.\n\n\nTL:DR: Alot of what you did made this game much more enjoyable, but you left a ton of errors that should have been fixed in the last 6 years, and never did it. These problems have only made those nice changes, look like a badly painted tarp over a smoldering campfire.\n\nThe game is nice, and i do suggest playing it. But don't expect a miracle from a game made back before 2010 after it has been raked over the coals like this.\n\n6/10","April 24","true","21.7"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","7","0","0"

The game was relatively Free 2 Play, where you have to farm/grind, and party your way to the top, where it was pretty costly to get the high tier skill books, but all in all, a pretty nice game.\n\nThen came the initial R9 update, at first it wasn't that bad, having it being reviewed, and was implemented in the game without a cash shop following for quite some time.\n\nBut when it did come out in the cash shop, samething that was equally hard to get to achieve such weapons also came into play:  Reputation Badges...\n\nThis quickly became "Work hard to get what you want" to "Pay a metric butt ton and you get what you want"\n\nA few months after that I started my mostly 3 year hiatus, keep in mind currently I've been on this game for 6 years, give or take, and including that 3 year hiatus.\n\nAfter 3 years I came back, both for curiously and boredom's sake.  and in November somethingth, 2015, I embarked on something entirely different, and I like it.\n\nSure, R9 can be reforged twice, and Nirvana gear had a 3rd tier as well, but if you didn't have your character built up through a certain map's dailies and whatnot, you're going nowhere.  Getting R9 is easy, even for the massiively free to play, Mostly everything that's outside of luxury is free...  (I'll get to that other some in a sec)\n\nNow comes the newest patch, and so far I can only see this going up from somewhere that has been going up for a while now, some people might hate this game after so many year and thought this game was dying/dead, but then again, so many other "bigger games" has communities that always spout that as well, when in reality stand tall.\n\nWe have a nice handful of people from various server, a lot of dedicated people, both good and nice.  The PvP's not too bad for a tab-target game and in general just getting mroe and more polished out.\n\nTo the players who think this game is still dead, and to the new people who are interested.  Give it a shot (again for some).  You might like it again.\n\nNow...  Back to the mostly everything is free.  There is a top rank necklace that's only in cash shop packs, but...  Give it time, and currently the Grade 16 cube necklace will do just fine for you...  I wish I had one, I better work at it.  haha.","April 24","true","332.2"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","6"

It's not p2w, since you can get anything with in-game money, but it costs quite a lot and requires a lot of time. The game is not optimized as much as it could be, but well, it runs. It has a solid playerbase, and servers in each region.\n\nThe world is huge, filled with dungeons, bosses and lots of cool stuff.\nYou can choose between 6 races, each race having 2 classes, adding to a total of 12 classes.\n\n\nDespite the fact that people say it's p2w, i think you should still try it out since you can get anything w/o paying, and also you could have a lot of fun. ~plus, the game is free, you don't have anything to lose.
