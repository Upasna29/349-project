A simple concept yet so challenging.  Great to pass the time.  If you know what a three-body problem is, then you'll love this game.\n\nSimilar to:\n\nKerbal Space Program and Osmos\n\nEdit: A builder mode would be nice.  Looking forward to seeing new features in future updates.  Keep up the great work, dev!","March 18, 2015","true","9.1"," 83 of 96 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","83","96","7","0"

Sometimes I'm not looking to build a space ship or castle, fight zombies or blow the crap out of everything.\n\nIn Orbit, you influence a comet orbiting around planets, but in doing so, the comets shell is slowly lost to space.  Lose all of your shell and you lose you influence and gravity completely takes over.  As you progress and gain 'Stars' you can increase the comets speed or the strength of its shell. It's not without it's difficult levels and I'm not sure how much replayability there is (it seems replayability is not a word), but I'll likely only play through it once.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeAVHdbta4M&list=UUMc9vxo5NN-yMIkAecJ87Bg\nOverall I think Orbit offers good, low pressure gaming for a reasonable price and the casual gamer will probably enjoy it.\n\nGameFace","March 19, 2015","true","1.8"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","23","25","3","0"

The unique twist comes here with the element of orbital mechanics.\n\nMeeting the bare minimum requirement to pass the levels just requires a few stable orbits - getting higher scores, ratings and stars to unlock stat improvements and new avatars requires you to really think about three body mechanics and is addictive as all hell.\n\nThe author is also clearly engaged with the community, and I expect this one to keep improving as a result. I reccomend this one wholeheartedly.","March 25, 2015","true","1.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Orbit is a very fun yet technical game where you, in most cases, will plan out your moves to be as strategic as possible and at the same time avoiding collisions with other planets.  The levels range from very easy to extremely hard (not impossible) and I can honestly say this is a fun game altogether and I am still having fun with it!","March 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
