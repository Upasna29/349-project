I can relate to them. But an hour will only get you so far in this game. There is a lot to explore.  Which might I add is saying a lot for a game that was just released, and being developed by 3 people. For what it is I say it is worth the price.","January 27","true","8.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

It's kinda puzzley when it comes to finding your way out of the castle, but hey maybe you'll enjoy that. The one thing I hate about this game is the damn "survival" aspect of needing to eat all the time haha. Geez did that p*ss me off :P. I really like the price point on this game though.. most devs would've tried to sell this for $10.\n\nVideo speaks louder than words: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bk-S475K4Y","February 3","true","0.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","0"

I want to play this game.  However, I am an old gamer and this game has no adjustment to make it easier for me to play.   I live for the story, exploration, and the fights.  Managing my resourses takes a back seat to the adventure.   It is early and with luck these nice developers will fix it a bit.  Exploring Castle Torgeath will have to wait till then.

Plays like King's Field.\n\nFor anyone who hasn't played that series it may feel clunky. The graphics aren't that great, but it doesn't affect gameplay adversely.

Honestly, I am not sure how this game has garnered so many positive reviews.\n\nThe second I started the game and saw the intro graphics I was worried. The static image of a castle with cones parked on top of cylinders was really, really dated.  Then I saw the hands. THOSE HANDS. Why? Why the pencil fingers? How is that something that made it in a game? Why the awkward arms held out like mannequin arms like that?\n\nOk, well, let's be fair then; I've played games with bare-bones graphics and enjoyed them. Well, the combat is like swinging a sword under water.  From what I played monster AI was basically if the mob sees you is b-lines at you and gets stabbed to death.  Sometimes it would dodge backwards and come at you again.  Pretty uninteresting overall.\n\nThe battle music takes the surprise out of combat and 5 seconds after combat is over it comes to an ♥♥♥ grinding halt. Like a BMG switch was flipped.  Then eventually the standard BMG kicks in. It was so jarring that it completely ruined any immersive quality the game had.\n\nYou can pick up things but the cursor doesn't indicate whether something can be interacted with as you've come to expect in modern releases.\n\nThe story is well written and I think that a lot of the positive hype is because this game has potential.  I can't argue potential here as Castle Torgeath has a long, long ways to go to be a solid and polished gaming experience.  I think the loot chest is the only asset in the game that was up to par graphics wise.\n\nPros:\n-Story is not bad\n-The music is OK when it's not stopping suddenly\n-Price point is low\n\nCons:\n-Combat (everything)\n-Graphics (everything except the loot chest)\n-No autosave\n-No voice acting to compliment narrative\n-Hands\n-The Hands\n-Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ needle fingered hands\n\nAnyway, I will be replaying this gave farther into development and if the game improves I have no issue updating my review.  I honestly would love this game to do well but this Early Access may have been a bit -too- early.","January 25","false","1.1"," 40 of 71 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","40","71","8","0"

And the first time you swing the sword you start with, you'll likely think "ugh! soo slow!"...\n\nBut don't judge a book by it's cover!\n\nHere is my "First Play on Launch Day! (Early Access)" video...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUzoP8xrafA\n\nStay patient with this game, and it will reward you, even on this first day of it's early access launch.\n\nThis game offers creepy spiders galore, lots more baddies waiting to ruin your adventure, and while the A.I. is far from great and could use some work, it's still fun and will have you desperate to get your own hits in, especially when taking on multiple enemies at once!\n\nThere are hidden traps everywhere, and keeping your eyes open and your torch lit are vital to your survival on this expedition to escape the castle once the doors you entered close shut for good on you!\n\nThis game features multiple weapons to be found and used as you venture further into the crypts of the castle, and while you don't start with any kind of character creation or get to choose your class, you'll get to experience a little of every class if you can complete this game.\n\nAs long as you don't go into this game expecting to play the next Skyrim, I think you'll be happy with the fun to be had in this indie RPG.  As it continues its development, I would expect it to only get better, and at $4.99 USD regular price, you could do a LOT worse with your money!\n\nThere is NO procedural generation of loot, dungeon rooms, or mobs.  It's going to be the same game every time, but just finishing the game is the challenge. The developers say about ten hours is expected to beat the game, that equates to about 50 cents an hour.. which to me seems like a pretty good value, even if there really is no replayability.\n\nI give this game a recommend based mainly on a high value score and the fact that once you get past the old school graphics and slow combat, this game offers quite a bit of fun...\n\nValue:  36 out of 40\nFun:  22 out of 30\nControls & Bugs: 15 out of 20\nGraphics & Sound: 6 out of 10\n---------------------------------\nMy total score on Day one of Early Access: 79%\n\n79% is not bad at all for a game that launches on sale at $3.74 USD that offers many hours of dungeon crawling gameplay and understanding the game will likely only get better as it goes through its early access development.\n\nThis game gets my recommend to anyone who won't buy this game expecting it's gonna be the next Skyrim or Diablo AAA game.  While it could have better graphics, a faster combat, and better mob AI.. it still packs quite a lot of RPG adventure goodness for your gaming dollar!","January 22","true","1.6"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","28","51","5","0"

As of today, there was an update, where there were some additions and fixes. There was one problem that I had that was the input lag, for me, it was unplayable with that in the game, but today it was fixed. I was actually suprised that the developer listened to our critisisms and didnt take them too harshley, which im greatfull for and this only made my intrest in the game peak, the fact that they made an extra update before the scheduled one for feb, was awesome. I hope you keep this up, because I can see this getting better and better over time. I apologise for not giving this a fair review and please, do take what you are about to read with a grain of salt. When more of the problems get fixed then ill edit this post  to remove them! keep it up guys!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile this game is rough around the edges, animations are bad, key bindings are broken most of the time and the input lag it terrible, i do see some potential. This could be a great game if there was more time put into it.\n\nTHINGS I LIKED:\n\n1. THE ATMOSPHERE IS GREAT, THERE WERE TIMES WHERE I ACTUALLY GOT SPOOKED\n2. THE MUSIC IS NICE AND FITTING\n3. THE OPTIONS ARE BETTER THAN MOST CHEAP INDIE GAMES CREATED WITH UNITY. THERE ARE SOUND BARS!!!\n4. HAVING TO MANAGE YOUR HEALTH AND HUNGER GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DO WHEN YOU ARE WALING ARROUND AND LOOTING ROOMS\n\nTHINGS I DISLIKED:\n\n1. THE LACK OF VSYNC\n3. THE ANIMATIONS ARE SUB-PAR\nI did find 1 or 2 bugs where the crosshair would dissapear and my weapon wouldn't swing, but at this current point in time, do I recomend it? no. There is lots of work to be done and while it is in early access, all I can say is that it needs improving, alot. If I come back to this in a future date, and some of the issues have been fixed, then I can reccomend it.

A creepy game that is set in a dungeon and where RPG elements are combined with survival elements.\n\nWhat I also like is that I control only one protagonist, I control him freely and directly and the movement is not grid-based, unlike other dungeon RPGs, many of which are party-based as well. I like it when I play as a single character.\n\nI haven't played a lot yet, but I'm willing to give feedback.\n\nWhat I really liked about this game:\n\nThe price, of course.\nThat the game is not overcrowded with enemies and doesn't focus on constant fights. As a result, the game is slow-paced and creepy. It's immersive. If the dungeons were full of monsters, it would ruin the atmosphere. It's better to have a small number of monsters that are dangerous and scary.\nThat the dungeon is not so straightforward. There are passages and hallways that are not connected with each other and lead to separate areas.\nThe availability of character customization options. I want my character to be unique.\nThe overall idea and setting. An intriguing story, dark dungeon exploration, necessity to survive, frightening surroundings.\nThe graphics, style and design. They're pretty old school and make the game even more gloomy. I especially liked the statues.\nThe music is surprisingly fine. It was a good idea to use such ambient music as a main soundtrack in the castle. It helps to create a dark and haunting atmosphere that is essential for this type of game.\nWhat I'd like to be changed or improved. A few suggestions:\n\nThe halls and rooms look empty at times. They could be embellished with paintings, weapon racks, furniture, some useful items etc. Anything that might be suitable.\nThe ability to block enemy attacks and to strike with the torch. I'd like to have it.\nThe way the protagonist holds the sword looks kinda weird and unnatural.\nThe first NPC I met was weird too. He looked like a statue or a zombie. Maybe his position or animation could be changed to make it more realistic.\nI wish there was a sneak skill to avoid some hazardous enemies if the protagonist is not prepared to face them.\nI didn't notice any bows in the game. I saw a crossbow only. A variety of weapons would make the game more interesting.\nI would like to see a 'hardcore mode' where a player is able to save his progress either at certain 'checkpoints' or a limited number of times. I want the game to discourage a player from constant 'save/load-s' and from feeling safe in this castle. I want the game to force a player to survive. >:\nI'd like to see barrels and bottles of drinkable wine as an addition to other consumables. I didn't notice any. A medieval castle without wine? No way. See my current avatar. ;) It would also boost protagonist's bravery, something that he really lacks. :)\nAnyway, the concept of combining a dungeon RPG with survival elements and creepy atmosphere really appeals to me. The game has its peculiar charm.\n\nUpdate:\nI've just defeated the giant spider and proceeded to the next area. Wow, it was a disturbing adventure.\n\nI love it when these types of things appear in games. In combination with appropriate ambient music they often create a grim and hellish atmosphere.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665138388\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665138486\n\nIn spite of enjoying the game, I feel a little uncomfortable while playing it and I feel sorry for the protagonist. It's due to the mentioned atmosphere of gloominess and despair. The developers managed to create it, well done. On the other hand, this type of game helps me to 'relax' and forget about everything after a busy day and daily routine.\n\nI wish I could light a fire here...\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=664623114\n\n...and drink a bottle of wine...\n\n...to warm and cheer the protagonist up. ːsteammockingː","April 13","true","14.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It hearkens back to the older dungeon crawlers, a genre in sore need of good new games. I honestly got the urge to pull out a pen and paper and begin mapping out a game for the first time in years!
