It's that close, but there are a few crippling flaws that just ruin it. First, there's the combat. There are different ranks of creatures, one through four, one being weakest and four being most powerful. The problem with this is, after a certain point, anything below rank three will die in the first turn of battle because the enemy AI consists entirely of 'KILL WEAKEST CHARACTER'. The combat maps are tiny so forget any sort of strategy, mid and end game opponents can hit you anywhere you stand. Oh, and those opponents are almost always all one to nine monsters, plus nine to twelve wizards. There are three wizard types, and you will see up to a dozen in every single combat.\n\nThere are dragons in the game, and you can find them as random encounters. That isn't a problem. A single low level dragon can be beaten, but it's fairly tough unless you come loaded for end game critter hunting with high end, high level units. It's cool. You get an achievement. What isn't cool is that the dragons can spawn in groups of up to six, and all of them in the level 15 range. There might be worse groups out there, but this is literally what invaded one of my provinces in my current game. This isn't something you can fight. I also mean that Literally. You can not defeat these multiple dragon encounters. It isn't possible. You can build an arena in your home province and send heroes to battle in it to gain experience. Why am I mentioning this? because as soon as a hero reaches level ten, the enemy heroes you battle in the arena can also spawn with dragons as minions. It goes about as well as you'd expect.\n\nOn the plus side, your units can level up and improve their abilities, but it really doesn't matter, because a lvl 30 tier one unit will still be instagibbed by a lvl 1 tier four. And the upgrade system is utterly worthless as well. Why yes random number generator, I did want to improve my crossbowmans hand to hand skills for the fourth time in a row. No, he doesn't need better ranged attacks, he needs to be able to swing that butterknife he has like a man!\n\nThere are hundreds of items you can find, which is nice, but there's almost no storage space for them. You get a tiny little vault that can't be upgraded. It wouldn't be so bad but on the same screen you have access to the merchant window to sell stuff, and hey, if you guessed that had a scroll bar and infinite space in it, go get a cookie or something. You can build an artifact shop so you can buy artifacts, but unfortunately it doesn't cycle through different ones. You get the opportunity to buy three randomly chosen ones and it never changes for the rest of the game. Those three items are pretty much going to be terrible and I really want to chalk it up to being a bug that it doesn't refresh every so often, but it's been like that since release so probably it isn't.\n\nThere are four types of hero you can recruit, but you shouldn't bother getting anything but a warrior. The warrior is so much better than the other three it defies belief. Scouts can be useful for the rare encounters designed exclusively to kill warriors, but that's about it. Oh, and yeah, there are encounters designed from the ground up to murder warriors. packs of medusa will petrify you and then poison you, giant spiders will web you down and poison you, giant slugs will poison you if you hit them or vomit poison on you from a distance if you don't.\n\nEdit: Okay, so I finally managed to grind a mage high enough to use a specific spell named 'white magic', and basically, it lets you break the game over your knee like a rotten twig. Two casts will clear virtually any combat encounter of critters, barring the two (the latest update may have added more) creatures who are magic immune. Once you get one cast per combat, better beleive that mage is going straight to lvl 30 since he can now effectively obliterate entire armies. Unconquerable foes turn instantly into big, meaty sacks of free XP. Just load up every unit slot with lvl 1 swordsmen, the enemy creatures/mages/whatever will go and kill them while your mage, free and unharmed, fires magic nukes that hit EVERYTHING ON THE MAP FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE. This is a well balanced, well implimented ability that reduces multiplayer combat to 'whoever goes first wins'. Casting it does a small amount of damage to the mage, but a couple of healers can fix it easily before any monsters that made it to turn two kill them for being a weaker, easier target than the wizard FIRING MAGICAL NUKES AT THEM.\n\nOh, and I hope you like really, really really loud TING! sounds, because the game plays one over and over at random for no reason I can discern.\n\n\nEdit: I also hope you don't like loading saved games, because doing that while the game is running will cause the entire thing to crash. Not always, but often enough that I had to mention it.\n\n\n\n\nShouted at by a dev and I didn't even get an acheivement for it.","April 28, 2014","false","87.0"," 417 of 512 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","417","512","16","26"

My opinion is that someone who hates the game will over exagerate the flaws, but at least will talk about the flaws where someone who loves it is less likely to. That being said, I still love this game even though it has flaws. However, some people won't like it as I do so I will begin with the negatives then move on to the positives since that's how I approach it anyway.\n\nNegatives:\nCrashes too much. I'd say once every few hours of play time you will have the game crash. It's not enough to bother me, but it can be frustrating.\nAI can be off pretty bad. Battles that will tell you are impossible sometimes can be beaten manually without losing a single hit point. Battles that say they are so weak they are not worth your time will sometimes wipe you on auto. That doesn't happen all of the time, and with some play time you can easilly judge for yourself. Also computer players will keep throwing themselves at your defenses every time they resurect even if they die every single time in some situations.\nBugs. There are a few, one that for some reason will pop up the AI's hero screen in front of me which has shown me they get a +10 gold per turn bonus per hero at the level I was playing at.\n\nPositives\nIt is constantly changing. Every time you start a new character or see a new world, the game will be different, different maps, different quests available. It kind of reminds me of Civ in that aspect.\nYou can chose how you play. Some games require you to be the hero, some games require you to be the villian, this game requires you to be whatever you feel like being.\nIt is a great strategy game IMO. Losing a single soldier at the wrong time can cost you an entire map, granted like most strat games you can always load fail (load the game and redo a fight because you lost), but not all of us play like that.\n\nSo with all of that I'd say the game play and replayability are worth it. The bugs and glitches and even AI issues can be fixed (or modders can fix them if it ever opens to mod on steam). Overall I'd say the positives outweigh the negatives enough for me.","April 12, 2015","true","055.5"," 121 of 130 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","121","130","5","2"

I recommend it because the core game is absolutely great and I love such games in general. I also don't want to harm the devs because they really tried hard and have created a real rough diamond but some mayor design issues will spoil the fun for probably most of the common players!\n\nSo I only recommend it to die hard 4x fans with masochistic tendencies and/or you might want to grab it on sale :)\n\nMy review became a mini guide so here is the overview and I will post more details in the comments.\n\nGood:\n- Very deep 4X game mechanics (with a focus on battles)\n- Great turn based battle system (focus on tactics and not luck)\n- Good RPG elements regarding the hero/unit development\n- Many different units to hire and fight (most or all of the enemy units can also be hired if you are lucky to get an offer)\n- Polished graphics and menus\n- Nice humor (you can either play a good or evil “god” and the evil options are really funny to read)\n\nMixed:\n- Not many armies to control or cities to build up so micro management doesn’t get out of hand\n- Hard to learn even harder to master\n- Endless playtime (if you can stand it - might be good for players who rather want to play in doses instead of one huge map/battle)\n\nBad:\n- Tedious game mechanics\n- Monotonous game play (most of the time you spend doing the same over and over again until you finally see/find/unlock something new)\n- Easy to get stuck in “dead ends” (as long as you haven’t learned how to avoid them or have the patience to wait (for lucky random events or gaining gold/experience over time) or reload/restart)\n- Still some bugs (Happened once that an enemy unit was not removed from battlefield and I had to reload the fight)\n\n\nSo what to expect from the game?\nI expected another Fallen Enchantress/Warlock - MotA clone but this game plays quite different. There are the same features in place but they are used in a different manner. Think of starting one of the mentioned games. Build/take over your first cities on an isolated island and form your armies, then, when you are ready to conquer the next island: you have to start over.\nThis is basically happening in Eador. You conquer a "shard" where you face 1-2 enemies (at the first shards) and as soon as you conquered it you lose (mostly) everything you had earned the last hours. The shards do work on a greater scale though. They unlock new buildings/units and give some mild benefits to the starting condition of the next shard. I also can only speak for the first shards because even though I played 16 hours I'm still on my second shard! (+ the good tutorial that took me 3 hours alone) According to the forums there are 80!! shards to conquer - go figure the playtime you need to beat the game. Though I have to say I always fought my battles and didn’t auto resolve them because I’m a control freak and don’t trust the AI so you can decrease playtime a lot by automated battles.\nI also don't want to complain about a long playtime but the simple problem here is: motivation. I think it would have been much better to only have like 20 shards but instead increase the rewards you get for conquering each shard and thus give a better feeling of actual progress.\nWhich leads to the real problem here, because having an extrapolated playtime of 400 hours and making only small steps on your way from shard to shard don't has to be bad in general, but the real issue is: The start of each shard is tedious and often frustrating.\n\nYou start with you major city, the only one you can really build up (and if you lose it to an enemy it's game over). Even conquered enemy cities are just better "provinces".\nSo now you can start constructing buildings from different categories that either increase income, mood, get you access to certain military units, spells or items. You also have to hire a hero because there are no armies without heroes! So the heroes are the real stars of the game and they are significantly better than every other units you get (at least in early game). You can choose from 4 different classes: Warrior, Scout, Commander and Wizard.\nThe problem is: The hero alone is not able to win most of the fights even right at the start of the game. You need either supporting units, spells or items to make him capable of conquering the provinces around your city. More units sounds like a good idea but they cost money and upkeep and the AI tends to attack the weak units first so they most likely get killed fast. Also when you buy units you don't have much gold left to build up your city. So what happened to me in the first level was that I started with a warrior (because he was great in the tutorial), build up the city and tried to conquer the provinces around me.\nWhen you attack you get a nice text that estimates the outcome of the battle. It also tells you how many units you spotted and which kind of units they are. It is still a little vague because when you spot 8 units of militia and bowmen it makes a great difference if there are 1 or 6 bowmen and you won't know that. So despite the text I at least started every fight and would have lost all of them (tried - failed - reloaded). So my only chance to finally progress in the game would have been to use another (great but overused) feature: Exploring.\nEvery province (or tile) has a level of exploration. You can send your heroes to explore the tile which will give them experience (very important, but very slow), lets them find locations (most of the time fights that are often too hard to win but bring very important loot and gold/ you can also find shops with special items or units to hire) and expands the province for the population (lowers effects of overpopulation).\nSo back to my problem: It would have taken ages until I got strong enough to finally start conquering the provinces so I restarted the shard and chose the scout hero. The reason is that ranged combat is a little overpower and the scout alone can win some battles as long as the enemy doesn’t have too many ranged units himself or too strong and fast melee units. I guess you can also use the wizard for that matter (not tried yet) but if you go for a melee character I suggest to invest in spell granting buildings (especially magic missile) so that he can deal some harm from a distance.\nSo with the scout I was finally able to gain some ground and get the game going. Eventually I was able to hire a second hero (which makes sense because just 1 army to cover ~30 tiles is difficult, especially when the enemy starts attacking).\nWhich leads to 2 more problems:\nFirst, when you hire a new hero midgame he is starting at level 1. You might have some items and spells available to give him or perhaps even can give him the supporting units from your experienced hero (but then this hero is significantly weaker) but all the easy fights are already done by your experienced hero so there is no (comfortable) way to level him up and make him actually useful. You can only explore and trial and error random fights.\nSecond: The enemy is really annoying. He often has several heroes (more than you have) and can take every province by just moving on that tile as long as you didn't buy any guards there. The point is that those guards cost money and all they bring is defend the province against a possible hero attack (later on you get access to better units that have more benefits like auto exploring the province or even increasing the income of that province (still less than their upkeep though)). So when you start taking provinces you don’t want to spend your money on hiring guards but rather want to wait until you have an actual frontline. But when you finally have one it usually consists of 4-5 tiles per enemy.\n\nI will continue my description in the comments as the text got cut off here in the middle of my explanation! :(","December 29, 2014","true","17.6"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","59","64","2","10"

That having been said, I would also like to point out that many triple A titles are more often then not unpolished and lacking on release, but patched at some point. As others have said, the game plays somewhat like Civilization/Heroes of Might and Magic. The developers don't seem to be in full swing patch-mode anymore either, which is really sad because it needs it.\n\nOne of the things I enjoyed the most was the exploration aspect of the game. Your heroes explore each province to provide more land for the province's population to settle comfortably. In the process you come across bandits, monsters, and unique shops. Sadly, for each positive aspect of the game, it tends to turn around on itself and bite it's own rear end. In this example , the game all but forces to you play with a "rush/zerg" mentality. Getting your hero(es) to the enemies stronghold as fast as possible, because nothing transfers over to the next map, and building up your empire on the shard is more or less wasted time. Couple that with the fact that the longer you play, the more the AI seems to advance in suspect manner (I've more then one grumbled the word "Cheater" at the computer screen).\n\nThe game is very good, I played it for a long time and still visit it when the mood hits.

Highly random starting positions can vary the difficulty from "cakewalk" to "impossible," and strategy games should be decided more by your decisions than by randomness. Hero units drive the game, so if your starting area is  good, you steamroll the map; if not, you may be able to grind through, provided the enemy hero did not get a steamroll start that lets it one-shot your troops and two-shot your hero. "First OP hero wins" is not an interesting strategy dynamic.\n\nBefore each fight, the game evaluates your forces versus your enemies and gives you a difficulty estimate from "no casualties" to "no chance." Whatever math is being done does not compare the units' strengths and weaknesses. You will regularly find impossible "easy" fights and "run away!" fights you can win without taking damage.

Dog slow out of what it could be.  2/5\n\nGood intro to TBS?  1/5\n\nThis game's learning curve is poorly designed and might turn off many beginners to the genre permanently.  A lot of the game is figuring out "this map is unplayable - I have to re-roll" or "this _campaign_ is unplayable - I have to re-roll."  Occasionally a really fun map does show up.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy main complaint with this game is the random map generator.  Some maps seem to be fine, but others are practically unplayable.  Or they are barely playable in the openning game only to find out later that you were destined to be steamrolled by the opponent.\n\nThe game makes no effort to generate "fair" maps from what I can tell.\n\nMy second complaint is that the campaign suffers from the same problem, since it also uses random maps.  That's right - a campaign with randomly generated maps.  Which means a normal distribution of players will see some players able to beat the campaign on the hardest setting, while others won't be able to beat it on even very easy settings.\n\nSound stupid?  Well, whatever you want to call it, it still needs work.  Maybe it's similar to how Civ II would sometimes just be a bad map roll - but it is tedious to spend time learning the player skill "oh this map is crappy - now I have to start over".\n\n\nOf course - it's REALLY TRICKY.  The game can offer a feeling of tension, of not knowing "how far behind am I?" and "am I wasting my time on this game?"  So maybe that's the largest enjoyment it has to offer - that feeling "do I have any hope of winning whatsoever?" before being plunged mercilessly to your death.  Ha!\n\nThe weakness seems to be a complete lack of balance between map economy and unit maintenance costs.  Don't believe me?  Try finding screenshots that show armies with high level units.  They are rare.  Which tells me the player base just never finds gameplay involving high levels.  By the time you could afford the big guns, the map has already been used up.  That's my guess anyways.\n\nLastly, progress is excruciatingly slow, both in the campaigns, but also on a single map.  It will take forever to see characters level up, and I think this design is probably intentional, but really misses the boat on making hitting the sweet spot on playability and fun.  After a while it really feels like a grind.  At least the Civ games had a pace slider, and that would help this game a lot.\n\n------\n\nAs long as you clearly understand these shortcomings, I still recommend the game for its unique tactical layout and game mechanics. My first impression of the game has not been overwhelmed by the short-comings I only figured out after playing many many hours.\n\nDon't like tactics?  THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU THEN.  The core mechanic of the game is the tactical map - sort of these mini-chess games that pop up over and over again.  I get tired of them after a while, and they can become rather complex.  It's not as deep as chess -- nowhere close -- but it's a similar mental workout.\n\nI guess the only thing to remember if you decide to buy this game: "play it looking for the fun that it has to offer."  It's in there.\n\n\n\n~~~~~~ Here is my response to someone asking how Eador compares to Warlock ~~~~~~\n\nWarlock is a good beginner 4x. It's relatively lightweight, it has a sense of humor, the\ngraphics are good. But the content is not huge. I played many many Warlock games\neven when it first came out and I'd skip 20 turns because the AI back then was crappy.\nBut they've improved the AI. In Warlock you'll expand your kingdom until you've moved\nfar enough in your religious rating that one of the gods gets angry and incarnates to\nbattle you. Then it's that boss battle and the game is over IIRC. Battles are ALL on the\nmain map - there is no tactical battle map like in Eador. An average game in Warlock\nis maybe 300 turns or less, and they go by fast. Probably less than 2 days for a game.\nI'll probably play Warlock again in a couple years or so - but it's not as good as say\nCiv5. Warlock does "just one more turn" very very well.\n\nIn comparison, Eador stands out in that the RPG element is the heaviest I've seen in\nany 4x. I have finished a few low difficulty games, which wasn't very satisfying. But\nmoving into "competent" difficulty and it gets frustratingly difficult. Lots of luck is\ninvolved and restarting games is common (and again, frustrating). But there's a sense\nthat (or I have this sense anyways) that the tactical options are mind-blowing what\ncan be available at higher levels. If you can figure out how to play...\n\nThe economy in Eador is extremely volatile. Nothing comfortable like other 4x where\nyou build your buildings and everybody is happy. Even Civ5 which is a great play\nexperience doesn't offer this sort of challenge. So in Eador it's like the house is\ncontinually burning down and you're always just one or 2 steps in front of the fire.\nThat's the feeling I get playing it.\n\nWhether a beginner should try Eador.... my advice -- don't take the campaign at\nall seriously because it uses randomly generated maps meaning you may get\nscrewed. Learn the basics and (what I should have done, but I doubt it would help\ntoo much) read whatever guides you can find, and watch the youtube videos.\n\nAlso, the tactical battles in Eador are very similar to the experience of playing chess.\nSome other 4x TRY to do that (hello Fallen Enchantress) but they don't have stamina\nor morale and simplistic in comparison.\n\nEador also stands out from all other 4x in that it has no tech tree. Instead, the tech\ntree is implicit in the buildings you build. I can't remember, maybe Heroes of Might\nand Magic does this too, but no where near the complexity of Eador.\n\nI think "should I buy this?" is really a question of do you want one of the most complex\n4x TBS available, with a brutal learning curve, or do you want something easier that\nyou might not play for as long? If you find it's too difficult and just give up - that's no\ngood. So if you do buy it, don't hesitate to ask in the forums for help and get the\nmost fun you can get out of it."","April 18, 2015","true","233.0"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","35","40","2","4"

As much as I loved this, there was more that I just didn't love.\n\nAfter spending so many hours on one shard, you start with nothing on the next shard. It feels like a slap in the face. It is supposed to feel like starting another scenario, but there is virtually nothing different from this shard than the last one. Why can't I keep some of my ♥♥♥♥!? What's the point?

Can't say that the campaign is getting to the end basicaly because there are several endings. Each shard is different, and it's not only lands, but the world itself is different too (world of fear, rust, magic and many more), and I unlocked only half of the buildings available, so probably that is why every new shard i start, brings new challenges and tactics to try out. There are 4 hero classes to choose from, that can be mixed together and yet, eventually, you will have to use all of them. There is also karma system in game, so sometimes you will have to be good and sometimes, evil is the way to win. You can amass an army or you can just go with a hero and a few units - it's all up to you. You will struggle to maintain economy but it's good that battles will be the main source of your income, so you will have to pick the right fights, because loosing is crippling, but not necessary deadly.\n\nI really don't understand the mixed score - the game is dynamic, interesting and there is "one more turn" feeling in it. Furthermore, the developer is still updating the game and replying on forums, bringing some new features and reacting to the probelms (can be faster though, but can't complain). There are minor bugs, but have encountered them two or three times and they are not gamebreaking (skip a turn or finish the fight and the bug is gone). Has crashed once after a big fight, but fighting it again wasn't a big problem and i believe my PC is the one to blame here.\n\nIf you're into a classic turn-based strategy - it's definitely worth a shot.","June 21, 2015","true","239.5"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Let's give it a thumb up!". After years the devs still take care of Eador, and this a great thing.\n\nThe game concept is quite original: long ago, after a great cataclysm, the world literally broke into pieces... but life did not encounter its extinction and now each shard of Eador is floating on the Astral Plane as a little world on its own. In the farthest dephts of the Astral Plane boils the burning chaos (a sort of hell), populated by demons whose only purpose is to swallow every single shard until nothing will be left on the Material Plane. This reminded me so much "the nothing" of the movie "The Neverending Story", and when someting brings me back to my early youth it's always a good thing.\nSome elder entities or some fortunate, cunning or sinister mortals have found the way to "ascend" to become a Master: a demigod with peculiar powers able to reunite the shards and to shape them into their ideal world. Every Master wants to get all the shards for him in order to restore Eador (the official rightful goal), and because if he loses all his shards, often due to the attack of another Master, the chaos will swallow him (the unofficial but very compelling goal). You play the role of a Master (and a very powerful one, with the power of time travel... that is how the game justifies the "load game" button!).\nBut enough lore...\n\nThe artistic style of the game is quite unique and in my opinion it's just enough to recommend the game to those who like the genre. I find it very "dreamlike": the colors are vivid and the illumination reminds me of a late afternoon in an autumn day. Very oniric. The loading screens are the best I've seen: they're handpainted and show different kinds of shards. I always find myself staring at them, searching for a little particular in a distant town or thinking about the loneliness of the people who live in the only creepy village in the swamp shard...\nThe music is soft and it seems like you're listening to it from afar... like in a dream. Just one thing... why isn't there a combat music??? fighting with a lullaby (even if it's a very, very good one) as soundtrack does brake the atmosphere!\nThe sound effects are not as good as the music, but it's not an issue.\n\nThe gameplay is structured into turns, this game is not meant to be played in a hurry, yet the AI is very fast (maybe because, as other people has said, it does not shine for its "intelligence"). Every Master who struggles for the shard can count on mortal heroes born in the shard (or, as recently added in an update, transported from the previous conquered shard through the astral plane to the new shard) devoted to him.\nIn a given turn your "hero" can perform a single action picked from the common 4X choices:\n- eXpand your reign by conquering neaby regions;\n- eXplore your domains for places of interest (and give a boost to the economy with the treasures he finds);\n- eXterminate your rival Masters and kick them out of the contended shard (or into the Chaos if you're attacking their world);\n- eXploit the resources of your regions by building specific structures and by taking decisions and reacting to random events.\n\nThe "exploit" part of the game is nice (even though after lots of games it becomes a bit repetitive), because it is based on completely random events which can affect the morale of the commoners and/or the income of every single region under your control. For example plagues, fires, festivals, magic or scientific discoveries can happen and you have always to take a decision: you can be a tyrant that enslaves the workers in order to boost the production or a benevolent god loved by the people: there is a "karma" mechanic that sums all your decisions for the curent shard, and in the end the people will give you a title like "The Pure". The interesting thing about this is that the choices encourage you to think as a demigod, not as a human: your goal is the domain of the shard and mortals are just creatures (and if you try to please them always, you'll discover they are a quite expensive kind of creature) that you can cuddle or slaughter if needed. After all a game turn could last a day, a year or a generation... why should you concern about creatures whose whole life is a blink of an eye compared to the eternity of your being?\n\nCombat is challenging but I find that only the Archer hero is useful (at least according to my playstyle). Other hero types are way too weak IMHO (although I guess that a high level mage would be able to win every battle very easily, especially with high level summons).\nPlanning the logistics is very important as the main hero gets farther from your capital, because independent troops get stronger and heroes (apart from archers) can move only one/two regions per turn. So it's important to dedicate to production the regions which are near the capital and to build forts and marketplaces into the border regions. But these are general rules, since the absolute randomness of the shards (even the campaign ones) can really influence the outcome of the game, and this can be a pro or a con (you decide): the last shard I played, for example, a poor enemy Master started on a peninsula linked to the main land by a line of regions of deadland (which is not productive and it's difficult to conquer at the early stages of the game), so when I reached him at the end of the game he was blocked and weak... and I annichilated him. If that happened to me I probably wuold have reloaded the game... I am the timewalker Master after all ;)\n\nI could speak a lot more about the management (hiring defenders, maintenance costs, combat and people morale, quests, alliances with NPC races) but this is a review, not a guide!\nI just want to spend a few words about the tech-tree because... there's no tech-tree! Your "technology" for the shard is decided by the buildings you build. In the campaign every shard you conquer adds some new building for your capital city to your building list (you start with an "empty" city in every new shard). Every building allows you to do something: recruit a new type of troop, give a bonus to morale, learn new spells, build special buildings in other regions ecc... In addition, like in a tech-tree, some buildings block others, so you have to plan which ones will you construct according to your desired gameplay style for the shard.\n\nSo let's talk about the bugs now. The game crashes once every few hours, so I sugest to enable autosave, which can overcome almost completely the bug allowing you to load the last turn.\n\nWhat else to say?\nI recommend this game! It has the "just one more turn" effect on me...","August 31, 2015","true","133.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

One downside is that with each new shard/map you start over somewhat, but things still manage to stay interesting through new units and buildings, new opponents, and randomized events.","November 20, 2014","true","81.1"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","0"

On my normal computer, this game does not work it crashes all the time, I recentlly built a very nice computer and it runs as smooth as a lampshade made of fresh baby skin. Also the issue with the crashes and errors I got on my other two computers (ones a laptop) will not be adressed as none of my emails or error reports ever got a reply. Maybe the company is not the best at pr. This game is amazing nonetheless, I enjoy the strategy and it is not insanely easy as some others, so long as you dont select skilled or anything below you will have very nice combat that requires actuall planning and thinking, story line was pretty awesome too. Only issue I have had is that you need a strong computer to play it, and the lack of help or support from the creators, but I get that from ea and almost every company too. Another cool thing so far as gameplay goes is that you can use one method to win most battles, for example necromancy, however these battles can be slugfests, and you may end up losing, where you essentially trade blows until one of you manages to get the upperhand and you will end up taking days of back and forth battling to take or lose the shard, when if you just adapt you strategy and maybe add a commander with long range  units in the back and strong defense with low attack to shield the path of incoming land units you could maybe have won the shard or faster if you win anyways. There are flying units too, the strategy is quite varied, really an awesome game.","November 3, 2014","true","226.2"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","31","45","3","1"

The best way to describe this game would be that it is heavily influenced/steals from (well, the older version but okay) Heroes of Might and Magic 3. You upgrade cities by making new buildings allowing for magic, income, creatures, experience for your creatures, or special effects. Battle is done on a grid system in a turn based combat manner and as your heroes level they gain new abilites and skills.\n\nHowever, there is were similarities end. For instance, unlike HoMM3 all cities are equal, which the same creatures being able to be recruited. You explore the map by conquering surrounding provinces - which can be upgraded with buildings but with a much smaller variety than the cities. Thus no free roaming on the map and individual armies of provinces can be daunting to defeat. Furthermore, magic does have some impact, but I would say less in the battlefield that HoMM3, but can be more impacting on a global scale than HoMM3, due to the so called rituals. Another important difference is the 'happiness' factor. If a province gets unhappy it might revolt, that is something you do not see in HoMM making Eador more of a grand strategy game in that sense. It also has more RPG elements than HoMM3 as quests can be given through the conquering of a shard (= one map) and acting differently can have very different consequences. Even more so, if you are friendly some troops will like that and get better morale, where others will think you weak. Likewise, you can not ally e.g. the Elves (some rare neutral provinces on the map) if you play like an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nPersonally I miss a bit the variety in units from time to time, but that has been partially lifted by the small DLC (allied forces) of 4 euro. Although that states only 2 new units per individual faction, it actually creatures more new units and with a new special building that can be found in a province (the mercenary guild) you can actually hire these troops. This is great because it sometimes tediously long to get e.g. to level 2 unit buildings and this gives your army the edge you need for higher difficulties in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, Eador is a good addition for anyone that enjoyed the old HoMM series (not V as it does not have those graphics implemented) and is looking for a different game with a slight twist.","January 27, 2015","true","433.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Expect a harmless crash every 24 hours or so. There's one bug that can hit fairly often and prevents kills from registering, especially on retaliatory hits and especially on slower combat speeds. It can be resolved without incident by autoresolving at the end of combat and almost always works in the player's favour, blocking its AI reenforcements and almost never occurs on the highest combat speed, which I would recommend using either way, because the second slowest is much too slow. There are other cases in the game where the settings are not as delicate as they perhaps aught to be.\n\nThe game seems to be a direct remake of Eador: Genesis.

There are towns, equipable items, all that good stuff. However, where HoMM  tends to be fairly simple, Eador has enough depth to drown a whale. What you build, where you build it, and what you stock your army with can have huge consequences, and every turn has dozens of choices about how best to improve your situation. Add in random events, potentially dozens of battles per province, and a solid enemy AI and you've got a recipe for a huge time-sink.\n\nMost 4x games become bogged down in the late game: Your strategy is set, you've built everything you need to, and now it's simply a matter of hitting "next turn" until you win. Eador's campaign averts this in a wonderful way: The maps are fairly small by 4x standards, but you have to complete dozens of them. The world has been split into shards, and your goal is to control as many of them as you can. That means that by the time you've reached the "just hit next" stage you'll have completed one shard and it'll be time to move on to the next, where you have to build up your forces all over again. That's not to say that beating a shard has no benefits: Each one you control grants you boosts to your income, troops, or abilities, so planning which ones to conquer in what order actually matters to an extent.\n\nAll-in-all an excellent strategy game that I'd highly recommend to HoMM or Disciples fans.","February 15, 2014","true","20.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Clawdius/recommended/232050/","Clawdius","Clawdius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Clawdius/","311 products in account","TL;DR: Only buy this game if it is on sale and you absolutely love 4X games. If you want to spend a few dozen or hundred hours testing your patience, then this may be the game for you. Otherwise, perhaps gift it to someone you want to see spend hours on end beating their head against the wall.\n\nThis game is a great time sink, but there are lots of poorly executed concepts. Item durability, especially on arrows, is a joke. Your arrows can (and sometimes will) break before you run out of arrows in a single fight. The best magically enhanced arrows have less durability than the "heavy arrows" which themselves have to be repaired literally after every single serious fight or they will break during your next battle.\n\nIf item durability was the only flaw this game might still be a gem, but even concepts that are well thought out are not well developed. Exploration of owned territory is an interesting idea, but there is often no real reason to bother completely exploring areas. Your rewards for doing so are threefold. You receive a tiny immediate 2 gold increase in total income, you discover a large variety of new enemies to battle, and the settlements in that area can expand into the newly explored areas, eventually generating significantly increased income. This mechanic would function a lot better if there was a small amount of exploration that took place automatically in provinces with guards. The AI doesn't explore much manually, but it does have guards in every province so at the very least the AI would have some small amount of exploration done in their own territories. Instead when you take territory from an AI opponent every single province will be gripped under the stranglehold of "overpopulation". And that brings me to my second major frustration with the game.\n\nThe AI doesn't understand the mechanics, either in battle or on the world map. As an example of the flawed combat AI, ghosts can only be damaged by magic damage. However, if you try to autoresolve a battle with a ghost in it you will almost certainly be completely annihilated by the ghost because the AI will use all the physical damage it can against the ghost, while units capable of magic damage busy themselves with other tasks until your entire army is dead. This means that armies that are labelled as something you can fight without taking casualties are often impossible to defeat, where enemies that are labelled as "I will be trampled" can often be manually defeated without taking a single point of damage.\n\nOn the overland map the AI spams a granary in effectively every province. The granary itself generates no income, and takes up one of the limited building slots. The granary can be explanded to a stable which would give the AI some tiny additional income as well as allow it to move more quickly through its territory, but I have yet to see a province in which the AI had actually upgraded one. A storehouse on the other hand can add 10 gold per turn income to a province when it is fully upgraded, otherwise it will offer 5 at tier 2 or just a single gold per turn at tier one. Still, these are the most readily constructed source of income, while it takes awhile to be able to upgrade them to tier 2 you can quite readily increase your total income by a third or more by having one in every province. It's a crying shame the AI doesn't understand how to build a thriving economy, if it did perhaps there could be a provincial governer (or some such) that would automatically build the upgrades you wanted akin to automating workers in Civilization. Building a mall in every province you have is a chore when you have twenty provinces, but it's ludicrous to even consider bothering once you've gotten to the point where you have 100 or so provinces. If the AI could build wealth it might be able to field larger armies more often. I have thus far only rarely seen the AI taking advantage of units higher than tier 2, and there are 5 tiers of units that can be recruited.\n\nAs an example of something that is ridiculously easily fixed, and yet remains flawed for no good reason, just look to the autosave system. The autosave system autosaves at the end of every several turns, rather than the begining of every several turns. If they had taken the approach of labelling these saves Turn ___ or something along these lines this wouldn't really be an issue. However, they've gone the route of having 5 autosaves that roll over each other. Not necessarily a problem, but there isn't anything behind the scenes that tells the game that it has autosaved this turn in say the slot Autosave 4. So when you load Autosave 4, and end the turn, you will create Autosave 5. Does the war seem inevitable at that point? Load Autosave 3, but when you end your turn you will create Autosave 1. Get to the turn that originally was Autosave 5? Now it's created Autosave 2, and if Autosave 3 isn't early enough to head off your issue your older autosaves are gone. This is easily avoided using a rotation of manual save games, but it's just one tiny example of a problem that could likely be fixed by changing a few lines of code and remains in the game just to annoy players.\n\nI wish I could introduce Snowbird to the concept of numbers that end in 0, it would be a lot less frustrating to see that I've done 2 damage or 5 damage to something with 50 health than that I did 0 damage four times in a row firing Ballistae at one skeleton (each with damage potential labelled as 0-5 on a 5 health skeleton). And that's just another in a litany of odd design decisions. If a flying creature flies onto a hill, it gains +1 range for its attacks. But it already flies, it's flitting about in the air, why on earth should the topography below it matter? If anything flying units should constantly receive a +1 range buff, perhaps losing it when they run out of stamina. There's a reason why it's a fairly common practice that ground based effects, positive and negative alike, are typically ignored by flying units in games. Siege engines are considered mechanical units for the purposes of healing spells, but they're not immune to being petrified by a medusa. There is literally only one unit, at least according to the wiki, who can gain the Repair ability so that they can repair siege engines, and it is the militiaman which is one of the weakest units in the game. Both the Ballista and (clearly described as self propelled, yet also capable of being petrified) Catapult are described as having been created initially by the Dwarves, but the Dwarf cannot gain repair. Interestingly the Dwarf can gain petrification immunity, and now I have nearly come to the end of this tirade. I am baffled anew by this game every time I play it, I understand many of its quirks, and yet I am consistantly scratching my head and asking "Why?". Why did they make every quiver of arrows in the game have the potential to break if you fight two back to back battles when you can very easily be required to fight at least three armies during a fortress siege (the guards, a defending hero, and the garrison. You will honestly likely fight five as two more armies rush home to commit suicide as an act of solidarity with their comrades). Early game a quiver of 10 arrows will break before you've even run out of arrows, apparently you break arrows like a drunk having a nicotine fit might break cigarettes.\n\nThis game has had a lot of thought put into it, but it seems to me that very little logic has gone into the development. I almost wish it had come out alongside Master of Magic and the first Civilization. At least then I could have more readily forgiven its faults and the games it inspired would be able to refine the good ideas and burn away the dross. As it stands at the end of the day there are better 4X games out there for your purchasing dollar.","January 10, 2015","false","159.8"," 37 of 60 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","37","60","8","0"

Fairly sure you've already recommended it, pal.\n\nAnyway, I have no idea why this game is still being updated, it was released 2 years ago, but it's rather nice for them to STILL be releasing updates for it.\n\nBeen playing the game for a while and it seems fine to me, few glitches here and there that I recall but given the state of development of even AAA games these days, the glitches were no more pronounced than "usual" so seemed balanced. I had no game breaking glitches, anyway.  Game is pretty, combat is fun, levelling heros feels rewarding, taking over shards is the way to make the game "progress" and world feel persistent without forcing a heavy handed corny storyline onto you that limits player options per scenario.  Delivering an interesting turn based strategy game that works within a non intrusive narrative is no easy task, but I think handled quite well in this case.\n\nOh, love the dialogue too. Nicely written, surprisingly so, actually. The majority of game dialogue is trash, and that's fine, most don't read game dialogue for the dazzling display of talent - but in this case I thought it was pretty decent.","June 11, 2015","true","273.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

This game could be wonderful.  It is the best Turn-Based Strategy I've ever played, and it is broken beyond belief.  I'm currently nearing 70 hours into the campaign, and I've had to relaunch the game from crash over 150 times.\n\nThat in mind, the game is surprising in its depth of world, story, and dialogue.  It incorporates the karma alignment options of games like Fable and Mass Effect, with actions made affecting the general disposition of everyone when they talk to you.  Based on their appraisal of you, the dialogue changes entirely.  If they like you, they may be willing to divulge information, or even give you a boost forward in the campaign.  If they dislike you, they'll be curt, aggressive, and might in fact attack your home world.  The karma system is much deeper and more involved than this, and is one of the flavors swirling in the mix that made me fight through the headaches of constant bugs.\n\nFighting is tough.  The entire game is incredibly difficult.  There are a large number of ways to beat the game (ten?), and each feels different than the others.  Each ending makes you fight for it, and while fighting for it, the possibility for another way out crops up.\n\nManaging the empire on each shard of the broken world is tough, and requires capitalization of what you have available.  Once I felt comfortable and confident in my skills, I raised the difficulty to the maximum, which was a nice ego check: while I did still finish the shard, it was tooth and nail.\n\nBottom line for this game: if you're a fan of TBS, get this game.  The developers have stayed on it consistently, improving the game since its ill-advised release.  Even given how long it has been since the game was released, it feels like it's still in Beta release.  It's a fantastic game that absorbed a large amount of time, and likely will continue to do so, but I doubt most people would be willing to fight through all the effort it has taken to get to this point in the story.","July 7, 2014","true","84.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The battle prediction is broken, dont trust it ... there are some predicted "very easy" encounters which in my oppinion cant be won. A battle against 4 medusas without a ranged hero is a loss regardless of predictions.\n\nThe above brings me to the next obvious point; inbalance. The devs simply did not take their time to implement this propperly, some creatures are simply too powerfull for early game and you have to know this prior to engaging ... unless you dont mind reloading a lot.\n\nEarly positioning and ressources can also be an issue, but in my oppinion not as vital as the two flaws mentioned above.\n\nWhen all is said and done its not a bad game, the devs should just give it it a final look to balance things out and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.","January 22, 2015","true","5.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

But I find myself replaying Eador more than just about any other game I played. Finishing the campaign takes really a huge effort (estimate 600 hours). And after, I immediately started playing a new one.\nWhen making comparisons, Heroes of might & magic comes to mind. But me, I like this game better.\n\n+ The game has personality: a lot of random events - tied to the personality (karma) of the master you play - and really adding flavour and also the opportunity to develop that personality further. Also pretty funny.\n+ Challenging: rather difficult. Different scenario's take a different approach. Also, the technologies you develop add to that. On normal difficulty an experienced player might need several tries to conquer a world.\n+ Strategic: resources are scarce. Investments in your lands take a long time to pay off (10-30 turns) and are nicely balanced to investing in units.\n+ When comparing to Heroes of M&M: the units, spells and choices to make are just more interesting.\n+ Lots of replay value: because of the above.\n\n- Mixed feelings about the Allied forces DLC. I think it distorts the balance in the game. Because of that it is even more difficult.\n\n+- The game did have a lot of bugs. But most are fixed and it is stable now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/232050/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","Strategy game that uses the Heroes of Might & Magic battle system and a tile-based overworld. You only have one city (your base/capital) as your major base of operations but you can upgrade captured tiles with minor improvements/defenses. There are four tiers of buildings/units (and buildings in higher tiers require you to construct buildings of lower tiers). In the campaign you unlock buildings slowly so it's nice for learning the system: you start with limited options, figure out what's necessary to build, then add in more options and change your build as necessary.\n\nI've been playing in the easiest modes and it feels like playing Civ V on easier modes. I can be pretty flexible in my build order (since it takes a while for enemies to attack and upgrade tiers) and just safely build up my hero and steamroll into their capital. As a warning, games can take a long time (like in civ) so when I build up enough of an advantage, I quick-resolve battles (after taking out any key units from range) and head straight to the enemies' capitals (without capturing every single enemy tile).\n\nOn harder difficulties, I think it'd be more like immortal/deity civ where you need a victory plan: you should know build order (what buildings you need and can skip), what tiles you take (not every tile is worth wasting time on), and trying to balance upgrading unit tiers and spending money on economy-boosting buildings.\n\nThere are some changes I would've liked:\n* Before battle, I would have liked to be able to click on the name of the enemy unit to bring up a civilopedia-style entry about the unit (Sometimes I forget what units are in each tier and the strength gap between tiers is pretty high).\n* When you're offered item rewards, I would've liked to be able to check hero inventory (to see if I already have that item).\n* In battle, you can use the hotkey 1 to use a selected unit's ability. However, that pretty much only works if your mouse is hovered over it (so it doesn't work if you had selected it previously and moved your mouse away over another unit).\n* In battle, sometimes units that are brought to 0 hp don't die and are untargettable. If this happens to your own units, you can heal them up to 'revive' them so they aren't lost at the end of the battle. If it happens to an enemy unit, when you're ready you'll have to use 'quick combat' to end the battle (it'll count it as dead).\n* I play on windowed borderless and sometimes there are game crashes (access exceptions, pointer errors) and the game doesn't really like alt-tabbing.\n\nIf you liked the HoMM series and turn-based strategy games, you should try your hand at Eador. If you're a fan of strategy games, you should take a look.","May 25, 2015","true","16.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's a brilliant turn-based strategy with classical "heroesque" tactical battles, solid stronghold and province management component and profound RPG systems on top of that all. Add to that a uniquely structured campaign (albeit a one that's a bit too long to my liking) in an interesting charming setting with a good deal of both humour and seriousness. Imagine if Heroes of Might and Magic and Master of Magic had an illegitimate child. That's pretty much what Eador is. Sounds utterly fantastic, right? If only that was the whole deal.\n\nUnfortunately not everything is sunshine and roses. Masters of the Broken World is actually a sort of a remake and a sequel, all-in-one. It took the great gameplay mix described above straight from its predecessor - Eador: Genesis. The idea was to greatly enhance the graphical appearance of the game with tons of *shinies* and stuff. Too bad it didn't really work out as planned. The new graphics aren't ugly, even somewhat nice but mostly awkwardish. The interface was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess at launch and although it got better with patches, it's still pretty clunky. Add to that the fact that despite all the updates the army of bugs is still undefeated to this day.\n\nTo summarize: the game is fantastic at its core, it has one of the best gameplay in the genre, but the technical side of things leaves much to be desired. Be prepared to battle the interface and fend off nasty glitches and bugs. Having said that, I must stress once more that despite the shortcomings, the game itself is brilliant.

HOMM is pretty much dead to me these days and I have no interest in the new version where you stack troops and faceroll boring maps for more story bits. I'm a bigger fan of the King's Bounty series but those are still largely about progression through troop stacks and a bit lacking in the grand scheme development. Eador however, is ALL about the development of your capital and all of the land around it. I was initially put off by the more story/objective driven campaign and didn't fully realize that this game did in fact have a sandbox mode, so I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n\nThe thing that really sets it off is that you'll take over bigger plots of land, but will have to fully explore it, clear all of the dungeons within it and completely run the enemy forces out of it before you actually gain the land making fights a lot more thoughtful than just single tile-grabbing. This process may not even be possible until you level up a bit higher and come back As in just because you walked on a tile doesn't mean you fully own and control it.  You are also fighting not only all of the monsters around the map, but also the AI building their capitals as well. Not to mention there's actually things on the maps like rocks and hills that you can USE. I took out a bigger army due to great placement with ranged units and chokepoints. That would NEVER happen in HOMM.\n\nOf course there's tons of tech tree type buildings and troops with upgrades and multiple classes of heros. It's your typical foray across a map, and the game itself does nothing brand new. It's just how it's glued together and operates that sets it apart. I picked this up for a fiver in a bundle at one point and I've seen it that low on a sale. If you like turn based strategy games you could do so much worse here for that price. It's another game that has 100's of hours potential going for it.","March 15, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Each conquered shard offers bonuses to you in your quest to take over the broken world. During unit battles, however, you will move to an actual level where your armies must fight - slightly similar to games like the Disciples series and Age of Wonders. The battles, however, are a bit more basic compared to those games (you are put into a top-down style map grid and can place your units prior to the start of battle).\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are nice, there is good detail in the area tiles and the unit models are decent considering the large availability of characters to recruit. The sound, music, and effects of things like activated skills and magic spells are also decent.\n\nThere is a lot to do in Eador, and the learning curve is pretty high if you are not familiar with strategy games. During your turn, you can hire "heroes" who act as your generals for your armies. The game incorporates a karma system where "evil" units like skeletons and "good" units like dwarves will stack and provide bonuses if your army has only one type of karma (so mixing the two will result in negative attributes).\n\nYou can "explore" each tile if you own it (up to 100%) and doing so may yield things like an adventurers guild that provides higher-tier characters for recruitment, various ruins or areas for you to fight monsters and receive treasure (there are A LOT of these), etc. Be warned, however, that is is not always advisable to explore your tiles to 100%, especially if you only have one hero because your enemy will surpass you in both troops and tile ownership very quickly. I think this contributes the most to the difficulty - when I play strategy games I am usually very good because I have a good balance of turtling while harassing, howver, in Eador the cost for subsequent hero recruitment increases substantially, and you can only move an army if a hero is leading it.\n\nThere are a lot of different buildings available to be built, however, there is a limit to how many of each kind/tier can be built. For example, the "military" buildings each provide a single unit (archers, spearmen, etc) and will also provide either "good" or "evil" units, , but you may only build 4 out of 9 buildings (if I recall correctly). At the next tier, you can only build according to what you have previously built (and this leaks over to other "types," like market/armory buildings). You may only build one building on a tile per turn.\n\nAt the initial stages/shards, the AI is not too difficult, however, quite early on you will quickly find your enemy to be very unforgiven. If you slack in your expansion and troop building, you will soon find the AI's troops right outside your borders. Once you take over a tile, you can build a fort in order to garrison troops - if you don't you can hire a single "guard" unit to patrol around the tile and defend it from invaders. This makes it a bit easier to reclaim (or lose) tiles.\n\nThere is variety in how to take over tiles as well, depending on what kind it is. For example, some village tiles will join you peacefully if you pay enough gold, and they will provide a free "guard" unit as a result. Others may offer missions and join you upon completion.\n\nThe battling system is decent, but if you are used to the more complex battle system in Age of Wonders or the Disciples series, you might not like this as much. You get flanking bonuses against your opponent if you can maneuver behind or to the side of them. Your hero is critical to victory here, as each type (ranger/scout, mage, general, warrior) will affect your party in different ways. The wizard, for example, is very versatile (depending on what magic buildings you invest in) because he can heal, buff, debuff, and use offensive spells. He can also summon units, and investing in specific skills can allow you to keep those units after battle (if they survive and you have space in your party). You unlock more party slots as your hero levels up.\n\nThe leveling system is pretty interesting, you get 2 options for your units (for example: +health or +morale), and sometimes your units will also be considered for awards/medals. These will provide extra bonuses (like extra damage), however, they will also increase the upkeep (and this can be significant in the beginning when you do not have much income).\n\nOverall, the game is very fun once you know what you are doing, and persisting over the learning curve will allow you to enjoy the unique challenges Eador offers.\n\nHighly recommend.","July 9, 2014","true","20.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you like HOMM/AoW style combat and empire development, this will be right up your alley. It's a bit simpler (units don't have many spells/skills and mainly boil down to melee/archer/mage/healer), but not simple. As is typical for these types of games, the combat gets repetitive.\n\nNow, there's another Eador game, named Eador: Genesis. It's 99% the same game, but this one has (much) better graphics and some minor tweaks. However, MotBW also introduced some serious bugs, one of which is pretty game breaking. It's also a bit slower than ideal, especially on older systems. A lot of the gameplay revolves around reloading the game as a "go back in time" mechanic, mainly because of the inability to properly scout enemies and the impossibility to predict the actual strength of an army [unless you play the first or second difficulty, out of 7 or so].\n\nEador: Genesis is bug free and due to its age suffers no lag or delays. The "reload last turn" mechanic makes more sense there, but is also less forgiving than the full save/load in MotBW; to be hones it's much more interesting that way.\n\nSo my advice would be to pick up Eador: Genesis ($6 on GOG.com I believe) unless you REALLY like flashy graphics in a tactics game.","May 4, 2014","false","32.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

But it's completely unbalanced and as such it makes no sense.","November 23, 2015","false","7.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

I do like it a lot, so I feel like I owe the game and the developers my feedback, which might help some people decide that they should get this! (or not, I suppose).\n\nFirstly, it's a turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting. Anyone who's a fan of that genre knows that it can be really difficult to tell a good one from a bad one by looking at screenshots on Steam. As a result, I own the complete collection of bad ones.\n\nI classify this game as good. For me personally, it's probably one of my favorite games, and would be in the shortlist of titles that I might choose from if I were forced to play only one game forever. Other titles in this "shortlist" might be Dominions 3, and Heroes of Might and Magic III. Now that 75% of you have stopped reading this, I can speak specifically to the people who should be reading this.\n\nEador has a lot in common with those other two games I mentioned. Hiring heroes, outfitting them with gear and troops to roam the map conquering territory, building improvements in your castle, casting "adventure spells" and "combat spells" that you obtained from your buildings or looted scrolls. So many similarities, it captures all of the great things from the other games of this genre, so the decision whether to get this game hinges on what it does differently.\n\nFirst of all, the scale of the game is enormous. The campaign is the primary game mode. You choose a "shard", which is a piece of a broken world, they are all just floating around in space, and each one has a unique set of properties that will alter the rules of the game on that shard. One shard might have magically infused crystals, making wizardry especially effective, or a desert shard makes it difficult for troops to move across a battlefield, etc. The shards also have a "size" (map size), and a reward for conquering the shard. The rewards are mostly centered around unlocking castle improvements, which will then be available to you in subsequent shards. With the exception of previous shard rewards, nothing carries over between shards, as your "character" is just the immortal calling the shots from above, and he can only pass on what he has learned. The shards all have their own inhabitants and a unique ecosystem. In addition, there will be other immortals, like yourself, on the shard trying to capture it. You capture the shard by conquering the castles of these other immortals. The winning immortal has the shard merge into his master shard, (a collection of all his previously captured shards). You can choose to attack these master shards, where it will be a 1v1 battle between you and the immortal who owns it. If an immortal loses a game on his master shard, he is eliminated from the campaign altogether, and all of his rewards go to the person who defeated him. This is true for you as well, some immortals will attack your master shard, and losing means game over. Also keep in mind that while you are attacking shards, the other immortals are going after them as well. Some shards might get snapped up while you are battling on a different one, so prioritize them if they contain technology that is part of your fundamental strategy.\n\nAll the while this is going on, there will be plenty of bantering, wheeling and dealing, smack talking, and good old fashioned back stabbing happening between the immortals. All of them want something from you, want you to hate the people they hate, or try to convert you to whatever their psychopathic vision might be for how the universe should operate. You can take them up on these things, and it can have a dramatic effect on the "storyline" of the game. You can kill them off if you choose, and they will do it to each other from time to time when the universe gets crowded. There are many of them, and more of them will keep springing up along the way, each with their own personality, back story, misguided morals, and gameplay strategies. The choices you make in game will affect their attitude toward you.\n\nIt's important to understand the whole shard and immortal concept of the game because this is a big turn off for some people. Conquering a single shard is like playing an entire game from start to finish in any other strategy title, something that can take 1 to 12 hours, depending on the map size. Then you move on to the next shard where all your heroes are level 1 again, and all your phat loot is gone, and your castle has no upgrades again. While 95% of your time will be spent battling on shards, the overall story arc and meaningful strategic decisions will happen outside of them. This is what makes the game feel like it has nearly infinite possibilities and replay value for me, but I've heard others comment that moving from shard to shard feels punishing as you have to keep "starting over". You definitely need to decide which camp you fall in.\n\nThe pace of the game is much slower and more nuanced than similar titles. You will be faced with MANY decisions in the game, and their impact is rarely immediate. These will come in the form of random events and encounters, where you will be making moral or monetary choices, which buildings you build will open other building possibilities while closing a bunch of others, and the troops you hire will have their own alignments and synergies. In a game like Heroes of Might and Magic, the outcome of the game might be decided on turn 9, by the guy who built his capital first, or captured the ultimate artifact, and the rest is just cleanup. In Eador, you build momentum. You pay 50 gold for +2 gold a turn, because in 30 turns, you're going to be glad you did. Your strategy is the culmination of all your decisions and how effectively you can align them with a particular end goal. Not to say that nothing significant happens, because it does, but for the most part you're playing from a macroeconomic perspective. This also frustrates some players because it can be hard to tell whether you are doing well, and there are so many choices to make without any clear indicator of what your priorities should be. It also doesn't help that the AI can be pretty brutal at times, so right when you are feeling way out of your element, someone is going to come along and crush you very unceremoniously, leaving you feeling pretty sour. I assure you that after a few shards, you will know what you are doing, and why you got crushed, and all that confusion and frustration will turn into excitement and possibilities.\n\nHeroes and troops are the core of shard conquering, and the best ones require a robust economy to support. Heroes engage in combat just like troops. They also can become very formidable relatively quickly, making lower level troops more like obstacles in a battle between heroes. There are 5 ranks of troops, and it takes a lot of time and resources to obtain higher ranks. Consequently, the combat effectiveness between the ranks is very significant. A dragon, hydra, or phoenix would be a rank 5 unit. These are very powerful, and could easily clean up an entire army low rank troops like swordsmen or clerics. This huge disparity of power is another frequent complaint. Just know that while each troop will have his moment of glory, and play a pivotal role in your advancement, most of them are unlikely to be useful beyond that point in the shard.\n\nThe game has a ton of content. After 300 hours, I don't even have half of the achievements, and I'm constantly finding things I've never seen before. In combination with the stunning amount of replay value, this makes for a game that manages to stay fresh.\n\nMy only complaints are AI turn times in large maps with many opponents during the late game can be long. Patches have made it better, but it's still irritating sometimes.\n\nIt's had a history of bugs. The last patch introduced a pointer error that made it unplayable for me, but a reinstall seems to have alleviated it completely.","April 29, 2013","true","401.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game gives you so many ways to play it, and every way you can play it feels satisfying as hell.\n\nIt's one of those games you literally have to pick up to experience it, as it can't truly be full explained. One of those mixxed bags of  a psuedo 4x strategy, but not quite that deep, with elements of other games like Heroes of Might and Magic, among older games from the early PC floppy days and Amiga era.\n\nIf you like a more straight forwards approach to a psuedo 4x strategy game this would be it. They line it up and simplify it nicely, but keep all the complicated bits in if you want to play around with them and dig deeper. It's a must have for anyone that likes hero style tactics roleplaying gameplay.","March 6, 2014","true","70.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is basically a remake with improved graphics. And with this I am perfectly okay because the graphics were the only thing that needed some correction - the rest is perfectly awesome as it is. An Age of Wonders / HoMM sort-of-clone, Eador uses the very cool concept of you being a God conquering the 'shards' that make up the world to send you in multiple mission on relatively small maps as you try to make your way towards total domination. The game is a mix of strategy with some resource management (very basic stuff, really), RPG with growing heroes, items, and spells, and tactical turn-based battles on hexagonal grids, in the best Warhammer tradition. If you like this genre, it's good fun - and in this version, it now is good fun with very awesome looks.","September 1, 2014","true","24.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love Strategy games, I love the strategy, I love that you need to care and protect your army in som RTS's or Hex-Based Strategy games. But this one falls a bit short of both of those. I love this game, do not get me wrong. I only have three hours in this game but it is still a fantastic Hex-Based for what it is. After you get your armor and weapon set down, you need no strategy to win battles. When your troops die, you don't need to worry since you can get 6,000 gold in the first hour and a half so you can constantly buy more and more troops, and you constantly get Gems which is currency for mage troops or buildings. You can have buildings in your kingdom to hire new troops or entertain your city population, etc. This is fun nonetheless, but one major bug (which is common, but not at all an annoyance) is the zero HP bug. Sometimes when an enemy reaches zero HP, they are still alive and you need to auto-attack in order to complete the battle. Other than that bug and the simplicity then comes into play with no strategy, if I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 7.5/10.

And that's saying something, because I seem like the kind of person to enjoy strategy games...\n\nThe reason for this is because the game remains paletable throughout. I think the thing that typically drives me away from strategy games a few hours in is that, once you start to amass resources and turn those resources into troops, etc., there's so much to take care of at any one time that it's too easy to lose track of anything or everything.\n\nEador isn't like that. While you can eventually get a gigantic army, colossal empire, and a mountain of resources, the buildup to that is very slow and easy to take in. Your armies are led by heroes, which cost exponentially more for each successive one, and each hero only starts with the capacity to have three units in its army (except for one, which starts with four slots). Over time, they'll level up and be able to lead more troops.\n\nEssentially, this leads to a strategy game where the most important resource is time. Hard limits are set on just how much you can do in a single turn, so, rather than a game where the first guy to get a billion troops wins, you get a game where the guy to best optimize his time wins.","June 8, 2014","true","205.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Eador is a game with a very interesting playstyle, that has some serious problems preventing it from being great. I decided to recommend it because, despite its flaws, I am pushing a three digit playtime and still enjoying it.\n\nEador looks like a 4X game, but I would argue that it is not. Your real focus here is on advancing your heroes. EVERYTHING COMES DOWN TO YOUR HEROES. You advance your heroes by clearing dungeons located in your provinces, which you locate with a "province exploration" mechanic, that is essential to advancing your economy. You will make far more money clearing these dungeons than you will with your economy, and the latter is really only there to support a few garrisons and pay for your leaders upkeep, which rises steadily.\n\nYou explore your provinces to find dungeons for your heroes. You expand your empire to get more provinces, so that you can find more dungeons for your heroes. You expand your economy to support bigger armies for your heroes. You upgrade your castle so that you can get bigger bonuses for your heroes. All of your tech advances are aimed at getting better spells, and better units, and better equipment... for your heroes. The goal of this game is to be the first the get a hero to level 30 and max out its arsenal, at which point it becomes more powerful than everything else in the game except for another maxed out hero. Once you do this, you march to the enemies castles, and start taking them out.\n\nI have enjoyed this game a lot, because there are very few others quite like it, and the constant leveling is emotionally satisfying in an odd way. But, there are some real flaws. You cannot see far outside of your borders, and you cannot explore any areas you do not own, so the world feels vey small and lonely. You only ever meet your rivals when your borders physically touch, and even then you have no clear way to guage their strength. The world map will remain mostly hidden by the fog of war until you have conquered it, and even then there is no point in seeing everything. Just get to 30, find the keeps, and take them down.\n\nThe first few turns are nearly impossible to get right until you have really gotten the hang of things. This game snowballs INTENSLY... messing up on turn 5 basically means that you have lost the game, but it will take you 300 turns to find that out. Eador forces you to save scum. There is no scaling of starting zones to lvl 1 armies, and the RMG can place you in a beginning position where none of your surrounding zones are capturable. Depending on your difficulty settings, the first 40 turns or so could be the hardest of the entire game, as you struggle for even the least of progress.\n\nMatches take so long (even the smallest of maps take 15 hours sometimes), that you cannot afford to simply play it by ear, you have to commit to a match for awhile. The largest sized maps can take a week to complete, if you really want to clear everything. The campaign is a joke. I spent the first 80 hours of my playtime on it, and I only barely got to the point where I could start to unlock t2 buildings. Basically, each campaign match unlocks (or permanantly locks) a single building and maybe a unit too, and gives you some small boost to your starting set-up. Given how long matches take, I could only assume an estimated 500 hour playtime for the whole thing, as there are hundreds of buildings in total. Either that or it ends way before you get everything.\n\nPick it up if you like heavy RPG elements, that seems like what this game is focused on. But, dont expect a true 4X experience.","May 10, 2015","true","130.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While you spread your influence for gathering resources you shouldn't think you're the only one doing the same.\n\nAs it is quite typical 4X game, there are few things that makes it work quite well - if you are about to invest some time to learn the game mechanics. That's the only drawback: construction (i.e. building up land) is more complicated, because you have capital region and "provinces" - and they don't develop the same way. Once you have built up buildings in your capital region you unlock more buildings for regions. And you can have only 3 buildings up on any given province, which doesn't make sense, but it forces you to prioritise. Luckily, you can tear buildings down on provinces. I wish there was a way to do the same on capital region, because you can have only 4 types of unit recruitment buildings.\n\nThat restriction is horrible. At the beginning you need some first tier "barracks" in order to muster up your initial army to get you going anywhere. The beginning is quite rough even on lower difficulties. However, on later stages you wish you could have more variety of higher-end troops, but the cap limit won't allow you to do just that. What's even more painful, some "garrison" troops, which are different from standard troops, require also certain "barracks"-types, so you need to do some research. Later on, you get hold on that, though.\n\nTactical battles are like from Fallen Enchantress. They can be very hard at first, but when taking full advantage of the terrain and vegetation it is possible. I am finding the very beginning quite hard on 2nd lowest difficulty level, though I haven't played but a couple of campaign maps. Like in Fallen Enchantress, you equip your hero, while troops get automatically geared up. Both heroes and troops gain levels and when they do, you can choose an upgrade for the victorious one. And when the leader gets level-ups, you can occasionally have more unlocked slots for more troops.\n\nBalance on economics work quite well. Gold is scarce, but if you do spare provinces' guards you are asking for trouble. On frontiers they won't save you much against enemy troops, but fortification gives you more time to get in aid with your armies. But these fortresses cost dearly. But you still need guards and pay for their upkeep, because there are plenty of events you get randomly attacked on one of your provinces. These events vary though, and some are helpful. However, the events can occur a lot. It isn't unprecendented to have got four events on your regions at the beginning of your turn.\n\nGraphics and sounds are okayish - nothing too brilliant, but they do their job.\n\nDefinitely worth picking-up on your game library if you're into Master of Magic and/or Fallen Enchantress - especially on this summer sale. 75 per cent off is not too shabby.","June 25, 2014","true","59.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's on the deeper end of the complexity scale but unlike something like crusader kings 2, it's not initially mind boggling... for the most part. Though the building tree is extremely expansive and not very well laid out...\n\nIt doesn't run very smoothly either... I've got a 780 now and it works fine, but my previous 570m on my l;aptop had some stuttering, though anything over a 760 should be very smooth. And most people have that at least, so this is just a wasted sentence i guess lol.\n\nanyway.\n\nthe game has it's flaws; the campaign is excessivley long and boring. Though the writing is great I'd reccomend just free play or whatever it's called.\n\nalso steam rolling... not very fun late game, it's a problem with most 4x games, it's steam rolling. Once you've bumped off the enemy commander a couple times YOU WIN.\n\nthough it can be fun to maintain and manage a huge kingdom, exploring your lands etc.\n\nit's worth the price, it's worth putting a good 100-150 hours into, and it's a 4x game I'll be coming back to at some point. The ai is very good and it's heart warming to see how many different strategies can be played out in this game.","November 10, 2014","true","95.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

At a glance, it looks a lot like most fantasy setting 4x hexagonal grid strat rpg games, but this one is by far more punishing. As an example, the Age of Wonders series, when you make a mistake in that game it is typically a simple process to work your way back out of it, time consuming, but simple. This game is a lot less forgiving, to the point that even with all the right moves, you downright have to be cheating to get anywhere at all. In one game I had a single hero at level 2, was barely managing to stay on top of 4 hexes of land, and then a SINGLE beginner difficulty AI warrior hero comes along and stomps me. in the same amount of time the AI had somehow magically managed to have a level 5 hero, with 2 maxed abilities, and another with three points in it, which as far as I know so far, is not evne possible. So, all in all I definitely would have to give this game a 7/10, just for the sake of the mind-numbingly stupid situations I find myself in because of the balancing.","August 15, 2014","true","12.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I felt that it took a good while before things became clear to the players as to what might trigger within certain terrain, by certain races and for what reasons. While some might argue that it keeps things fresh and you on your toes at all times, I found it at least as much frustrating to be punished for things I couldn't possibly predict.\n\nBecause of this, some other random elements and because of limited knowledge of unit composition and generally what a good way is to start, I would say this game has a very steep learning curve. For some this might be a strictly bad thing, while others might enjoy figuring things out.\n\nIt should also be said that the more you learn, the more restricted you might feel as some choices are real not much of a choice at all, like your starting hero for example.\n\nSometimes the games can drag on, and because the game is repetitive in its nature, due to how the campaign is played by generating a new map with a basic start for every single new world you try to take over, progression can feel slow and unrewarding between maps.\n\nBut overall, it can be very tactically challenging and worthy the time of those who enjoy some management and above all this style of hex based turn based combat.","November 28, 2013","true","172.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoy it alot. I have dumped alot of time into the game. If you like Strategy/RPG mix overall I think this game is something to look at. I won't hide the fact that the game is still buggy even after being out for a year, but the developers have been patching the game non-stop since it came out April 2013.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nOkay this game still has bugs, for some people game breaking bugs, and for others bugs that are iritating enough that can make it painful to play the game sometimes. The game was released last April almost completely unplayable, and over the past year it has improved for the major part. Yet I won't gloss over the fact that their is still alot wrong with the game.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe game probably is not all that balanced. Their are 4 tiers of units, and some T4 units could trample an entire army. Not all of the Hero classes are balanced. Their are 4 of them, but they all are playable. It will be nice to see what the game is like in the future.\n\nThe Good:\n\nDid I mention patching? The developers still care about the game. They have been patching it a while, and still patch it.\n\nThere is alot in this game, alot of units, alot of choice. Alot of lore burried deep within a rough exterior. The game does not look half bad. The game is not fast paced, but is the type of game you can start playing, and come back between turns as you do something else, but will also keep you wanting to play "one more turn" when things are getting good or you near to beating another map. The developers have recently added a boat load of new units and spells, and have dropped hints are future expansion to the game.\n\n\nIs the game, worth $19.99? Its a hard sell considering how buggy it can still be. I do thing its a hard sell, but I've enjoy the time I've dumped  into the game and I do appreciate the patches that have gone into it. The game has gotten good, and hopefully it will cotinue getting better.","May 1, 2014","true","683.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, the four heroes types are quite distinct and balanced. The building system is also very, very deep (sadly its building interface is not good as it isdeep).\nAnd cheaper than king's bounty, heroes VI and fallen enchantress.","August 13, 2013","true","598.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Has the hardest campaign I've ever played by far and I'm still playing on beginner without finishing or starting a new campaign for the whole time I've actually spent playing the game (over 190hrs).\n\nBut it's been time well spent. The style of the artwork, the units, the models, the abilities and depth just work sooo well together.  I ACTUALLY feel like I'm in control of a kingdom while I'm playing. My choices have meaning and consequence/benefits. Although thats obvious when you play some games. I feel if I had to choose between games like ROME total war, Age of wonders series, Civ 5 etc, all those turn-based conquest stratagy games, I'd rather uninstall the rest than stop playing this one. But thats just my opinion.\n\nThe game in full could be taken furthur if the developers spent the same amount of time they spent making the game to make it go ever furthur. More intereactions, more interesting situations your kingdom might face, THINGS like shards clashing in the middle of conquering one shard then 2 more enemy kingdoms rock up that were originally clashing on that shard to begin with now I have to conquer both with more mayhem to add to the mix. The forging of alliances out of shards with other demi-gods, THE LIST is endless.\n\nFor what it is though it's amazing and a true inspiration towards what fantasy games should be/feel/look like. Not to mention the idea of shards and it's turn based stratagy while conquering territories. Well done! ^_^\n\np.s to myself: This review after reading does not serve the game justice, I feel its more than what I described by far but I couldn't find the words :(","February 19, 2014","true","247.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Compare to Heroes of Might and Magic or Disciples. Well worth the money it features near endless gameplay, diverse maps, interesting characters, and tons of quests, loot, enemies, buildings, and units to play with. You can also be as kind a ruler as you wish, or as evil a tyrant. Eador has some cons; a diplomacy system that is extremely limited and almost completely non-user firendly (I have yet to successfully forge an alliance with another master while on a shard). It also forgoes a totally pure RPG system like the Heroes series as heroes don't carry over between maps. So while you can level up to your hearts delight within a shard, all those experience points and high-powered items are lost once you beat it. Your deity character is also non-customizable and has little effect on actual gameplay. But besides these minor qualms fans of the TBS genre should pick this one up.","December 23, 2013","true","190.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its one of those games where I keep thinking..."Just one more turn, then I'll go to bed". Choose from 4 classes for your first hero/general and then build up armies to follow him around capturing provinces and hunting for treasure as you go. As your resources grow, recruit more heros to lead other armies. Its got a bit of everything - loot, RPG character progression, a story (which I havent really kept up with as I'm fairly early in),  exploration, base building and army customisation.\n\nFor people that remember games like Gladius, this is about as close as it gets but with more frills. Highly recommended and was a complete steal in the flash sale.\n\nMy only gripe is that completing some of the quests for the foreign races that you encounter in order to make them allies are sometimes near impossible to complete. Some more directions in game as to where to go to complete the quest would be good, instead of just "Find this item" (which could be anywhere amongst the dozens of map hexes, and in turn anywhere within the hex!).\n\nI had originally got Heroes of Might and Magic which was also on sale, but this is so far infinitely better in my opinion.","December 28, 2013","true","195.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But until Snowbird either adds in a whole new raft of features (multiplayer options, alternate ways to conquer shards) then for the sake of pretty graphics it’s hard to imagine why you would pay upwards of £20 for an identical remake of a game that is still available for £2 - especially in a genre where graphics are less than a secondary concern.  The amount of bugs and crashes I experienced as well as the constant repetitiveness makes this a hard game to recommend but at the same time I have enjoyed the game and how exceptionally well this game is put together beneath the surface.  Juggling multiple management systems and tieing them to karma, story and making the whole experience fluid is not something to dismiss on a whim, however that already appeared to be present in the original game, so the question remains: what value has Snowbird Games really brought to Eador?  That is a question I struggle to answer, even after 98 hours.\n\nA (now) solid turn based strategy game that stands shoulder to shoulder with many others but perhaps not quite matching the immersion that the Heroes of Might and Magic series provided.  What it lacks in story and frills it more than makes up for with in depth mechanics and gameplay however it is difficult to see anyone who is pressed for time or ambivalent about this genre sticking with Eador beyond the first few hours - especially when the tutorial alone took me 6 hours because I hadn’t realised there was no need to explore everywhere to 100%!  It’s a shame as the game really comes alive after the first few hours of invading a shard when you get the tier 3 and 4 creatures involved to take on the larger encounters in the game.\n\n7/10\n","December 30, 2013","true","339.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got about 15 hours out of it before I got bored.  It's a great concept and very ambitious.  The game gets bogged down in tedious combat, unbalanced units, and dumb AI.  Normal units require too much baby sitting to really level, but that's okay because high level heros dominate the field single-handed.  The strategic game lacks too: You're too busy conquering new areas (or re-conquering) to really explore or do quests except as side effect.  The meta-strategic is also neat, but you're so rarely there that it's more an aside than core gameplay.\nReally, I enjoyed what they were trying to do here, but I'd rather go play something a little more complex, such as Elven Legacy.","July 15, 2013","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a promising game, really a masterpiece of a crossover between Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic, the battles are really difficult but still fair, with the exception of 1-2 enemy units. It is a lot of fun for ppl who like to manage a lot, but still enjoy a nice battle every now and then.\n\nThe main flaw why I wouldnt recommend this game is, because on the technical side it's a mess. Errors prompting up every 5-30 minutes, most of them just stop the game from running, the minimum specs are a lie and the loading times are unbelievably long. You could say that in a playtime of 8hours you effectively have played 3-4.\n\nStill I would recommend Eador for being one of those games that really fascinate you, if you give it the chance and maybe have a good PC, the game is still a work in progress so maybe it will get better in time.","April 2, 2014","true","39.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a fairly steep learning curve so be prepared for some level of frustration unless you procede carefully.\n\nThe economics determine your success or failure so be sure to think before buying armies willynilly. Scout/Warrior are best for starting out.\n\nFair warning: this game will eat up your time if you attempt the campaign mode. And there is a significant chance that there will be game killing errors. I still recommend it but with the caveat that you are buying a deeply flawed and yet beautifully implemented long time scale game.","August 30, 2013","true","264.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes out some of the more frustrating resource management by reducing the types of resources from 6 to 2. Heroes feel a little underpowered in this game, but the four classes are pretty well balanced. The campaign mode adds a nice level of strategy. While each shard you conquer feels like its own world, and is a brief heroes of Might and Magic style game unto itself, the strategic brilliance is in how they link each conquest. As you conquer shards you obtain benefits and unlock technology that you can use in later conquests...for a price. The writing could use some polish, and it's difficult to pin down exactly, but it feels at times as though maybe a less than thorough job was done translating the game from another language. The real gold of this game is in its expanse. It is basically impossible to completely explore every shard, or at least would take a very long time, and the game does a nice job of providing you with new and different encounters. Do I want to try and forge an alliance with the elves on this shard or the halflings? Is it worth the time or should I just slaughter them all and take their lands? Should my hero spend his time hunting down that dragon that's plagueing my kingdom or should he pillage my enemy's domain? It's also nice to be confronted with actually insurmountable obstacles from time to time. No I can't explore this laborynth and kill it's minotaur at level one, but just because I can't face it, doesn't mean I can't see it. So many games have the "you'll get there when you're ready" mentality and it negatively affects suspension of disbelief.\n\nThe story is fairly generic fantasy, but Astral politics can be fun, and it's nice that the way you treat your subjects and those around you has a concrete effect on the way they interact with you. That being said, being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ isn't all bad like it is in some games. Some races respect bloodthirst and power. As a do-gooder, I constantly had my orc provinces in rebellion because they view me as oppressive and weak. Certain Astral entities will ally with you out of fear or respect for power rather than just sycophantic loyalty to kindness.\n\nAll in all I very much enjoy this game. Is it Shakespeare?

I enjoy it alot. I have dumped alot of time into the game. If you like Strategy/RPG mix overall I think this game is something to look at. I won't hide the fact that the game is still buggy even after being out for a year, but the developers have been patching the game non-stop since it came out April 2013.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nOkay this game still has bugs, for some people game breaking bugs, and for others bugs that are iritating enough that can make it painful to play the game sometimes. The game was released last April almost completely unplayable, and over the past year it has improved for the major part. Yet I won't gloss over the fact that their is still alot wrong with the game.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe game probably is not all that balanced. Their are 4 tiers of units, and some T4 units could trample an entire army. Not all of the Hero classes are balanced. Their are 4 of them, but they all are playable. It will be nice to see what the game is like in the future.\n\nThe Good:\n\nDid I mention patching? The developers still care about the game. They have been patching it a while, and still patch it.\n\nThere is alot in this game, alot of units, alot of choice. Alot of lore burried deep within a rough exterior. The game does not look half bad. The game is not fast paced, but is the type of game you can start playing, and come back between turns as you do something else, but will also keep you wanting to play "one more turn" when things are getting good or you near to beating another map. The developers have recently added a boat load of new units and spells, and have dropped hints are future expansion to the game.\n\n\nIs the game, worth $19.99? Its a hard sell considering how buggy it can still be. I do thing its a hard sell, but I've enjoy the time I've dumped  into the game and I do appreciate the patches that have gone into it. The game has gotten good, and hopefully it will cotinue getting better.","May 1, 2014","true","683.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not too difficult and not too easy, just right. This is a TBS type of game. The world consists of shards, which you have to conquer. Every shard consist of a number of provinces. Your hero (as usual you can have a number of them) has to conquer the provinces. Once a province is conquered you can explore it (find treasure, etc. usually leading to a fight or negotiation) pleasing the local population make money from them build mining facilities, mills etc. There are many kind of buildings to build and paths to choose.\n\nIn between, events take place that you must resolve in some way. For instance there is some wizard that resurrects some death people and you have to decide whether to fight the wizard, pay it off or ignore it (just making this one up as an example).\n\nFights bring you to a hexagonal field which is pretty much standard across TBS type of games and you have to fight the enemy with the army you have (pretty much like you have it in other TBS games like king's bounty).\n\n\nLoads of fun and highly recommended.","February 22, 2014","true","86.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game was quite new. It had tons of bugs but it was mostly playable. However it was no secret it was unfinished and many important mechanics did not work. But the small team of developers really deserve a load of respect because now a year and dozends of patches later - after many fans may have given up their hope on Eador and even taunted the creators "Masters of the Broken Game" on their official support forums - the game is great.\n\nMy comeback to the game today was worth and to honor the good work on the game the devs put into it I decided to buy it on Steam. I never thought they could recover this game and even more important giving the UI a needed refresh. By today the game is like it should have been at release - it is fun and can be challenging.\n\nThere are still some drawbacks: it can be confusing to learn how to conquer the shards and how the whole works.\nThe AI may be still better. The monsters, items and events you face on the shards are very repetitive. Not to start talking about the music.  Apart from that I would give Eador a good 6 of 10 rating.\n\nIf you have some time kill and you love to combine strategy with roleplay elements  it is definitely worth the few bucks it costs! In strategic aspects how creatures are fighting each other it reminds me a bit of Magic the Gathering.\n\nBad luck for Windows 8 users this game needs .NET Framework 3.5 to be installed to work properly.\n\nI rate the game with a 7/10.\n\n1 point less for the repetitive music and missions\n1 point less for the remaining bugs (mostly AI) and crashes\n1 point less for the fact you have to delete a preexisting profile and start a new campaign to unlock steam achievements, also to get access to the DLC. if you played Eador before you got it on Steam and like to play on like me, it will be troublesome.","June 25, 2014","true","61.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Really?)  I recieved it in a 5 dollar bundle deal.  Playing through the tutorial seamed a bit clunky and glitchy, but that was just the tutorial.  After the first few days of playing (countless hours of playing) , wow, I really like this game.\nI will use an analogy from the game story to describe the game.  Its like a gem broken into pieces floating aimlessly, spend some time collecting and putting them together, well, its a gem to behold (thus far).\nIts not your typical pick a race, class, here are your abilities, now get to it game.  The shards you attempt to conquer, will add to your abilities and somewhat define and refiine your strategy.  The game has been a pleasant journey of discovery as it doesnt come with a manual (although you can find the manual through google translate if you need game info).  Shards of different gametypes, pieced together (ex: HoMM, Masters of Magic, Warlords, etc) and its friggen extensive.  I am over 40 hours in and not even halfway through.   Altogether, it works for me and if you like these kind of games, you should find this a unique experience as well.\nDid I mention the game is huge?  Some shard battles I take time to do some quest, others I have been forced to finish fast as the enemy gives me difficulties (I started playing on skilled mode).  I have heard complaint that the game gets redundant or repetative.  What game do you enjoy playing that doesnt get repetative?  The game solves this with some auto functionality.  You can just quickview the battle, or set it to auto and watch the battle play out.  Sometimes I am forced to do the manual battle as the AI doesnt do the strategy required to win.  It will say this should be easy then you lose your entire army.  The game does save every minute or so and I suggest you do some manual saves (just in case, as there is no restart scenario option).  In all its a minor annoyance in all the richness this game offers.\nI have seen many gripes on the forums concerning this game, I have none here.  I guess you will either love it or hate it, but dont be swayed buy the naysayer if the above mentioned gametypes gave you some joy back in the day.  Eador:  Master of the Broken World is a worthy game.\nNow if you will excuse me, I have some shards to conquer.","August 26, 2013","true","339.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm a fan of Civ / Master of magic type games and that's what this is. Dozens of "shards" each being a unique world ruled by one or more local lords and possibly a higher being (similar to you). You can use diplomatic relations with the higher beings or just fight everything, be a kind rule and loved or a tyrant and feared. Take things be force and pillage or grow and build.\n\nEvery shard you claim unlocks new spells, troops and items so it's motivation to go for the hard ones. All in all a really fun game with a good auto save, buggy at times but auto save bails you out and you really open it up / start to enjoy a couple shards in so stick with it / power past the tutorial and the 1st demo shard if you can and you'll be rewarded with a lovely game.","May 14, 2014","true","115.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have more than one hundred and twenty hours of gameplay and was only able to conquer ten shards, nevertheless know that to finish the game you need twenty five. This means approximately twelve hours per shard, therefore I am talking about three hundred hours of campaign. And I am only playing on the third hardest difficulty. I am sure that in the hardest one I would not be able to finish the game. This characteristic force you to use the best strategy you can think in order to do absolutely anything. Eador is a low-number-status game, so each single positive thing you can figure out will make a enormous difference, the same applies to negative ones. The terrain on the battle map is extremely important, the single "1+ defence" a hill give can make the difference between everything. Personally to me this is a positive point if I liked easy and casual things I would study art or some other meaningless area, not physics.\n\nThere is one thing that almost kill this game, the sense of progression. But the Eador's developers are one the the best on Steam, and even after two years they are trying to fix this problem through patches. It worked on certain aspect but the problem persists. After each shard you conquer (after ten hours) you goes back to the astral plane and have to start every thing all over again, this creates the feel that all your effort was in vain. Now with the new patch you can transfer your hero and equipment to your next shard, so you can progressively construct your hero etc, creating the feeling that your efforts are really meaning something, that your efforts are constructing something. Nevertheless this costs astral energy, and every thing is so expensive that you will only be able to continue with your weakest and meaningless hero, probably the level 6 Commander that in the end of the shard's battle you create just for province exploration.","September 2, 2015","true","135.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You conquer the Eador world shard by shard. Each shard you conquer allows you to build a little bit better buildings.  The combat is turn based and is done very well. The variety of monsters, creatures you will face is also very nice. I am a little over 16 hours into the game and I am on my 4th shard and to be honest it is getting a bit repetetive at this point. There is no hero carry over from shard to shard so after you conquer a shard you then recruit a new hero for the next. I think this is where the game falls a bit. You spend hours working through a shard, building your main provicence and adding a couple of smaller buildings to the conquered provinces all the while leveling up your hero. This is honestly quite a bit of work and takes grinding to beat the shard. However once you beat the shard , you lose all your progress and your hero. You essentially start the next shard at ground zero. Albeit you have access to a little bit better buildings but you do the same thing again. Start your hero at 0 and work on beating that shard.\nThis is a fun game and at this point of its life plays solid- however I do not see myself logging 60 hours due to the repeat process on each shard.\nThings I think would make this game more enjoyable for longer play:\nCarry over your hero and make the next shard a level harder. This way you feel you are building towards something as you play through. Right now on shard 4 I stopped because I have a level 0 Warrior and he just croaked on 3 imps with 4 barbarians with him. It is frustrating considering on shard 3 I grinded my Mage to a great level and was enjoying the game. Then .... he is gone once the shard is defeated.\nReduce the amount of searching in each province. To get to 100% per province takes quite a bit of time and is very repetetive. I find myself at this point in the game rolling my eyes when I hit nothing encountered 3x in a row and it becomes a click fest to see what you will find.\nAdd more heroes if you plan on keeping the new hero per shard. They are quite generic and there is no real customization you can do to make the new hero on the next shard feel different.\nRight now you only have 4 to choose. I have already used all 4 and I am on my 4th shard. From what I read this game can reach 20+ shards per playthrough.\nThe good :\nPretty game. Graphics are solid.\nCombat is quite fun. I do like the movement points and I do like the challenge as the fights are not easy.\nThe variety of monsters,creatures encountered is very large.\nOnce you get the hang of city building with the wheel its pretty slick. I found myself realy enjoying the building aspect.\n\nAll in all .. this a solid 4x entry ....however if you are like me and enjoy customization of your characters and buidling your characters over the course of the game you will find this quite repetetive and almost a chore when you hit the next shard. (notice my frequest use of the word repetetive)\n\nI would give it 7/10 based on solid gameplay, graphics,combat but it falls a bit due to lack of hero diversity, growth, and customization.\n\n\n","September 21, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Simply put yes - in a pure cost per hour it represents great value. But if you're looking for a flawless gem then this is not the game you're looking for, its greatest strengths are also its greatest weaknesses.\n\nBy all means buy the game, enjoy it for what it is and appreciate the depth of control you have and perfecting your chosen methods/tactics. However this is rather like a marathon - you do it once, maybe you talk about doing it again but when you get back in training you realise the memory is better than the actual experience and there are better things to do with your time.\n\nWhen this game was first released the bugs made it torturous to play, despite its underlying appeal. The bug fixes and subsequent DLC addressed the vast majority of these and added some additional diversity into the game and the alliances you could build.\n\nThe unit progression is superb, allowing you to tailor to your playstyle while still retaining a small element of randomness. It's gratifying to see your minions grow and develop, reaching landmark skills/abilities and being able to deploy them accordingly. It's less gratifying to see them die on turn one of a battle before you can act. The realism of this is appreciated however anything resembling an offensive spellcaster is going to spend its life cowering at the back being chain healed awaiting the arrow that will finally kill it. After carefully nurturing them to a level where they get decent spells this is not entertaining. To avoid this you are left with only a small selection of units to use (or you go with a hero that does all the work while the creatures in the army are more like cheerleaders). The other failing is the high level units you can build are ultimately not needed meaning every level is the same army; the game fails to challenge you to change your playstyle, the 'differences' between the worlds are not level defining and every shard is the same. While I don't always like the myriad of missions that are often forced on players in games such as these the totally directionless play isn't rewarding. And just when you think it is you win the level and start from scratch.\n\nMy first playthrough was long, I inadvertently picked the longest win condition and proceeded to conquer every shard in turn. It was clear from the achievements there were a number of ways to win but none presented themselves. For me the replay value of a game is key, I love to go back and play games again in a different way, or using different tactics and this one is no different. Once I finished it I wanted to go back and play again; different heroes, different endings, different bonuses. The problem is after a shard or two I realised that I was going to be doing this for another 200 hours (and that there was no joy in trying to do it differently). While the longer I spend away from the game the more fondly I think of it a few hours playing it again drives me away.\n\nI don't regret buying it, or the time spent. Perfecting the tactics, overcoming the AI's tendency to cheat spectacularly, finally closing down a shard and managing the grumpy inhabitants of the cities was something I enjoyed at the time. But not something I want to do again and it's something many people won't want to do at once.","March 20","true","343.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I love games like Kings Bounty, Age of Wonders, Civilization etc.  But Eador just sucks, just keep clicking in explore province over and over again get's so boring and repetitive I'll start playing games on my cell phone as well = / I've also found most of the time in the begining when your hero is underpowered, the notifications of how powerful the enemies you'll face is frustatingly inaccurate. This really took the ♥♥♥♥, Just seeing, "this enemy is easy" and then going into battle and have all your units die in 3 turns, and then you have to wait for your hero to ressurect, and in the mean time your rival hero on the shard takes it over and you lose GG!\nI also found the combat really dull and boring. I hate strategy game where the units you face aren't concerened with their own life.  As in I hate facing A.I. that's more then willing to kamakaze themselves just so you lose a unti, rahter than strategically move around the board so they don't get flanked or ambushed.  But instead they will charge in the middle of 3 units just to take out that weak archer or shaman and the enemies die next turn because they bum rushed in the middle of your army just for the sake of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off.\n(Also why I hate FIre Emblem and love FF Tactics wayyy more, but anyways)\nNo option to rebind the keys, the options to change the graphics was bare minimum, and the U.I. is underdeveloped, just doesn't provide enough information, like before you move to a square you could maybe scout it to see what level of enemies you could expect to face.  Or maybe in the "go to a a location" menu it could state what's in those locations when you hover your cursor over them, instead you just have to waste turn after turn poking around seeing what enemies you can face while the Enemy Heros take over the shard and Game Over.\nAll in all a waste of time.","November 23, 2015","false","9.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

If the game is ever fixed, it is definitely recommended.\n\nConsider this a public service announcement: Game still glitchy as of December 25th, 2013.  I hope it is fixed sometime.\n\nEDIT as of December 30th follows:\n\nI've added another 40 hours of playtime, despite glitches and restarts.  Its a testament to the fact that I really do like the game.  I try to limit the number of actions I take per turn, to give the game less opportunity to fail.

This may well be the case but unfortunately I finally gave up with it due to the fact that it is so incredibly slow, clunky and badly made. The game mechanics are rather confusing and it really does a terrible job of letting you know what you are supposed to be doing. The tactical combat sections are also terrible. Tiny maps with big daft looking units that don't really offer much in the way of tactical options. Either your units are better or the enemies are.

Variety is sorely lacking - Units are divided into alignment, and despite a plethora of building construction becomes surprisingly linear based on what the surrounding area looks like, and there is only one player faction. Balance is bad too, with the margin for error being extremely unforgiving -  I couldn't make any headway even with the game set on beginner.\n\nThe setting, while enchanting, comes off as little more than your standard D&D story that we've all seen a hundred times.

There is no unbalanced/unbeatable combination of units, so you can play the game your style. For example Forests is good cover against ranged attacks and hills give you an advantage in melee fights. You don't have to kill all units, you can also reduce their moral to zero or reduce their stamina (that won't grant you the victory, but makes it way easier to kill them ;))\n\nThe Game is still a little bit buggy and freezes sometimes when you start a new shard and you have to play a different shard instead.\n\nThe Game develops slowly, you have to conquer a shard and as reward you get plans to build new buildings.

So much time that you may not have enough in your schedule to make good progress in it - I have over 80 hours in it, and I have not yet completed the campaign. As much as I like the scale, the shattered vibrant world, the astral mechanics and the immersive soundtrack, it has issues that it doesn't need to have.\n\nThe world in Eador is based on shards, with each shard being a whole new map to explore and conquer, and every one you conquer brings you a new building or advantage you can take along to the next. You gain astral energy based on how much of the world is in your possession, and how many people worship you, the astral spirit/master controlling the place. The problem here is that every single shard has you build up your forces from practically nothing. You can spend energy to bring some basics, but it is never really enough to skip through the early game and expensive. Plus, who knows what else you may want your energy for? Eador plays much more like several similar skirmish maps than a long unified campaign. Yet, there is throughout it all a large storyline, from world to world, where you can spend time talking to the other masters or decide to engage them, change things that have long term effects far past the one world you're in, or otherwise find out more about the game's world.\n\nWhile in the game itself, there are a lot of random and semi-random events as well. The world feels as if it is actually a world, rather than just a game through these. The soundtrack is very well done, and it is easy enough to forget about time and spend several hours to take over another shard and advance past it.\nBut it has issues, as mentioned. It is imperfect, with occasional crashes and some balance issues making it very difficult to progress at times, as well as some design decisions, whether intentional or not, leading to some choices being just plain better than others. Out of all this, the worst of it is when your opponent gets a random event that allows them to have a guard dragon, while you are still in the earliest levels. There is no way to defeat a dragon at that point without a lot of grinding experience on your hero and luck.\n\nThe opposing AI is rather poor, and at times does not seem to even understand the basics of gameplay, which is sad as you will be spending a lot of time beating on said AI. Both the other masters and the neutrals tend to be like that, sadly. The battles being on a tiny, simplistic map that shows that combat is not the game's strong point.\n\nBut you're likely not buying this for the combat. If you're buying Eador, you're doing it for the strategy, the long term plans, the vibrant world, and all the good things it has. Try to not let its faults get to you, and you will be able to spend litterally days on it without any regret. But if you do not have time, patience, or are not that much into strategy and similar 4X games, you may not enjoy it. For those who do enjoy those things, here's for you.","September 28, 2015","true","81.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Need to get some good income of magic first though.\n+ Equipment for heroes can be easily bought. (In most similar games i've tried, buying new equipment is "late game"\n+ Auto-combat can speed things up.\n\n- Hero balance is pretty awful. Scout is OP, Wizard is good, Warrior has uses, Commander is pretty much worthless.\n- Lots of useless units. Mostly tier 1.\n- Crashes, nothing too bad from what i've had and it autosaves frequently so rarely will you lose more than 3 minutes.\n- Difficulty of units you're fighting to reach the opponent can be "too hard". i.e i had to literally go through some semi difficult dungeons too "get lucky" and find a bow which let me kill some harder stuff which i couldnt find how to dodge to even reach the opponents side of the map to kill him.\n- 1 "playable" race, but hireables from others is interesting (but a little too unreliable)\n- Starting can sometimes be slow (depends on randomness of finding easy dungeons)\n\nBasics for new players:\nGet scout with either barbarians or swordsman (get 2-3), i recommend swordsman as they're easier to keep alive. Do not even bother with the other units. Bowman's can be added later on if you really want or elf if you get lucky as a mercenary.\nProtect scout with units whilst it slaughters stuff. When he levels increase his damage & precise strike/ammo when possible\nExploring closer to your capital is more likely to find weaker enemies. Once the scout reaches level 10 select archer and win from there.\nBuy him better equipment when possible pretty much as soon as your income allows.\nYou can figure out the rest.\n\nAlso, speed up the combat speed to max in the settings, yes it looks a little silly but so much better.\n\nMight seem i have more negatives than positives, but i've managed 60 hours in barely over a week and seeing i work and  do other stuff, this is pretty much all i've been playing.\nHighly enjoyable and worth a shot.","October 11, 2015","true","111.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

After 277 hours I can say that I still found new things in the game today.  The campaign takes forever but it is well worth it.\n\nWhat usually seperates games for me is do your choices matter and is the playability of the main function fun.  This satisfies both of those requirements.  You can win in a lot of different, satisfying ways.  I had mages who just fireballed everything or never cast a spell but summoned golems to destroy everything.  The warrior class is the strongest class by far but there are some challenges still if you play that class.\n\nPros:  Great gameplay, Solid graphics, Fun levelling for hero and units, awesome items, soundtrack is very good, solid strategy decisions and finally very challenging even if you are a veteran player.\n\nCons:  Interface is really tough especially on buildings, overpowered class(warrior/slayer) but really all heroes but commander.  Some of the events get tiresome and repetitive.\n\nOverall this is well worth your money and more importantly your time if you like turn based games.","November 1, 2015","true","291.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The "mixed" reviews on Steam almost turned me away but I am glad it didnt.  I have had the game for less than two months, and am at 341 hours played as of this writing.  I still haven't beaten it.  If I had to quickly describe this game, I would say it is a perfect marriage of playstyles from Brigandine (a PS1 turn based SRPG) and Civilization.\n\nPros\nInsanely addicting gameplay, with that "one more turn" craving.\nThe balance of units and their usage is very appropriate.\nThe story and writing are actually surprisingly good, and thats usually a non factor for me in a game focused on pure gameplay.  It's not an epic tale you'll be telling your friends about, but the individual characters are distinguishable and it's a rather neat premise.  Additionally, humor is intermingled in rather well.\nThe gameplay has a "roguelike" feel to it, in that after every shard you conquer you move on to another shard and start off almost from scratch.  Over time you gain more and more benefits you can start the next shard with, but it is very much a fresh new start every time.  Personally for me, this is what keeps racking up the hours.\nI would also like to give praise to the great attention to detail on units, and also the vast catalog of equippable items and buildings to employ.\n\nCons\nOther reviews really only harp on two things, difficulty and bugs.  The bugs do exist, and the game does crash.  There is an autosave feature that saves the game every turn, which addresses this pretty well, but it is still annoying.  It is NOT a reason to give up on, or dismiss this game entirely.  The difficulty may be hard for people new to SRPGs.  For me, I updated the difficulty level to "Expert" not too far into the game, and I am not struggling on any one stage.  This concern is also well addressed because they have I think 8 options for difficulty and can be adjusted.  There is a learning curve with troop usage and all of the classes involved, but a huge variety of successful strategies to develop which truly makes this game interesting.\n\nDLC\nI recommend playing the game a bit first and making sure you dig it before buying.  You'll probably know pretty quickly.  If you do enjoy the game, the DLC is a welcome addition to it.\n\nSummation\nIf you are looking for a turn based SRPG that you can play for 10 minutes at a time or easily lose an entire weekend to it all the same, this is a solid choice.  This is the best SRPG I have been able to find since the PS1 era.","January 16","true","429.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The visuals are beautiful, but the gameplay suffers from the fact that you can't field a mobile army unless you have a hero. Unfortunately, recruiting a hero beyond your first is prohibitively expensive, making the early parts of the game very boring or very frustrating depending on how you're progressing. Allowing players to march out troops without a hero or even allowing two free heroes at the start would help tremendously with the opening turns' dullness.\n\nAdditionally, the game features a separate tactical map for combat.

You'll invest a few hours on a shard to move to the next one just to unlock one more building. The game is fairly challenging which is good. Your lands are easily conquered and require your constant vigilance. Lands also revolt and succeed and so you send your limited units over to smack them down. Meanwhile, other lords are conquering the lands you just left. There's a good amount of random events that benefit or hurt you. There's also a fair amount of bugs that will hurt or annoy you like enemy units that are dropped to 0 hp but don't die.

This game looks and feels a lot like Heroes of Might & Magic, but it has some flaws that holds it down from it’s true potential.  I’m writing this review for the TBS fans that know what they are looking for, and noting the exact flaws that ruin the game.\n\nThere are four tiers of strength for your recruitable units.  Each recruitable unit can level up.  However, no matter what high level they attain, they are really no match for the next higher tier unit.  No units can be resurrected, which can be infuriating when your tier 1, level 10 infantry is eliminated by a tier 3, level 0 archer in one strike.  I tried to cycle through my troops by only using my low levels to fight low level battles, but then you realize that your higher tiers would rather benefit from the experience, as they will need all they can get when they have to take on tier 4 enemies.  On top of that, the opponent AI will always bee-line to your weakest and most exploitable units first.  Battles have to be sought out, but are abundant.  The problem is low level encounters are just as rare as high level encounters.  All encounters are preset, and you can choose when to take on the encounter.  You might find yourself scouring the lands trying to find goblins for your tier 1, level 0s to knock out, wasting many turns in the process.  The best way to level up your army is for them to see combat head on, which makes it tough to build up solid armies without losing a few in the process.  I found myself sometimes recruiting low levels as simple cannon fodder or bait.  No units have a ‘taunt’ ability, so no unit can be used for ‘tanking.’ This greatly hurts the whole point of playing as a warrior type CO, and puts heavy armor defense infantry in a tough spot.  Most units can run or fly circles around them.  Terrain does play a role in mobility and stat adjustments, but not so much that it becomes a game changer.  Battles ultimately end up being very lopsided, with little actual strategy.\n\nIf it wasn’t for the core of the strategy being flawed, it would be a fantastic gem.  The graphics are very pleasing to the eye.  The soundtrack is limited and repetitive like an old console game, but can be turned off.  The interface may look intimidating at first, but it is simply spread out and unconsolidated, which doesn’t affect gameplay.  I only recommend it to those with a tremendous amount of patience and time on their hands.  Expect campaigns to take many hours at a time, and anticipate never being able to take on many battles due to the limits of what army you can develop.  In short, expect disappointment, but do your best with what you have.","June 17, 2014","false","15.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's simply a disaster on all levels.\n\nGetting the game to run initially is a struggle by itself. The game files get flagged by AVG (something I've never seen before with a Steam title. After that, the game won't run because the game process is not killed and Steam will report an error. Even after forcibly terminating the process, steam still thinks you are running it. Ultimately you have to forcibly terminate Steam itself to fix it.\n\n\nOnce you finally get into the game, things get even more frustrating. Let me cover some key points to give a general idea of why I think the game is a POS.\n\nFirst you customize your profile as lord- pick a portrait, emblem color, name etc- however this is mostly pointless because the only part of the customization that is retained is the name and emblem. I picked a cool portrait to suit my roleplaying preference, changed colors to black and white, but in the game my portrait reverted to the default one and the character model is fixed to all red armor with a particularly douchey looking haircut.\n\nThe games inability to let the player roleplay doesn't stop there either. You equip your guy with a nice shiny Axe and a shield, but the model does not change and in battle he uses a spear and sword. I've seen more roleplaying value in games that aren't even roleplaying games.\n\nNo UI scaling- Yeah this game doesn't have it. If you are like me and many others that want to play at a decent resolution, then prepare to squint your eyes at the tiny UI or keep a magnifying glass in one hand as you play. There's really no excuse as to why a game like this is lacking such a rudimentary feature.\n\n\nThe combat- If you would call it that) is incredibly boring and lifeless. It's about as satisfying as peeling a potato. The animations are out of sync with the combat actions. The floating text and repercussions of an action happen before it has even been executed in a rather strange and detached way. Swinging a sword at an enemy looks and sounds like you've just slapped someone with a stick of celery. The combat lacks any meaningful impact and the enemies fall down in the most generic way shortly before they vaporize into a bunch of sticks ?\n\nWhen a battle ends there is no reaction at all from your army, no war-cries, no chants, they just stand there like stunned-mullets like it never even happened. The battle map is so one-dimensional and generic looking. It doesn't make an effort to show any creativity and just slaps a bunch of hexes together on some slightly modulated ugly looking terrain.\n\n\nI'd say the best part about this game is it's music, and even that's pretty average. Other than that, It's just a horrible uninspired, boring and lackluster approach to the genre with no redeeming value. In fact I can't think of a single thing this game does right.\n\nSuch a waste.","December 16, 2015","false","2.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

There is no option to retreat, no option to negotiate, no option for protective measures. I was forced into combat.\n\nThe 2 Ghosts were COMPLETELY IMMUNE to physical damage. I only had 3 Magic Missiles on my hero. I killed only one of them. The other Ghost had half hit points and he killed my entire army of 7 units including the hero because he was completely immune to physical attacks and the tutorial does not allow you to have any magic units in your army.\n\nGreat game design! How about an event that forces you to fight a Tier 2 unit that is completely immune to the most basic damage type with no way for you to counter it?\nNo strategy, no exploitation of weakness, no need to use your brain at all. Just watch one low tier unit slaughter your army because the developers don't know what STRATEGY and testing means. I swear is was absolutely hilarious watching this one ghost guy kill a whole army by himself!

So when this came out I was excited. It's essentially the same game with much prettier graphics. It look great, the interface is better and I enjoyed it for a while. I really give them props on some of the art - it's some of the best out there. The quests can be fun and there's a great balance between enhancing your own territories and going after new ones. Then two problems hit me:\n\n1. It's repetitive. Very repetitive. You start on a shard, build up, conquer the enemy and start all over again from scratch on a different shard. Rinse and repeat. That's not very compelling gameplay. They would have done much better with a faster paced, more open gameplay style.\n\nI could forgive that. After all, it's okay for a while. What I can't forgive is flaw #2.\n\n2. This "strategy" game is nothing of the sort for one reason - the AI cheats and will give it's side resources that are comparable to yours even if you should vastly outproduce them. So the whole game becomes an illusion because you aren't really "playing" the other side, you're playing against a bunch of foes that are generated directly in response to your own force. If you found a way to find a million gold in the game, rest assured the AI would have similar resources the next turn even if they were down to one or two territories left. As a result, the game is fundamentally broken in a way that will never be fixed. It's not a strategy game at that point because the AI doesn't need to play with any strategy.\n\nI figured this out when I saw the AI pushing units it could not possibly create with only one city left. After some exploration and some help unravling the back end, we found that's the way it works. So there is no real "AI". It's like playing Civilization if the AI could just give itself cities and armies out of thin air every turn.\n\nThat ruined the game for me. Oh, it still has bugs and the gameplay is also still repetitive. But it's knowing how badly the AI can cheat that was the deal killer. It's lazy and insulting to the players. As such, Eador sadly gets two thumbs down from me.","December 13, 2014","false","14.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

So I decided to pirate the game to see what it was like. I can honestly say that it was extremely fun and I decided to buy it the next day. For those who are new to the genre or maybe even the game, I recommend using beginner difficulty and playing the tutorial to get a grasp of the game mechanics.

That's a good thing.\n\nBut you have to feel this good feeling tons of times. I mean, whenever you conquer a world(or shard), you have to restart from the begining, YES, FROM THE BEGINnING. While this is not a bad idea, I mean it, but this kind of game IS very long, the campaign IS very long, and after sometimes, you will think, "What, I need to do it again? All right, I will do this, I will chose that. Come on, let get this war end". And BAM, after this, you have to that, again.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's up to you, I just show what you will do.

The game has issues with bugs creaping in, but the developers are generally pretty quick at addressing them. Unfortunately you rarely get a fully working game. As old bugs are squashed, new ones creep in. Also, some bugs just don't go away, the worst is the bug where you can't end your turn. You're required to basically sacrifice your next turn by converting it into 'auto combat'. In many cases this just results in you losing the battle. This means that 5-10% of your battles you are required to reload, purely because they won't/can't fix this bug.\n\nThere's three aspects to the game. A campaign-wide strategy, a map strategy, and tactical maps/tactics in small combats. Each one is flawed.\n\nThe Campaign-wide strategy could be very cool, as you earn astral power to augment your next map start, and you selectively choose what building upgrades you can get. Unfortunatly the astral power aspect is far too weak to have any reasonable changes on your map starts. So every map you start (which will be 10's if not 100's of times in a single campaign) is exactly the same thing. It gets repetitive.\n\nThe map strategy involves taking provinces and as you progress to diposing 1-N enemies on the map, but once you take a province you can instantly plop down a guard for the garrison, which is 1/10th the cost of the troops you would normally have to buy, and regularly a lot better than any troops anyone can produce. This means the game behoves rushing early on and plopping down guards, two of which the AI gains bonuses and cheats to accomplish.\n\nFinally, the tactical combat is exeedingly simplistic. The AI does the same thing irrespective of the map or your compliment. There is no concept of "threatened zones" around your characters, so AI troops will run through your line and attack things behind you, turning the game into just balling your troops up, and your tactics are limited by the kharma system.\n\nThe game has a "kharma" system that is based on your actions and the results of the campaign, which would seem like a good idea. Unfortunately, the kharma system limits what troops you can acquire or use, and these limits have absolutely zero relation with your actions. The "good" kharma units are slow and expensive, while the "evil" kharma units are generally glass cannons. Since your world map size/complement would dictate which tactics you would want to do, the strategic aspects of kharma basically have negative correlary to the tactical aspects of kharma. Combined with the fact you're limited in the number of units you can build at any rank/tier, this means that if you start in a small shard with the zerg units (which since every shard is the same, is almost always the best early option) you're now locked out of the other units.\n\nThe concept of the game is great, but in practice the limits on troops, building ranks, and the failing of the astral campaign options results in a very tedious game where your choices are generally limited not by any sort of story or strategy, but just purely pragmatic necessities.","July 12, 2014","false","129.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I found myself trying to figure out how to reach the higher level content once I managed to level my hero up.  Many of the quests were extremely hard at the beginning stages of the game and added to the frustration of leveling up.  Basic units are no match to even the most beginning level "monsters".\n\nThe economy is unbalanced.   Unit maintenance is very high in relation to the amount of coin that you bring in from provinces.  Building costs are low which allows for quick building.   This will allow you to access units for purchase fairly quickly.  However, it doesn't seem to matter that much because there is a logistical issue with your hero only being able to hold 4 troop types at lower levels.  Even after leveling up to level 4, a hero still can only hold 4 troop types.  It is very difficult to level your units and keep your favorite units around.  Combat is unbalanced.\n\nI'm not sure if it's a bug, but my garrison was transferred to another province when an uprising occured in that province.  I would expect the garrison to stand and fight.\n\nThe loot part of the game was very cool at first.  But there's no originality to the items.  Many of them are common low level items that don't help out too much.  Most of the game is loot based with low drop rates.\n\nThere are several bugs that cause the game to freeze/crash in the middle of the game.  This is not a huge issue though considering the game saves every 2 seconds.\n\nIf this game got some balance tweeks, item updates, bug fixes it would be a much more fun game to play.  It feels like the developers wanted to portray the look and feel of a 4x strategy game with all of the bells and whistles , but forgot the underlying basic game mechanics.\n","November 23, 2014","false","6.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

However, the execution of this God playing with pawns leaves more of a sense that one is actually just playing one of the selectiable heros rather than a God this makes Eador comparable to playing Might and Magic.

The object is to conquer shards by taking each enemy's capital, then move onto the next using advantages you gained in prior shards. Combat is grid based on a board with your soldiers. Each army is led by a hero and they all have their own special powers. Seems just like my kind of game.\n\nUNFORTUNATELY... the game is just broken in a number of ways. The shards are randomly generated and sometimes you can just get a trash start where it's very difficult to take neutral territories while the AI proceeds to take everything else. And on the topic of the AI... its cheating is in a league of its own. I've never seen anything like it in a game. The AI will do insane things like get tier 2 guard units before you even have access to them in game, all but insuring capturing their capital is nearly impossible. The same with spells. Tier 4 spells that one shot your entire army, super rare items, endless pools of gold... I've had the exact situation, where the AI was down to maybe 4 provinces and I had the entire map, but they would pop out heroes and full armies like it was nothing, all while their capital was defended by Centaurs, a tier 2 unit, that would utterly destroy even the best army I could muster since I hadn't even unlocked any tier 2 units!! By the way, this was on the 3rd from lowest difficulty, where the game still gives you advantages. Even when you don't get completely screwed with RNG and do pretty well all this cheating makes the game extremely tedious. Especially the guards. More often than not you need to grind up to beat them, sometimes for a long, long time. And you know what? In  the end, the AI cheating really doesn't make it that much harder. It just makes it take much, much longer.\n\nAdd in some bugs plus a less than stellar UI and you have Eador in a nutshell. If it were less tedious it'd be a pretty fun game. As it is though? I suppose it's better than Warlock, but that's all I can really give it.","August 21, 2015","false","69.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

But you will quickly see (within the first non-tutorial map) that the game is incredibly repetitive and grindy.\n\nThere is a concept of exploring provinces which is good but the execution is bad: Exploring takes many turns and you have to tell your heroes to "Continue exploring" every. single. turn. You may even get more than one hero to do this, so you will be clicking OK a lot. This really should be automatic.\n\nYou can then "visit" the locations you have found while exploring, which you will usually do this with your strongest hero. When visiting locations, any scouting information you accrued is lost and you're given no indication of the fight difficulty (if there is one) until you spend a turn. Both issues could have been covered in a 'are you sure?' prompt when selecting locations.\n\nYou're supposed to hire heroes and support them with an army. But I found it much easier to just hire a tough warrior hero and equip them with all the stuff you find from visiting locations. After a while they become invincible and can just stomp on everything. Armies are too expensive/upgrading heroes via equipment is too cheap.\n\nManaging your kingdom is a horrible experience. You can only reinforce one village guard and build one building in one province per turn. Your kingdom will typically consist of dozens of provinces, making this incredibly tedious and difficult to keep track of. These limits could be removed.\n\nFinally, there are too many random events. They can fire off for multiple provinces every. single. turn. Many events have multiple stages, depending on what choice you make. Do you care that there is a minor event in the insignificant province of Backwater Dump that might affect the citizens in some vague, indiscernable manner? The game believes you should. These events could have been more rare and had a larger impact.\n\nSo, Eador is entertaining and has great concepts but terrible execution. I can't recommend it when there are better games like it out there (Age of Wonders, Heroes of Might and Magic 3/5).","August 24, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't know why there aren't more reviews or why the ones it does have are mixed.\n\nIt plays like Civ 5, but you choose a hero (mage, ranger, warrior) and you deck him out to take out enemies. You can get more heros later if you can afford them and deck them out and send to war as well. You recruit soldiers to build armies your heros can command, and there are lots of cool fantasy units you can get. There are casters and healers and tanks and archers you can unlock. More fantastical things are in too, like faries and ogres for example, if you conquer neighboring settlements, which you can do through bribes, diplomacy, quests or violence.\n\nTechnology is a little weird. You unlock new solder types not through a tech tree so much but by building things in your towns. Building upgrades and types offer higher tier soldiers and different soldier types as well as spells your dudes can use in combat. Army composition is important, you will take morale hits if you put in a bunch of paladins with zombies for example, so you want to watch that and recruit accordingly.\n\nI got this game on sale but this title is worth the $20; as far as the dlc I bought it with the game so I can't really tell what all that added or not as I haven't looked at it seperately. It's only a few bucks though so may as well pick it up as well imo. I bought this as a cheaper alternative to Age of Wonders and Heros of Might and Magic, so I can't really compare it to them, but judging this game by itself I would say it is a fantastic game by its own merits.","May 21","true","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game is so close to being fun, but with the silly randomness of events and the rediculous amount of freebies the computer is awarded all aspects of enjoyment are gone.\nI would rather say this game is recommended, but just cannot without that factor being present.\n\nYou need to first slowly, oh so slowly, level you starting hero in order to explore with you weak units in order to gain xp, gold and gems for encountering the computer opponents.  Then just when you can expand out farther the computer jumps in, starting at peace and hopefully remaining there long enough for you to gain units that can tackle the outer rings of territories.  Usually however you cannot get those units in enough time for the computer to declare war, and then steamroll over you with a hero that is 5 levels or more above yours and bringing in tier 3 (sometimes tier 4) units when you have only reached tier 2 units last turn.  Then on each level (shard) taking 2-3 hours to complete and then having no feeling of accomplishment ruins the game in my opinion.\n\nThere is just something missing.  Games can, and should, be hard, in order to advance mastery of the game for good, hard fun to occur; at some level of hard however a game becomes stupid.

You are not limited to just one hero however and as long as you have the resources your army can be as big as you like.\n\nI am going to assume however that you are unfamiliar with HoM&M and even if you are, Eador is a different beast altogether. It's main gimmick is shards, that is each map is its own contained world so when you conquer one shard you move onto the next.\nThe game also features an ambigious moral choice system and certain units do or do not like being teamed up with others. Holy Paladins for example are not pleased by having to work with blood sucking vampires and such combinations will affect morale. Let morale get too low and units will flee the battlefield.\n\nAlready you can see a lot of systems are in play in this game and it isn't a bad game either. Complex doesn't have to mean 'bad' or 'begineer-unfriendly' but many things are randomized. You might get a start location with nearby provinces you have little chance of taking over and no resources to bribe them with. A province by the way is akin to a second city or to extending your domain so basically you want them if you can get them.\n\nI really could go on and on about every little system but a game stands or falls on one thing. Is it fun? For me Eador is middle ground. It is not a bad game at all and if you like games such as Civilization 5 or Endless Legend you will find yourself slowly adapting to Eador but for me I grew up on Heroes of Might & Magic so I want to love Eador and instead I find myself being SUPER ANNOYED at the game lying to me so much!\n\n3 Medusas? Yeah it'll be fine, we'll slaughter them. Lied the game shortly before I reloaded my last save.\n6 Peasants? We stand no chance! Lied the game again and I wiped them out with no issues.\n\nLying is a harsh word but that is certainly what it feels like at times. The game will tell you that wizards can attack at range, but forgets to tell you that they need a wand to do so. A wizard is a hired hero and hiring is expensive so if your wizard doesn't come with a wand, your hosed. You have to spend more money to build a shop that sells wands.\nThe game will tell you that a unit has a certain range like 3 or 4 but you get into a fight and it forgets to mention all the modifiers that effect the range like trees or hills.\nAnd this is the begineer difficulty, with tutorials turned on!\n\nAs you get better at the game you learn to ignore the lies as you have a good idea of what kills what and who to fight or who to avoid but I can't help but feel like Eador sabotaged itself. This game should be as big as the remade Kings Bounty games with over a million copies shifted or something I mean this game is good enough to be a Civ5 contender, but due to the steep learning curve I imagine many people are just turned off and stop playing, I know I did.\n\nMusic is more of background noise, I honestly mentally tuned it out. Sound effects are funny, spiders sounds like jewels falling down an escalator but as I always say about sound effects, they are not the biggest factor. Graphics? Game looks wonderful! Really, the art is great it really is and their is so much of it you won't take it all in until after a few hours of playing.\n\nOverall Eador is a niche game for a niche market and that is a huge shame. I stand by what I said when I said this game should be up there as a contender for Civ5 but as it stands many will have looked Eador over for Endless Legend and I personally think Eador is the better game but its amazing the difference some handholding and a tutorial can do.\nThe game does have a manual but I think that should be within the game itself like Civ5's civilpedia.\n\nI can't recommend this game to the majority of people but if you read this far then you will have a good idea if this is the kind of game for you or not, for most people they will struggle to get into this game and when they do the small playerbase will struggle to keep them.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","May 9, 2015","false","67.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","36","4","11","4","0"

This is far from the reality of the game. In truth, even the beginning difficulty level is more frustrating than it is worth. I have tried multiple strategies from single to multiple heroes of different classes, conservative and liberal spending. None of it matters. By the time you get any momentum in the game you are harried by your opponent and relentlessly picked off. If resources were plentiful this would be an acceptable challenge as you could build your defenses, hire support, and actually dream to achieve something. The problem is that when this happens you are typically stretched. Conservative play is likely key, but to be honest - I don't f*ing play a game to sit around for hours twiddling my thumbs. Yes, it's strategy, but different people like different strategy. I for one do not like this one. I'd rather play Civ, or most any other tactics game.

Each province needs capturing, then you can usually fight one or two side battles there straight away, then upgrade it (one building per turn only), then 'exploring' to quell overpopulation (about 5% explored per turn, totally automated, no actual walking around or exploration) which uncovers more battles. With over a dozen provinces per stage there is an awful lot of content, albeit drip-fed.\n\n- Unfulfilling, slow combat.\n- Even with a huge advantage, using the auto-battle will get half your force killed.\n- The battles really don't have much to do with 'strategy and tactics'. The battlefields are so small, so full of terrain and your army so comparatively huge that you almost run out of room to deploy them (leading to just plonking them down wherever you can), units get in each other's way, leading to fiddly, grindy crawls across a map dominated by choke points. Pretty shallow, more about numbers than anything else.\n\nIf you like more board-gamey strategy games (like FF Tactics) then you might like this. But otherwise, don't bother.","December 22, 2013","false","58.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

So this time i tried on the easiest difficulty setting, i got a good hero leveled him up to 15 lasted for 3 hours just continusly building holding off the enemy but then another enemy player showed up who was apparently working with this player and they both attacked me from both sides and again I lost. I try defend i cant hire units to guard my province, the enemy with 1 province remaing can capture one of mine then instantly spawn an army of 10 highly trained archers to hold it for him while my hero can only hold 5 units. Its just redicolous and enraging. Sure i might not fully understand the game yet but i dont think a game should be this hard to pick up espically on the lowest difficulty setting when there are 8 settings to choose from. Otherwise im still disappointed nothing really carrys over from the shards so theres not much point trying to get the best items or units because you will just lose them. The shards are unoriginal and get repetitive very fast and the manual combat is boring, the maps are to small, after a certain point my archer hero could sit in a corner doing 12+ damage to anyone the moment they spawned, theres not enough tactics to manual combat to make it worth while, meanwhile the automatic combat seems to be just odds, my hero will say something like "this battle is going to be easy" yet all my units and hero will die to units they should of been able to kill easily. The whole game seemed very unbalanced which just ruined it for me. Definatly no match for some of the other games i love that are similar to this like Age of wonders. I cant recommend this game even though the tutorial was fun at i thought it was going to be amazing.","February 13","false","3.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The art is amazing, the sound atmospheric, the story... might be interesting, i can barely tell though and i think you can see the love and thought which went into this game, there are a lot of nice concepts packed into it. But, for me, the actual gameplay is so horrible that i don't even want to touch it anymore despite all the things that seem so nice about it.\n\nHere is why: I like turn based strategy games, i've been playing Heroes of Might and Magic (oh no, so mainstream?!) since decades, tried every installement and Eador reminds me very much of it. But, while Heroes is definetly not the fastest game, it has a pace i can go along with, its mechanics interlock well into one another (usually, not the same for all of them and all the titles), so it is nice to be invested in them, fighting your way through the campaign with what little things might be given to you, or watching your puny town thrive to a huge empire in an open game, or make to many or one big mistake and probably fail. I think, this is not the case in Eador. There is a lot you can do, but to me none of it felt like i was achieving anything. Spending dozens of turns to explore one area, most of which is delivered in text, sometimes fighting encounters, most of which appeared meaningless to me, sometimes dieing to a threat i couldn't even determine beforehand, or when the game even told me "this should be easy" and my units get one-hitted one after another, because i coudln't know better - more than once, but then, maybe i could have known better after the first time - careing less and less about the individual parts of the game because it feels so tedious, until i even started skipping most encounters and finaly stopped playing.\n\nSo, i can't recommend it despite all its nice parts, because, after 10 hours of playtime, the game should have proven to me why i should care to carry on and not feel like a bunch of tasks i ought but not like to do to maybe get anywhere.","June 23, 2014","false","10.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Their file handling errors manifest it two ways.  The first is that if you try to attack the wrong shard the game will crash during the first save event.  The second is that if you try to attack the wrong enemy on a shard and the game will freeze.   I don’t know what’s going on, but this is pretty basic stuff.  It is kind of surprising that they could create the graphics and gameplay that they have and yet still not even manage programing 101 file handling issues.\nHere’s the use case that ruins the game for me.  I have three shards that I can attack.  Two of them will cause the game to crash during the first save event.  The third freezes every time I try to invade a territory controlled by the last of four enemies.  As such, there is now no way for me to even attempt to continue, let alone win, the game.  I guess that I could just kill off all of my heroes, dismiss all of my guards and troops, and then wait for the last enemy to conquer my castle, but who would want to do that?  Besides, there is no guarantee that surrendering this shard will allow for the creation of a shard that won’t crash.\nIt looks like this game will be really fun someday.  But until they fix there file handling issues it is just frustrating.  As such, I wouldn’t recommend buying it until after they fix these bugs.\n","April 9, 2014","false","258.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

On campaign level you conquer "shards" that give you new technologies and buildings, and compete with other NPCs. Each conquest happens on a map where you and your opponent have a castle, raise an army and fight for territories and resources. Finally, each fight happens on a tactical hex map.\n\nCampaign level is little more than a sequence of missions. You have some choice on what to attack next, but it does not matter much. It is extremely long, and most will stop playing before end. After playing 200 hrs I am about halfway.\n\nArena level is fun, but NPC is not competitive - its just something to kill when you want the arena to end. The fun comes out of selecting a sequence of fights to level up your hero and your castle. Its somewhat similar to King's Bounty in play style - you pick fights, your hero levels up, you can now win harder fights, but there is no hurry to do something by set time.\n\nThe tactical fights are reasonably entertaining, units have various spefical abilities and immunities that you have to keep in mind, there are spells, tile bonuces, fatigue influence etc.\n\nThis would be a very good game, if not for bugs. Bugs! When I bought it a year ago, it was essentially unplayable, so I let it settle down for a while. Now it is somewhat better, but still, hourly crashes, NPC units endlessly going in circles, lockdowns, corrupted saves... when half of the challenge in a fight comes not from defeating an enemy, but from avoiding triggering the known bugs, the game definitely has quality problems... and if they didn't fix it by now I guess they never will.\n\nSo... I am not recommeding it because of bugs.","May 1, 2014","false","341.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I ended up putting the game down when this repetition got to me.","November 25, 2013","false","40.2"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","0"

If ever the developer finally irons out thier customer service and bug fixing issues (after a year and a half my prediction is that they will not), they will have a true classic on thier hands. If you can tolerate a campaign that drops you to desktop every 5-8 turns or so, you will love this game. If however you can not give this title a wide berth.","January 30, 2015","false","725.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Since if you go slow, the enemy hero finds you and walks right through all your defences.  Whoever has the strongest hero wins especially with the weak units you use for most of the game, the hero can crush entire armies when he gets high enough and the mage class is useless for the most part.\n\nThe campaign is like an endless restarting skirmish mode, where you start off the same each time with maybe a couple different enviromental effects and the possiblity of one more building which you earned last time. This gets old fast and it almost seems like you aren't making any progress with a vague reason to keep you going.\n\nSo if you are wanting one or two skirmishes its ok, it also look and plays fine. Would however only say to get this game if its on sale to play a little to see what its like but for the most part its too repetitive for me.","December 20, 2014","false","75.0"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

What has it brought to us? A fine picture, a new DLC (which you will rarely use to your advantage) and a damn lot of bugs!\nFirst of all, the game is not optimized at all! Its graphics are not so great, because it's just a turn-based strategy, but is uses more resources than Skyrim until it just refuses to work. Relaunching the game may help, but I want to play, not launch it over and over again. But that's not all. Tons of bugs still occur after so many updates. Devs, are you sure you fix them? I don't see it. Just two days ago, it crashed, when I attempted to conquer a new shard and no matter how many times I reloaded the game and the save file, it was crashing in the same place. Do I have to begin it from the very beginning after so many hours of playing to get the same error again someday?! Oh, come on...\nNew DLC... Yeah, it's fun sometimes, but that's not what I expected. It could have been much better! You just have some new units for the creatures you can make an alliance with, but if you have a troll or a minotaur, then you won't use them at all, because they are too week. And completing some tasks becomes more difficult, because, if you need to kill 10 dwarves, you'll have to kill 100 dwarves and that's not funny at all.\nTastes differ, I know, but I liked the Eador: Genesis's interface more. It looked better and worked better. It was more convenient.\nAnother thing that I did not like at all! The game has become easier! A damn lot easier compared to Eador: Genesis. When you attempt to conquer a shard, you've got 3-4 new building to acquire... When you finally conquer a shard, you get 7-8 new buildings! And how am I supposed to call that bonus? Yeah, a piece of s**t! It just ruins all the fun! You don't have to plan ahead, you don't have to choose wisely which shard you should conquer next. And in the end (if you get to it, because it can crash anytime, as I mentioned above) you have to (yes, you HAVE to) conquer EMPTY shards! And you know what? It pisses me off to waste time like that!\nThe result: yes, Eador: Genesis is older, it doesn't have that pretty though useless DLC, it's not 3D, it doesn't have these pretty (also quite useless though) achievements in Steam, but it works well and it's more challenging, and that is why I'll choose that old beauty instead of this new piece of garbage!

I must say that this game is interesting and certainly has the "Still another turn" appeal. However, eventually I must admit: it is exceedingòy frustrating. After the few first worlds, that are fairly easy to win, the game becomes very hard. After trying in vain too many times to beat some of the enemy gods for the control of my third or fourth island in sky, I eventually felt disappointed. A game that is too easy to be interesting  becomes quickly annoying, but so does also a game that is just too difficult to be won. When I play I want to have fun. If it is too frustrating, where is the point in continuing?\nI may be a mediocre strategist, or just right a stupid guy, but I do not enjoy to be systematically punished.

The game feels (as in it is) really dated with mechanics, graphics, music and themes that belong at the turn of the century.  Eador would be considered a "good" game back then, but it doesn't measure up to what can be done now.  There isn't any story behind any of the game, mechanics are pretty straightforward (meaning uninspired) and don't bring anything we haven't already seen.  You will encounter odd text in tooltips, ranging from some type of humor (which comes out of nowhere) to not helpful at all. You will spend many turns pressing "next", which brings the game to another issue: performance.  Turns are pretty long, even from the start.  Considering that this isn't a very complex game to begin with, it  proves that the studio doesn't know how to optimize a game for the current era. There aren't really any options as to who you play as, where you are going or what path to take.  Overall its just a sad, flat, uninspired game that is akin to a sophmore student's project at technical school.

You may hoard, but it will cost you.\n- Unit prices increase for every one you hire of each type. You can't just spam the best units.\n- You have to choose which unit types you want, because you can only use half of them in each game.\n- Your hero can only use a limited number of each unit tier at any one time, with fewer of the higher tiers.\n- Building everything in your home town takes alot of time and gold. I still haven't managed to do it.\n\nThings I dont like:\n- Lack of helpful tooltips makes some things hard to understand. Like how the size of a population will affect the game. It's hard to win a game when the game doesn't tell you how things work.\n- The heroes say "I will easily defeat them", but then he dies and\or loses several units in auto-combat.\n- The combat AI is awful, sending archers and healers to the front row all the time.\n- Not enough abilities available for each hero type.\n- Unit animations are poorly timed (they deal damage and then they hit)\n- I'm swimming in mana, without trying at all.\n- Heroes are unbalanced. The scout and the warrior are one man armies, while the wizard can only cast 2 attacks through a whole battle in the beginning...\n- Some province populations will hate you and rebel. You dont have a clue why, because the game doesn't tell you.\n- Too little focus on magic, spells are too few and not very interesting.\n- There's no combat log.","September 29, 2015","false","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you like strategy? Do you like character building? this is the game for you. Built around forming your faction as you go rather then just making you choose from a set of premade ones the game offers many branching paths for development of both your faction in terms of religion, culture, military, and magic, aswell as for your avatar. There's plenty of hidden things and random encounters to mix things up, aswell as mercs and special weapons to buff your armies. The province interaction is very limited though, and the game suffers from the occasional bug, the difficulty curve is also a bit too steep.\nAlso multiplayer would be good, if anyone still played this game... I give Eador a 7/10","December 8, 2014","true","191.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

I'm switching this to a *very cautious* thumbs up. (By the way, my hours in the game are exaggerated. One of the many bugs is that when the game crashed, it didn't end the process in the task manager. So, I once had the process running for a week straight, adding a couple hundred hours to my play time).\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:\n\nSo many bugs! I really really want to enjoy this game. And for long stretches, I do enjoy it... and then a gamebreaking bug causes all of my progress to be lost. This happens over and over again. I keep coming back, so at its heart it is a good game. Every time there is a patch to fix a bug, several new bugs pop up in its place.\n\nMost recently, they put out a big patch, calling it free DLC, and supposedly fixed bugs. It introduced an obvious, gamebreaking bug right up front that makes the game unplayable (enemy units won't die, they just sit on the battlefield at 0 health).\n\nHere is a list of some other bugs I've encountered in previous builds, some of which may still be present (I don't know, since the game is unplayable on the first shard now)\n\n1) I attacked another master, and won the final battle to take the shard. This results in a "game over" screen (this ruined my longest campaign, and even happened when I went to beat a different shard first, then returned to that master).\n2) My provinces are invincible. An enemy master will defeat my guards at a province, then retreat the next turn, with the province still under my control and my guards at full health\n3) I attack a province and end up in a mirror match, where I control both of my identical armies against one another. No matter which side wins, I both win and lose the battle.\n4) Game freezing and crashing to desktop immediately after conquering a shard. It goes to the main astral screen, the conquered shard comes towards my shard, and the game crashes as soon as they merge.\n5) The enemy AI completely forgetting to play the game. I once took over an entire master's shard with the enemy hero having never been beyond one hex of his capital. This was on a large map.\n\nI cannot recommend this game in its current state. It's been a year of heartache for me, since I want to play through a campaign so badly, and I keep trying, but it's just getting worse.","May 8, 2014","true","703.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
