Or just cut the crap and drop a Megaman Master Collection and put all 8bit and 16bit megamans including MMX in one release.  Capcom could even keep up with their practices of leaving other games in the series out like Megaman 64 and Megaman Soccer.  No one really cares about those.   .....Right?\n\nEach game is a direct port of the original, even with the same slowdown's that would happen on the NES.  Even some of the graphical glitches.

I love Mega Man.  It's my favorite series of all time!

It's hard to explain why/how, but I'm finding myself making a lot of mistakes and moving with less precision than I normally do.\n-Kind of glitchy in ways I don't recall from the NES days.

I go back in, and Guts Man reappears with full health.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/363440/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Mega Man Legacy CollectionDeveloper: Capcom\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nThe Blue Bomber has been around since 1987, and since then over 50 different titles bearing his name have been released. Selling over 30 million copies combined, Mega Man is often cited as one of the most renowned video game franchises of all time. However, Capcom has been neglecting him for the past several years, having cancelled the last few major Mega Man titles that were in developement (Mega Man Legends 3 being one of the biggest ones). It wasn't until Nintendo picked him up as a playable character for Super Smash Bros that we really started seeing more of him. That changes with the release of the Mega Man Legacy Collection, an updated re-release of Mega Man's first 6 iconic adventures from the NES glory days. While not as encompassing as the Mega Man Anniversary Collection that released in 2004, that included Mega Man 7 and 8 as well as 2 previously unlocalized Mega Man fighting games, it's still a great way to introduce new fans to the Blue Bomber's original adventures.\n\nIn addition to the six Mega Man games, Mega Man Legacy Collection features new ways to experience the classic games with the Museum Mode and new Challenge Mode. Challenge Mode remixes gameplay segments from all six games, with plenty of scaling difficulty objectives for experienced players to conquer yet serving as a good starting point for new players, too. Museum Mode contains a comprehensive collection of history, high-res art and original concept pieces – a treat for any fan of Mega Man and video game history.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nFeaturing some of the most difficult 2D platforming, Mega Man plays out with the player controlling the Blue Bomber himself as he jumps and shoots his way through 6-8 stages, each with one of Dr. Wily's Robot Masters at the end. Defeating the Robot Master grants Mega Man a special interchangeable weapon for his Mega Buster, taken straight from the Robot Master he just defeated. Each stage has a certain theme, usually matched to the Robot Master. Players must be on top of their game to navigate each stage and defeat the Robot Masters, and ultimately Dr. Wily. Back in the day, game developers had to make their games incredibly difficult to extend the lengths of their games. Mega Man is one of the most difficult of the older game franchises, right up there with Castlevania and more.\n\nMega Man 1 is where it all began, featuring 6 stages with 6 Robot Masters. Each later title features 8 Robot Masters instead of 6. Mega Man 2 is probably one of the most memorable of the original 6 games, having one of the most overpowered weapons in the series: the Metal Blade. Mega Man 3 introduced sliding to the series, allowing Mega Man to traverse small spaces by sliding through them. Mega Man 4 introduced Charged Shots, where Mega Man charges his Mega Buster for a more powerful attack.\n\nThe most amazing feature this collection has is save states. If anyone has ever used an emulator, you'll be familar with what this means. Save states allow you to save anywhere in the game, at any moment, and then load those saves back up at anytime. Each title has 1 save state available to it, so make good use of them! I think they are best used as checkpoints during statges, or right before a boss so you can redo them over and over until you learn their attack patterns. This is probably considered cheating by some, but it's extremely useful.\n\nAlso available are a number of challenges, remixes to test your skills and abilities. Each one has a bronze, silver, and gold rating to aim for. Online leaderboards track the best players, and Replays allow you to watch them!\n\nGraphics\n==========\nMega Man is an 8-bit series, and this Legacy Collection does little to improve it. It does however add a few filters to give the nostalgic feel of playing on old televisions or PCs. The TV filter is probably the best one. Also available are widescreen and fullscreen options, as well as the original format.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, each title has an extensive collection of sketches and official art depicting characters and enemies from each game. These pieces of art are part of gaming history!\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe Legacy Collection keeps the old 8-bit NES tunes and sounds of the series, and also offers a very nice music player for each of the 6 titles. Each title has around 20-25 tracks that can be played at anytime from the main menu. Boot up Dr. Wily Stage 1 from Mega Man 2 for a great example of the games' soundtracks!\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThese games all run beautifully, and don't really take much at all. The game never crashed or had any issues. It runs at a steady framerate. If you want you are able to fully rebind any keys to your liking. Full controller support is also available, and is the recommended way to play. It's fully playable with a keyboard though.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nThe Mega Man Lecgacy Collection is the perfect way to relive the glory days of Mega Man's 8-bit adventures, or introduce someone to the series. This collection is a must have for fans, and if enough people buy it we may see further Mega Man titles released on Steam. Capcom has neglected Mega Man for far too long, let's show them that he is still relevant and is still a beloved gaming icon!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/CIl75nw1fsQ\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nA Must Play\nIf you liked this review or found it helpful, please consider rating it up.

It does not exist as some end-all be-all collection with tons of amazing extra features or all the games or anything like that.\n\nit does not have:\n\n- a huge amount of Mega Man games or even nearly all of them in the classic series;\n- HD remakes or total overhauls of the games;\n- any fixes or alterations to the original games; there is still slowdown when too many sprites are onscreen, all the bugs are still there (which can be seen as a good thing, especially with MM1's pause trick still intact) and spelling errors ("Wiley" in MM3, "Faild" in MM6, etc)\n\nhowever, it does have:\n\n- well-done HD upscaling that is smooth as silk and has absolutely no screen-tearing unlike any emulator I've ever used on an HD monitor;\n- a very tight and lagless feel closer to playing the games on the original hardware or 3DS, which in fact was noticeable enough that it took me some time to get used to the gamefeel after so much time spent the touch of lag most emulators and ports come with;\n- an absolutely ridiculous amount of concept and production art in extremely crisp, high-quality, high-definition scans;\n- a database full of relevant stats, weaknesses, descriptions, official names and the original artwork for not only every boss but every single normal enemy in each game;\n- customizable controls and comes with a built-in rapid fire button;\n- save states, one for each game (and of course passwords work too);\n- options for screen size and borders on or off as well as some neat stuff like a filter that makes the screen look like an old CRT TV from the 80s;\n- a cute little jukebox that lets you listen to any music or jingle from any of the games;\n- perhaps most importantly, a set of 50 different challenges presented as bits-and-pieces of the games' levels and boss fights, offering a new and unique challenge to players.\n\nI will say that the challenges offer a bit to be desired, as many of them use the same level chunks and of course boss fights, there aren't enough that shift between games in the series (those tend to be my favorite) and you're not going to see any crazy effects like, say, NES Remix tends to add to the mix, which the challenge mode quite reminds me of. But all in all it's a fun addition that will definitely help anyone completely master the classic Mega Man series, especially if they can manage to get gold medals for each of them.\n\nOverall, it's probably not everything that you wanted or were hoping for, but at $15 -- half the price of buying these same six games on 3DS or Wii U, mind you, and bound to go even lower on sale through Steam -- it's definitely still worth it for fans or newcomers that would like a high-quality and, well, more legal Mega Man experience on PC than playing the series on emulator.  As well, it's going to be the smoothest, cleanest option outside of playing them on the original hardware or possibly 3DS, and it comes with enough extras (particularly the huge amount of high-quality original artwork and challenge mode) to make it worth the small price tag for sure.\n\nBut seriously, it's 2015, why is it so hard to release a collection with 1-10 & Bass, the Game Boy I-V and Wily Wars, at the very least?  Seriousy dude the challenges in this that mix all 6 games made me YEARN for a new Wily Wars-like experience where you can mix abilities from all the games, uuugh.","August 30, 2015","true","32.6"," 63 of 74 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","63","74","4","3"

Though it could use a little more, it's an excellent collection that is totally worth your hard-earned cash to show Capcom that you care about this neglected series.\n\nThis collection only contains the first 6 NES Megaman games, which is probably my only complaint about the whole thing. I would have loved to see 7 through 10 here -- even just 9 and 10 since they fit the NES style. I, however, am a fan of even 7 and 8, and I firmly believe they deserve the same definitive collection treatment.\n\nThat aside, everything you could want is here. There's controller and keyboard support with full customization options.  You get screen scaling options that either maintain aspect ratio to a T for perfect pixels, stretch the screen only as far as it can go vertically, or completely fullscreen. If you're into CRT filters, they've got that too and they do a pretty good job. There's even an option for including a border around the game if you're using one of the non-fullscreen options. Quite honestly, I find it most comfortable to play with the proper aspect ratio. However, the game doesn't look or feel too bad in full screen.\n\nThe games all play just like I remember them in my brief experience going  back through. Included are also a music player which plays music from all 6 games, and there's a bunch of artwork and sketches to see and read about pertaining to the characters and enemies of each game. It's a nice little touch that shows extra effort. The challenges section is also a nice touch with some fun and addicting little speedrun challenges. Nothing revolutionary, they just run you through bosses and portions of stages. There's decent social integration with leaderboards and achievements and whatnot.\n\nI've seen some people complain about the slowdown. Be assured that this is not due to actual framerate drops from poor optimization or something. These slowdowns are due to the fact that this collection is accurately emulated. This is the only collection of Megaman games released since the original NES version that perfectly emulates the NES hardware including all of the slowdowns. This is how Megaman played all those years ago, and the archiving of these games and all of their hardware flaws is good and necessary, in my opinion. I give Capcom a lot of credit for deciding to do this.\n\nThis is a good collection. If you like Megaman, buy this and show Capcom that you care. We all know how easy it is to emulate these games yourself, but there's no longer an excuse not to buy these games when such a great collection option exists at such a reasonable price.","August 24, 2015","true","10.5"," 147 of 204 people (72%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","72","147","204","9","2"

I own a variety of MM games, from NES carts, to the X games, to the Legends series, to some of the digital editions, etcetc.\n\nIf you're looking for a direct port of the NES versions, you're in luck. The problem however is that this game markets itself as a 'faithful reproduction' with 'HD flair'. As far as I played, neither of these key elements are actually there.\nThe game suffers from really strange input lag. It's hard to describe but everything feels really off and unresponsive. In a game where quick reflexes can be the different between life and death via pitfall, this is already a pretty major error.\nAs mentioned earlier though ontop of that, they are literally direct NES ports (as far as I could tell, anyway). This means every game in the collection (including the new challenge mode) suffers from buggy audio, flickering sprites, and EXTREMELY frequent framerate drops, to name a few.\n\nBack on the NES this would be forgiven because of hardware limitations. But in what should be an HD reproduction in 2015, this is an absolute deal-breaker. Emulators that you can download for free literally do the job so much better, meaning you can save your £11.99 for something else.\n\nI've already received my refund from Steam.

There is absolutely nothing this collection does to make it preferable to any of the myriad other ways to play these games. Even the Steam Achievements and Trading Cards feature lazy artwork.

The games don't even run in true 1080p, they all run at sub-1080 in 4:3, with the options to scale them up to fill the screen vertically, or to stretch it to fill the whole screen. It was thrown together in a rush as a quick cash-in for Mega Man fans' nostalgia, and as a way for Capcom to hold the series hostage.

But is this collection nothing more than just a bunch of emulated ROMs?\n\nWell, that’s a very easy answer.\n\nPros:It’s Megaman!\nI mean, seriously. It’s Megaman. The music, the colorful graphics, the presentation, it’s just very Megaman!\nThe Exclusive Challenges are surprisingly fresh, and gets really interesting when you warp from game to game in a single level.\nNitpicks:The “databases” and “artwork galleries” are nice additions but they just seem to be a excuse for additional content.\nCons:They’re all emulated, barely modified ROMs. It’s basically just a well-presented NES emulator that plays Megaman.\nThe Review\nI’ll admit, I haven’t really grown up with the Megaman games. Prior to playing the collection, I played a brief session of Megaman 1, and I’ve later played the remake for it as well. But it’s so easy to see why Megaman is such a classic icon when it comes to video games. There was an element of strategy and challenge to defeating the bosses, and it makes a very elegant design. Once Megaman 2 cleared up most of the issues the original had, what did they do with this well-designed formula?\n\nThey copied it about 4 more times.\n\nThat’s not to say that the sequels didn’t have new mechanics/abilities, but playing through all of these games at once shows that each new game only added a small, marginal improvement. Which is perfectly fine, because if it ain’t broke (or stale), don’t fix it. Packing the first 6 games together makes them feel more coherent and similar (As if it was one large game), and that really makes exploring the history of such a legacy really great. And why would you change the stellar music, rock-paper-scissors mechanics, and challenging difficulty anyway? All they needed was a bit of spice each iteration to make it special.\n\nBut we’re here to talk about this re-release for the first 6 Megaman games, right? I wish I could go in-depth about how the re-release turned out but that would be completely boring. And this is because Megaman Legacy Collection is almost nothing more than a bunch of emulated ROMs placed into a emulator, with the emulated slowdown and everything. There’s virtually nothing different from the original NES releases, which is fine, but those expecting more will be severely disappointed. If there was one thing I wish they just changed for these releases, it would be the removal of the emulated slowdown. It makes the game seem slower than it actually is at times and it makes precise movement difficult. Most computers are already more capable of handling all of these sprites at once, why do we need to experience the same technical limits that occurred on the original release?\n\nNote that I said “almost”. That’s because the game’s new form of content comes in the Challenges, which add a time trial element to the games. These mainly consist of both boss rushes and unique stages that take parts from different games and put them together in one level (Which is probably the coolest part of Legacy Collection). They’re nice additions that probably won’t attract the majority of the people that play the game. The other bonuses include art galleries, a playable music player for the game’s soundtrack, and info databases on all of the characters/enemies in each game. These are also neat additions, if a bit standard for some of these re-releases in general.\n\nFor the most part, that’s about mostly the entire game covered. There isn’t that much you need to know, other than that if you wish to play some Megaman, this is definitely worth picking up. If you want something more out of this collection (like more unique bonuses), then you’ll probably be out of luck.\n\nTL;DR - [A simplistic, if somewhat underwhelming re-release that’s still very worth it for those wanting some Megaman action on PC.]\nRecommendation Level: Cautiously Recommend.\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","May 12","true","6.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

This game includes MM 1-6, artwork, Challenge mode (its basicaly a bunch of time trials), and music from the games. The games are also in 1080p.\n\nAll the games are EXACTLY the same as they were on the NES; they even contain the same glitches they used to have. The good thing about that is: the Pause glitch in the Yellow Devil boss is still there. The bad thing about that is: has the same slowdowns the NES had to deal with. You don't have the option to turn if off either. This makes Mega Man 3 harder than it needs to be.\n\nThe deal you are seeing here isn't bad, the Mega Man Aniversary Collection was $40 when it came out. This collection has less content but is $15. So comparing what you'll get in each this ain't a terrible idea (by the way, they don't even market MM: Aniversary Colection anymore. EDIT: The Aniversary Collection was only released in America and Japan got an alternative; countries like Europe never recived a Mega Man collection of the classic series, so I'm guessing they are happy getting this). The fact that you don't get 7-10 can be considered a downer.\n\nOther issues I had with this game is that the controls are not responsive enough. Right when you press a button you should move right away but in this version Mega Man takes a few extra miliseconds to move. For a game like Mega Man you are constantly jumping, moving and shooting; this makes the game harder than it used to be.\nI have had only 1 crash so far, it happened while I was looking at the leaderboards.\nThe last issue I has with this game is that you only get 1 save per game, not a huge issue but it would be nice to have extras if you mess up on the only save slot you got.\n\nNow if you have never played Mega Man before or you are a die hard fan of Mega Man, who would like or wouldn't mind the best representation of the classics, I would reccomend this game to you. If you are neither of those ignore this game and carry on.","August 26, 2015","true","21.9"," 35 of 53 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","35","53","2","16"

I love the challenge and frustration it provides.  This game fulfills its purpose wonderfully.  It preserved megaman with all the glitches perfectly.  I popped megaman 3 into my NES the other day to see what everyone was talking about with the input lag and when comparing the PC to the NES, I don't see any difference.\n\nThis is a fantastic port of 6 classic games and the challenges are fun as well.  I really like looking at the top of the leaderboards and seeing how close I can get.  Some of these people are ridiculously good.  There are a LOT of challenge missions (though you only unlock a few at a time) and while some have repetitive level sections, many of them are very creative.\n\nSome argue that the auto fire makes the game 2 easy and does not accurately represent the NES, but I remember having auto-fire controllers back then.\n\nMy only real gripe is that the game crashes randomly on me when I am looking at leaderboards.  If I try to find myself on the leaderboard it crashes everytime.  I was finally able to watch someone else's replay today without it crashing, so here's to hoping they are fixing bugs still.\n\nBUY THIS GAME TO SUPPORT YOUR FAVORITE BLUE BOMBER.\n\nNow all I want is for Capcom to make the Megaman X collection for PC with the inclusion of X7 and X8.\nWith all the Resident Evil rehashing, I don't think it would be too hard to do.  Just port X Collection to PC and change the menu interface to include the other 2 games.\n\nAlso make Megaman X9 and tie up the damn story.  Thanks.\n\nBut buy this game.  Seriously.

Rather, it simply packages together the first six  Mega Man  games from the old NES in their original 8-bit glory -- no gimmicky upgrades required. For anyone over, say, thirty years of age, this will be a most enjoyable trip down memory lane (except maybe for those damn disappearing/reappearing block sections). For you youngsters, get ready to experience near-perfection in platforming level design, as well as the best old-school video game soundtrack ever recorded.\n\nThe only change I noticed to the core gameplay is the ability to save your progress at any point, which spares players the annoyance of having to redo tricky platforming sections if they happen to die before reaching a checkpoint. Purists may whine that this makes the games too easy now (the  Mega Man  series was notorious for its difficulty back in the day), but there's an easy workaround for that:  don't use the save feature if you don't like it.  The old password-grid system is still in place if you really insist on keeping things totally retro.\n\nAside from the base games, there's a few extras tossed in, most notably the "challenge" mode. In it, players must complete a timed obstacle course comprised of various sections of the first six games, all linked together by warp zones. So for example, you may start out by having to defeat Cut Man; be instantly warped to a platforming section in Magnet Man's level if you defeat Cut Man; find yourself falling through the laser pit in Quick Man's level if you managed to beat the Magnet Man section; and so on, until you either reach the end of the course or run out of time. You're awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal depending on how quickly you reach the finish line. And of course there's the inevitable leaderboards for you competitive types who actually care about such things. Just a heads-up though, the top spots are obviously taken by cheaters who supposedly finished the challenge in one second.\n\nAlso included as an "extra" are production sketches for each game. The only interesting ones are the concept art of certain stages, as well as designs for unused Robot Masters. (There's not a ton of them, so don't get too excited).  Finally, each game comes with a jukebox if you can't get enough of those famously awesome  Mega Man  tunes. The best tracks (in my objectively correct opinion) are Metal Man's stage, followed by Dr. Wily's castle in  Mega Man II  and maybe Top Man's theme. Anyone who disagrees can fight me ;)\n\nAs for the games themselves, I enjoy all of them, but if you really forced me to rank them I would say  Mega Man II-IV  are stone cold classics;  V-VI  are enjoyable but ultimately forgettable; and  Mega Man I  gets by partially on historical significance, given how relatively clunky and riddled with cheap kills it is.\n\nOn a technical level, I initially had difficulty launching  Mega Man Legacy Collection  on my Windows 8 2013-era laptop, but after looking up a quick solution on the Steam forum (can't remember what it was now, I think I just had to delete some random file), it's worked like a charm ever since.\n\nBottom line: Most of the  Mega Man  games in this collection aren't just notable as nostalgia trips, they're timelessly great experiences and outshine many of the platformers of today. Highly recommended for veterans and newbies alike.","February 5","true","30.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","1"

This Mega Man Collection is not up to the standards you would come to expect from a company as experienced as Capcom. The first major issue is the noticeable slowdown. It somehow seems to run worse than it did from back on the NES. Most of us know and understand the limitations of the hardware back then, so we just dealt with it, but for a game released in 2015 this is unforgiveable. They claim that it is a faithful reproduction of the series' origins, but I highly doubt it. That would seem to imply that the games were remade to look like the classics, but the slowdown gives away that it is most likely just an emulated version of them. Nice try Capcom. For 15 dollars I would have expected much more from this collection.\n\nI am happy to see Capcom doing something with the license, even if they are probably done making any new MM games, but come on this is unacceptable. It has some nice features like the Museum of the era, which has nice artwork that reminds me of the old cartoon. They claim it is developed with an all new engine. If that is the case then just let me play it with their old engine because it probably ran a lot better. A bunch of nice extras does not make up for the horrendous framerate issue which kills the experience of such a legandary franchise. In the end, most fans would rather have the game run smooth with responsive controls, than a bunch of fluff.\n\nCome on Capcom, I still love the majority of your games and I know you can produce better than this.

Added comfort like turbo-fire and savestates are a nice addition - but the games are otherwise pretty much intact in the way they used to be, pause-tricks and glitches included.\n\nEach game is easily worth a couple of hours of playtime, especially if you have no experience with the series, on top of that you get the "challenges" which are basically small speedrun-missions inlcuding leaderboards and replays. Personally, I don't like 'em that much and don't think I will spend much time with them, speedrunning Mega Man feels kinda wrong to me - because I like to take my sweet time playing these games.\n\nApart from that, this whole set of games doesn't feel very "Legacy". After RARE Replay and the love and care that has been put into the presentation as well as all the background stuff that is crammed into that disc, the Mega Man Legacy collection feels pretty barebones. Sure, there are a bunch of artworks - but thats about it. I would have loved to see the various covers for the games from PAL and NTSC regions, commercials if there ever were any, maybe some background info by the devs explaining the thought-process behind the series. You know, I wished they had celebrated Mega Man as a character and long running game series a bit more - no matter what CAPCOMs beef with Inafune may be, Rockman is a part of CAPCOM that CAPCOM can and should be proud of.\n\nTalking about a bit more - just the first 6 games in a series that actually consists of 10 games (Rockman 1-10) and one spin-off (Rockman & Forte), the rare Mega Drive remake of Rockman 1-3 and the excellent 5 Game Boy episodes seems strangely incomplete. Eventhough later games in the series are considered to be of lesser quality, I still wouldn't mind them being in one, complete package. But who knows, maybe there will be additional downloads in the future to expand this - I definitely would pick up a bunch of more Mega Man titles.\n\nTo sum things up, even with the somewhat lacklustre presentation of it all - the games are rock(man) solid and still great fun to play - even the really early ones. At 14,99 it is a pretty good deal too (considering that buying the 6 games as loose Famicom carts will cost you 10 times as much money) - it's a no brainer, really - but it could have been more, something that really acknowledges Mega Man as an important character in videogame history and not just a fancy ROM collection. A bit of a missed opportunity there - but still, get it if you are in the mood for some quality oldschool entertainment.","September 6, 2015","true","17.4"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/camuserenity/recommended/363440/","camuserenity","camux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/camuserenity/","359 products in account","I wrote big ol' stinkin turd of a wall of text in the forums so I  might as well use that as my review for this collection.  I for one welcome the addition to Steam and I could *absolutely* care less about the politics involved.  The post was about whether or not Capcom rewrote any code or used emulation.  My answer to anyone complaining about that:  Yeah, its a big debate on how games should be played and emulated but for the most part we are given the chance to pay to own these games again no matter if you own the original carts.  +1 for the gamers.\n\nFor the Rockman games I seriously doubt that the original code would have been curated in pristine condition, with the machines used to compile it, after all these years. Yeah, it isn't too far fetched to believe the files aren't out there somewhere, but who the hell knows, the way developers chew through bodies and how things change hands especially considering how every single sprite on games like these could have its own unique copyright, all of them possibly being "owned" by somebody else.\n\nEmulation, as much criticism as it can endure, is probably in *everyone's* best interest. The only way actual, true, from the ground remakes could be viable is if they were included alongside the original rom. It HAS been done with other games but I'm just sayin... Tweak one tiny portion of any of the Megaman games, be it in how a jump is timed, how many enemies can spawn in one area, or how the glitches became "features" over time; the way they handled this collection is probably the best choice they could have made without turning each game into an individual multi-million dollar project. Which of course, would have then brought the price for each game well above the one we see on Steam now.\n\nKeeping up with my tangent, I own all of my original cart/cd games from when I was a kid. I got Megaman 1 in April 1987, the *only* gift I received for my 8th birthday. My dad always went out and tried to find the most "obscure" games, usually ones that video rental stores only kept one or two copies of, amidst the shelves full of games like Mario. Every game still works, with the exception of my copy of McKids for whatever reason. Anyway, in the 90's and early naughts I would always get the urge to hook up all my old systems to an old TV and play games like I experienced them when I was younger.\n\nOver the years, the nostalgia, the enjoyment took a serious, brutal hit. I do not enjoy doing that crap anymore. My kids don't care, and I won't be "that parent" that tries to force my childhood on them. Emulation has provided for a lot of advancements in streamlining how we access the games, and emulation got very good and became a very viable alternative to "the real thing" in the 90's.\n\nOne of my kids suddenly discovered Crystalis a while back, a link they clicked in some youtube comments, a site that had games emulated in a browser. My first reaction was to say "OH COOL HERE LET'S HOOK UP THE NINTENDO" but as soon as the words came out of my mouth I realized how ridiculous it was. Embellishing our memories with rose-tinted lenses might feel good to us because we miss how things felt when they were new, but expecting anyone else to pick up on those idiosyncrasies is beyond unfair.\n\nI'll throw money at Capcom, Nintendo, hell even Konami every time they do something like this because yep, it might be emulation, they might have slapped some new paint and sparkplugs in there, but they kept the sh*t the way its supposed to be. Absolutely the ONLY way we're going to get anywhere closer to the "real thing" is if we already own the heaps of plastic that still functions after almost 30 years. Or go on Ebay binges or whatever. I will always choose spending a few bucks on a collection of some roms packed into a flashy, tidy package, over remakes that always result in "re-imaginings" because 99.9% of the original team who made the games are either dead or working somewhere else. Without the founders of Rockman, Inafune and the team he worked with granted *total creative control* with explicit stipulations regarding mimicking rather than remaking, I really don't have a lot of faith in Capcom handling such a timeless series.\n\nOh and where the HELL is 8. I could care less about 7, but 8 man, my favorites list goes 3,4,2,6,5,8,1, with 7 taking a distant last...

I'll get the one nitpick out of the way first:  There seems to be a very bad crashing problem when viewing the Leaderboards after accessing them straight away from completing a challenge.  Encountered a crashing problem while starting up the game, but was remedied by restarting Steam.\n\nOnto the actual gameplay:  As far as I can tell, the controls are the exact same and behave the same as the cartridges I have sitting here right next to me.  Most of the input lag that people are experiencing may be first-timers or people who have seemed to forget that there are little silly control mechanics embedded in these games.  Like in Megaman 4, while in water you cannot jump out of a slide.  In Megaman 6, you cannot jump out of a slide at all.  Megaman 3 has awful lag issues, but it's always had that,  It can also eat you jump/megabuster if you press the button slightly before picking up a weapon energy or life capsule.   Say in Shadowman's stage, when you have to cross the ravine with the parachute bots coming from above, if you jump at the same time you kill them (say with Magnet Missle) and they drop a weapon energy that you then run into, it will eat your jump input and you will fall into the death pit.\n\nIt's just small things that some of us tend to forget after 20+ years of not playing these games.\n\nI have played around with challenge modes for a few hours, and they're an enjoyable little addition.  Great to hone in on your platforming skills.  I have also completed all 6 games start to finish and I cannot distinguish any greatly disparaging differences from the original titles.  They play 99% the same.\n\nI do not think the $15 price point is steep at all, considering the original games can cost you anywhere from the $15 itself, to upwards of $60 depending on where you look.\n\nPick it up, and fight for everlasting peace!","August 29, 2015","true","10.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flashman85/recommended/363440/","Flashman85","Flashman85","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flashman85/","49 products in account","While the Mega Man Legacy Collection is geared more toward new players than longtime fans, the amount of content you get is easily worth the price of admission.\n\nFirst off, you get six of the most celebrated games in the series. Everyone has their favorites, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a true fan who won't at least tolerate all the NES games, let alone absolutely love them. The games look, sound, and feel exactly as they do on the original hardware, with the added bonus of being able to save your game at any time (rather than writing down the password at the end of each stage). I've heard a few complaints about slowdown and controller lag, but after several hours of game time, I haven't experienced anything out of the ordinary.\n\nSecond, there is a database for each game that contains informative and amusing tidbits about the characters and enemies, along the lines of what you'll find in the Robot Master Field Guide or the CD database in Mega Man & Bass. Futhermore, each game has its own art gallery full of concept sketches and official illustrations, like a condensed version of the Mega Man: Official Complete Works book.\n\nThird, there is a music player that allows you to listen to any of the tunes from any of the games at any time. It would've been a nice touch to keep the selected music playing in the gallery and database modes, so that you're not forced to listen to a cover of Mega Man 3's good but incredibly short password music on infinite loop, but unfortunately this feature is really just a glorified sound test. Still, it's a welcome inclusion.\n\nFourth, the game offers more than 50 time-driven challenges that mash up various parts of the six games in the collection. This is the one area where the collection falls short, however. A few sections (for example, the moving platforms in the beginning of Guts Man's stage) are used over and over, while entire stages (most notably the various fortress stages) are almost completely absent. For as much replay value as the challenges offer, too much of it is tedious and redundant. Some of the challenges are well constructed, though; themed challenges such as the boss rushes and "All Appearing Blocks" are good fun, and there are others that really keep you on your toes by continually teleporting you into unexpected situations.\n\nFifth, the Achievements and leaderboards give you something extra to brag about. The Achievements are all very sensible and don't waste your time; you'll naturally unlock them all if you play through the six full games and finish all the challenges quickly enough.\n\nOverall, the Mega Man Legacy collection is an incredible value (especially considering that any one of its main attractions originally retailed for upwards of $50). It's a great introduction to the Mega Man series, and the clean presentation and semi-novelty of the challenge mode make the collection worth considering for any fan who already owns all there is to own.","September 9, 2015","true","15.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

MM Legacy Collection contains straight ports of the first 6 games in the original MM series (it does NOT contain MM VII & MM VIII as the GC MM Collection contained, nor does it contain IX or X).\nThe first issue I had was the game simply not working, only loading a black screen, I ended up finding the solution online, but since it appears to be an extremely common problem (judging by search results & forum posts), it's something that should be addressed by the developers.\nThat issue however was not my reason for requesting a refund (since the solution fixed that problem); what led me to request a refund was the fact that this collection does NOT work with a standard USB controller (I used the very same USB controller, a Buffalo SNES controller, on the Steam port of the remake of Final Fantasy IV just minutes before buying this collection, & the controller worked perfectly with that game).\n\nThe collection itself is not a terrible deal, 6 classic MM games for $15 (US) isn't terrible, though it would be nice if they included VII & VIII as the GC collection did, or if they wanted to stick to only 8-bit MM games, they could have included IX.\nHowever I cannot recommend this game because of the controller issue.

This collection doesn't just offer the games but also official artwork and the soundtracks to the games. Also included are challenge tasks, which are remixed portions of parts of the games that are (obviously) fairly challenging.\n\nAwesome features include a save system (the original games required a password system, which you could also use if you're feeling fairly retro) and filters if you want the game to look like it's being displayed on an old television set. I probably like the filters more than I should.\n\nThe games run just like they did on the NES, so you don't need to worry about that. Some may complain about the lag that occurs when multiple enemies appear on the screen, but that was a limitation of the original NES. The producers decided to keep the games as faithful to the originals, which was a good decision in my part. All the original glitches and bugs are also still included, which just add charm to these classic games\n\nThese games are far from impossible, but they definitely require some precision platforming and technique. Each boss can be defeated easily if you use his weakness against him, resulting in most of the difficulty coming from the platforming segments of each level. The games are fair and offer a simple, yet fun experience that anyone who doesn't suck can enjoy.\n\nWarning: You will be humming the tunes from the game to yourself for hours after playing any portion of this collection.

While it would be easy to say that Anniversary Collection is the better purchase because it has more games, gives you more options like fast weapon switch, and all that good stuff, it is also a game that’s not on Steam, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, nor the Nintendo 3DS. The game also has its own fair share of problems, such as the god-awful sound quality for example, so it’s not like either game is free of problems and why I’ll only exclusively look at Legacy Collection by itself.\n\n\nMega Man Legacy Collection is a game that’s torn me both ways on really liking certain things about it and hating others, as well as unfortunately being indifferent to most of it. The goal of Legacy Collection is to try and be as accurate to the original NES titles as possible, so it does not make the games lagless nor does it fix any graphical issues or glitches found in the original games like zipping. The game also includes extra content such as a museum of high resolution official and concept art for all six games and a challenge mode with leaderboards. The challenge mode consists of timed objectives to do that range from defeating Yellow Devil in Mega Man 1 to completing an assortment of sections from stages from each game in the Megamix challenges. The game doesn’t do much else aside from these kinds of extras and then just the games themselves, so let’s look at the good and bad things about Legacy Collection.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+Colors are bright and vibrant\n+Sound is really good, very crisp and clear (I swear there’s some instrumentation I hadn’t had heard before in some tracks)\n+Some of the Megamix challenges are actually pretty fun\n+Most of the border art looks fine\n+Concept art in museum is incredibly detailed and is interesting to look through\n+Database provides descriptions and weaknesses for enemies and bosses for all six games\n\nTHE BAD:\n-Only has native controller support for Xbox 360 pads (you would need to use something like JoyToKey if you want to use an NES controller through an adapter like I do)\n-No scans of each game’s manual in the museum\n-Noticeable input delay if you’ve played these games before (I’d guess around 1 to 3 frames)\n-Certain rooms are reused A LOT in challenge mode (Guts Man room 1 and Quick Man beam section is ridiculously overused in the MM1 and MM2 challenges) and some that are used don’t have anything going on besides just walking forward or climbing a ladder (one room used is near the end of Bomb Man’s level that only involves walking forward under two Flying Shell’s and then climbing a ladder)\n-Autofire is not authentic to the original games and makes challenges like Yellow Devil MK-II and Mecha Dragon way too easy\n-Main menu is very bugged and can improperly display everything to be white squares or can just randomly crash on startup if options were changed (this can be fixed by deleteing Options.sav under \AppData\Roaming\MegaMan\011000010009159F\)\n-Severe lack of basic options (only controller mapping for keyboard, no sound options or anything)\n\nAs a whole I can only give this game a recommendation if you’re someone who hasn’t played Mega Man and wants to do so on an officially released title. The input lag likely won’t be noticeable enough for it to ruin the experience and the games themselves are preserved well enough that you’d get an experience close to the original NES. For someone who has played these games countless times and wants something more, I can’t really recommend buying this game. Obviously the six games aren’t what you’d be looking for if you’ve played them again and with the added input delay you’re not going to get much out of playing them again on this. The challenge mode does provide some fun stuff to play through, but with the amount of them that are either boring or flat out not fun to play through I can only really recommend this game on a sale. The best implemented features in this game are the museum and the soundtracks for each game, but even at that $14.99 is too steep of a price to pay for this rahter lacking title. Hopefully with the release and sales of this game, Capcom can develop an original Mega Man title, but at this point I’m not really expecting anything. So as far as new Mega Man content goes, the challenge mode in this is likely as close as we’ll get for a while.","August 30, 2015","false","16.9"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","20","37","0","3"

WILLY!" before?\n\nMega Man rules.\n\nSince this got a mild amount of attention compared to my other actual reviews that, y'know, explain stuff, I feel like going into a little more detail...but there really isn't much to go into! Chances are, if you're looking at buying this, you've probably already played Mega Man or are familiar enough with the franchise, but here goes anyway...\n\nIt's the first six Mega Man games from the NES (with the Japanese Rock Man equals from a recent update) with an additional "challenge" mode with tasks like time-attacks and other special activities that, quite frankly, aren't particularly exciting.\n\nThe client is stable; I've never once had it crash or had any major hiccups while playing. Each game plays and controls splendedly; faithful to the NES (including those irritating slow-downs on Mega Man III when there's too much on screen). However, you do get a single save-state for each game which is incredibly abusable; I used it to oblivion and back when I was playing them for the first time in many years, but once you get back into the groove, you'll forget its even there.\n\nController support is flexible; both my PS3 controller and my Logitech F310 work perfectly and input is responsive.\n\nIn addition to the games, they come with all the concept art for all the characters and enemies for each game which is pretty cool to look through at least once and see the evolution of their designs, as well as the complete soundtracks for each game, which is nifty since we all know Mega Man has great tunes (my personal favorite being Top Man's Stage from MM3).\n\nThey also included Steam achievements and trading cards. Fancy that!\n\nIn the end though, it's definitely more for long-time fans of the series than anything else, but someone new to the series would still benefit from the experience.\n\nSuit up and (re)join the Blue Bomber in stomping Dr. Willy- er...Wily and his army of questionably-designed robots!...again!\n\nI also recommend checking out 20XX, an incredible Mega Man-inspired roguelike currently still in beta since, sadly, we probably wont see a new Mega Man or Mega Man X.","December 26, 2015","true","36.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","2"

Input lags, frame rate drops, sprites flickering, game exploits; all those were part of the original game and from the look of this, this game seems to be some short of emulator that runs the original games ROMS, making those issues legacy issues. I was expecting to encounter those legacy issues by purchasing this game. My primary intention of purchasing this game compilation was to be able to play the original 6 Mega Man games through legit means, but to also have access to its extra content and the Challenge Mode.\n\nThe critical issues that disappoint me are the ones from the compilation software itself, like the graphical issue that causes the game to show corrupted UI elements or even a blank screen, forcing the user to reboot their game’s application.\n\nThe game can even encounter stability issues with the game’s application causing it to crash by performing certain actions within the Leaderboard of the Challenge Mode.\n\nBut the issue that angers me the most is after completing all 6 Mega Man games the compilation offers, the user is unable to boot the game’s application anymore because the save file becomes corrupted, as if something was intended to be unlocked upon completing all the games but it is missing in the code and while the game attempts to boot, it crash due to the missing content. Though the cause of the crash is just an assumption and not the reason for the application to crash, but in the end the game’s application should crash and require the user to delete their save file to be able to play the game again.\n\nThe game also contain a few issues there and there with its new content like the Challenge Mode, like being able to be immortal by being not able to die due to damage inflected by enemies (though still being vulnerable to pitfalls and spikes). Though those issues are minor compared to the graphic issue and crashes.\n\nSome of those issues are obvious issues and none seems to be low occurrences, so most likely the Q.A. team that was assigned to test the Steam version of the game was aware about those issues and so was the development team. So even though those issues were most likely known, Capcom decided as the publisher to push this build to the general public, allowing the public to pay for something that was not deem ready for the market, to which it disappoint me a lot.\n\nIf you don’t mind the legacy issues from the original games, I highly suggest you to wait for the critical issues that are related to the game software and not to the core of the original 6 games are fixed. Otherwise you will be annoyed by having to handle those issues.","September 4, 2015","false","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This port has none of that, it all works just as it did on NES, slowdown, sprite-flickering and all. Although this shows how amazing the eclispe engine is, it would be great if slowdown and sprite-flickering could be turned on and off like in Mega Man 9, this is a very small gripe though.\n\nThe challenge mode is also a great bonus for this collection, it adds fresh, challenging gameplay for veterans while giving new players even more content than what's already here. It would have been nice though if some of it was more original, say with original level design akin to Mega Man: the Wily Wars, speaking of which, the Wily Tower would have been an amazing addition to this collection, or even a mode like the Wily Tower, allowing use of power-ups throughout all the Mega Man games to challenge newly made levels especially for this collection. As this is only a collection though, it's highly understandable why this isn't part of this.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic collection for both new and old fans alike, the emulation here is perfect and the challenge mode offers a new experience. I highly recommend this collection to anyone who loves Mega Man or wants to try it out, it's definitely worth the full price.\n\nI give this collection a 9/10.\n\nP.S. the Mega Man Anniversary Collection never released in Europe, so this was a long neeed release here","May 1","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So why would you want to buy them all over again?\n\nA good question. If you're not from Europe like I am, chances are you've played the Mega Man Anniversary Collection on PS2 or GameCube. That was a robust collection of all eight then-released Mega Man games plus two unlockable spin-off games. By comparison, Legacy Collection feels a little dissapointing when it comes to the number of games. This edition includes only the first six games in the classic Mega Man series, being the ones that were made for the NES console. The four sequels released on other systems, the most recent being 2010's Mega Man 10, are not included in this compilation. Anniversary Collection at least had 7 and 8.\n\nOne might argue that this re-release is a little cheap. With the split between Capcom and series creator Keiji Inafune, the Blue Bomber has been relegated to the side after being so wonderfully brought back to his roots just a couple of years ago. It's easy to see this compilation as a cheap way to keep fans happy. Making fans re-buy them will only happen you add something to the existing games.\n\nThankfully, it's not as bare-bones as just six games slapped together. This package has concept art, official artwork, playable soundtracks, and detailed descriptions for every enemy and character you encounter in each of the six games, which is sure to please long-time fans. Besides that, the main new attraction is a challenge mode that allows you to try and beat short sections of the games as quickly as possible in a Wario Ware or NES Remix-like fashion. It's a great way to add a modern spin on the familiar and it supports online leaderboards so even the most veteran Mega Man fans can see how good they really are in the grand scheme of it all.\n\nOther than that, you still have six games just brimming with 8-bit goodness. The classic NES graphics don't just hold up well on their own, but also look nice and crisp in HD. If you prefer a more nostalgic look, you can even turn on a filter that makes it look like you're playing on an old CRT TV. The game can be played with black or illustrated borders or you can go for the stretched-to-full look of old. It's all up to you.\n\nGameplay-wise, these old games hold up remarkably well. Controls are responsive and the games are faithfully ported to the PC. Even the glitch that allows you to cheat against Mega Man 1's Yellow Devil boss is present for old time's sake. Wether you are familiar with these games or not, you will have a blast as long as old-skool difficulties do not turn you off. The games are still as fun as ever and have just about enough diversity and depth to make you want to keep trying despite the serious challenge. Each boss is weak to another one's weapon. Finding out the correct order in which to beat them is a great mix of logic and trial-and-error. It's as good as it was over twenty years ago and as faithful of an experience, compared to the NES, as you will ever have.\n\nSometimes it's even a little too faithful, though. You still experience things like slowdown and sprite flickering if there's a lot of stuff on screen. While this may add to the authenticity of the games, I just can't understand why there's no option to at least turn it off. New players might be put off by this, which is sad as these games are otherwise not dated at all and still some of the deepest, most satisfying platform experiences out there.\n\nOverall though, it's still very easy to recommend this collection to anyone not familiar with Mega Man. Veterans really need to think about wether they feel the challengde mode and music/artwork extras are enough to keep them interested in games they have played to death. For those who may not have their old copies any longer, this is a fantastically affordable way to get them again. It's important to note that you can now save anywhere you want if you so desire, making the challenge a lot less meaty for those new players daunted by the difficulty of 80s and 90s gaming. If you're interested in getting into Mega Man for the first time, there is no better way to do so than by buying this for just fifteen bucks.\n\nThe biggest flaw is ultimately that the last four games aren't included in this package. I would very much appreciate if Capcom released these as well, either as DLC for this title or as a separate "Legacy Collection Vol.2". On its own, this collection may be lazy, but it's still a steal.","September 18, 2015","true","18.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

My best friend and I first connected by talking about Mega Man.  When Mega Man Legacy came out, I was hyped.  I bought it without question and immediately thought of my friend.  I love the Challenge Mode and found myself gaining more and more familiarity with beloved stages and gaining some for levels I had yet to play.  As of today, I beat Mega Man 2 and then Mega Man and have not yet lost entheusiasm for playing this collection.\nHonestly, I was never really That good at Mega Man.  I have only ever (until now) beaten Mega Man X (SNES) and Mega Man 2 (GB).  Most of my experience had been just watching.  Even though the screen glitches when too much junk is on it, I was brought back to the old NES days, and somehow became more than a watcher.  The Challenges made me step up my game and it paid off for actual games in the collection.  I am prepared to recommend this at the slightest suggestion of Mega Man, NES, the color blue, robots, power pellets or weapons.  Buy this.  Play this.  Share this.\n\nAs far as the actual game goes, it's a collection of old NES Mega Man games.  The graphics are the same, the playstyle is the same, the memories are the same.  If you've played any of the older games, you'll know what you're in for.  The biggest addition has to be Challenge Mode...which I mentioned way too much already.  If you don't want to plug in your Nintendo to play Mega Man, or use an emulator, this is a great package of the first 6 Mega Man games for you to play any time you want on your PC.  The games aren't easy now, but they weren't back then either.","September 2, 2015","true","17.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's basic run, jump, and shoot (from 3 onward, also slide) both in its infancy, but also somehow its finest. If you are new to Mega Man, this is a great place to start.\n\nIt should be important to note that it is the developer's intent to have the games play as they did on the NES. This includes slowdown, flicker, sound channel cut-outs, and glitches. (Some "original developer-unintended flicker" was resolved and a few copyright strings had to be changed, but 98%+ of this feels very accurate to how they played back on the NES!) This does not stop the games from being fun.\n\nThe earlier games are a little spottier in terms of keeping the difficulty curve roughly even across the stages, and sometimes the creativity in the later boss encounters can get a little too unrestrained. The latter games (4 onwards) smooth things out a lot - adding the ability to charge shots which mitigates the risk of picking a difficult boss without having their proper weakness - but at cost of feeling like there's less "wow" moments compared to earlier games.\n\nYou will skin your knees and fall into pits a lot, but you will learn. You'll get better, more skilled, more confident in how you move and how your weapons work. Somehow, Capcom made this game design work many times across the late 80's to early 90's, and the majority of them I'd say stand the test of time today even with the occasional hiccups in difficulty spikes.\n\nIf you are new to the games and don't want to risk going through tough stages to be trashed by bosses you are completely unprepared for, you can practice fighting the regular stage bosses with all weapons on hand as to best learn what works, and what route you will want to take when you play the games. This takes some edge off the earlier games' difficulty curve problems, and is otherwise a fun way to replay fights a player enjoyed.\n\nThe challenge mode is amazing in concept, but mostly functional in practice. The best part - when it's not crashing, this makes up my biggest problem with this whole package as it frequently does when navigating leaderboards - is the ability to view replays of people on leaderboards to learn new tricks for yourself to take into the main games! Death in this mode only slows you down by putting you at the start of the section you died at. Later challenges will frequently switch up which game you're playing and you have to frequently adjust to your changing toolsets according to which game you're now in for the next 15 seconds en route to the portal at the end. Unfortunately, certain sections feel like they repeat very readily, and sometimes the randomness of certain boss behaviors can inhibit the ability to achieve top scores (Mega Man 4 has quite a few bosses with invulnerability states they can trigger at will which mostly serve to just run up the clock, problematic in at least one challenge set).\n\nValue-wise, yes, some may argue certain collections released over 10 years ago give superior value for the buck, but they're for systems long off the market, and with numerous problems and flaws in their emulation.\n\nFor 15 US dollars, you're paying $2.50 a game, and that's before all the other added little features. I would say the recreation of these six games are the best seen, much much more faithful than the previous ports, and worth delving into as a primer to just why so many people fell in love with the blue bomber of yesteryear.\n\nThese are classics, and I'm happy to see them be commercially available on the PC so that it's easier for future generations to look back and see some of the formative years of the platformer genre. This is a well-constructed time capsule I would suggest anyone crack open if they ever needed a reminder of why Mega Man holds such high regard in gamers' hearts.","August 31, 2015","true","23.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I like the Megaman games, but this is a fairly awful job on Capcoms part.\n\nNo Contoller options - 360 pad or nothing, guys. As you probably are aware, it is atrocious for anything retro. Feels like there is a slight delay on the buttons too.\n\nReally bad framerate issues - This makes some heavily sprite populated areas almost impossible to do, it was bad on NES but here it feels absolutely abysmal.\n\nThe package itself is actually alright, there are some nice collections of music and concept art and even a challenge area that pits you against some selcted areas across all 6 games in the collection. All kind of pointless given that it plays like crap. Give me the abilty to use whatever pad i want, or at least one that is half decent, then i might change it to a thumbs up.\n\nUntil then, just play them wherever else you were playing them before...some of the games are tough enough without bad controls getting in the way.","September 14, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Here are a few facts everyone should know:\n\n-The NES cartridges have suffered remarkably from inflation, and aren't equipped with frustration pain killers (quick save features). Buy them if you want them. The controller is certainly more suitable.\n\n-The slowdown and flicker plagued our beloved Mega Man NES cartridges, too.\n\n-You have the choice to emulate. Use it if you choose it.\n\n-The Mega Man Anniversary Collection on GCN included Mega Man 7&8 and some sweet little JP only fighting games, but it also reversed the shoot and jump buttons for a crippling button layout. Regardless, it was a great collection and you can buy it.\n\n-Mega Man Legacy Collection doesn't include 9&10. It would have been better if it did, just like if it had also included 7,8, Mega Man & Bass, and the entire X and Zero collections.\n\n-Fifteen dollars is really not a lot of money, ya know? I've spent more for broken Early Access games. These are six of our favorite games of all time, with trophies, art, music, and challenges.\n\n-You may think Capcom sucks because of their recent business methods, or for their treatment of the Mega Man producer and product in the past. That doesn't mean this package sucks.\n\nhttp://zbrstreetgang.subdork.net/2015/08/lets-talk-about-mega-man-legacy.html","August 28, 2015","true","20.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Some of them are very difficult, making it very hard to achieve the best score. Overall, this is well worth the $15, in my opinion.

I was really hoping something among the lines of the original double trilogy being remade in the mm9/10 engines, but since when did capcom care about megaman eh?\n\n-The menus are a mess to work with, and the 3DS releases are mutch easier to load and save states on, not to mention portability of the titles and (in my opinion) better controls than the default ones. Without a proper controller I find megaman games to be a bit harder.\n\n-The added challenges are neat, as well as the scoreboards, but they didn't even do it in Powered up or Wily wars style by taking assets from the games to make a whole new stage, they just make you replay parts of the same game that were challenging. Very lazy indeed.\n\n\nIn my opinion, either get the 3DS releases (portability, easy savestating, but more expensive if you plan to take all the titles) or anniversary collection (a bit harder to come by, requires gamecube but muuuuutch more filled with content and games).\n\nI am disapoint capcom.","November 22, 2015","false","3.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It contains all 6 of the NES games in a very nice wrapper with meticulous emulation. This collection was developed by the newly revived Digital Eclipse, who have a stated focus of re-releasing older titles with a focus on accuracy and preservation. As their first effort, they did a bang up job here.\n\nThe emulation of the games is pixel perfect, including all the warts many NES games were famous for like lag and sprite flicker. The games run exactly as they did on the NES, for better and for worse. A variety of options are included to play them in different screen sizes (original, partially stretched and full widescreen stretched) and you can also add scanline filters and even a wavy RF modulator like filter if you're really nostalgic. Full keyboard and controller support are available and both work great and allow full button rebinding. There is game art to fill in the black bars if you aren't played in stretched mode but it isn't especially great and some of them are just creepy looking. Save states are also available but only one slot for each game which is weird. Multiple slots would be better.\n\nThe real value addition to this collection is the Challenge mode. A whopping 50 challenges are included, which are custom designed time attack gauntlets that will take you through a variety of small sections from all the different games. You are graded based on your completion time and full online leaderboards are available. Best of all, you can watch replays of any submitted leaderboard time, so you can watch some of the crazy speedruns that people have already done. Unfortunately, many of the challenges require that you complete previous ones not only to run them but even to see the leaderboards, which is a real bummer. I hope the ability to see leaderboards on all challenges gets patched in. These are great fun and made the somewhat hefty asking price of this collection much more worthwhile.\n\nUltimately, this is a fantastic and clearly lovingly crafted collection for Mega Man fans. However, if you weren't already a fan of the series or don't have an interest in retro games, this won't convert you. If you are one, the other or both though, this is a no brainer. The collection will also run on just about anything so if you want a great laptop game, you've found it here. Like Mega Man?

But upon playing this collection I must say I'm genuinely impressed the challenges are fun and creative and unique, the art books are a great addition, and the music player does the job well, but none of that matters if the core game has the same problems that the Game Cube collection has. So does it fix those problems?\n\nShort answer: yes, yes it does. The emulation using the new Eclipse engine is superb, the sounds are crisp, the visuals are clean and unlike the collection on Game Cube there is little to no input lag. Also unlike the Game Cube collection this is output into a beautiful 1080p HD signal that looks stellar on modern HD TVs.\n\nSo lastly, is it worth the 14.99 price tag? My answer is a resounding yes it has enough content to keep you playing for months, it looks great, and most of all it PLAYS great. the Mega Man Legacy Collection for PC gets my review of 9.8/10.I might even go so far as to say it's the best way to play the first 6 games in the series.

Presentation is fantastic, with a lovely aspect-corrected nearest neighbour mode; an even lovelier TV mode with a light dot crawl effect, scanlines, and a bit of motion blur; and just a regular scanline mode that basically looks like an RGB-modded NES running through an XRGB.\n\nFrom everything I read, it sounds like they put a lot of effort into getting it to be as accurate to the games running on an original NES as possible. To that effect, there's no emulator weirdness, you get all the flicker and slowdown you'd expect, the palette is completely accurate, and it sounds fantastic.\n\nNot much to say about the games themselves, because they're classics of the medium and among the best games ever made - at least the first three - and everyone who likes action games should play them. The latter three are technical showpieces that demonstrate the NES running at its absolute maximum capacity, but feel like they're starting to run out of steam.\n\nThe fact that this collection is only these games is fine, because these games ARE Megaman. The awkward late SNES/PSX years weren't kind on the little blue boy, so we're best left forgetting them. The only game I really wish was there was the triumphant return of classic Megaman, Megaman 9, but that does kind of exceed the scope of this collection. Wish there was a way to play Megaman 9 on the PC that doesn't involve ugly emulation through a Wii emulator, though...\n\nSupport classic rereleases that actually put effort into the presentation and accuracy of the games - buy this.","August 25, 2015","true","13.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Really regret purchasing this on GMG now, should have just gotten it on Steam so I could have done a refund.\n\nCapcom is covering their ♥♥♥ on the stuttering issues, saying that it's a 'faithful reproduction of the original game'. Well, the originals came out decades ago, the years are long past when stuttering should be acceptable.\n\nIt's a bit funny how they are so intrested in keeping this flaw in for faithfullness, yet are all the willing to add in HD upscaling which the original games lacked. And timed challenges. And leaderboards. And, well... You get my point, it's a 'faithful reproduction' minus all this stuff that the originals didn't have.\n\nWant to make it a faithful reproduction? Go right ahead and remove the stuttering, but add a option to reenable it. I'd bet almost no-one would enable that stuttering.\n\nMinus the completely uncecessary stuttering, the collection itself is decent. The addition of timed challenges and a music screen works well to flesh out the game to make is more then just a ported collection of old games.\n\nThe muesum section is a nice touch as well, featuring various artworks and concept arts - And looking closely, you can see how some of the older concepts inspire bosses seen in later games - though the later games have very thin pickings for the concepts section - The early 3 had a lot of boss concepts to look through in the concepts section, though the latter just get 4 stage concepts and nothing for bosses. A bit of a disappointment really.\n\nI've got a copy of the MM artbook, so the museum section is meh for me, and Youtube pretty much negates the benefit to the music section - And that even lets me put them on my ipod, which the music screen doesn't.\n\nOverall, the only two things that'd I'd recommend would be 1) Fixing the damn stuttering and 2) Adding soundtrack downloads as DLC.","August 31, 2015","false","18.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Other reviews are claiming it's a cash grab, or that it's a cheap version of the Anniversary Collection back over a decade ago, I want to elaborate that this game is Megaman 1-6 on a DIFFERENT ENGINE. Capcom designed an entire new engine and decided to port over Megaman 1-6, this means that's the reason why they didn't include Megaman 7, 8 or etc. Is this bad? Not at all.\n\nThis collection is an excellent collection of the classic 8-bit games that were on the NES. These are *NOT* emulated ports, these are the original games recreated on the NEW engine. This could mean Capcom is planning a Megaman revival soon, who knows. But I digress, this doesn't mean the game is bad. While yes, it may suffer from some input lag, it's nothing to fuss over. This game is an excellent addition to anyone who enjoyed the Megaman games from their childhood or anyone who's an entry level into the megaman series. The fact they included a remix mode and an online leaderboard really drives home for veterans of the series who are looking for a further challenge. In addition, the artwork and early sketches are a nice treat as well. There's not much I can say, other than the megaman games are hard, twitchy, side scrollingly fun!\n\nSo instead of looking at those bad reviews on people claiming how cheap or bad it is, consider it from a different perspective. You really can't go wrong with a $15 collection (About $2.50 per game) that's excellently ported over to a brand new engine that still feels like you're playing on an NES, and that's saying a lot since they totally could have just straight up emulated the games.","August 26, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

I had Mega Man 3-5 on my Wii, and I had beat them all. Each Mega Man game on the Wii's virtual console store is $5, yet I wasn't willing to pay another $10 to get 1 and 2. Also, they didn't even put Mega Man 6 on that store XD So I thought that I would just practice playing better with a wiimote. Now, I thought that on the Wii,  the flashes (e.g. Gravity Hold, Flash Stopper) were just changed to gray, but it turns out that all the colors were dimmed. I have no idea why, and I'm sure there's a fix, but I didn't feel like wasting my time looking up how to change it. I knew that the colors would be brighter on an emulator, but I had tried to download a ROM once, and I had to have my computer backed up and formatted, so that didn't work well. :P Then I learned about Mega Man Legacy Collection and I had to get it! I convinced my mom to let me buy it, and I tried it out. When I read comments that talk about input lag turtle-speed gameplay? I have no idea what they mean :P This game is perfect for any Mega Man fan that wants the original 6 games in full color without having to take a risk of using an emulator. Getting Mega Man 1-6 on a 3DS or a Wii U would be $30, yet here you can get them for $15 plus the database, museum, and challenge stuff. It's an amazing deal altogether!

My only gripe is that Capcom does not appear to have any intent of porting Mega Man 9 or Mega Man 10, which were both excellent games.

There are a couple minor bugs and issues with the game, some smaller than others, but the game came out 6 days ago, and luckily the dev team is actively patching it.

I think it's the only real catch here, and only you can answer that one.\n\nA bit more about the package you get:\n\n- 6 classic Mega Man adventures (but MM1 is a pain more than anything)\n- tight, responsive, flawless controls (if you disagree, remove V-Sync in game or put your TV on Game Mode; MM1 is a bit weird no matter what you do; and Christ don't use your keyboard)\n- arguably the best 8bit music ever composed (2 and 3 just keep rolling them out)\n- a couple of remixes in the main menu, rolling credits, game selection, etc. (not a whole lot compared to what you can get on Youtube)\n- non-stop action (I am not quite sure why they decided to go along with the NES slowdowns/blinking)\n- extremely diverse vistas and platform layouts (thank God there's only ElecMan that goes vertical in such an obnoxious fashion)\n- non-linear progression (although you often end up doing Robot Masters in a specific order)\n- rock/paper/scissors weapon system upgrades (they aren't created equal; some are better than others)\n- learn new tricks and make new friends (something fresh every title)\n- old school Easter eggs are still in (hold down "Shoot" and "Jump" when you select a Robot in MM2)\n- password decryption sheet you made as a kid still work 100% (I still had mine from MM2 and MM4 to confirm this)\n- save/load game feature (1 slot per game)\n- mutiple challenges with leaderboards and replays (apparently it can make the game crash, but I wouldn't know, never happened to me)\n- lots of media for every entry (think wikipedia and deviant art)\n- I have no idea what Capcom meant when they said "HD flair" (there's nothing HD in there)\n- super weird file architecture on your hard drive (Suzy folder? w.t.f.?)\n- obviously going to get more megaman games later as DLCs (because let's milk it)","August 31, 2015","true","22.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To this point, I've only played through the version of Mega Man 2 offered with this collection (it was the first game I ever beat by myself, so it seemed fitting to come back to it first), but everything's right where I expected it to be--and I'm not talking about level design or enemy placement (those are, I should mention, static).\n\nThe music has been reproduced to such a flawless degree that even the little "cuts" in sound production remain (particularly if MM's blaster overlaps several other sounds at once; call it a limitation of the NES hardware, but the fact that it's still there felt like a nice nod to my childhood).  Odd graphical hiccups remain (example: the Mega Man sprite "flashes" or turns transparent when standing between certain chain traps in Metal Man's level), but they were part and parcel of the cartridge edition of the game--and seeing them return feels less like laziness than it does like firing up my NES again (which works in fits and starts after almost thirty years in service, so I'm doubly grateful for this digital re-release; I've still got my old physical media, but its usable life is rapidly drawing to a close).\n\nThe TL;DR version is this: Yup, it's Mega Man.  I know many people possess these games through outside channels on the PC--and I'm not going to comment on that one way or another--but as an old time fan who still has his Mega Man 2 NES cart, this release feels like a love letter to childhood afternoons spent howling, "I JUMPED," at an uncaring TV screen--and it's well worth the cost of entry.","August 25, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This collection has the first six Mega Man games, and some fun extras on the side. A must for fans of classic Mega Man, but also good for people who like classic style hardcore games. If you thought Shovel Knight was fun and want more, welcome aboard.\n\nPros:\n-On top of the expected six games, there's an in-depth glossary of every enemy and boss from every game, including what weapons work best against them. There was some info even I didn't know about, and I've been playing these games for years!\n\n-Challenge mode is an interesting twist for Mega Man masters that want something new. Health and ammo carry over between different parts of a given challenge, even though they're from a variety of games. Ranging from a multi-level gauntlet from a variety of Mega Man games, or a boss rush of every Robot Master in the six games, there's plenty for hardcore fans to test their mettle against.\n\n-Soundtrack mode. Does what it says on the tin, but appreciated all the same.\n\n-Save States, allowing you to save and load anytime without relying on passwords. No shame in using them, they're there for a reason.\n\n-The six Mega Man games are still as solid as ever. With good level design and tight controls (Mega Man 1 nonwithstanding), it's sure to be a good time for platforming fans.\n\nCons:\n\n-Lack of options. You cannot change your screen resolution at all, there's no sprite smoothing option, there's Windowed or fullscreen, and a handful of cosmetic options. Having a screen filter that emulates old TV's and a arcade-style border to fill the black space is an ok tradeoff, but I'd rather have true fullscreen that doesn't stretch the game in odd ways.\n\n-Sprite Flickering you cannot turn off. This was all but necessary in the NES era, so that there's enough memory to render a lot of sprites at once. Some people like this because of nostalgia, but it does make some moments nearly impossible (See: Mega Dragon in MM2). Many emulators are capable of removing sprite flickering, the fact Capcom didn't is a bit lazy.\n\n-There are some truly unfair traps, especially in the endgame Wily Castle sections. Even vigilant save state usage can back you into a corner, forcing a reset. For the most part the games are a good time, but there are some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t challenges if you want to beat the games.\n\n-While Challenge Mode is a good feature, it's tailored almost exclusively to people who have memorized the first six Mega Man games. There's little to no description on what the goal of each challenge is, and no suggestions on how to beat them. On top of that, each challenge drops the player into different parts of each game, some of which having different gameplay (for instance, no sliding or charge shot in MM1+2, slightly different physics in MM1, different weapons in each game). Unless you already know every game front to back, you're gonna have a rough time in Challenge Mode.","December 6, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is an excellent collection of fantastic classic games with lots of neat bonus content, with the challenge mode in particular being my favorite thanks to the leaderboards. Besides that, this collection has a section where you can just listen to each game's soundtrack, which is pretty great since this has some of the best 8bit music on the NES.

Disappointing, maybe, but for fifteen bucks for these titles and a challenge mode, I'd say it's worth that price, especially if you're new to the Blue Bomber. Besides, these are the games most people hold so highly anyway, considering I generally hear 7, 8 and &Bass are looked down upon (I disagree with 7 and &Bass, but 8 can die). I'll cut the rambling now and go on to the Pros and Cons of this collection.\n\nPros:\n\nThe six NES Mega Man originals, preserved and in much higher quality and resolution compared to emulators or the NES for that matter.\n\nSwitching between games on the fly is a good feature, so props for the no-hassle menus.\n\nBoss practicing via Database.\n\nChallenge mode with leaderboards, prompting competition and replayability.\n\nFilters replicating an old '80s TV or a monitor.\n\nNo input lag unlike the Anniversary Collection! Quality > quantity.\n\nRetains the original funny misspellings like 'Wiley' and 'My scheme for world domination has faild!'\n\nFair price for all mentioned above plus the Museum and music player.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nCons:\n\nMonitor filter has a habit of causing all sprites to literally disappear in sections of Mega Man 1 and 2 with sprite flickering (namely, the Boobeam Trap).\n\nGames feel a little less responsive than they should be. A lot of times I find myself unable to jump over a wall while running into one. I could do so just fine when I played these games elsewhere.\n\nNo options to turn off sprite flickering and lag. I know these ports are supposed to be accurate to the original NES carts, but at the very least give people the option (I don't mind so much because purist).\n\nChallenge mode is, while a nice idea on paper, gets way too repetitive if challenges are played alongside one another in one single sitting. They tend to reuse a lot of sections like Air Man's annoying fan enemies with the birds or Guts Man's platform section.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThat said, this collection is definitive for newcomers interested in seeing what our robotic hero has to offer in what was his glory days. However, for a series vet like me, you're generally one of two things: 1. someone who already owns these games in another format and doesn't see a reason to buy this collection, or 2. someone who buys this because it's Mega Man and you love him that much (and I'm guilty of that. I bought the 3DS Collector's Edition version of this collection as well). In terms of the games themselves which is the main reason you probably even care about this, I'd give it a 9/10. Accurate to the originals in almost every aspect, and if you're not obsessed like I am you probably won't even notice those tiny things. It's worth picking up at some point, if not only for the novelty of these classics.","December 6, 2015","true","51.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It looks crisper than any emulator I've used, but don't trust what I'm saying because my hardware sucks and it might just be me. However, the games and ports themselves do run quite nicely, so that's always good.\n\n#2) Everything's there, you've got your Mega Man 1-6. And that's as much as you get there.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I personally can't complain about this game, as it's... just Mega Man 1-6 all in one nice package.\nLet's go over the games!!!\n\nMEGA MAN: It's... Well, Mega Man. You've got your 6 Robot Masters, and you've got Wily. Boom, the deed is done.\nFAVE WEAPON: It's a tie between Fire Man's weapon and Elec Man's weapon\nLEAST FAVORITE WEAPON: ♥♥♥♥ing hyper bomb stupid ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing weapon\n\nMEGA MAN 2: This is usually the one most people enamore. (did I even spell that right)\nIt's fast, it's pretty good, and the only parts I really outright despise are the ♥♥♥♥ing Wily 4 boss (AUGH WHY WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ MADE THAT THING) and the Wily 3 onwards theme, which I think is one of the worst themes in the entire game.\nThe music's pretty good, the weapons all have some use to them and nothing quite screams Hyper Bomb, so hey!!\n\nOh yeah, and Metal Blade OP. But you knew that. If you didn't know that, please stop living under a rock.\nFAVE WEAPON: Leaf Shield (look I can't put Metal Blade or someone'll kill me)\nLEAST FAVE WEAPON: AUGH CRASH BOMB ♥♥♥♥ OFF\n\nMEGA MAN 3: This one's pretty good. The difficulty isn't as high as Mega Man 2, bar... the ♥♥♥♥ing Doc Robots.\nLook, I love the idea, I hate the way they're handled. They're all way too enormous for their own good, and that doesn't help anybody. I don't like spamming boss weaknesses but look I DIDN'T LIKE 'EM\n\nBesides that, the endgame is pretty weak since the game was rushed but it's still a pretty good experience all around. Not my favorite, but it's pretty good. Music's all pretty nice, too.\n\n--------\nALRIGHT THIS IS WHERE SOMEONE TURNED UP THE ♥♥♥♥ DIAL\n--------\n\nMEGA MAN 4: It's not as good as the first three. Let's be honest. This one is probably my least favorite, and screams the most "eh." I didn't really love that many of the tracks, the bosses are pretty... okay who made Toad Man and why\nFAVE WEAPON: Toad Flush\nLEAST FAVE WEAPON: literally everything else\n\nMEGA MAN 5: mega buster op and the other weapons suck glhf\nFAVE WEAPON: power stone\nLEAST FAVE WEAPON: lol\n\nMEGA MAN 6: Probably the one you want to play if you're new. The robot masters are nothing too absurd (maybe centaur man...?), the weapons are at least mildly usable, the forms are pretty fun to use (jet form best), and the music's generally pretty alright. Definitely a good way to end Mega Man's presence on the NES.\nFAVE WEAPON: yamato spear\nLEAST FAVE WEAPON: lel blizzard attack\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Challenges are definitely my favorite part of the collection, and really require a different mindset while playing, as it promotes experimentation with weapons, or requires different things altogether.\n\nLearning that not all of the Mega Man 1 weapons are awful and can be used pretty easily was definitely pretty cool.\nIt definitely teaches you some cool moves, yo.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[SHOULD I BUY IT?]\n\nIf you're new to Mega Man, it's probably the best way to experience the classics, in all honesty.\nIf you're a seasoned vet, you'll like the challenges, but I'd pick it up if it's on sale.","December 8, 2015","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Using the quicksave features feels like cheating, and it is, but it is a great way to play the game if you want to just complete each game in quick bursts. Although I will be completing each game legit afterwards, I also enjoy viewing the numerous concept art pieces.\n\nThis is a great collection of really good classic games. They all offer a challenge and will keep you playing for hours. Not to mention, the music in all 6 games is incredible and memorable. All the bosses are fun to defeat, involving different abilities to deal more damage to each boss, and Megaman controls great in general. I love playing the games using the classic TV filter, as if I am playing on a 90s TV.\n\nYeah, get this collection, it's worth it.","March 16","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sadly they did not go the extra mile to remove slowdown like we saw in the Mega Man X Collection but that might not be a bad thing for purists.\nI love the encyclopedic section and how it tells you how much damage each enemy deals, takes and what weapon they're weak to. It came in really handy in teaching me more effective ways to get through each level.\nI did encounter a glitch after updating my NVidia drivers wherein the game starts up with a black screen\nwhile music plays in the background.\nLuckily, simply closing the game and restarting it fixes the issue but it does happen fairly often.","February 29","true","23.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And you know what?  I think it was.\n\nThe games are brutally difficult, as they've always been, but they're still pretty fun.  You don't get a purer run-n-gun game than Mega Man.  They were good in their hayday, and they're good now.  Plus the added challenges and bonus content make the $15 price tag a bit more palatable.\n\nThat being said, buyer beware.\n\nEvery single one of these games (and every other Mega Man game, for that matter), is avaible for free through piracy and ROMs.  Not that I support that kind of thing.  That's why I bought this, actually.  I've always said that if a game is more than 10 years old and hasn't been released to Steam, the developers clearly don't want my money and I'll... find other ways to play it.  That being said, Capcom DOES want my money, as they actually ported their old games to steam, which is something I love.  I'd eat my liver if I didn't stick to my own sayings.  But enough about that.\n\nJust know these two things; this is not the only (though it is the easiest) way to get these games, and the emulation is buggy.  I mean, seriously.  They're basically the exact same as they were in 19XX.  More than three entities on a screen?  Better slow the ♥♥♥♥ down.  Is it bad?  Yes.  Is it playable?  Also yes.  Although I do find it unacceptable that these games still run slow on today's machines, they play exactly as they did way back when (okay, I lied; I have played Mega Man before), which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Don't buy this game.\n\nFor one, and I was willing to\nsettle with this, there's only the first 6 megaman games. I wish there was more content with\nit.\n\nSecondly; The framerate is locked. It just feels so slow, the cartridges themselves could run\nthe game 2x faster with 60 frames *give or take with sprites*.\n\nThirdly; The games, for one reason or another, seem to be just...broken. For example I had\nissue where in Megaman II, I would be in Wily's Castle 1-1. At the end, you need to jump\non several blocks and escape a Metal Dragon. Megaman completely disappears from the\nfight and your left to pay attention to where he WAS in order to jump to the last three\nblocks to fight him. This also happened in 1-4 where you need to fight a room of blasters\nwith the crash bomb, you are left to get hit to where Mega's sprite hopefully shows up to\nfind where you are. This is just awful.\n\nLastly, and I regret to say this. It's just not worth my time to buy them in there current\ncondition. I'd rather take the 15 dollars I spent on this title and buy the last 3 Megaman games I don't own on my N-3DS-XL. I'd rather pay 5 dollars each game as long as I know they'll work.\n\nI'm completely disappointed with the QA that went into this compilation *if there was any*\nand I'm somewhat upset that steam would let the game stay on the store without telling\nCapcom to stop shoveling money into DLC and to actually take care of the games they\nrelease.

The games have played great for me so far.  Some players have stated problems, but it seems Digital Eclipse tried to maintain the true feel of playing these games on the original NES hardware.  The games slow down and flicker in the same spots and ways as they did on the original hardware and while emulating them on FCEU, NEStopia, and bNES on my rig.  I still play all of these games at least a few times a year and haven't noticed any real problems with this collection.  Full disclosure: I've got a pretty beefy setup including a GTX 980.\n\nNow that I'm done being overly defensive, this is a great collection.  Mega Man 1 - 6, plus tons of extra artwork, database of all robots, and an awesome Challenge mode.  I would have paid for this just for the Challenge Mode.

I beat them all yearly, whether it be on an emulator (NESDroid, FCEU) or the Wii VC or Anniversary Collection on PS2.  This year it will be this amazing collection.\n\n- Definitely the most accurate port yet, feels far more accurate than playing on a NES emu and even the anniversary collection.\n\n- Every glitch you've come to love or hate is in this port.  From the small glitched line in the MM3 stage select screen to the MM1 Yellow Devil glitch to all the slow downs, flashing and other aspects of this series in its early days.\n\n- No passwords.  You get state save instead.  Each game has ONE state save, just ONE, don't override it.  This is somewhat sad as I enjoyed my giant box of recipe cards that had all my MM passwords.  However can you imagine having a game release today that you had to write a password down on?  (River City Ransom passwords anyone).\n\n- Doubtful there will be any DLC for this release based on what I've seen so far.  It would be epic if they released MM9-10.  I can see MM7-8 never happening as each one would take as much effort as this whole Legacy Collection to release.\n\n- Sweet music remix... but only the main menu and some of the extras.  All the games appear to have their original soundtrack entirely intact.  I was secretly hoping for an option to have a remix soundtrack.\n\n- Controller support is great.  I am using a PS4 Controller on PC atm for its superior dpad.  XB1 controller likely a great choice.  XB360 with its notoriously bad dpad is not a good choice.  It supports keyboard but why on earth would anyone want to play this game with a keyboard!\n\n- Typical scaling and filtering options.\n\n- Typical extra fluff in these compilation games.  Art museum.  Listen to the original soundtrack.\n\n- Challenges!  and Achievements!  FInally show off how Mega you are.","August 25, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

I want to show support and interest for the series, though, and enough reviews convinced me to buy it. I'm glad I did.\n\nSo, technical stuff:\nAs others have noted, these games are recreated identically to their NES origins, warts and all. Honestly, Mega Man 1 is fun until Wily's castle, after which the amount of slowdown plagueing boss fights makes the save states almost a necessity. The same is true for MM2 in one fight, and the early games suffer from poor game design (weapon energy doesn't recharge between Wily stages, for example). Save states make up for this, but players who are unaware of these odd problems in the first two games may find them especially frustrating. I'm wondering if people have mistaken the slowdown for poor performance or software bugs. Given how rough it is in MM1, it's a questionable decision not to fix some of it.\n\nThat said - I experience no performance issues on my fairly low-end machine, and zero input lag. These games look and feel exactly as they did when I was 8 years old, which is great for me but may frustrate new players.\n\nThe monitor filter is great. Initially I didn't care for it, but once I got used to it, it looks exactly like my old tube TV did on NES games. I've hated these filters on emulators before but this one feels perfect.\n\nGiven there are a multitude of ways to purchase and play these games legitimately, this is certainly the best way to do so. At $5 a game on Virtual Console services, getting this package for essentially $2.50 per game on top of all the challenges is a great deal. Truly wish they included MM9-10 though, since they were done just like NES games.","August 29, 2015","true","17.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I don't think I have to mention that you can probably play these for free if you know how to use Google.  You're not just buying the games themselves; the challenge modes are a great time killer.  Being able to save is a nice feature, and a lot of the extras are fun to peruse through.\n\nThe only downside I can see is that it seems like the slowdown is a bit more severe than I remember it being on the carts.  Certain stages of the game slow to a crawl (especially in MM3) when there's a lot of activity on screen.  Whether it was in the original carts or not (I can't remember), it disrupts gameplay.  It would have been nice if they cleaned it up a bit seeing as these are being released 20+ years later.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it if you're a fan of the series or just enjoy solid platformers.","March 17","true","20.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

However this collection does a good job of recreating the games from the NES with some nice features, such as the challanges and official art galleries... but here are the things that I didn't like about it.\n\nUpon installing the game I was blasted in my headset with the loud menu music, and upn entering the game, I found no audio options at all. You need to use windows to turn down the game... Why did they not include this? Who knows.\n\nYou have the ability to save a game at any point and load a save at any time, similar to the save states in emulators or the game save on the 3DS versions of the megaman games. There is also an auto fire button that simulates those old turbo controllers. I find that while it makes the games easier, and you don't need to use them. I found myself using them anyways. I find that they make the game very easy, especially the auto fire button.\n\nWhile I realize these are fairly minor annoyances and complaints, I know some people will want to know about these before buying this. The games themselves are just as you remember them, and with some extra options, you can replicate that old TV you have in your parent's basement on your computer with a filter! I don't know why these old remakes feel the need to add that in to be honest... but reguardless. The jump n' and shoot n' are still there.\n\nTo sum it all up... It's Megaman... again. If you really want the first 6 Classic Megaman games on Steam then go ahead and buy this. It's definitaly compitent but other then the challenges and artwork, it doesnt do anything special.","August 25, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sqlkysely/recommended/363440/","sqlkysely","Humblebee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sqlkysely/","371 products in account","It should go without saying that Mega Man is one of those games that defined the action platformer genre back in the late 80's and early 90's. Though it doesn't seem like I've put many hours into this game here, trust me when I say that I've played and finished every game included in this set (1-6), 7, 9 and 10 (I never got the chance to play 8 unfortunately), and that these games are worth the current price of 15€.\n\nThere are extras included in this set, such as art, music and gameplay challenges. And while it does seem all well and good, it does feel like it was rushed a bit. The art isn't really categorized by any other way except which game it belongs to, a lot of the challenges are just small parts of the games put into a section that you have to clear, little things like these. They don't really take away from the experience, but they sort of make it seem like everything was rushed.\n\nThere are also some decisions made that I don't really agree with, such as autofire and having the ability to save your game at any point in the game and then being able to load it up pretty much any time you want. First of all, autofire is for wimps! Am I right? ... No? ... Ok, sorry. Second, I'm not entirely comfortable with being able to save and load at will, because you can just come up to a hard part, save, die and then load your game again like nothing happened. It sort of negates the reason why the Mega Man games had lives to begin with. Maybe if you used the saving system after every boss instead of the password system from 2-6, I'd be happy with it. But overall, I can't say that they're bad things to have. If anything, it will probably make more people enjoy the Mega Man series. Besides, they're entirely optional. If you want to play the games without saving or using autofire, you can choose to do so by not even acknowledging that they exist.\n\nIn conclusion, it's classic Mega Man with a built in autofire and the option to save and load your game at will, along with gameplay challenges, soundtrack and art. What's not to love?","August 25, 2015","true","5.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","1"

Oh wait, we get the Spike Bug in Megaman 1...\n2) Preserving Slowdown: I get that slowdown makes things more like their NES counterparts, but with the tagline: "8-bit style with HD flair" I would have liked a way to turn this off, as slowdown is never a fun experience to me when it comes to Megaman games.\n3) No Resolution Option: Playing in Fullscreen or Full-Window just locks the game to your monitor's resolution, Windowed Mode does allow you to drag the window to resize it, but it would be nice to have an actual resoultion option (would make recording video at the right resolution much easier)\n\nEven with these nitpicks, it's freaking Classic Megaman & honestly, this is the cripist the original 6 games have being, & the challenges throw a nice curveball into the mix.

I've never been a fan of them, for a multitude of reasons. When you think of games like Mega Man , you think of its difficulty. I, however, find the Mega Man series to be the perfect example of bad or "overrated" game design. The level design and enemy placement is all over the place. The vast majority of enemies don't really have an attack pattern and it's up to you to figure out a way to cheese them ultil they're dead. Unless you know the perfect order in which to engage each boss, you're pretty much done for. These games are nothing but exercises in repetition, linearity and frustration. On a more technical side, the games suffer from crippling slow-down, fps drops (GTX 970) and the audio quality is pretty bad as well. Unless you're a HARDCORE Mega Man fan and you're interested in the concept art, you're better off just emulating these games or just not bothering with them at all. There are much better modern indie games out there, like Braid, Ori and The Blind Forest and Shovel Knight.","August 27, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

(I recall one challenge having you move between levels in MM3, MM2 and MM4, while having only the Mega Buster, and your health being shared throughout.) -- While the Challenge Mode is not really all that NEW (other than your health being shared throughout the levels it puts you through, and the warp animation) - it still adds a nice touch to a collection which otherwise would have just been the 6 MM titles (with information about them too, including boss weaknesses which I find a bit odd)\n\nMy only REAL complaint is that in the challenges, it feels odd when you're in a MM3 level (with the ability to slide), getting teleported to a MM2/MM1 level and suddenly losing the ability to slide for the duration of the level. Sure, it makes SENSE, but.. y'know.\n\n* Apparently this was proved wrong okay, game's still great even if it is still emulation :V","August 25, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/recommended/363440/","NeoRizer","NeoRizer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/","368 products in account","Emotional nostalgia aside, Mega Man is a great series but is this collection worth the price of admission? Short answer,  no.\n\nI live in Canada, and the dollar is ♥♥♥♥ right now so this cost me 20 bucks... pretty ridiculous in all honesty considering I've had these games downloaded for almost 20 years now in ROM form and have beaten them multiple times. I've purchased these games multiple times over in digital and hard copy formats over the years and there's really nothing different about this version of the game.\n\nIt's essentially an emulator (built from the ground up, so you know that holds some kind of merit /sarcasm) with a fancy front end menu on it. For those who are unfamiliar with "front ends" they were basically just add-ons to emulators that made them look fancy and bogged down your system more than playing the actual game did. For example: Callus, the Capcom arcade emulator had a front end on it that would display the cabinet art instead of just boring old text when you wanted to choose a game to play... that's essentially what this collection is... An emulator with a nice front end on it... nothing more.\n\nThe achievements are insanely lacking, 1 achievement per game (beat the game) doesn't matter how you do it, weather you cheat and use save states, do a buster only run, a no death or damage run... whatever, just deliever the final blow to Wily in each game and achievement unlocked... so that's 6 games, with 1 achievement each... what a disappointment. No creativity went in to the making of this collection, and this is cold hard proof.\n\nHowever there's 24 achievements so where does that leave us with the other 18? Well... the newly tacked on remix / challenge mode. In this mode you run through random areas of each game spliced together or do full boss runs. This means, every single boss from every single game, back to back... like... why? This isn't even fun, or creative it's just boring and dumb... how many times is someone going to play this mode before losing their mind due to frustration?\n\nI'm severely disappointed, it had so much potential and it fell flat, not really sure what the developers were thinking but they don't know these games well enough to put in real achievements based on each game... like how about, not using the #2 Jet Item in Heat Mans stage? Like ever.... meaning you have to do that ridiculously long disappearing block section legit... wow, look at that, 1 solid, fun achievement for MM2.\n\nEven if they only did 4 achievements per game, I would of been satisfied. How about beat MM2 on Difficult mode? Or Beat Wily in MM3 without using the Search Snake? There's a fun one that might actually enlighten some people that there's two ways of beating Gamma in MM3... again, just not very well thought out.\n\nAlso MM1 is incredibly dated, it's such a basturd of a game I had no choice but to use save states and pause tricks to complete it... It's just such a lame MM game, obviously the prototype for a truely balanced game like MM2 and onwards.\n\nThe controls in the first MM game are also incredibly unresponsive, it doesn't actually start to really shine until MM3 when your gamepad feels like it actually works. Even though they built this engine from the ground up, it fixed nothing... the games are basically just emulated.\n\nIt's just unfortunate more MM games weren't added like MM7 and 8.... the biggest gripe I have about this collection is that it starts and ends with the two worst Mega Man games in the entire franchise... MM1 and MM6... so that's kind of a downer. I started playing MM1 and felt, my God this series has come such a long way since this garbage, I almost couldn't bare beating it, but I pushed through....\n\nKnowing that I have to trudge through the boring and lame MM6 for my final game just annoys the hell out of me, the music sucks, the game is boring and obnoxious because the level design is ♥♥♥♥. iI's basically just running through straight hallways until you fight a boss... there's literally nothing fun about MM6 at all... not even the music is good, none of it, it's horrible in comparison to MM1 - MM5.\n\nEither way, this collection starts out tough and ends on a bitter note but all the stuff in between is amazing, so it's kind of like an oreo cookie or something with a sugary filling inside... or you could look at it like two book ends... book ends are just book ends but the literature inbetween them, oh baby.\n\nSo in other words, you're paying for MM2, 3, 4 and 5.... and getting forced to play MM1 and MM6... We know no body likes those games... and those that do are in the minority and their opinions don't matter.\n\nI would of rather this collection ended it on MM7 or MM8 in all honesty, the tacked on challenge mode isn't going to do much for me but I'll definitely give it a whirl just to get my crappy medal achievements the dev's are forcing upon me.\n\nAll in all, I'd wait for a 50% off sale, it's not worth the cost if you already have these games downloaded.\n\nP.S. The save state system is such trash, emulators actually do it better. You only get 1 slot per game and it takes forever to save your postion, you should of just been able to hotkey save and load buttons to the controller (like the LT and RT - which by the way can't be mapped at all - LOL) I swear these programmers are just chimps looking to get paid.","August 25, 2015","false","12.9"," 121 of 258 people (47%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","47","121","258","19","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madolite/recommended/363440/","madolite","Madolite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madolite/","137 products in account","Shortly put, the Jump button in this game is adhorrently unresponsive, which alone says it all. Jumping is as important in Mega Man as stealth in Metal Gear or flying in Flight Simulator. And if such core mechanics won't work, you just can't shrug that off. It fundamentally breaks the game. Just imagine if you suddenly were unable to pick up blocks in Minecraft (in survival or creative mode, that is).\n\nFar too often, jumping doesn't even register. And the times it does, there's commonly a delay from when you press the button till you actually jump. These things make pixel-perfect edge jumping and similar almost impossible, and there's a plethora of situations in this game where jumping multiple times in a row and timing it correctly is key. And you can forget about speed running these games, as it stands now.\n\nMy Background:\n\nI've played these games on both the NES and through emulators, so this isn't about the games being too hard for me. Mega Man 2 is my most played-through game of all time - easily 200+ playthroughs, culminating in a 27-minute speed run. For the Mega Man Legacy Collection, I also happened to have a new keyboard (that works perfectly with every other game I have, old as well as new ones).\n\nIn MMLC's defense, I have NOT tested the game on a controller.\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nIf Capcom fixes the shoddy controls and makes the games feel properly responsive, you are in for an amazing game experience. The Mega Man series has some of the best NES games ever, and Mega Man 2 is, imo, the greatest NES game ever designed (from a level design perspective).\n\nThe fact that 7, 8 and 9 aren't included in this collection, is incidental IMO. Those games are barely worth playing - it's always been Mega Man 1 thru 5 that have been acclaimed as pinnacle titles, and I guess Mega Man 6 too. I can understand how the bigger fans would like 7, 8, 9 though - it makes the collection feel incomplete.\n\nIn either case, for my own sake, I just have to go with what I'm experiencing right now. And right now, I have very little good to say about the experience.\n\nBooh, CAPCOM. Please fix this!","August 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 22 of 52 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","22","52","0","0"

However there is Rockman Complete Works which is Mega Man 1-6 on orignal Playstation which only released in Japan. It's by far the best way to experience these games since it has remix music, play megaman without an helment , Change weapons with L&R Bumpers, fixes glitches & Slowndown which occurred on the NES version. It's sad that legacy collection has the orignal NES version in emulation. But after Mega Man Anniversary got released on GC PS2 & XBOX only here in the US which Atomic Planet the one who ported these games did a very poor job. Mega Man 1-3 did not had every remix soundtracks.\nProblem with GC version : lacks remix music since the storage on those disc. Reversed the controls which you jump with B button and shoot with the Huge A button.\nProblem with the PS2 version : runs these games on 240p and not 480i. no control mapping.\nProblem with the XBOX version :  the game crashes random point. unplayable on the XBOX 360 as it's backwards compatibility.\nTo Bad that Mega Man Legacy Collection lacks Mega Man 7(SNES),8(PS1),and the two arcade games that where unlockable  on the Mega Man Anniversary Collection if you beat every single Mega Man game.\nNot to mention ingnoring Mega Man & Bass (SNES,GBA) but also Mega Man 9 & 10 ( Wii Ware,PS3 & XBOX 360)\n\nBut overall this the legit way to get Mega Man 1-6 on PC plus it has challenge mode.

Blowing them up and taking their special powers for personal use? Even better. Such is the premise of the Megaman series- a system that has influenced game design since its launch in 1987 (and which I remember playing on a console a year later, when I was six. I feel rather old at that realization).\n\nThe premise is rather simple- take the first bunch of stages in any order, amassing a pile of special weapons to take down the evil Dr. Wily and save the world from his latest evil scheme (yeah, it's safe to assume he doesn't really have a hobby) by blasting through Skull Castle . While the full Megaman series consists of several different games spread over how many consoles and time periods, this collection contains only a small slice of all that- for fifteen bucks retail, you get a pretty decent selection: the first six games of the main Megaman series, which were all released on the eight-bit Nintendo Entertainment System over a period of time from 1987 to 1994. You also get some behind-the-scenes stuff, like enemy backgrounds art assets and sketches, as well as the soundtracks to the six games (trust me, you'll run into plenty of earworm-type songs in these games) but I honestly don't understand why you'd include a music player when you could just fire up YouTube and listen to them there without having to go and boot Steam.\n\nYou also get a challenge mode- which shows lots of influence from a series of fangames that just throw you into sections from random levels and see how far you can get. This is actually rather fun- your powers are determined by which game you land in, and you get four E-Tanks to sustain you through the sequence, and you're scored on time taken. This forces you to think on your toes and use your memory to try and think of all your options at the current time.\n\nThere's a save system- you get one save point for each game that you can use to save at any point- just go into the menu, save, and it will allow you to load the game and pick up at that exact point. It's useful for when you're at the end of a level on your last life, and don't desire to play the level again.\n\nThis is also one of the only legitimate ways to get copies of these games outside of A) owning the original cartridges, B) buying the Megaman Anniversary Collection, or C) buying them off of Nintendo's Shop Channels (1 to 5 are on the Wii Shop channel, 6 is on the Wii U and 3DS shop channel). But that, well... leads into a bit of the downside to this collection.\n\nWhy is this only the first six games? There are ten in the main series alone, and you've got the main series, the X series, the Legends series... why not just tweak the Anniversary Collection and release that and ask twenty or twenty-five for it? Follow it up with the X Collection and the Legends games and you have a great way to reach another generation of gamers through Steam. Also, why no Wily Wars?\n\nAll of the games enclosed within are faithfully emulated, down to the screen flicker and original bugs and easter eggs (the Elec Beam/pause trick still works in the first game, and you can still get the Rush Jet in 3 without having to earn it if you know the trick). However, that means the sprite flicker and slowdown is in there, too.\n\nThe early games- especially the first game- are genuine Nintendo hard. The most obvious examples of this are Yellow Devil Mk. I and Wily Machine I, both of which will make you rage if this is your first time through a Megaman game. (They still give me fits, and I've been playing them for years.)\n\nThere are good and bad parts to these games, but in the end... yeah, I enjoyed it.\n\nI'm still mixed about the price- fifteen sounds a little expensive, and the cheapskate on my shoulder keeps telling me that this ought to be ten (when he's not off viciously mauling the few slices of pizza I intended on having for dinner)... and I'm inclined to believe him.\n\nTL;DR: It's a nice solid title, but nothing to really write home about. Wait for a sale for a decent deal and grab it for ten at the most. 7/10.","February 13","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/recommended/363440/","Dracaerys","Night Druid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/","282 products in account","A classic remake for a classic game!\nIt's no secret that I love Mega Man almost as much as I love Sonic the hedgehog. Despite the fact that Capcom hasn't given Mega Man any love in the past few years, it's still my favourite series.\nOne day, I'd like to see Mega Man and his alternate Net Navi counterpart return to glory.\n\nWhile the Mega Man Legacy Collection wasn't everything I was looking for, it's better than plugging your vastly outdated NES in to either your smart TV or an old fashioned CRT television and watching the chaos ensue as you attempt to get the game to even run...\n\n\nWhat is Mega Man / Rockman: Legact Collection?\nSo what exactly is in the Legacy Collection? Well, it's a package that includes the six original NES games, as well as a few digital upgrades and extras.\n\nI know it sounds like a very simple port, but the games truly benefit from their digital enhancements.\nEvery game has the option of three aspect ratios (original, wide, and full), as well as two additional visual filters meant to replicate old CRT TVs and monitors.\n\nThat's basically all you get in terms of mixing up the games from the way they were originally presented.\nThat is, unless you count the "Remix mode" which I'll discuss later.\n\nEmulation or re-design...?\nThe key mantra from Digital Eclipse is "if it ain't broke don't fix it," which is going to be a rather polarizing choice for many gamers out there that never grew up with Mega Man.\n\nPersonally, having grown up with the NES, I'm completely okay with things like slowdown effects and choppy, warped visuals to emulate the look of an NES release.\nYep, that's right!  The developers have opted to retain the original look and feel of the games, for better or for worse.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you won't find any quality of life improvements, such as the ability to switch between subweapons with the triggers which was a feature from the PSOne Classic re-releases a few generations ago.\nIn case you're wondering, yes, the Elec-Man subweapon pause glitch found on the original NES cartridge still works.\n\nMega cool extras!\nThere are some nice extras that can be found in the game, like a music player that features every original sound track from all six games, and a hefty database mode, which showcases artwork and concept art for every enemy in the game. It's all old archive material that exists in some developers’ artbook somewhere, but it's still nice to be able to flip through it all in one centralized location.\nOne really cool feature of the archive is the ability to instantly fight any Robot Master at will from the menu screen, with every weapon from that game at your disposal.\nIt's a nice little throw back for players that enjoy the boss battles, mirroring the arcade CPS2 Mega Man games in their Boss battle only approach to gameplay.\n\nFrom NES to PC Ok, so onto Mega Man 1-6 how do they hold up? Quite well, actually...\nThe original Mega Man is a bit rough at times with some haphazard level design, bad enemy placement and off screen enemies being able to shoot you. However, these complaints are just as valid to the original game as this version.\nIn fact, with a few exceptions, the game is a pixel perfect replica of the original game.\nThe Blue Bomber seal of quality is immediately apparent upon progressing to the second game and of course, the third, which is my personal favourite of the original games.\nWhile I did feel the burn with Mega Man 4 and 5 due to a lack of innovation, I enjoyed them all the same, and Mega Man 6 wowed me, just as it did when I was younger, with just how clean and interesting the game generally is.\n\nMy view on the stalwart commitment to the "originals" is mixed, but ultimately extremely positive.\nWhile it would have been nice to possibly play a remixed edition separately with more modern options, every game is a classic in its own way, even when you're looking at it almost 22+ years later, free of the tint of nostalgia goggles.\n\nIf you're feeling finicky and want to switch between games, however, it takes seconds to do so with the highly responsive menus, and save states are available for each game alongside old school password support.\n\nThe completionist Challenge!\nFor completionists, 50 challenges exist to test your Jumping and Shooting skills, accessible by way of a standalone mode.\nWhile most of the challenges are pretty standard like timed boss rush modes, they also have remixes, which function like obstacle courses of sorts.\nThe game will task you with getting through 15-30 second bite-sized pieces of existing levels, complete with a portal at the end, which brings you to another mini-section. It's addicting, as the game forces you to constantly rethink your strategy, and sometimes hilariously drops you into a sticky situation, like the beam section in Quick Man's stage.\nTo make things even better, multi-game remixes are unlocked later on, which require you to deal with taking on successive areas from multiple games. It's crazy jumping from title to title, as I would often forget that certain experiences didn't have sliding or charged shot capabilities.\nGetting a respectable clear time will definitely test the mettle of even the most seasoned Mega Man players out there.\n\nCompetetive play The game is a love letter to the fans from Capcom, The game even comes complete with leaderboard support, so you can see how you rank up against your friends and the world. I've already started a friendly little competition with a few of my friends, and I think I'm going to get addicted to this feature all over again, just like I did with Mega Man 9.\nI'm interested to see the top times from players all around the world, and this is a truly great way to unite Mega Man fans old and new.\n\n\nVerdict\nAfter booting the game up I was inspired to beat all six games again and work on the challenges, so the Mega Man Legacy Collection did its job. I'd really like to see more Legacy packs down the line from Capcom, such as a Battle Network Legacy collection, with a bit more bravado in terms of extras and alternate modes of play.  Mega Man Legacy collection offers a thoroughly enjoyable nostalgia trip through Mega Man’s gaming past.  I recommend it, both for Mega Man veterans and those new to the Blue Bomber’s legendary legacy.\n\nScore:\n10 / 10","February 14","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy platforming that you can run through, jump on things, and generally have that "fun" thing; look elsewhere. Mega Man 2 is easier, and by default more fun. Start with that, not the first game. I'm kinda of having some fun with these games, but in a sort of twisted way. These games were clearly not designed to be enjoyed normally; but only to be enjoyed by gamers who love having pain inflicted on them at every turn\n\nI'm not sure if the early Mega Man games are the worst case of game design ever shown in platform games; or if they are secret evil genius designed to be enjoyable to a super niche audience of self-appointed elite platform game lovers who want to get in a d*** measuring contest to see who can somehow get through the most challenging stages.\n\nThink Super Mario Brothers VS The Lost Levels. The first game is fun, the second game is everything you loved about the first game turned around to kill you and make you hate your very childhood. Mega Man feels like everything you love about platforming games turned super nutso evil on your ♥♥♥.\n\nThis is a game collection you buy for the challenge, not for any sort of fun. That might sound harsh, but don't get this if you want a fun platforming game. I can only beat levels on Mega Man 2. I can't even get anywhere on any of the others games. I am 26 years old, and have played and beat Mario games sense I was 3 or 4 years old.","August 27, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You still have to buy 7 & Bass from the Virtual Console (if you have a Wii U), 9 & 10 on the last-gen systems and (most crushingly of all) 8 on the PSX. So that sucks.\n\nThe aforemetioned game selection also isn't that great. I mean, Megaman 2 and Megaman 3 are, as always, amazing. But Megaman 1 is still kinda "meh" as are the other three games.\n\nIf you like Megaman or want to get into the classic series, this is a great place to start. If you already own copies of MM2 and 3 elsewhere, I can't say I reccomend it. Overall, as someone who was introduced to classic Megaman through this collection, I think it's great.

It's been along time since I had the drive to play through these classic games and oh man does this collection make me never want to stop. As far as recreations of these games go, this is the most faithful reproduction of the original game experience I have seen. The slowdown is there, every little flickering sprite glitch is remade in crisp 8-bit. If you dont like the crispness they have a couple filters to simulate the blur of a CRT which gave me some instant feelings of nostalgia. Outside of the games there is a good amount of production and concept art to look through for each game, there is a music player where you can listen to every song in the game, and then there is a challenge mode. The challenge mode reminds me a bit of NES Remix in that it mixes and reorganizes the games in different, more bite size ways to play. There are around 50 challenges I belive. Every challenge keeps track of your time and there are online leaderboards where you can see how you line up against other mega man players. If you just want to practice and get good at mega man as a genre, this is a cool way to learn and push yourself. I would say, I reccomend the PC version over the console versions, purley because of the display lag inherint in most modern TV's. I have also been playing on my PS4 and it is absurd how much better the games feel when I play them on the PC. The tightness of the controls really starts to shine, something I havnt felt since I played these games all thoose years ago. Overall it is well worth the 15$ to play through these games again and bring foward this formative time in video game design to a modern audience.","August 26, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TechnoWolf/recommended/363440/","TechnoWolf","Tekker_Fenrir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TechnoWolf/","294 products in account","- Graphics :\n\nIt's 8-bit with "HD flair" ; their HD is apparently a ninja HD because I wasn't able to see it. What's the point in saying "HD" if you plan to make an 8-bit game AND keep the flaws of the original NES games anyway... I should have a talk with Capcom & Digital Eclipse Marketing Division one day...\n\nAnyway : this is what you'd expect from these six megaman games : your nice colors from before, your nice level design from before, your nice glitches & slowdowns from before.\n\n- Sound & Musics :\n\nThe same musics than before as well. If you never played Megaman before (well first : where the hell have you been, people ?), and secondly, one word to describe them : AWESOME. Megaman's music is considered to be a monument to 8-bit rock, so if you're into the chiptunes & never played Megaman before, go for it........ or buy Rockman Soundbox...?\n\n- Gameplay :\n\nIt's jump & shoot man : you jump to avoid enemies, hazards or bottomless pits, and shoot to kill enemies. Beating a boss will grant you its power, so you can take down another boss more easily. No changes have been made in the gameplay.\n\n- Storytelling :\n\n...\n\n...\n\nIt's a guy who wants to stop an evil Dr. from taking over the world and turns into a blue robot. What more could you possibly want ? Shakespearian.\n\n- Length :\n\nMegaman games are short by their very nature, these six games can be dealt with in an hour each if you know what you're doing. Then there's the challenge that supposedly add more replay value, and the art you have to unlock. So for its price, I'd say it's not bad.\n\n... When I released my review of Mighty Switch Force : I said the game was good but lacking in content for its price. I see now a game that has a lot of nice content, but that's two decades ago... so I kinda shot myself in the foot, there....\n\nCONCLUSION :\n\n"We wanted to show the game at its original state" => that is more or less the philosophy Digital Eclipse had when they released this collection. I'd be enclined to disagree, but I can't help but notice how negatively people are responding to the actual look of Mighty N°9 (you know, the so-called successor to Megaman), which is a mix with old megaman style & new graphical look with tons of stuff in the background so a larger audience can be touched... so I'm not sure what to trust anymore on this subject... or maybe it's the megaman fanbase who's very conservative.... I don't know.\n\nNethertheless : Megaman has often been described as viable ONLY in 8-bit, yet this collection could make you want to play a full HD remaster of a megaman game (that would be Megaman 2 and would be developped by WayForward , right ...? Capcom ? Capcom ? Capcom ? Capcom ? Capcom ? Capcom ?........)\n\nAnyway : if you're really into the Megaman, why not ; if you never played Megaman before, it could be a nice way for you to get into it ; if you're not into Megaman & don't really care... well no, go play some more Shovel Knight.\n\n...

You get the 5 NES games as straight ports, (Meaning slow down and flicker retained, and probably the original glitches) a music player that lets you play any track in the game, and gallery of all the manual art and some concept sketches. All of these are accesible by simple menus, unlike that horrid Gamecube collection from way back.\n\nYou can select screen filters and the size of the screen (Normal, fill, and ugly widescreen). All around, it's a pretty great deal for $15. That's less than I paid to get them on the Wii! I'm a big Mega Man fan who missed the first three games at retail but constantly rented them, so I'm always glad for a chance to get them on a new system, even if they were $30.\n\nSome people have mentioned having bugs. I don't have the input lag at all, but my friend did. I got the blank screen only once so far. So it seems these bugs might be hardware related. So you might want to wait and see if it gets patched. Or take the gamble and buy it now. I had no problems with either the keyboard or my cheap logitech controller.","August 26, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But you know why you'd buy this game: you want to play Mega Man 1-6 on your PC with the convenience of Steam and x-input controllers.

I have a Mega Man tattoo (he's jumping and shooting in all of his blue bomber 8 bit glory), I have keychains, I have all of the original cartridges and boxes-- I'm very into Mega Man.  Ever since I was a kid I was super into these games.  I always associated my love for the series with me imagining that I was Mega Man as a kid while playing.  He's this little white kid and I could relate to being a little white kid when I was 4 - 7 (I started my journey to being fat at 8).  But now that I gave you a little back story as to how much I love Mega Man, let's get into why I love the Legacy Collection and the one main issue I have with it.\n\nFirst of all, you're getting 6 of some of the most creative and frustrating games, albeit tons of fun, that have ever been made in all of it's HD 8 bit sexiness.  That alone should be worth the 15 bucks you're forking over for a copy.  But what really blew me away about this collection is that you can put a graphics filter on while you're playing that makes it look like you're playing on a tube television.  and it is AUTHENTIC.  I was geeking out so hard on all the nostalgia that was happening when I found this function.  It was like I rediscovered how you should experience Mega Man.  Sure, it takes away from the HD perk of the games.  But who cares?  Some, probably.  But not me.  I'd much rather have the option to play my Mega Man games in crisp HD or with all the blemishes and ghost lines of an old tube tv.  So that really made me legitimately blissfully happy.\nAnother reason as to why you should buy this collection are the remix challenges.  I'm not going to lie, when I first started the challenges I was a little lackluster about them.  I was hoping you could play like your own version of Mega Man games by, say, playing Ice Man's stage and then after beating him you'd go to like... Heat Man's stage or something along those lines.  Like mixing up the robot bosses.  That isn't what you get at first.  BUT.  The more and more you unlock the challenges, the closer to that reality you get and the challenges become much more fun the more you complete them.\nThere are so many added goodies and functions that I probably would have paid 25 dollars for this collection of 25+ year old games.  But I do have a complaint.  It's not HUGE... but it certainly is frustrating.\n\n...\n\nI hate saying anything bad about anything Mega Man.  But this collection sometimes isn't the most responsive with the controls.  And it's not like "oh, it's just cause it's a NES game."  No.  It's really not.  I've played all 6 of these games and beaten them countless times and the lagging issue in this game is not found in the original cartridges.  What I mean by lagging is sometimes if you want to move forward... it just won't move.  Does this happen often?  Lord no.  But does it happen?  Yes.  Will it make you want to throw your controller at the wall?  Most definitely.\n\nBUT IN SAYING THAT...\n\nI would not dismiss picking this package up solely based on that.  Enjoy revisiting these games and reclaiming a bit of that spark you felt when playing these as a little kid who looked up to Mega Man.  I sure did.","September 6, 2015","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I think it is a great way to play the frist 6 games but a version on a inferior console has more content. I think this version should of had all of the main series Megaman games (7,8,9 and 10).

I grew up on these games and this collection is heart breaking.  A post title "Fixes Forthcoming" was posted in August (3 months ago) and there hasn't been any communication since.  A port of the Anniversary edition would have been a better fit for this platform.\n\nPros:\nLegal way to play MM on the PC\nMM 1-6 preserved well\nGreat challenge modes\nMusic player\nMess ton of concept art and character info\n\nCons:\nTitle screen music is incredibly loud compared to the sound effects of going through the menu.\nBlank screen on load occasionally\nCloud Save doesn't work (or atleast for me)\nCan't use my USB Nes controller on the game.\nNot able to reconnect my controller in game if battery dies or looses connectivity. Must restart game.\nIn game save method negates the need for in game lives.  Saving often and reloading removes most of the challenges in the game.  I think you should only be allowed to save in between levels.\nTurbo button fires way too fast and removes a lot of challenge from the game.  Devs said most people that had an NES used turbo controllers.  I never had one that could shoot this fast.\nLeaderboards have been hacked\nNo soundtrack available to buy\n\nI'd really like to see the ability to disable the NES Emulation and plug in a few features from the anniversary edition.","September 3, 2015","false","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never got the chance to play these classic games, they are $5 each on Nintendo eShop, but clearly this is the much better deal. Apparently some people experience input lag, but I haven't at all. There is slowdown and sprite flickering, which is part of the original games on the NES. Therefore, it is not a bad port or emulation, since it plays exactly like the NES.\n\nIn addition, you get a mission mode which I haven't played much of yet (still playing through the games first), but what I tried was a very cool remix of all the stages from Mega Man 1. My only complaint is that there is no actual widescreen feature as advertised. The widescreen simply stretches the picture, which looks awful.\n\nOverall, buy this especially if you never played these games. They are pretty difficult, but there is a built in save-state feature so you will not need to start over every time you mess up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/recommended/363440/","Dracaerys","Night Druid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/","282 products in account","A classic remake for a classic game!\nIt's no secret that I love Mega Man almost as much as I love Sonic the hedgehog. Despite the fact that Capcom hasn't given Mega Man any love in the past few years, it's still my favourite series.\nOne day, I'd like to see Mega Man and his alternate Net Navi counterpart return to glory.\n\nWhile the Mega Man Legacy Collection wasn't everything I was looking for, it's better than plugging your vastly outdated NES in to either your smart TV or an old fashioned CRT television and watching the chaos ensue as you attempt to get the game to even run...\n\n\nWhat is Mega Man / Rockman: Legact Collection?\nSo what exactly is in the Legacy Collection? Well, it's a package that includes the six original NES games, as well as a few digital upgrades and extras.\n\nI know it sounds like a very simple port, but the games truly benefit from their digital enhancements.\nEvery game has the option of three aspect ratios (original, wide, and full), as well as two additional visual filters meant to replicate old CRT TVs and monitors.\n\nThat's basically all you get in terms of mixing up the games from the way they were originally presented.\nThat is, unless you count the "Remix mode" which I'll discuss later.\n\nEmulation or re-design...?\nThe key mantra from Digital Eclipse is "if it ain't broke don't fix it," which is going to be a rather polarizing choice for many gamers out there that never grew up with Mega Man.\n\nPersonally, having grown up with the NES, I'm completely okay with things like slowdown effects and choppy, warped visuals to emulate the look of an NES release.\nYep, that's right!  The developers have opted to retain the original look and feel of the games, for better or for worse.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you won't find any quality of life improvements, such as the ability to switch between subweapons with the triggers which was a feature from the PSOne Classic re-releases a few generations ago.\nIn case you're wondering, yes, the Elec-Man subweapon pause glitch found on the original NES cartridge still works.\n\nMega cool extras!\nThere are some nice extras that can be found in the game, like a music player that features every original sound track from all six games, and a hefty database mode, which showcases artwork and concept art for every enemy in the game. It's all old archive material that exists in some developers’ artbook somewhere, but it's still nice to be able to flip through it all in one centralized location.\nOne really cool feature of the archive is the ability to instantly fight any Robot Master at will from the menu screen, with every weapon from that game at your disposal.\nIt's a nice little throw back for players that enjoy the boss battles, mirroring the arcade CPS2 Mega Man games in their Boss battle only approach to gameplay.\n\nFrom NES to PC Ok, so onto Mega Man 1-6 how do they hold up? Quite well, actually...\nThe original Mega Man is a bit rough at times with some haphazard level design, bad enemy placement and off screen enemies being able to shoot you. However, these complaints are just as valid to the original game as this version.\nIn fact, with a few exceptions, the game is a pixel perfect replica of the original game.\nThe Blue Bomber seal of quality is immediately apparent upon progressing to the second game and of course, the third, which is my personal favourite of the original games.\nWhile I did feel the burn with Mega Man 4 and 5 due to a lack of innovation, I enjoyed them all the same, and Mega Man 6 wowed me, just as it did when I was younger, with just how clean and interesting the game generally is.\n\nMy view on the stalwart commitment to the "originals" is mixed, but ultimately extremely positive.\nWhile it would have been nice to possibly play a remixed edition separately with more modern options, every game is a classic in its own way, even when you're looking at it almost 22+ years later, free of the tint of nostalgia goggles.\n\nIf you're feeling finicky and want to switch between games, however, it takes seconds to do so with the highly responsive menus, and save states are available for each game alongside old school password support.\n\nThe completionist Challenge!\nFor completionists, 50 challenges exist to test your Jumping and Shooting skills, accessible by way of a standalone mode.\nWhile most of the challenges are pretty standard like timed boss rush modes, they also have remixes, which function like obstacle courses of sorts.\nThe game will task you with getting through 15-30 second bite-sized pieces of existing levels, complete with a portal at the end, which brings you to another mini-section. It's addicting, as the game forces you to constantly rethink your strategy, and sometimes hilariously drops you into a sticky situation, like the beam section in Quick Man's stage.\nTo make things even better, multi-game remixes are unlocked later on, which require you to deal with taking on successive areas from multiple games. It's crazy jumping from title to title, as I would often forget that certain experiences didn't have sliding or charged shot capabilities.\nGetting a respectable clear time will definitely test the mettle of even the most seasoned Mega Man players out there.\n\nCompetetive play The game is a love letter to the fans from Capcom, The game even comes complete with leaderboard support, so you can see how you rank up against your friends and the world. I've already started a friendly little competition with a few of my friends, and I think I'm going to get addicted to this feature all over again, just like I did with Mega Man 9.\nI'm interested to see the top times from players all around the world, and this is a truly great way to unite Mega Man fans old and new.\n\n\nVerdict\nAfter booting the game up I was inspired to beat all six games again and work on the challenges, so the Mega Man Legacy Collection did its job. I'd really like to see more Legacy packs down the line from Capcom, such as a Battle Network Legacy collection, with a bit more bravado in terms of extras and alternate modes of play.  Mega Man Legacy collection offers a thoroughly enjoyable nostalgia trip through Mega Man’s gaming past.  I recommend it, both for Mega Man veterans and those new to the Blue Bomber’s legendary legacy.\n\nScore:\n10 / 10","February 14","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I very much hope that Capcom will at some point revive the series and announce another game, perhaps Mega Man 11 or maybe another remake like Mega Man Powered Up. But that’s beside the point.\n\nSimply put, this is a collection of the six Mega Man games originally released from 1987 to 1994 on the Nintendo Entertainment System. There have been no changes whatsoever to the games except for the removal of “Licensed by Nintendo of America” on the title screens of MM1 and MM2. The games run in an emulator environment, so there’s save states for those who need them or don’t want to use the password system. Controller support is done well and I don’t notice any problems when using a Logitech F310 gamepad.\n\nThere is a plethora of official artwork and music to explore in the “Database” section of each game, and it is well worth your time to take a look, but most of the included material can be found for free on the Internet at sites like Mega Man Knowledge Base and YouTube.\n\nThe only major new addition is a “Challenge Mode”, clearly inspired by the challenges found in Mega Man 10. The challenges (of which there are about 50) consist entirely of rooms and bosses taken straight from the original games – there aren’t any new challenges with unique rooms as there were in MM10. This is a bit of a disappointment, but it’s perfectly understandable as the developers were trying to go for perfect emulation and as a result chose not to develop any new material. They’re also a nice way to practice fighting certain sets of Robot Masters.\n\nThe one really disappointing thing here is that Mega Man 7, Mega Man and Bass, and Mega Man: The Wily Wars are all absent from this compilation. I can understand not including Mega Man 8-10, because those were developed for more advanced platforms (PlayStation and Wii respectively), but the Super NES and Sega Genesis aren’t that hard to emulate on PCs. There’s no excuse for not including titles released on those systems. Besides, the original versions of Mega Man and Bass and Mega Man: The Wily Wars have never had an official release here in North America. It would have been a major selling point had those games been included.\n\nIt is really up to you whether or not to purchase this collection. I have included the following checklist to help you out with that decision. Please take a look.\n\nIf you…\n•	do not already own any of the NES Mega Man games on another platform such as Virtual Console for Wii U, 3DS, etc.\n•	are interested in supporting the Mega Man franchise and telling Capcom that we want them to stop ignoring it and do something new\n•	want to play Mega Man 1-6 on PC without using emulators and “illegal” ROMs\n•	want easy Steam achievements for beating the games\n•	want to play the Challenge Mode with assorted challenges and quests from the games similar to that found in Mega Man 10\n•	want to look at cool official artwork\n•	don’t mind that every Mega Man game after MM6 is not included here\n\n…then by all means, BUY THIS GAME! You will be 100% satisfied with what it has to offer.\n\nHowever, if you…\n•	already own any of the NES Mega Man games on another platform (or if you’re one of those people who actually has an NES with the cartridges)\n•	have played through these games many times and can complete all of them in one sitting with few deaths\n•	want Mega Man 7-10 and/or Wily Wars on PC\n•	don’t care about the Steam achievements\n•	are fine with looking at artwork on the Internet\n•	are fine with using emulators\n\n…then don’t buy. You will not find anything new or interesting.\n\nI hope this review has helped you make a choice as to whether or not this game is worth your money. Thank you for taking the time to read and please rate up if it was helpful. =)\n","January 3","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Blowing them up and taking their special powers for personal use? Even better. Such is the premise of the Megaman series- a system that has influenced game design since its launch in 1987 (and which I remember playing on a console a year later, when I was six. I feel rather old at that realization).\n\nThe premise is rather simple- take the first bunch of stages in any order, amassing a pile of special weapons to take down the evil Dr. Wily and save the world from his latest evil scheme (yeah, it's safe to assume he doesn't really have a hobby) by blasting through Skull Castle . While the full Megaman series consists of several different games spread over how many consoles and time periods, this collection contains only a small slice of all that- for fifteen bucks retail, you get a pretty decent selection: the first six games of the main Megaman series, which were all released on the eight-bit Nintendo Entertainment System over a period of time from 1987 to 1994. You also get some behind-the-scenes stuff, like enemy backgrounds art assets and sketches, as well as the soundtracks to the six games (trust me, you'll run into plenty of earworm-type songs in these games) but I honestly don't understand why you'd include a music player when you could just fire up YouTube and listen to them there without having to go and boot Steam.\n\nYou also get a challenge mode- which shows lots of influence from a series of fangames that just throw you into sections from random levels and see how far you can get. This is actually rather fun- your powers are determined by which game you land in, and you get four E-Tanks to sustain you through the sequence, and you're scored on time taken. This forces you to think on your toes and use your memory to try and think of all your options at the current time.\n\nThere's a save system- you get one save point for each game that you can use to save at any point- just go into the menu, save, and it will allow you to load the game and pick up at that exact point. It's useful for when you're at the end of a level on your last life, and don't desire to play the level again.\n\nThis is also one of the only legitimate ways to get copies of these games outside of A) owning the original cartridges, B) buying the Megaman Anniversary Collection, or C) buying them off of Nintendo's Shop Channels (1 to 5 are on the Wii Shop channel, 6 is on the Wii U and 3DS shop channel). But that, well... leads into a bit of the downside to this collection.\n\nWhy is this only the first six games? There are ten in the main series alone, and you've got the main series, the X series, the Legends series... why not just tweak the Anniversary Collection and release that and ask twenty or twenty-five for it? Follow it up with the X Collection and the Legends games and you have a great way to reach another generation of gamers through Steam. Also, why no Wily Wars?\n\nAll of the games enclosed within are faithfully emulated, down to the screen flicker and original bugs and easter eggs (the Elec Beam/pause trick still works in the first game, and you can still get the Rush Jet in 3 without having to earn it if you know the trick). However, that means the sprite flicker and slowdown is in there, too.\n\nThe early games- especially the first game- are genuine Nintendo hard. The most obvious examples of this are Yellow Devil Mk. I and Wily Machine I, both of which will make you rage if this is your first time through a Megaman game. (They still give me fits, and I've been playing them for years.)\n\nThere are good and bad parts to these games, but in the end... yeah, I enjoyed it.\n\nI'm still mixed about the price- fifteen sounds a little expensive, and the cheapskate on my shoulder keeps telling me that this ought to be ten (when he's not off viciously mauling the few slices of pizza I intended on having for dinner)... and I'm inclined to believe him.\n\nTL;DR: It's a nice solid title, but nothing to really write home about. Wait for a sale for a decent deal and grab it for ten at the most. 7/10.","February 13","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's sad that legacy collection has the orignal NES version in emulation.

Reversed the controls which you jump with B button and shoot with the Huge A button.\nProblem with the PS2 version : runs these games on 240p and not 480i. no control mapping.\nProblem with the XBOX version :  the game crashes random point. unplayable on the XBOX 360 as it's backwards compatibility.\nTo Bad that Mega Man Legacy Collection lacks Mega Man 7(SNES),8(PS1),and the two arcade games that where unlockable  on the Mega Man Anniversary Collection if you beat every single Mega Man game.\nNot to mention ingnoring Mega Man & Bass (SNES,GBA) but also Mega Man 9 & 10 ( Wii Ware,PS3 & XBOX 360)\n\nBut overall this the legit way to get Mega Man 1-6 on PC plus it has challenge mode. It's Mega Man enough said.","January 7","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blowing them up and taking their special powers for personal use? Even better. Such is the premise of the Megaman series- a system that has influenced game design since its launch in 1987 (and which I remember playing on a console a year later, when I was six. I feel rather old at that realization).\n\nThe premise is rather simple- take the first bunch of stages in any order, amassing a pile of special weapons to take down the evil Dr. Wily and save the world from his latest evil scheme (yeah, it's safe to assume he doesn't really have a hobby) by blasting through Skull Castle . While the full Megaman series consists of several different games spread over how many consoles and time periods, this collection contains only a small slice of all that- for fifteen bucks retail, you get a pretty decent selection: the first six games of the main Megaman series, which were all released on the eight-bit Nintendo Entertainment System over a period of time from 1987 to 1994. You also get some behind-the-scenes stuff, like enemy backgrounds art assets and sketches, as well as the soundtracks to the six games (trust me, you'll run into plenty of earworm-type songs in these games) but I honestly don't understand why you'd include a music player when you could just fire up YouTube and listen to them there without having to go and boot Steam.\n\nYou also get a challenge mode- which shows lots of influence from a series of fangames that just throw you into sections from random levels and see how far you can get. This is actually rather fun- your powers are determined by which game you land in, and you get four E-Tanks to sustain you through the sequence, and you're scored on time taken. This forces you to think on your toes and use your memory to try and think of all your options at the current time.\n\nThere's a save system- you get one save point for each game that you can use to save at any point- just go into the menu, save, and it will allow you to load the game and pick up at that exact point. It's useful for when you're at the end of a level on your last life, and don't desire to play the level again.\n\nThis is also one of the only legitimate ways to get copies of these games outside of A) owning the original cartridges, B) buying the Megaman Anniversary Collection, or C) buying them off of Nintendo's Shop Channels (1 to 5 are on the Wii Shop channel, 6 is on the Wii U and 3DS shop channel). But that, well... leads into a bit of the downside to this collection.\n\nWhy is this only the first six games? There are ten in the main series alone, and you've got the main series, the X series, the Legends series... why not just tweak the Anniversary Collection and release that and ask twenty or twenty-five for it? Follow it up with the X Collection and the Legends games and you have a great way to reach another generation of gamers through Steam. Also, why no Wily Wars?\n\nAll of the games enclosed within are faithfully emulated, down to the screen flicker and original bugs and easter eggs (the Elec Beam/pause trick still works in the first game, and you can still get the Rush Jet in 3 without having to earn it if you know the trick). However, that means the sprite flicker and slowdown is in there, too.\n\nThe early games- especially the first game- are genuine Nintendo hard. The most obvious examples of this are Yellow Devil Mk. I and Wily Machine I, both of which will make you rage if this is your first time through a Megaman game. (They still give me fits, and I've been playing them for years.)\n\nThere are good and bad parts to these games, but in the end... yeah, I enjoyed it.\n\nI'm still mixed about the price- fifteen sounds a little expensive, and the cheapskate on my shoulder keeps telling me that this ought to be ten (when he's not off viciously mauling the few slices of pizza I intended on having for dinner)... and I'm inclined to believe him.\n\nTL;DR: It's a nice solid title, but nothing to really write home about. Wait for a sale for a decent deal and grab it for ten at the most. 7/10.","February 13","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Jerks.\nSeriously though, great game. It's mega man 1-6, as advertised. One problem - It can crash on the screen after you complete a challenge. I have completed like 4 challenges and it has crashed twice already-once directly after I completed the challenge and once while I was viewing the leaderboard.I played more challenges - it crashes every time I view the leaderboard - specifically when I view my global ranking, it crashed more often then. I hope that this can be fixed because it is quite an inconvience.\nOther than that, though - great. I spent too much time on wily castle 3 though.

Only problem is that my controller which works for all other games is not recgonized for some reason with only this game.\n\nSo for those who used controllers did you manage to attach an old NES or SNES controller to your computer via string and a tin can McGiver style? Or am I forced to buy a CAPCOM only controller so I can play an old ♥♥♥ game?\n\nThat said, the game looks good, haven't had a lot of time to play it as using a keyboard for a console game just doesn't work out the same way. Hopefully I can get these controller issues resolved so I can play the games I grew up with and loved.\n\nAFTER NOTE: If you can get the controller working the way your like this is a great buy, if not then you are going to have a bad time.","April 16","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"
