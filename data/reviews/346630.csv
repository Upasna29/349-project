Very much so in that the Thief swinging mechanic and the Wizard telekinesis mechanic are extremely similar.  Death is back to the last checkpoint and there are alot of them so the frustration factor is a little lower, despite some tricky spots.\n\nIt is shorter than Trine and at times a bit more of a grind, but it is a decent and very underplayed game.\n\nAt 4.99 it is hard to justify, perhaps 4.5/10, but in a bundle (and it has been 6 times according to Enhanced Steam), it is an easy 7/10.","May 1, 2015","true","8.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

For one indie game, it has good physics. As I said, it's little short, but not so hard for achievement hunters. It has my positive review, because I really enjoyed playing it.","February 19, 2015","true","4.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","5"

It is one of the better indie games that i have played in a while.  A puzzle based platformer with mouse control.  It is well worth 5 dollars and strongly recommend it at a sale price.  I am also looking forward to the Dev's next game "Systematic Immunity" Which is on steam greenlight now.\nGraphics are good, puzzles are great, I wish that it was controlled with xbox 360 controller but the game really doesn't easily lend itself to that.","February 27, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Is it hardcore platformer? No, but some parts can be, especially last level, with boss. Is it hardcore puzzle game? Not really, but again, some puzzles can be harder, and you have to work with gravitation and game's physics. Is it worth 5 euros? I think yes, i've enjoyed this game, and the only con is graphics (not really my cons, as i prefer gameplay, not graphics :) ).","February 10","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Right now it's a fun ride for an hour or two but little replay value.\n\nConclusion: 6/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goochroachy/recommended/346630/","goochroachy","[GA] Roachy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goochroachy/","622 products in account","Only 2-3 hours of gameplay, the controls are a bit unintuitive, twitchy, and difficult to master, and it's not particularly exciting. In addition, recognition of which objects can be interacted with in which ways is very difficult, leaving an average player quietly perplexed with the lacking game design.\n\nBut the mechanics are solid, and a few of the puzzles are quite elegant and satisfying to solve. Imagine starting out on a simple platformer, having the powers of the wizard in Trine. Later you gain the Trine thief's grappling hook, and a limited ability to teleport into certain objects. None of these additional powers are explored to their full potential.\n\nI give it a positive review because it's worth playing around with, if only for the unique feel of the game and its combination of mechanics. However this game has a lot of wasted potential. If the developer were to come out with additional, more complex puzzles, with better level design, and more variety to the environmental mechanics, or open it up to user-created levels somehow, it could be a beautiful thing, a la 2D Portal.","April 27, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I didn't watch the video until after I played the game, and I was amazed at how many solutions to puzzles that it contained. Now onto the review.\n\nThis game was a hidden gem for me. I was in the mood for a game that I could comfortably play in a weekend. I liked the idea and the look of the graphics of this, so I gave it a shot. I ended up enjoying this far more than I thought I would. It also took a bit longer to play than I was expecting, but that was mostly due to me getting stuck on a couple of puzzles. I got a great sense of satisfaction when I did figure out the solutions, and they always felt reasonable and logical. If I stopped playing and came back to it later with a fresh set of eyes, most of the solutions seemed obvious.\n\nGenerally the game is all about using your brain to solve puzzles, but there some parts that test your platforming skills. It had a good progression of adding abilities to keep the levels fresh. It was impressive how well the puzzles were made to use all the abilities, and even at one stage had a puzzle based on the sound made when selecting the different abilities. Some people have complained about the short length of the game, but I don't think that adding any more levels would have resulted in any new type of puzzle. I was quite happy with the way the game ended.\n\nPerformance on low-end systemsThe game plays perfectly on my netbook powered by a 1GHz dual core AMD C-50 processor at 1024x600 (below the minimum spec). The minimum resolution is 800x600 (why don't system requirements ever state this) and it supports windowed mode. It also worked surprisingly well using a trackpad instead of a mouse, although I did my full play through on my desktop system so I only tested the trackpad on the first few levels.","March 11","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
