Except Rory, god they ruined his face)\n+Cards (This one is kind of cheating but if you're a Doctor Who fan, you would have always wanted this. Plus, card designs are nice)\n\nCons:\n-Gameplay (Controls are somewhat messy, mechanics are too easy)\n-Graphics (Not all that important, and considering it was made in 2011)\n-Replayability (Playable for about 2-3 times to collect everything and before getting bored of the story)\n-Length (Episodes are about an hour or so each, so this game can be complete in under around 6 or 7 hours)\n-Crafting rewards (Another cheat, basically cancels out the above pro. Expected better badges, emoticons and backgrounds but hey, Dalek emoticon)\n\nBasically,\n8/10 for Doctor Who fan (familiarity is what this game relies on, as the fans would understand and forgive all the cons to make way for the pros)\n6.5/10 for non-Doctor Who fans (non-fans most likely would not understand much about the show, characters, music, stories, and monsters, and therefore the pros would not affect them much, and the cons would overpower the good aspects. Go watch the show!!!)\nWibbly-wobbly, but still worth playing at its price.","March 21, 2014","true","17.5"," 122 of 135 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","122","135","2","1"

The episodes themselves are fine, story and voice acting seems like proper Doctor Who episodes. Sadly the game has a few impractical things in it, low graphics and a few bugs. The mouse seems laggy in the buzzer game puzzle, which is pretty annoying. I also feel they overdid the stealth thing a bit; there's a lot of it. The music is great, ofcourse, the game uses the music from the tv show.\n\nThe sound in this game really bugged me; the voices did not seem to come from the characters properly and it didn't sound like the voices came from the place the character was; they sounded like they were in a sound studio (which they probably were) and whoever managed sound didn't do a good enough job to put the voices in their proper setting. The sound effects are also off; knocks on doors, for example, is randomly played and does not match the characters hand hitting the door. In the last episode, for some reason,; probably supposed to sound like wind or water; the sound sounded like a crap microphone sound over skype, like someone put their volume on too high and didn't speak, but the mic kept running.\n\nThe game has a fairly low quality on the graphics, but most characters have a good likeness, with the exception, I feel, of Rory, who looks rather bland and not too recognisable. Amy's face makes her look 12, which is an awkward mix with her short skirt and the whole being married thing.\n\nI experienced a few bugs; in one episodes it's possible to fall into the water, but you spawn on the harbour again almost instantly so no harm done. Another bug I had was starting the game from the main menu into a particular savepoint where there is a puzzle with lasers spawning in hallways that are timed and you have to move between corridors to dodge them. For some reason when spawning into this savespot from the menu one laser was on all the time and the other lasers never showed. "Fixed" by suicide, but annoying again. I also had a few times npcs would get stuck; mostly random npcs wandering around, but at one point an enemy as part of a stealth puzzle (made it easier so I shan't complain too much), but most annoying; when you are in a stealth puzzle and have a companion with you, your dumbarse partner has a chance of getting stuck and if you're reeeeally unlucky they will get stuck in a point where they are found by an enemy and killified and you have to start over.\n\nAnother impractical things; you cannot see your collection from the main menu in the main episodes; you have to quit to the menu to see it.\nThe game has 2 options when opening it; either run the first 4 episodes or the longer Gunpowder episode. The first 3 episodes has 3 acts and when you have completed it you can start in any act, which is nice if you forgot a collection item. For some reason the Gunpowder episodes does not have this option and you have to start over from the beginning of the episode if you missed something.\n\nIs it for fans only? Probably yes; as with all the bugs and minor nuisances you can probably find a better game in the genre. Most episodes have enemies already seen in the Doctor Who universe, but nothing a newbie can't handle, with the exception of episode "Tardis" where you get a quiz about some things from the show (even from pre-2005). Nothing google can't fix and the questions don't change should you fail and have to try again, so you can always guess your way through.\n\nOverall a decent game if you want to feel part of a Doctor Who episode or five, but not the best game for its genre and a non-fan should probably look elsewhere for p&c adventure.\n\nEdit: Typos","November 13, 2015","true","9.6"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","60","64","3","0"

Personally I am a Doctor Who fan so I love the game! But if you are playing this to get into Doctor who, don't bother, most of the easter eggs are related to Doctor who (as you should know). This game makes you feel as the Doctor, wondering and thinking of what to do. In most levels they give you a open level sort of thing, where you have to find the items you need to progress in the story. This adds some fun and fustration at times. If you are a Doctor Who fan get it, it will be great fun. If you are not don't get it.\n\nPros - Great Stories (yes, multiple Doctor Who stories in this game)\nFun Puzzeles\nGood use of companions\nI like the Stealth, nice stealth system (opinion)\nLots of content\nVoice acting done by Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Arthur Darvil\n\n\nCons-\nAI is a bit weird and stupid (at times)\nGraphics (this is a minor if you're a Doctor Who fan)\nLack of settings options\nRepetitive gameplay\n\nMake sure you join or check out my Steam group for reviews and random topics :D Steam group: Jammy Dodgers","October 24, 2014","true","9.7"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","54","58","3","0"

At least, if you're a Doctor Who fan. The stories are well written and the dialog is witty so anyone might enjoy this game. But for those who love Doctor Who? This game is a must. There are five Doctor Who stories in all which tie into the show. Every story is presented like a television episode including the opening theme song and credits. But YOU get to play those episodes! The main characters are The Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond. The character models for the game look just like the actors AND are voiced by the actors. All in all, it's a pure pleasure to play. I'm about halfway through all the stories and I still marvel at their high quality. Maybe the character movement isn't quite as responsive as it could be but everything else is topnotch and I am giving this 5 out of 5 stars. Just as I will rewatch Doctor Who episodes on tv, I will replay this game again as well. This is one of my best buys on Steam!\n\nOh, Additional: Gameplay - a mixture of stealth and puzzles. If you want action, I believe the other Doctor Who game on Steam supplies that.","September 1, 2014","true","5.0"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"

This is the ONLY reason this is getting a thumbs up. Its everything Doctor Who. Enemies, the use of the Sonic screwdriver, Tardis and the occasional british humor. The plus side its the actors actually voicing the characters.\n\nHowever please keep in mind the following:\n\n- Mouse controls are wonky. Some puzzles take longer because of this.\n- You can NOT skip cut scenes. Don't fail something as you get to sit through the whole thing again. This also applies to replays.\n- Climbing, jumping and doing actions seem to take FOREVER as the character needs to line up to preform the action\n- In the Gunpowder Plot you get the oppertunity to fall through the enviroment.... over and over again\n\nThere were a few places where locating things became annoying. Overall I enjoyed the stories and the game seemed to at least progress at a decent pace.

Is it good? Should i buy it?''.In this review i'll try to answer those questions.\n\nThe strongest part of this game is story.Earth is in troubles and only Doctor and his companion Amy can save the situation.Sounds easy enough?Well,unfortunately your greatest enemies will try to kill you.Will you prevail against Daleks,Cybermen and others and could you stop their evil plans before they conquer the Universe?\n\nGameplay is interesting-mixture of adventure,stealth action and puzzles.Together they work surprisingly well and keep you enterntained in entire game.\n\nGraphic is very good,it could be better but also it could be much worse.I'm not that type of guy who judging the game for graphics, in fact it's the least thing i care.In this case i could tell the grapic is solid and well made.\n\nSound is awesome.Some songs are from show itself others are very similiar and make perfect atmosphere.\n\nLast thoughts: The game is great for every Whovian and not just for them.Even if you never watched the show you can easily get into it thanks for Facts and information from Cards which you collecting through game.So the answers for my questions from the first part of this review are ''Doctor and his adventures.Hell yeah and Sure thing.''\nThanks for the reading and i hope this review helped.\n\nSummary- pros: epic story,incredible sound,collecting informations and cards,funny gameplay (specially puzzles) and wibbly wobbly timey wimey....stuff\ncons: maybe too short (i just want another episodes to play ^^')\nFinal verdict 8.2/10 -it's a fantastic game.","December 29, 2014","true","22.7"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","100","26","26","7","0"

It's JUST as jinky, hilariously frustrating and absurd to try and control at points.\nI actually found this to almost be a positive. If you found yourself seriously ENJOYING Octodad, the controls in this aren't quite as complex but just as hit and miss at multiple points.\n\nGraphics wise it's about 6-8 years old despite being only 4 years old. Clipping issues and some rather gnarly graphic glitches do exist, but overall it's a fairly sound PS2 game.\n\nThe storylines and voice acting so far have been fairly good, and overall it has been very fun to poke about and enjoy some between episode shenanigans.\n\nThat said, I am a huge Whovian nerd, and this game is delightful to me.\nI am having a blast with it, and actually really enjoying the retro feel.\n\nIt's not a AAA title, it's not groundbreaking or incredible.\nIt's a Doctor Who game, with decent to great writing, hilariously bad controls and rather nostalgic graphics obviously done on the cheap and holding a very firm sense of the absurd.\nBasically it's like Classic Who and Nu!Who had a video game love child.\n\nI'd honestly have far LESS fun if the graphics were AAA level and the controls were smooth and reliable. It's the very rough corners that make this FEEL more like Doctor Who.\n\nIf you're a Whovian, I highly recommend you grab this when it's on sale 10-25% off.\nIf you're a nominal fan, I recommend this when it's on deal of the week or 70+% off.\nIf you're a giant kid inside who adored both the old and new Who?

I find it takes about two hours to play through an episode the first time, which puts it on par with most other adventure games.\n\nThe real-time re-creation of the show's title sequences are beautifully done, and it's overall a good demonstration of how to go about making a game based on a TV show.\n\nThat said, it does have a few flaws.\n\nThe characters are rather lacking in facial animation. The developers would do well to take a leaf out of Valve's book in that department. Their mouths sync up with the dialogue and they blink occasionally, but their faces are otherwise largely static, making the game seem a lot older than it really is.\n\nThe controls are a bit sluggish, though they are somewhat improved in Episode 5, due to it having been made later.\n\nThe music has a tendency to get a bit too loud when string-heavy action sequences are playing, resulting in the sound effects and speech getting masked a bit.\n\nFinally, the sequences which are explicitly about solving puzzles (typically involving modifying some kind of device) tend to be much too easy, and even then the challenge is usually about actually going through with the solution, rather than figuring it out in the first place. I'm sure this was meant to give the youngest members of the audience a chance at solving them, but it would have been nice to have an option to make the puzzles harder for older players like myself.\n\nOverall, though, it's a good game and it's worth dropping $10 on when it's on sale if you're a fan of Doctor Who.","November 9, 2014","true","8.1"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

Otherwise, none of this will make any sense whatsoever. If you are, however, this bundle of games, excluding maybe the first one, can be quite enjoyable. Don't expect too much - these are basically bonus episodes to Series 5 and 6, set up as adventure games with stealth and minigames - but they are (usually) just as well written as the tv programme itself, and get better as they go on. The continuity cavalcade going on in the third one - TARDIS - is especially lovely; and not only that, both the Doctor and Amy explain what they understand of the TARDIS controls, and you actually get to have a go yourself! Definitely makes the scenes in the tv programme where he's flying "Sexy" more interesting to watch.\n\nSo, if you're a Whovian, and this happens to be on sale, don't think, BUY IT. You won't regret it.

Let me tell you that one of the things they got right here is the dialogue of the characters.  Everyone's in character here and the dialogue can range from dead serious to openly hilarious just like in the show and I have to say that it's great to see that here.  Also, they have the soundtrack from the show in here which is ear candy.  Whether or not you find that great fan service or just plain lazy us up to you to decide.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where my praise ends.  I'm not one to usually rant about graohics, but you have to admit that the visuals could have been a lot better here.  Also, the controls are incredibly wonky and awkward.  It's awful that the Doctor has to take a walking start before he actually runs.  And your companion: Amy is a major handicap to play with since her AI is just awful.  And the stories that takes place in the game are...okay.  They're just okay.  Nothing major to run home about.  The stories are nowhere near the gems that take place in the show such as Vincent and the Doctor or The Doctor's Wife.  But still, they are nowhere near as bad as other stories such as Angels Take Manhattan or Nightmare in Silver.\n\nFor recommendations, I would only recommend it if you are an obsessive die hard Whovian.  But for the majority, I just can't recommend this game.  I probably would have been more leniant on this game if it was free like it used to be in the UK, but on Steam where it's worth $10, it's just not worth your money.","December 3, 2014","false","13.0"," 27 of 47 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","27","47","2","13"

As someone completely indifferent to the series, I saw it and thought "hey, you know what?  A point-and-click in the Doctor Who universe, what could go wrong?"  Ugh... everything, apparently.\n\nI won't focus on the small things, like the Bethesda-grade visuals and lacking optimization that makes it run worse than Crysis.  40 FPS is still playable, bad controls can be put up with, and the lifeless animation and Xbox era visuals are acceptable if you grit your teeth a bit (noting this game wasn't made in 2001, but 2010).  I'll focus on the legitimate issues with this game, the ones you can't just grit your teeth and put up with.\n\nWhat I ended up with in playing this was a Telltale game with none of the charm.  The entire game is EXTREMELY linear (it literally tells you "Wrong Way" and forces you to turn around with any deviation from the path, LucasArts is literally rolling in its digital grave right now), and the entirety of the content is so barebones that, much like a Telltale game, the only thing that could save it is a fantastic story.\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAnd that's not what it is.  It's Doctor Who.  It's decent, but hardly The Wolf Among Us here.  Five episodes of 'eh.'\n\nWhen the game does give you freedom, it's through awful stealth sequences in which you can only right-click to move in the camera direction (the arrow key controls are sickening, to say the least), and I was able to cross a hallway with a guard simply by hiding behind pillars AFTER it noticed me and waiting for the heat to blow over, with NO INVESTIGATION.  Or, the guards are all-seeing and will spot your braindead companion with ease.  Even if it had a fantastic story, these sections singlehandedly ruin the game.\n\nIt's free directly from the BBC's website if you're in the United Kingdom.  If you happen to be a real Brit and not a 'Murrican wannabe, go right on ahead.  As for paying for this game?  There are plenty of high-quality adventure games you can buy instead, like Grim Fandango or Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.\n\nIn the meantime... there are better things to do with your money.

Fine, you have Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill, but they sound like they are falling asleep.

The gameplay is simple, you have some stealth parts, riddles and minigames. It is never difficult and the environments are rich in detail, the secondary characters are great. If you like Doctor Who, you will find those four episodes very enjoyable.\n\nHowever, I didn't like the 5th episode, The Gunpowder Plot, at all. It has as much story as one of the other episodes, but it is as long as the four of them combined. The checkpoints are horrible which makes its stealth segments extremely frustrating. The atmosphere of 1605 London is great and the last of the three chapters is quite exciting, but that's it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kargor/recommended/268830/","Kargor","Kargor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kargor/","827 products in account","Well, the adventure games tell reasonably Doctor Who-ish stories. Various game mechanics tend to repeat quite a bit, like the puzzles, or sneaking through areas guarded by enemies, which doesn't really happen all that much on the actual TV show.\n\nThe first four episodes were comparatively short, and very linear. Sometimes you play as the Doctor, sometimes you play as Amy, but the character you're not playing is either standing around somewhere or following you, so it's still very linear.\n\nThe gunpowder plot is considerably longer. They've added Rory into the mix, and they made the switches between characters more meaningful as characters might split up to do different things. It's still linear progression, and switches between characters happen when the game says so. As for the game itself, it's still the same: Doctor Who-ish enough to be enjoyable, but more repetitive than the TV show would suggest.\n\nIt's not the must-have AAAAAAAAAAAA game of the millennium, but it's certainly a game to consider for a Doctor Who fan. You might want to pick it up on a sale, though.\n\nControls aren't the greatest achievement either, but it's not an action game of any sort so there's no actual issue with that.\n\nHint: try to search the areas carefully if you want to complete achievements. For example, if you're missing a "card" from the first four episodes, there is no hint where that card might be, so you have to replay all of them (at least until you find the missing cards). For "facts" you do at least know the episode where you have to search, although you still don't know which of the three acts you should be searching.\n\nThe Gunpowder plot, being considerably longer, gives no hints where a "fact" might be missing, and it has no way to start somewhere in the middle. So, take your time to search every spot for "facts" on your first playthrough.","September 20, 2014","true","16.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I really, properly don't even know what to make of it, or what my opinion truly is on it.\n\nIt's strange because sometimes I absolutely despise it, with it's glitches and it's lack of polish. And other times I find myself really enjoying it! Completely immersed in the world of Doctor Who and completely freaking out over the fact that I GET TO FLY THE TARDIS or the tiny, little thing that is USING THE SONIC SCREWDRIVER.\n\nLet me go into a little bit more detail... This is a bundle of 5 games that were originally release in 2010 and 2011 episodically. They are all set during the early Matt Smith era of the show, back when he was travelling with Amy and, later, Rory. Each 'episode' is about 2-5 hours long, and is a unique plot written by several of the show's writers, such as Phil Ford. The script's are perhaps the best part of this game, as they are, for the most part, as interesting and well-written as the script for an ordinary episode of the show. This sense of authenticity is enhanced by the use of the show's actual cast to provide all the voice acting. Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill all do great jobs and slip back into their characters without any effort whatsoever.\n\nSo, that's the good. Now, for the bad... And brace yourself, because there's quite a lot of it to get through.\n\nThis game was made on a teeny, tiny budget by a very-inexperienced team. So the whole thing look's, quite frankly, appaling. There are just 4 graphics settings in the main menu, and none of them look at all comparable to even the most low-budget game released in the past 5 year's. This lack of polish also extends to the gameplay, where glitches and clipping abound. The otherwise-excellent cutscenes also, unfortunately, suffer because of this.\n\nOh, and then there's the gameplay... Now this is the bit that baffles me. As I said before, sometimes I will find myself having a lot of fun with this game, and that's mainly because I am a massive Doctor Who fan and there is a certain thrill out of doing things like exploring the TARDIS or outwitting the Daleks. I am a big fan of this series, and it's obvious the developers are too. The amount of love that has gone into this game is obvious right from the outset. The enviroments, while ugly to look at, are packed with details and little, obscure refrences. But, as fun as these bits are to play for me, they still can't save the rest of the game from falling into the pit of mediocrity. Take the stealth's sections for example; They're okay, mechanically, but a lack of depth really holds them back. Basically all you do during these sections is wait for the enemy's cone of vision to pass, before running past them to the next bit. There's you formula, rinse 'n' repeat 4000 times. People have been saying this reminds them of Metal Gear Solid, but I don't see the resembelance. At-least MGS actually has some amount of depth to it's mechanics. And doesn't merely consist of simply waiting for an enemy to pass, before bolting to the exit.\n\nThen there's the puzzles. Some of which are clever... Other's? Not so much.\n\nThe one's that require you to explore the enviroment and mix multiple items together to solve problem's are good fun and really highlight the attention to detail that the devs have paid. Not to mention, they also harken back to old school point 'n' click games, which is great. The more basic, minigame-like puzzles however, can be fed to a pack of hungry Yeti for all I care. (And yes, that was a refrence to The Great Intelligence's footsoliders during the late 60s.)\n\nSo, overall, what do I think of Doctor Who: The Adventure Games? Well, I'm really torn about the whole thing. As a fan, I certainly got a kick out of certain sections, and the game can be a very fun experience at times. But as a game critic, I have to admit it fails to live up to my standards for a modern video game... Or anyone's, for that matter. While some portions of the game are a lot of fun, other's are just poorly-designed and realised. And these sections drag the whole experience down.\n\nShould you buy Doctor Who: The Adventure Games? If you're a Doctor Who fan, and this may suprise some of you, but I'd say 'yes'. If you love Doctor Who and are prepared to put up with some shoddy design and lack of depth, I think you'll have some fun with this. The experience is very true to the show, to the point that it often feel's like you are simply playing an interactive Doctor Who episode, rather then a tradional 'game'.\n\nSo, yes. If you're not a fan of Doctor Who, you'll think this is an absolutely abhorrent attempt at a game. If you are, then I think you'll be able to look past the flaws, and see this game for what it truly is.","March 20, 2014","true","3.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I'm not going to complain about the price overmuch because I got this as a part of a very cheap bundle, but it's definitely not worth the full Steam store fare.

Authentic voice actors too, but they could have used some better directing. They sound bored for the most part.\n\nLast game, the Gunpowder Plot, is a slightly improved version. Longer too.

The rest of them are worse and have very little meat on them.\n\nIf you are a whovian and a big fan of eleventh this might be worth getting on a big discount, otherwise avoid.","December 20, 2014","false","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you try to explore it just turns you around\n\n- Since when can the Sonic NOT open a locked door?

The mains (Matt Smith "The Doctor" and Karen Gillan "Amy") do a speldid job with voice acting and the main plots for all five of the episodes are good. Shadows of the Vashna Narada is really good and brings back fantastic aliens from the library two parter in 2008. City of the Daleks brings back the daleks (who pretty much appear in most doctor who series, however it's nice to see them in the game to). Blood of the Cybermen (Has the Cybermen in it, REALLY cool aliens that can DELETE you). TARDIS hasn't got an alien in it (mostly just a nice puzzle filled episode where you explore the TARDIS as the Doctor and Amy). The fifth episode (The Gunpowder plot) is quite nice and has Rory in it (Amy's husband). All in all it's a great game that is worth $20.00 as I'm writing this review it's 75% off (price is $5.00) which is basically a steal!

Except Rory, god they ruined his face)\n+Cards (This one is kind of cheating but if you're a Doctor Who fan, you would have always wanted this. Plus, card designs are nice)\n\nCons:\n-Gameplay (Controls are somewhat messy, mechanics are too easy)\n-Graphics (Not all that important, and considering it was made in 2011)\n-Replayability (Playable for about 2-3 times to collect everything and before getting bored of the story)\n-Length (Episodes are about an hour or so each, so this game can be complete in under around 6 or 7 hours)\n-Crafting rewards (Another cheat, basically cancels out the above pro. Expected better badges, emoticons and backgrounds but hey, Dalek emoticon)\n\nBasically,\n9/10 for Doctor Who fan (familiarity is what this game relies on, as the fans would understand and forgive all the cons to make way for the pros)\n8/10 for non-Doctor Who fans (non-fans most likely would not understand much about the show, characters, music, stories, and monsters, and therefore the pros would not affect them much, and the cons would overpower the good aspects.

If you're not very good at puzzle games and not a Doctor Who fan, I highly suggest looking somewhere else for a good game to purchase because this game can get REALLY frustrating at times.\n\nI'm not a particular fan of puzzle games, but the story really drew me in and made me feel just like I was watching Doctor Who. Every episode you play actually has an intro and outro based on one from the show! I was really excited to see all of the fan-favorite Doctor Who monsters that appear in this game (especially the Vashta Nerada). The puzzles mainly involve sneaking around the monsters without being detected/killed while they're walking in a constant pattern or re-wiring interfaces so that they're usable for you (among other things, those are just the most memorable for me).\n\nEach episode should take you about 45 minutes each if you aren't looking for the many collectable trading cards scattered around throughout the episodes. Each card has facts that revolve around the character(s) on the card. There's also some pretty interesting Who Facts that you can find in every level, keep an eye out for those!\n\nOverall, I'd say you should buy it just to hear Matt Smith and Karen Gillan being their characters (and doing it well) in this awesome Doctor Who puzzle game. I can't think of a reason that a Doctor Who fan could/would not enjoy this game, so don't pass it up!","December 27, 2014","true","14.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Terrible as a game, actually. It all looks and feels unfinished, especially the last episode (The Gunpowder Plot) which felt really rushed. While the characters do quite look like their real life counterpart, the rest of the game looks like it was developed 2005. Some rather bad controls as well.\n\nYou run around interacting with things, solving puzzles in the enviroment. You do have an inventory, but it's rarely used. There is some puzzles in form of mini-games, and they're pretty bland and uncreative. There's also some stealth sections, which can be pretty frustrating, since the field of vision on the enemies on some parts are just unfair, and they can also shoot through walls. Oh, and you have Amy with you as well, and if they see her, they shoot her and that's game over. So be careful, and make sure she keeps away from their line of sight.\n\nThis game has some redeeming qualities though. It gets hilarious, due to the glitches and bugs, and the lack of enthusiasm in the voice acting makes it funny as well, especially in the more tense parts (well, it was supposed to be tense anyway) of the game.\n\nAll through the game you can pick up collectible cards that features things from the Doctor Who universe, such as enemies, friends, and companions, to name a few. There's also some objects that you can interact with so you get some facts, both taken from the real universe and the Doctor Who universe.\n\n\nThis game will be interesting to the whovians.

Instead, we have this poorly written mess, in which about 90% of puzzles solved by pointing the sonic screwdriver at the obstacle, while the remaining puzzles are so simple they could probably be solved by a drunk toddler.\n\nMost of the game goes like this: move from point A to point B, point sonic screwdriver at something, repeat ad nauseam. There's no challenge, no variety, and no fun.\n\nI might overlook the shoddy design if the stories were interesting. The first four episodes are all very boring. Something something daleks. Something something Cybermen. This is going to be a big call, but I'd rather watch terrible episodes like Fear Her or Daleks in Manhattan on repeat than sit through these again. The final episode, The Gunpowder Plot, was a bit more interesting, although it runs too long.\n\nThe voice acting! The actual actors voice their characters! That's gotta give the game some credibility? Nope. Matt Smith delivered his lines with all the enthusiasm of a crusty, old mop. And yet, Karen Gillan somehow managed to be worse than that. The disdain she shows for voicing a video game... it's almost impressive.\n\nPros:\n- Getting all 30 achievements is pretty easy.\n- There are no more pros.\n\n","June 2, 2015","false","8.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","8","16","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexisplaying/recommended/268830/","alexisplaying","Shinsuke Nakamura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexisplaying/","1531 products in account","I should preface this by saying, it's a thumbs up if you get it cheap (I got it for $4 in an IndieRoyale bundle with 6 or 7 other games). This is great for those who want some more Matt Smith & Karen Gillian content. This game should be seperated into 2 seperate reviews. One for the first 4 episodes and one for the Gunpowder Plot. The difference in quality is massive.\n\nThe first 4 episodes are hindered by very janky controls, short and rushed episodes (Episode 3 takes roughly 30 minutes) and none of the stories themselves are memorable. They are serviceable at best. It's rather uninspired stealth held together with some very poor puzzles. While not unplayable these episodes just feel empty. You can definitely tell that these were games made on a low budget. Considering they are free to citizens in the UK through BBC's website, I can understand why the quality isn't that high.\n\nGunpowder plot is  definitely a major improvement. This one takes a good 2 hours (close to 3 if you get everything) to complete. It's a very nicely written Doctor Who story that is based aroundGuy Fawkes & The Gunpowder Plot (Hence the name of the episode). The controls are much more responsive, the tacked on puzzles and stealth are also much less prominent. The pacing is a bit too slow for my tastes but this feels like a legit Doctor Who adventure in video game form that's actually worth the time and money spent. If you're considering picking this game up then it's for this episode alone. It's shockingly solid.\n\nSo for $5 or less you can't go wrong, but at their core these are very very simple and short little adventure games. Don't go in expecting brilliance and you will probably enjoy your time with them assuming you're a Doctor Who fan. It just has a disturbing lack of rock quarries.","September 22, 2014","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The voice acting is SUPERB! It is so much better than lots of modern games. It's got plots (yes, "plots" as in plural.) that actually MAKE SENSE and you can go inside the TARDIS!!!

You can think of them as similar to the early telltale games, but a lot worse.\n\nThe graphics are pretty low quality, from questionable character models, to bizarre animation [frequently rory looks like he is made out of rubber], to a lack of proper lip-syncing. The voice acting is ok, and at the very least uses the actual actors. The stories given [there are 5 in total] are, again, ok.\n\nThe gameplay itself is not great. Very frquently the control is taken away from the character for cutscenes, and occasionally to display a message along the lines of "don't go this way", which is very jarring. A lot of the game seems to revolve around either scouting the maps for "collectibles" [always a horrid thing to have in games, in my opinion], and solving puzzles both like a normal adventure game and sometimes with minigames.\n\nOverall its pretty bad, and unfortunately you can't download it for free anymore [You used to be able to in the UK].

I love the show. I am passionate about the show. This game, however, is total garbage.\nThe controls are poor. The Doctor/Amy/Whoever doesn't run realistically, they run like they have an ironing board attached to their backs.\nThe graphics are dreadful for a game released in 2011. On the highest settings, it looks like an old Spyro The Dragon game from the playstation 2. Maybe even the Playstation 1.\nThe music in the game is okay, it loops, constantly, but it's fine.\nThe Dialogue is well voice acted. They got Matt Smith and Karen Gillan to phone-in their roles which adds a sense of immersion to the game. Until you play the game and all immersion is gone when you're supposed to be sneaking and all of a sudden, your character inexplicably stands up, directly in front of the enemy chasing them.\n\nWhere this game shines is in the information it gives you. If you can handle the frustratingly bad controls and terrible graphics, there is a lot of information in the game that will broaden your knowledge as a Doctor Who fan. But then again, so do the books/comics.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to people. As fans of Doctor Who, we deserve a game that we can thoroughly enjoy. Not a game we have to make excuses to enjoy.","November 10, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This philosophy does not translate to video games. Poor voice acting (despite allegedly being done by the actual cast), a vague-at-best idea about what an "adventure game" is, bad controls and forced stealth sections come together to make a truly unpleasant gaming experience.\n\nIt is sad really since they probably could have built a better Doctor Who game by going over to the Adventure Game Studio forums and announcing a competition to create puzzles worthy of a character like the Doctor. (A character who literally survives by his wits.)

Deffinitly a rage-inducing aspect of the game for me.\n\n2. The graphics are subpar, though I can give it a pass only on the fact it was produced as a free downloadable game in the UK a few years ago.\n\n3. The voice acting is very badly done. It sounds like it was recorded and slapped on to the game. It may have the original cast, but they don't seem to have the enthusiasim for the game that they have during the show.\n\nOverall I'd give the game a 4/10, mainly because I enjoy it as a Dr. Who fan, but if I wasn't I wouldn't be playing it.","March 18, 2014","false","1.2"," 42 of 90 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","42","90","0","0"

Even as a whovian who got some enjoyment out of it so far. (I've finished the first episode and started the next one.) I still think whovians should buy this at a price drop. Doctor Who: The Adventure Games is pretty average. The controls take a while to get used to and the A.I at times can be pretty stupid. I have died a couple times thanks to Amy walking into a dalek's range of sight or into dangerous obsticles. It can be enjoyable, but I've had fun for about a couple minutes and just played till I finished the episode or act. I can see a nonwhovian buying this and finding it a waste of time. Which I find kinda sad really. A video game should be something anyone can pick up and play, no matter if they're a fan or not. Heck they might become a fan after playing it. However this is not the triple A Doctor Who video game we've been waiting for. Although I do appreciate the actors voicing their roles and these stories being canon to the show. Its hard to recommend this to anyone who isn't a fan. If you're a gamer, but not a whovian I suggest skipping. However if you're a whovian who loves the show I highly suggest this title. I've heard its one of the best Doctor Who games out there, although I suggest waiting until its on sale. I just wish Telltale or Bethesda could work with the Doctor Who license and create that super amazing Doctor Who game I'll be waiting for.

TERRIBLE. It's along the lines of point and click games that were popular circa 3DO and Sega CD. You have no control over running, crouching, jumping, only walking. This game was truly made just for the fans of the show. And not even that but fans of a specific section of the show. Namely the seasons featuring Matt Smith and Karen Gillian. A MAJOR downside for me was that David Tennant was by far the best Doctor out of the last several to play the role. And Rose was definitely the best companion. With neither of those characters making an appearence I think the game loses a lot of its appeal to people like me who aren't the biggest Matt Smith fans. Don't get me wrong I liked Matt Smiths version but only after  a long while. He had to grow on me like mold. Whereas I immedietly loved Christopher Eccleston and David Tennants versions. The game replays through several episodes that appear to be from the show though I don't specifically remember these shows. To me they seem more like an amalgamation of several of the shows.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nmykita/recommended/268830/","nmykita","nmykita","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nmykita/","243 products in account","'Doctor Who: The Adventure Games' is a welcome sight for Doctor Who fans who have waited a long time for a game based on the show that is actually worth playing (anyone old enough to remember 'Dalek Attack' or 'Destiny of the Doctors' will know what I mean).  Set during the Matt Smith era, you guide the Doctor and Amy -- and during 'The Gunpowder Plot', Rory as well -- through a series of adventures that require different types of puzzle-solving to complete.  This, to me, is exactly what a Doctor Who game should be: an adventure game with puzzle-solving.  Sounds simple, but when done well, it can be really fun.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are not that complicated.  Some involve matching symbols quickly, others are a fancy version of 'Operation', and others involve connecting wires without crossing other wires.  Again, not very elaborate, but at least it's something.  There will also be multiple instances where you have to sneak past enemies without being caught in their field of vision.  These parts are a little more complicated, but still only require a few attempts to succeed.\n\nMatt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Arthur Darvill all lend their own voices to their respective characters.  This is a great touch as it enhances the feel of a Doctor Who episode.  However, the voice acting could be a little better.  Voiceovers for a game are not the same as acting out a scene for a camera, and unfortunately there are times where they sound flat and uninteresting.  But this is only a minor complaint, as I am simply happy they did their own voices.\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the controls are a bit awkward to use.  While I agree they get clumsy at times, I never really felt like the controls were hindering my progress.  Granted, there were times where I was trying to sneak past an enemy and Amy would get stuck on a corner, but thankfully that didn't happen too much.\n\nEach episode is rather short, probably about 90 minutes each.  However, there are several collectable items in each level.  These take the form of cards and world facts.  Many are easy to find, but you'll likely have to replay parts of each episode to get everything, so that extends the life of the game somewhat.\n\nOverall, this game is worth picking up, but not at the full price of $19.99.  I got mine on sale for $4.99, and I'd say it's definitely worth that much.  Even at $9.99, it's at least worth considering, but I certainly wouldn't go any higher than that.","September 5, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

TERRIBLE. It's along the lines of point and click games that were popular circa 3DO and Sega CD. You have no control over running, crouching, jumping, only walking. This game was truly made just for the fans of the show. And not even that but fans of a specific section of the show. Namely the seasons featuring Matt Smith and Karen Gillian. A MAJOR downside for me was that David Tennant was by far the best Doctor out of the last several to play the role. And Rose was definitely the best companion. With neither of those characters making an appearence I think the game loses a lot of its appeal to people like me who aren't the biggest Matt Smith fans. Don't get me wrong I liked Matt Smiths version but only after  a long while. He had to grow on me like mold. Whereas I immedietly loved Christopher Eccleston and David Tennants versions. The game replays through several episodes that appear to be from the show though I don't specifically remember these shows. To me they seem more like an amalgamation of several of the shows. The game is entirely based on puzzles. Movement puzzles to avoid being seen, logic puzzles to rewire this or that, and finding items to combine and use to solve problems. This to me gets really tedious after a while. I love that the Doctor is a pacifist (sorta considering he's wiped out entire species or at least tried) but not being able to fight back in a video game is very cumbersome. If you are a fan of Matt, Rory, and Amy, then this will be a game you enjoy I think.

It uses WSAD, or the right mouse button for movement. Which I can appreciate given that sometimes I just want to be lazy and use only the mouse. That being said, the character's movements are as if they tried to add momentum to their steps to make it seem more realistic when running, but it just makes it feel sluggish and at times unresponsive. The mouse control during some of the minigames can be teeth grindingly aggravating, especially with the wire minigame.\n\nNow, gameplay wise it's an adventure game. You go around (sometimes in stealth mode). solve puzzles, do minigames, collect items etc etc. It's barebones and has just enough variety to call it a game.\n\nSo, the game has a stealth mechanic which involves either The Doctor, Amy, or both hunched over in a crouch trying to avoid whatever the enemy is at the time. Often times, it's easy to deal with as the enemies either patrol or just stay in one area. The only time I had a pain with it was during tight corridors where the partner's A.I. would act up and either get caught on something or decide to take a few extra seconds getting into the hiding spot, causing them to be seen and having to restart. Another problem I had involved the enemy A.I. as sometimes trying to lead them into certain positions can be a pain due to them getting caught on walls or objects. It's especially aggravating considering you have to lure a couple of enemies into the same room in order to continue, only for one to constantly walk away after getting it near the door time and time again.\n\nWould I recommend the game? Sure, if you wanted more of Matt Smith's Doctor and the episodes quit doing it for you. The game has a nice variety of facts from both the real world and the Doctor Who universe which made getting all the collictibles actually worth it. The episodes are pretty well written and the sound design is good enough for my eyes.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't buy this game for $20.

I'm giving this a thumbs up, but reluctantly.\n\nAs sooo many others have pointed out, if you are a Doctor Who fan, you will probably like this. But that might be because we Doctor Who fans have learned to, ahem, lower our standards. It hasn't always been an amazing adventure in time and space...\n\nThis game is OK, but has a lot of problems.\n\nYou get the content of what would be five Doctor Who mini-episodes, but they're not very good. The plots are trite and predictable, the dialog weak and clunky. You meet some interesting characters, but because it's so short, they are skin-deep and do not develop.\n\nThe game is very, very easy, to the point of being boring. Go here, get that, push that button. You are always told exactly what you're supposed to do. There are mini-game "challenges" that are trivial to solve on the first attempt. And they repeat several times. The level design is linear and unimaginative: there is almost no exploration. There are some stealth scenes, but they are repetitive and trivial. The levels are also very sparse: no objects to examine to enrich the game world, no intriguing designs to delight the eye, almost no attention to detail. Unless you try to find all the collectibles, there's nothing rewarding about looking around, even when it's possible (rare).\n\nThe controls are wonky, sluggish, and annoying. The Doctor and Amy turn around like oil tankers moored in a shallow bay, and then run in a straight line like Forrest Gump. This isn't a big problem, though, because really all you need to do is run in straight lines.\n\nThe graphics would have been mediocre even two decades ago. That said, this game works very well in NVIDIA 3D Vision. If you have that setup, everything becomes so much better! There are issues with the text converging at the wrong depth, but otherwise it's terrific. Make sure to play at minimum depth setting, though.\n\nIn terms of fun things for Doctor Who fans, even that is disappointing. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan are not at their best here. The tidbits from Doctor Who's history all appear as "fun facts" that you just read as little cards, and there's nothing new to learn. You can't use them or interact with them: they are not part of the game. At one point you get to play with the TARDIS controls, but unfortunately it's been reduced to something like manipulating a tractor.\n\nAll that said, it's playable, and a casual way to spend ~3 hours if you've really exhausted everything else Doctor Who has to offer. But few of us have. :) If you're a real fan looking for more content, do yourself a favor and go back to the classic episodes. I recommend the Jon Pertwee era (early 1970s) as eminently watchable and fun, a great way to dive into the past.\n\nSo, it ends up being another flat merchandising effort from the BBC. Not awful, but very far from great. If you're not a fan of Doctor Who, steer clear.","September 23, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiujazi/recommended/268830/","kiujazi","Oni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiujazi/","577 products in account","Edit: After playing through the Gunpowder Plot, a lot of the issues I had as far as janky controls and length were solved, however I could only recommend that part of the game.\n\n\nOriginal Review: First off; like many others the game captures the feel of the show as it was obviously meant to do.\n\nThat being said, everything about the game other than it's writing and audio aspects is absolute garbage.\n\nGraphics wise it looks like a early playstation 2 game, which admittadely doesn't bother me all that much but where there's a lot of clipping and sort; that's when it starts to bug me.\n\nControl wise, the game is kind of weird. It uses WSAD, or the right mouse button for movement. Which I can appreciate given that sometimes I just want to be lazy and use only the mouse. That being said, the character's movements are as if they tried to add momentum to their steps to make it seem more realistic when running, but it just makes it feel sluggish and at times unresponsive. The mouse control during some of the minigames can be teeth grindingly aggravating, especially with the wire minigame.\n\nNow, gameplay wise it's an adventure game. You go around (sometimes in stealth mode). solve puzzles, do minigames, collect items etc etc. It's barebones and has just enough variety to call it a game.\n\nSo, the game has a stealth mechanic which involves either The Doctor, Amy, or both hunched over in a crouch trying to avoid whatever the enemy is at the time. Often times, it's easy to deal with as the enemies either patrol or just stay in one area. The only time I had a pain with it was during tight corridors where the partner's A.I. would act up and either get caught on something or decide to take a few extra seconds getting into the hiding spot, causing them to be seen and having to restart. Another problem I had involved the enemy A.I. as sometimes trying to lead them into certain positions can be a pain due to them getting caught on walls or objects. It's especially aggravating considering you have to lure a couple of enemies into the same room in order to continue, only for one to constantly walk away after getting it near the door time and time again.\n\nWould I recommend the game? Sure, if you wanted more of Matt Smith's Doctor and the episodes quit doing it for you. The game has a nice variety of facts from both the real world and the Doctor Who universe which made getting all the collictibles actually worth it. The episodes are pretty well written and the sound design is good enough for my eyes.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't buy this game for $20. Even if it has several episodes, the gameplay can be frustrating to the point that it's a chore to get through certain sections. If anything, I'd get it at $5 maybe $7.50.\n\nDoctor Who fans, you deserve a better game than what you've been offered so far with this and the Eternity Clock.","February 6","false","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These Doctor Who games are educational, they have interesting plots, and they have very enjoyable game-play.\n\nWhen the TV show Doctor Who first started up it was meant to be educational, but the plan for it to be educational soon went down the drain as they introduced more and more aleins, they started to make the show less about history and more about science fiction and more about the future. Doctor Who was the perfect vessal for education, as it had the excuse for being in the past with time travel and it was facinating with the aliens it had in it. The game is educational and does it really well, it gives you facts about everything, which are things you can collect, it puts you back in time to certain places and teaches you about Guy Fawkes, and it puts you somewhere cold and teaches you about ice and snow and such.\n\nThis game contains five different stories for you to explore and play. It contains the classic Cybermen, the Daleks, the interior of the TARDIS, The Vashta Nerada, and the Gunpowder Plot. These plots in the game feel like Doctor Who epsidoes when you are playing them, they are packed full of dialogue, action, and puzzles. Each story has the characters of The Doctor (11th), Amy Pond, and Rory Williams as playable characters. All three playable characters in the game are voiced by their actors in the show, which is quite nice to have in a Doctor Who video game.\n\nThe gameplay is quite different than a few Doctor Who games, this is not a platformer, instead you can roam around and control your character outside of a 2D path. You can use the Doctor's sonic which will bring up a puzzle, because no Doctor Who game is complete without an annoying puzzle. The puzzles aren't always extra things that comes up on screen, sometimes you have to do a stealth puzzle and try not to be seen, and I must say there are a lot of stealth puzzles, most likely because the Doctor is passive and if he comes across a threat there's always the option to sneak by it.\n\nOverall this is a very nice game, the graphics are a bit old, and there are a few glitches, but it is playable. If you are a Doctor Who fan you will enjoy this much more thyan if you weren't, as it does have a lot of references, and even quite a lot of references to Classic Who. And if you're not a Doctor Who fan, you may enjoy it, but you might end up being very confused and have a bad introduction to Doctor Who.","January 25","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whovians may continue to read:\n\nThe Adventure Games contain 4 episodes (+ The extra episode the gunpowder plot which is significantly longer than the other 4) serving as mini episodes (about an hour playtime each) during the 11th Doctor and Amy Pond era of the show. The mini episode aspect is even more evident with a pre opening teaster, the well known opening of the TARDIS flying in the time vortex and closing credits.\n\nWhile the stories themself are nicely written and there are many injokes in the dialogue and what not. As an interactive story the game does a nice job.\n\nWhere it fails though is game play: very repetitive mini games such as avoiding enemies, wiring up some stuff or guiding stuff in and out of mazes. On top of that navigation is also not very well and more often than not glitchy. In terms of game play this is just a total failure.\n\nTherefore if you are a Whovian and can cope with the above points, go get it when you get a bargain on it. Otherwise not really worth the price.

There are many who are quick to put doctor who game down, but its not like there are lots of them to choose between, so were lucky to have any at all..... they really should make more. This game and eternity clock are fun and im have a great time with both. Yes i know the grathics are not xbox one standards in this game lol, thats because this game is some years old and it is a BBC game.... but you dont really notice when your playing as your focused on the puzzle at hand going at a quick pace.... But i can tell you the doctor is as quirkey and barmey as usual which we like.. he's a real mad hatter lol","May 11","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is very buggy and glitchy but the storyline is pretty good. Some of the mini-games are hardcore annoying while others are extremely enjoyable. I would only recommend this to those during a Steam sale as it is not worth the wage. I've only played half of the game so far but it is enjoyable from what I've played thus far.\n\n6/10 for Humans and Time Lords alike. (Or both, wink wink professor).","May 15","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only reason I played this game or tried to finish it was because it\'s Doctor Who. My favorite TV show of all time. Especially because it has daleks.\n\nIt seems to be like a total conversation of low budget adventure games. Nothing great unfortunately.","May 31","false","41.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
