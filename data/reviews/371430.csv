Deliberately without a skip turn function, it changes smoothly between just going for it and taking another second to ponder about what to do next.\nAmmunition for your 3 weapons has to be found (only very late into the game I actually ran out of ammo for 1 of my guns for a while), and encourages you to swap between them to get the most out of it.\n\nThe late game can get quite tense, but you can take your time to think about your next move.\n\n- 3 weapons which upgrade over the course of the game (short range gun, AoE grenade launcher, long range and piercing plasma rifle)\n- 3 characters with different starting stats\n- procedural level generation with secret rooms and randomly spawned entrances to special levels\n- good amount of loot, most pickups have limited durations (like x turns of invisibility - these have to be consumed in your 10-slot inventory, so you can decide when to use them)\n- 1 life per run, no carry-over progression besides some sort of enemy codex (using found data cards on terminals)\n- nice, consistent pixel art\n- sound works... could be a bit meatier but doesn't get in the way\n- controls work fine, keyboard only, mouse only or controller just do their things, use whatever you prefer.\n- NO crashes\n\nFor me it hits the sweet spot in between hectic shooters like nuclear throne or dungeon souls and micro-management heavy turn based games that drag on forever. A successful run takes me about 90 minutes which feels just right.\n\nFrom what I can see, the (core of the) game is finished and a lot of fun to play, the developer is relaxed and responsive; no reason to believe that this one will be one of those broken early access turds that gets abandoned once it's cashed in.\nThumbs up.","September 15, 2015","true","40.6"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","0"

But wait, before you dismiss it, understand that it is really well done, and definately has earned its place in competing with NT. While I love Nuclear Throne, this title may actually get more of my time because IMhumbleO anytime you add turn-based mechanics, things get better.\n\nI said I would only boot it up to check it out, but four hours flew by - that rarely happens to me. Dissertation work was put on hold for this mother******.\n\nPros:\n+Butter smooth gameplay with either a mouse/keyboard or from the couch with a controller. You can play as fast or slow as you want.\n+Artwork is pretty great\n+Utterly addictive one-more-run kind of coffee-break game here.\n+Unlockables such as a bestiary and new playable characters that have different stats (not just skins).\n+Daily runs.\n+Learning curve is not as steep as many other roguelikes.\n+No cheap deaths.\n\nCons:\n-Probaby best in 1-2 hour play sessions maximum (like any coffee break game).\n\nTotally worth full price IMO. I will get a lot of mileage out of this, plus there is more to come a la Early Access.","December 12, 2015","true","21.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","19","22","3","0"

The randomly generated levels work perfectly, it's nice to see different layouts each time I play and the area sizes feel just right. Not too big or small.\n\nThe turn based game-play adds even more value for me, I love being able to plan. It's so much better than just running around in a big mess of explosions and bullets like a lot of traditional rogue-likes.\n\nThe variety of weapon upgrades, items, power ups and enemies that I've encountered are interesting and the addition of data cards makes it all that more interesting. My personal favourite item so far is the mine, I enjoy pacing about at distance and letting the enemy come to me, only to walk straight into my mine!\n\nThe data cards seem to be rare, unless I've just been really unlucky. But this is the way it should stay I think, if they drop too often, it would feel like less of a reward when players find them.\n\nThe pixel art is nice and bold, the music works for the settings, creates some nice atmosphere, coupled with really nice weapon sound effects.\n\nIt's not very often that a rogue-like pulls me away from my work, which happens to be making games too. So from one developer to another, you've done an excellent job with the balance in Space Grunts.\nI'm looking forward to playing more!\n\nKeep up the solid work!","October 7, 2015","true","4.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","1"

I will update this review as needed.\n\nForgettable name aside, Space Grunts is actually a pretty interesting game. It plays like a hybrid of a turn based roguelike/roguelite with the pace of an arcade game. The gameplay itself is pretty simple. When you move or shoot, enemies can do the same. There's no skip turn button, so you need to think a bit about how you're going to position your marine to deal with enemies. The gameplay loop is that you spawn into a level and you move room to room clearing out baddies. You start with three weapons: A shotgun, a railgun, and a frag grenade. As you progress through the levels, you'll find more items that mix things up. It's simple and fun. If you're a fan of roguelikes/roguelites, give this a try. For $10, it's a good deal.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to pick up.\n- Polished for an Early Access title.\n- Decent aesthetic and sounds.\n- Fast paced and fun gameplay.\n\nCons:\n- Visually simple.\n- Not as deep or complex as the genres it draws from.","September 15, 2015","true","0.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Unfortunately for me, his recent games tend to become a tad too difficult for me old cheezer.\n\nSpace Grunts is a game changer. While it stays true to the OrangePixel look & feel, it empowers the player to dictate the pacing. You can play it as fast as a shooter. You can advance more carefully, "one step at a time", considering the options.\n\nNow even I am able to compete for the daily challenges. I'm happily spending about twice the playtime as my competitors, but oh boy the feeling of topping the leaderboard for the first time! ;)\n\nOn the technical side, the early access version is exemplary.

Space Grunts ticks all the right boxes: turn-based combat but still fast paced; well balanced; sci-fi theme; cool music, and last but not least, gorgeous colourful pixel art. For an early access game, it seems incredibly polished. Additionally, unlike many rogue-likes, the diffuculty curve is fairly gradual, there isn't a giant spike. Everything seems very balanced.

The characters are largely the same, most items aren't particularly interesting or fun, and the play pattern for winning is easy to execute once you've figured it out. The controls are clunky at best and misclicking in a fight is one of the only reasons for ever taking significant damage. There are handful of enemy types, but only two that required adjusting strategy at all. While I think there are a lot of better games in the genre, I can see this appealing to someone who wants a simpler roguelite experience. However, to those people, I would still recommend passing on this game for now. If Orangepixel make significant adjustments to the controls, I'll feel comfortable giving the thumbs-up.","May 14","false","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Some unusual directions have been taken with the gameplay, and while some aspects still seem roughed out, the quality of the art, sound, and interface design already feels like a finished game.\n\nThe decision to give the player a set of three upgradeable weapons is something rarely seen in a roguelike, and it plays out well in Space Grunts. While the progression for each weapon is fairly linear, having three weapon choices at all times does make the game feel more like an action game, as you quickly swap weapons between kills. I also appreciate the wide variety of items, but I never feel the need to use them early game, while in the late game I find myself running low.\n\nI'm very impressed with the art for the game, the level design, weapon sounds, music and effects all reek of charm. The simple iconic images do a great job at making the game easier to read, which makes it faster to play, which makes it more like an action game. The explosions, flying shells and dirt, and screen shake add a satisfuying visceral quality. While it's already been mentioned, it bears repeating: the gun sound effects are very entertaining.\n\nDespite the polish of the art, there are still some rough edges to the gameplay.Mainly there is not enough variety in completing the series of rooms that make up a level. The flame trap rooms are an interesting, and boss rooms are great, but the vast majority of rooms in the game involve tackling a few opponents that you are well equipped to defeat. Difficulty feels patchy at the moment, with early levels too easy, and later levels leading too often to a sudden, unexpected death. There are three classes to pick from, but their primary status feel unequal. Strength (HP) can be upgraded by Bionics items, and is generally unexciting, while Tech (Starting weapons) and Luck (Item Find) are both very important. If this was a completed game I would feel more uncomfortable about these elements, but given that the game is super fun while it is still incomplete, I'm fantasizing that it will be amazing when it's finished.\n\nSpace Grunts does still feel a bit incomplete, but given the quality of the existing work plus the frequent and meaty updates I believe we can expect great things.","September 25, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's great! No troubles using my PS4 gamepad over bluetooth either!\nThe mechanics are straight forward and it's just the right kind of replayable for me. I was already a fan of the Orangepixel style and it's amazing how it came together so well in a turn-based game format. Still juicy, love the action, love the ability to plan out your attack on a room.\nThe balance of ammo and health drops feel pretty good to me so far (only played a little bit at the time of writing so who knows what the future holds); the levels and setting are just a nice change of pace over the typical high-fantasy of similar titles. I only bring that up to say that I appreciate variety, and not to suggest one setting is superior to another.\nIt doesn't appear that you're going to find the seriously in-depth story-telling and lore like you might find in games like Caves of Qud (or insert another previously released rogue-ish-turn-based-action-adventure game that you might love); for me this is perfect.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ingeniousclown/recommended/371430/","ingeniousclown","ingeniousclown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ingeniousclown/","339 products in account","Space Grunts is a fun little rogueLITE (I'll explain later on why I won't dub it as a roguelike) with charming and unique pixel art and fast turn-based gameplay.  It's a fun and addictive time killer and you can find yourself saying "one more run" very often.  It's learning curve is very low, meaning anyone can jump in and have a good time, not having to worry too much if the item they are about to use will just straight up kill them.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LYtnlRTbLA\n\nSpace Grunts is fun and it does what it does pretty well, but I can't call it a roguelike.  There's not enough nuance.  There are no player levels and no character skills (outside of base stats per different character that can't be changed).  This means that your gameplay is pretty much completely defined by the drops you get or don't get throughout a given run.  Games like The Binding of Isaac do that same thing, but Isaac lets your own skill overcome adversity because of the real-time combat.  Turn-based means you can plan your actions, but I don't think it's feasible to avoid damage entirely.\n\nYou characters have 3 (4 if you pick up a crowbar) weapons with limited ammo and different uses.  You can also find various single-use tech (items) in your travels that heal you, create traps for your enemies, augment your firepower or give you a damage buffer (almost like temporary HP).  The limited ammo and single-use items puts a lot of emphasis on strategy and luck, hoping that you get the right ammo or right weapon upgrades or right tech at the right time.\n\nUnfortunately, this game isn't for me, as I felt gameplay felt relatively shallow.  However, some of my complaints are the very reason it is so easy for people new to the genre to pick up and play it.  I can see this very much being a soft introduction to the much more complex genre of REAL roguelike games (think stuff like Tales of Maj'Eyal, for example).  It's obviously crafted with care and in the image of the creator, who seems to be very active on these forums.  I love seeing that!","January 12","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/recommended/371430/","uncleyar","UncleYar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/","2120 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLove the idea of this game since it reminds me of DoomRL, one of my favorite roguelikes. Could this be its better-looking cousin?\n\nUnfortunately my initial impression wasn't very good:\n- I find controls awkward. Initially I thought you could move with the arrow keys and shoot with the mouse, but you have to use either one or the other.\n- When playing with keyboard you have to change your facing before moving in that direction. This has no gameplay purpose since turning on yourself is doesn't cout as a turn. This makes moving around artificially slow, I'd much prefer "twin-stick" style controls, think Binding of Isaac. It could work very well on a gamepad, on keyboard (two sets of directional keys, one to move one to shoot, or with the keyboard to move and the mouse to shoot,\n- Using the mouse is error-prone because clicking an enemy will shoot at it (if you have line of sight) or run towards it and your doom if you don't. Basically if you're a fast player like me or misinterpret the visual cues you're in big trouble. Clicking an enemy you can't shoot should do nothing.\n- Keyboard keys are rebindable - good - but the keyboard controls occasionally interprets me pressing the key once as two moves - very bad. WASD doesn't work by default and you can't use Enter to choose things in the main menu which gives the initial impression that keyboard doesn't fully work (two bindings for each commands would be nice).\n- You can't wait a turn to wait for enemies to move (a staple of turn-based roguelikes), so you're occasionally forced to move into enemy line of fire, which I really hate.\n- Initial 2-3 levels have very little challenge, I was getting seriously bored.\n- So far level design is completely linear with only one path to traverse the whole level, which means that if an explosion leaves some permanent toxic stuff on the floor you can be forced to walk through it, no alternate path for you.\n- Drop rate from crates is low but they occasionally give very good loot so you feel forced to burst them all. You spend a lot of ammo that way; there's a crowbar but it has limited uses and switching to the crowbar everytime to clean up a room is tedious. I think you should just be able to melee the crates for free.\n- You have to use all consumables from the inventory screen, being able assign a few into quickslots with their own keys would've made the gameplay more fluid.\n- Cheap deaths (in a permadeath game!): some enemies don't follow the same rules as you and can fire at you directly and through obstacles while you have to shoot in straight lines. Also, when you open doors enemies can sometimes get a first shot at you. In both cases if you're low on health you're doomed to die without being able to do anything about it, a big design sin for a roguelike.\n- Explosions graphics are cool but they don't accurately convey the squares that were affected, and for explosive enemies you can't quite see if you were damaged by the explosion.\n- Enemies seem to vary in health (your damage with weapons is constant) which makes the tactical game of positioning with the enemies unreliable, i.e. you can't plan out how much damage you'll receive by tackling a specific enemy. I think enemies should have fixed health (but you can have different colored ones for variations of the same enemy).\n\nStill there are some things I liked:\n- Thank gods, it avoided the balance-breaking mistake of having power/health upgrades that stick between runs\n- Nice pixel art, very well animated with nice explosions\n- Explosive barrels (muhahahaha!!!) and destructible walls\n- Only three weapons (so far at least) but they each have their purpose, and you have to carefully choose which one to use, and conserve your ammo.\n- You can select weapons with number keys.\n- Getting weapon upgrades doesn't happen too often but is very satisfying because you can really feel the difference visually and in terms of damage. Other upgrades (inventory, skills) are even rarer but I think it's well-dosed.\n- Secret rooms\n- Some explosions don't expand in a single turn, so you can run away from them, pretty cool\n- Some interesting inventory items, mostly consumables but some with permanent effect\n- Traps can be used against enemies\n\nOverall some good elements, but some very annoying flaws and some bad design points. I didn't find the overall gameplay as exciting as in DoomRL, in particular due to a lack of early challenge and controls I dislike. I'm on the edge on whether I should recommend it or not, but I'm going with negative since I won't be coming back to it. Let's see what can of improvements can be brought to the game during early access...","December 13, 2015","false","1.5"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","3"

The year 2476, Earth's space-federation has been building moon-bases across the galaxy. One of those moon-bases has been sending a distress signal. Space Grunts are a group of intergalactic "problem" solvers, sent to investigate..\n\nYou play one, out of a team, of Space Grunts, and your mission is simple: find your way into the moon-base, and figure out what has happened. You'll have to fight your way through aliens, robots, security drones and base-systems. Find the lower levels of the moon-base, and get to the core of the problems.\n\nConsumables - A large collection of consumables can be found all over the moon base from weapon enhancers, to destructive toys, armor, explosives, system-hacks, and more. Use the items wisely to advance deeper into the moon-base.\n\nWeapons - Starting with three standard Grunt weapons, you will be able to enhance them for more fire-power and range. On your way you'll also find alternate weapons, and melee weapons. - Highly Recommended!\n","January 11","true","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Howling monsters and thundering explosions make the dungeon crawling feels like a rock show.\n+1: Secrets and clues.  Beware of special walls and containers.\n+2: Unforgiving combat.  It takes me 45 hours to beat the game for the first time.  I really enjoys to solve in-game problems one after another.\nCons:\n\n-1: Annoying glitches.\nThe mouse pointer moves to the center of the screen every time I start the game.  I play the game by keyboard or X-Box controller, so I have to move the mouse pointer out of game window when running in window mode.\nThe fouth weapon slot cannot be remapped.\nMy X-box controller cannot be detected in full-screen mode sometimes.\nThere is only one save at a time.  And every level can only be saved once.   -2: Low replayability.  It takes me 48 hours to use all three characters to beat the game.  After that, the game fails to make me stay longer.\nSimplified Chinese comment:\n\n一周目很好玩！但是用三个玩家人物各自通关一遍之后，至少我不想继续玩了。\n\n我写的中文介绍[trow.cc]。","May 22","true","51.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
