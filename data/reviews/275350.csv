This is exactly the mobile game, ported to PC without changing anything. It has no resolution options (and only a low/high quality setting, nothing else). It only runs in window mode or in a stretched (!) fullscreen mode. Really, really bad. I have a native resolution of 1920*1200, so why the hell can't I get this exact resolution in the game? Instead I get this ugly, stretched mess. But ok, I can live with it. Tower defense games were never about the graphics, right? The interface is exaxtly what I know from the iphone. They really didn't change a thing. For instance, if you drag a weapon to a free slot in the armory, it becomes zoomed in in your hand/mouse cursor, which makes sense on a mobile device. It looks horrible and ridiculous on a full HD display though. And they added absolutely nothing. No achievments, no trading cards, no nothing. I really have to assume, that the developers only wanted to make a quick buck with this.\n\nWhich is really a shame, because the game itself is actually great. It is exactly what i expect from a tower defense game. Looking at all the newer TD games which try to implement more interaction (like running around with a hero), this is rather old-school. And it is exactly how i like my TD games. Searech for optimal spots for your towers. Find the right balance between getting lots of interest each round and not dying. Love it! And the commander is a nice addition to the already great gameplay of its predecessors. It gives you a little bit of additional interaction, but not too much. For me personally the commander is about as much interaction (besides placing and upgrading towers) as I can take. Perfect!\n\nI really like this game, and that's why it gets a thumbs up. I was really struggling though, because this port is basically a punch in the face of all Sentinel fans. I would have expected more. I pay more money for this than on the iphone after all, so I think i can expect more, right? Whatever, the game is still a lot of fun. If you like traditional tower defense games, this might be the game for you.","February 7, 2014","true","2.3"," 103 of 123 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","103","123","2","3"

The Steam version suffers from being a lazy port. The controls haven't been properly reworked for PC, the slider where you select your mission is slightly bugged (clearly intended to be swiped with a finger and just badly ported over for mouse), and the graphics are poorly detailed when viewed on a normal sized computer monitor or TV.\n\nI think if these guys had just put in a bit more effort, it could have been a good port. As it is for now, there are better tower defense games to be played instead.","February 8, 2014","false","16.2"," 68 of 82 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","68","82","0","0"

This is primarily a fixed path, but flexible tower placement game. Not a maze builder.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of play, it appears to just be a bug free, direct port, of the mobile version. That is not necessarily a bad thing. I already own the android version and have beaten it before. Too many mobile to PC ports are buggy right off the start. So far this works fine for me in either full screen or windowed mode. Thumbs up to a smooth mobile to PC transition for the Devs.\n\nIt’s a good addition for fans of the genre, especially if you don’t already have it on your tablet or phone. This is best for those that prefer a more 2D tower defense where you focus on upgrades and tower placement like Onslaught, Fieldrunners, iBomber Defense, or Defender’s Quest.\n\nIf you prefer a more complex fully 3D tower defense that uses more of the PC’s gaming power I’d recommend checking out Prime World: Defenders, Dungeon Defenders, Sanctum (1 or 2), or Defense Grid.\n\nI enjoy both the simple 2D and complex 3D Tower Defense games. So I was more than happy to add Sentinel 3 to my Steam collection.","February 3, 2014","true","1.5"," 63 of 90 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","63","90","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/275350/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","This game BARELY cuts the mark for that yes, and it's for the reason everyone assumes: the port is clearly an afterthought and I was never allowed to forget that while playing. For example, I eventually started pausing mid level every time I wanted to upgrade a tower, because actually selecting one with the mouse is a hit and miss thing - it tries to grab and slide the screen instead, which is utterly useless since the whole map fits fine in my screen. And don't start me on the level selection slider. The appropriate asking price tipped the scale towards yes for me.\n\nThat huge aside aside, this is a solid tower defense game of the more traditional variety, with fixed paths and some interesting mechanics - just don't expect a reinvention of the wheel. The maps of the campaigns repeat once too often for my liking, however they're intersting enough and at times challenging. I like the difficulty, though the curve can occasionally be steep and some grinding seems to be encouraged. It is mildly addictive, the graphics are fine and scale alright, the music is okay but can get very repetitive. All in all, as TDs go this one is lukewarm: decent, not great, not bad.\n\nPet peeve: It's really sparse on information about the levels, the enemies, the towers and the upgrades. I especially miss details on the enemy types (an icon and a level are not info enough in my book). More practical details at the level selection page would also help plan what towers/weapons to pack along. However, since many of the maps are pretty solidly geared towards one or two winning strategies, you could consider that part of the design: this is less a plan ahead and stratgize sort of TD and more a "jump right in and take the hits as they come" one. Personally, I consider the lack of information just another sign of a game made for smaller screens and less reading.\n\nSo buy? Yes, I suppose, if you're a TD fan and running dry. Especially if it's discounted and practically free. There are many MANY great TD games for PCs out there and this isn't one of them, but it gave me enough hours of fun to pay for itself.","May 17, 2014","true","8.8"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

Shame there is no such option. With that said - game is not exactly bad, but it has a lot of flaws. But let's start with good part - game has lots of maps (35+), lots of modes and difficulties and nice interest system where you have to keep your defences to minimal, which adds to tactical part. That's about it for the good part.\n\nNow about bad stuff - first of all, game is  really  long. Each stage (except maybe very early ones) lasts at least an hour. On it's own that wouldn't be so bad, but you can't speed up the game more than 2x. Considering that some games has 3x, 5x, even 9x speed ups - very poor desicion. Next thing - in every stage to collect more money (and gain more interest money) you have to do your best to kill enemies withlou building anything. So you have to use abilities and your commander (yup, you have movable unit to help you) for a good 20-30% of the stage. Way to go for a TD, instead of tactical managing limited resourses you must jump around to collect money. Another bad thing is - there are basically only 8 types of enemies with small variations, nothing interesting really. If that was a game for 20-30 hours, it'd be ok, but game for 100h+? Definitely bad. And there is more! Towers are majorly disbalanced, by the end of the game you really need only 4-5 towers from given 12 - as if 12 was too much to make it more or less balanced. Well, that's it for big ones, i may also add couple small ones - bad graphics (but i guess if you play TD you don't care like me, still had to write about it), repetitive music (remember 100h+ of gameplay, on the other hand you can turn it down - again, like i did) and small glitch when you choose chapters, but that's not really an issue, just a bit annoying.\n\nSo. After all that you may ask why i even put "recommend" on it. Well, not everyone completes games on 100%. If you want to complete campaign and leave, i suppose, it's not so bad. I give this game 5/10, because it's badly flawed and artificially prolonged, but you may still enjoy it. Just don't go too deep.","July 31, 2015","true","128.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

While this may be an phone app port, I have to say I'm really enjoying it.  Personally I have more problems with console ports (due to poorly implemented keybinding options or only supporting the XBOX controller; Deadpool being a HUGE example of this) than phone app/flash ports, so this was a pleasant surprise when I found how much I'm enjoying a game that was originally a phone app.  The only gripe I have about it is the fact that you have to click & drag the towers to the location you want to drop them to, which is a bit of an issue if you accidentally release the button & drop the tower somewhere you don't want to (luckily not all areas in a map are buildable).  Other than that, I would probably give this game an overall rating of 8 out of 10.  Music would be 9 out of 10, it lost a point for being somewhat repetitive (the music you hear in the trailer is exactly what you hear in the game).","March 3, 2014","true","21.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KermodeBear/recommended/275350/","KermodeBear","KermodeBear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KermodeBear/","478 products in account","This game has all the trappings of the tried and true tower defense formula:\n\nThere's the paths, baddies walk along it. There's the Land / Air dichotomy. There's the cheap damaeg tower, the slowing tower, the damage over time tower, the expensive zapping tower. There's some abilities you can use when you need that extra ooomph against the baddies when you need it. There's the mechanic of gaining interest on the money you've saved. There's occasional baddies that are resistant to X. There's the standard list of enemies: The Standard Baddie, The Swarm, The Slow Tough Guy.\n\nSo far, it has all the trappings of a standard TD game.\n\nThe feature that makes Sentinel 3 different than most tower defense games is your Sentinel, a robotic character that can jump back and forth between gates on the map and engages in combat on its own. It has its own set of abilities and can be leveled up over time.\n\nUnfortunately, the Sentinel isn't engaging or interesting enough to raise this game from generic to something special. This is especially true in the later waves of the later maps: The Sentinel's capabilities are of little importance compared to your towers as the game progresses.\n\nAlso, there's very little in the way of interesting choices.\n\nThere's a limited number of slots for towers available to you, but you can purchase more over time. Even if the tower selection were more limited, it's possible to beat the campaign and get quite far in the Endless modes with just 3 different towers. Tower placement, in general, isn't all that critical either. Stick the slowing towers in the right spot, spam damage everywhere else.\n\nAlthough the different levels of difficulty do indeed make the game more difficult, they don't make the game more interesting or encourage you to make different choices.\n\nThe only real choice one has in the game is where to spend the upgrade points on your Sentinel; you don't have enough to completely max out all of the stats. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the Sentinel is almost inconsequential later on, so your choices here don't matter all that much past the first 20 waves or so.\n\nIf you're a Tower Defense Junkiie and absolutely must play everything available to you then you might want to purchase this. For everyone else you may want to pass, despite the low price of the game itself. Better, more engaging experiences can be found on many Flash game sites for free.","February 7, 2014","false","50.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

The levels are all very bland and "samey," there are very few enemy types (although they can vary in strength amongst their kind), and it is very easy. The game never introduces anything which forces you to change your play style; your first two towers are all that you need to beat most every level.\n\nThe game tries to add some spice to the typical TD recipe by including a commander unit who can move from one key point to another and engage the enemies directly, except that it isnt very well implemented. There is no penalty if he dies, and he doesnt really do much for a very long ways into the game. The key locations that he can guard are basically capable of handling themselves without his help, as long as you add one bomb turret and a couple of lasers.\n\nThe game feels short, even though it takes awhile to beat. There are only a small number of maps available, so the game repeats several of them with "different" waves of enemies (which dont feel different at all due to the limited variety) and tries to extend gameplay by making you face absurdly high wave counts (50+ for most levels).\n\nI like TD games, and i have played a ton of them... but this game felt half ♥♥♥♥♥ and amateur.
