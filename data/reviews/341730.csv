The gameplay is fluid and action based. You control helicopters moving into the warzone to pick up wounded soldiers, equipment and ammunitions over 25 progressively challenging levels.\n\nThere are 4 different helicopters to unlock; the last being that sexy Chinook! Each time you upgrade your helicopter your capacity, armor and guns get better but your overall control greatly diminishes. The music and graphics are both well done and exceeded my expectations; I didn't realize the level of shadows and lighting detail that could be achieved with something like this. I dig it.\n\nIt's worth the $4; but definitely grab on sale if this sounds like your thing!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dionw/recommended/341730/","dionw","Solarin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dionw/","1313 products in account","This is a fabulous little game (4.5 out of 5), reminding me of a mix of Choplifter, Fort Apocalypse and a little Desert Strike, with bright colors and a nice 2.5D voxel-look. This game is among my current top favorites. It allows for a quick round or two-three trying to complete a map/mission, so is quite inviting for casual play. The controls need a little getting used to, but once you've finished one or two maps they do feel natural and add to the feel of the game (I'm using gamepad controls).\n\nBasically there are two "styles" of play, sometimes mixed in one mission: what I would call "normal flight" where one rescues soldier or brings in equipment while bringing down or avoiding enemy fire, and "fort apocalypse" mode where one navigates the heli through cavernous parts. There are in total 25 maps/missions for now. My favorites are the ones that require a little planning on taking down the enemy in the right order to be able to survive the mission. I care a little less for the "fort apocalypse" parts because I like flying that chopper, not inching forward (although once more practised, one can fly through caves with higher speed).\n\nCompletionists can try to finish every mission for silver or gold medals, and collect up to five extra items per mission that give rise to soldier dog tags. I feel the game is fun enough to attempt this.\n\nThe game has a cool intro screen by the way, with the heli blades spinning in slomo. Bottom line: recommended!\n","September 25, 2015","true","9.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Old school Choplifter in a Minecraft setting.  Simple aim is to fly helicopter, with very limited controls, and rescue troops and vehicles from enemy territory. You may need to shoot and/or avoid enemies at times as well. Charming with  cool physics.\n\nThe controls are what will make you love or hate this game. Much like the old Lunar Lander/Thrust/Oids type games, you can only control left thrust, right thrust or both at the same time which makes you feel like you are trying to balance on a bowling ball. I enjoy the challenge, reminds me somewhat of the old Desert Combat Apache controls. But when it gets windy, it becomes extremely challenging to control, especially if you have the controls set to the professional option.\n\nI nice diversion from all the modern popular 3d shooters everywhere, and a game that requires a bit of hand eye coordination.","December 24, 2015","true","2.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It was ported,  but it got updates to it so you can keybind and all that goodness. I do sort of like it, but I wouldn't play through all 25 levels unless it was the only game I had installed and had no internet. The controls are a bit clunky when turning because it turns you SO for over that you can sometimes crash into a tree without going very far up first. To go straight up, you have to press your laft and right buttons at the same time. The shooting is a little odd felling if you have your keys binded to for right on your keyboard, unless you have auto mode on. I give this game a 5/10 because I kind of want a refund.

At times you'll need to rescue a certain number of troops somewhere on the map and other times pick up and bring home your equipment such as vehicles.  The maps are 3D, retro block style graphics.  The graphics actually aren't bad and are handled well in this game.  The flight patterns are only up and down vertically and left and right horizontally.  There is no real 3D space to fly around in.  Some people have complained about the handling of the helicopter.  While it's true the controls are very simple and can't be changed, the controls are very simple to get used to and allow you full control of the helicopter at all times.  This doesn't mean that the game isn't tricky when controlling your helicopter through tank ammunition, rockets and caves.  The difficulty level increases as you progress through your 25 missions, but I never found the game too frustrating or overly difficult at all.  Easy 100% achievement if you're into that kind of stuff.  Definitely a fun game to play and definitely would recommend it for the right price, $2.50 or less.","April 14","true","12.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It might be a mobile port, but as long as it's enjoyable to play, and this is definitely the case, I don't care ;)\n\nBeen playing for 4 hours, made it to level 16 of 25 (unless there are some bonus levels after that) with (so far) all gold medals and all bonuses (dog tags to find, scattered around the levels). I'm using an xbox360 controller, and that works perfectly (I did not even try with keyboard).\n\nI remained on easy mode for flying (I think pro mode just brings frustration, not what I'm after), and auto fire, though manual fire could be useful on some levels (come to think of it, I don't think I'm able to change that in the options ... so far at least).\n\nThe overall feeling of flying is quite good for such a game imho, the levels have been interesting up to now, and the achievements are very doable, for the most part. Only complaint I have : the dog tags bonuses are really difficult to spot sometimes, leading to some wandering around the maps for quite some time, to find the damn last one ;)\n\nThe price is right, the game is enjoyable, there are trading cards and achievements : this game is totally recomended, even if it's only 10 hours long or so (I'll know exactly later ...)\n\nUPDATE : game finished in a little more than 7 hours. The last level is a real challenge, don't expect a medal with autofire on (and to clarify, this means you'll have to play this one on keyboard + mouse, controller unplugged, the option to turn off autofire is not available otherwise). So, maybe a bit on the short side, but still very much recommended :)","April 1, 2015","true","7.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

You also receive the emotional reward of bringing those little dudes with the waving arms home to their little ladies(presumably also with waving arms??).\n\nThere are some tricky/frustrating parts. Mainly on "Cargo" retreival stages, where the cargo gets out of control & starts revolving around the chopper. This is due to the game's physics, but is rooted in the pilot's (MY) crappy flying. Also trying to land in the trees. tends to result in flipping the chopper, which then drives you into the ground(again faulty operator). My crappy piloting did however make me "kamakaze" into a tank & accidentally blast those VC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into the ground.

No resolution changes. No customizable controls. Uses arrow keys (in 2015, rly?) and mouse and is super annoying to use. Every level the same. You just fly side to side on this same looking small map that has trees and a few areas where you pick up guys and bring them back. That is it, the entire game. You get 3 total weapons, 2 of which are just machine guns. The controls suck. One button moves 1 way, 1 moves the other, hold both same time to rise. Sometimes I would press sideways then press to the other side and my helicopter would just flip all the way over. Sometimes you just tap it and it overcorrects. You commonly catch a side when you are landing and just flip over. Graphics are terrible minecraft ripoff. You have to pick up guys in water but water deals damage to you for some unknown reason. There are trees, but its impossible to tell which are in your plane of map and which are behind or in front. The ones in front block your view when you need to land, leading to you to flip over, which is a stupid design decision. Barely tapping down hurts your helicopter somehow.

World War has reared it's ugly head upon the vastness of the jungle not unlike the graphics presentation in this game. An evil alien cube called the Mindcraft has taken over half of the known universe thus turning everything into blocks. Only you and your trusty helicopter named Lucy can save the entire galaxy from the horrors of having a square shaped bowel movement.\n\nThis game is a documentary about a famous war hero. Complete with highly advanced augmentations left over from a mentally challenged rodent, the A.I in this game is more than ground breaking. At times you will find yourself going only sideways. This is because the known world has been turned into a psuedo-3D by the smoking ruins of monkey urine.\n\nWar is an expensive business. Your assignment is to rescue the sole survivors of the jungle and free them from the clutches of an warlord known as "I Have Under 75 Cents Maybe I Should Buy This Game". You might be thinking that's a strange name. The last person who questioned it is now cleaning the latrine with Q-tips until further notice.\n\nUpon the journey for survival and rescue, this game also includes magic. This is because your chopper will suddenly make it's way into the ground, welcoming you to an early death for no reason. Other times, you will find crates of supplies which are strangely attracted to the roters. Although invisible, this magic is the essence of the once great city known as Steam.\n\nThat once great city of Steam did it's best for it's people, but failed to stop games of this quality from reaching the known galaxy. It is up to you to decide. Support the war effort by not being involved or miserably fail trying to free the world from the grip of Mindcraft.\n\nPros:\nAt least 2-3 minutes of gaming\nUnder $1 dollar\nNo DLC\n\nCons:\nUnder $1 dollar\nNo co-op\nThe A.I of extinct species are smarter\nThis game being allowed to exist in the known dimension of space and time\nNo multi-player\nNo VR support\nCrates are OP\nNo story.

If your heli gets turned slightly the wrong way boom you're dead.\n-extra unlockable helis actually control *worse*. Yes they may have more person capacity and a higher health bar but controls are even more touchy than before especially on higher stages going into caverns and whatnot where space is tight.\n-you have to land *extremely* softly.
