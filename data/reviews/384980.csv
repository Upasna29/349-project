Units ONLY really look good when they're very tiny on screen. Once blown up, they look like a bad flash game.\n\nLet me break it down for you...\n\n1. Still has TABLE/MOBILE resolutions that cannot be changed.\n2. Still has mention of SWIPING/TAPPING.\n3. Has no actual volume control within the game. Only Mute toggle.\n4. The "5 special items" should actually just be Spells but are called items so you have to buy them instead of waiting for mana. (can be purchased with in-game money but it's a hidden means to force you to buy more currency)\n5. Gameplay often results in you sitting there waiting or watching the repeatative combat until you either win or lose horribly.\n6. Even though there is a PAUSE button, the game will automatically pause if you leave the window or Alt+Tab away. This means if you're stuck waiting for a battle to complete, it will not complete without you watching.\n7. Move limit means if you're not preping for chains or doing chains you will not advance without grinding lower levels to have stronger units. Since the game cannot be sped up, auto completed or have anything to deal with grinding, it makes playing even less entertaining.\n8. Weird loading issues and fading hangs. My computer can run this game easily like it's Notepad. I cannot, for the life of me understand why the game fades to a semi-transparent black and often hangs there. Objects are still clickable and if selected will still do as they're intended.\n\nI'm sure I could go on and on about issues with the game but it's just a brainless PC port hoping to cash in on that PC dollar, dollar, with Microtransactions.\n","July 8, 2015","false","0.6"," 190 of 230 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","190","230","11","0"

The main reason I felt compelled to write the review is from reading the negative comments about the game that had been written by people who clearly did not actually play the game long enough to be fair about evaluating it.\n\nThis is a free game that DOES NOT REQUIRE MONEY TO WIN. You just need some patience to farm the coins you need to pay for things. Here is why I say this: The only thing you can buy in the game is coins and lives. There is NOTHING you can buy that you cannot earn. All units and "items" are unlocked just by playing. EVERY level you play will earn you coins. So, if you have time and patience and upgrade the right units as you go, you have to spend NOTHING to progress. I even saw some people claiming that upgrading your items with coins was "hidden" to get you to spend money. FYI, there is only one way to upgrade anything: coins. So, you cannot do the upgrades even with money without finding that "hidden" screen. Also the "hidden" screen is just another tab on the upgrade screen.\n\nNow I have gotten that out of the way I will describe the game. This game is a match 3 driven classic castle defense game: you must keep producing better troops faster than your opponent to crush their base before they crush yours. The troops are just melee or ranged and there is no variation on how they work. The cleverest part of the mechanic is that each unit has a % associated with it. Each level has a certain number you have to fill to play it. So, the stronger the unit, the lower the % and the more different units you have to have. The more different units you have the more symbol types you have to match and the harder it is to make matches.\n\nIn the end, it is an easy to play and a bit grindy free system that is worth playing for a bit. Currently, the achievements are semi-broken and there are some rough edges, but it is basically solid. Those who are willing to try will  enjoy it if they like the genre and those who bash a game just because of a freemium model get over yourselves as you could play this game all the way to the end for free if you are willing to spend the time.\n\nEDIT: I have now completed the game without spending one cent. They have also made a few quality of life changes since I have started. Once I completed the game up till now I purchased one of the coin packages to support the game.","July 11, 2015","true","53.8"," 72 of 109 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","72","109","5","2"

Can't even appreciate the usability of skills despite the time limit/moves while keeping units alive on some sticky situations. The art design is clean compared to some games I don't dare to mention.\n\nThe learning curve of the game is simple that the player pretty much:\nConnect tiles.\nSpawn units then use some items now and then.\nClear a level/got defeated.\nEarn coins\nUpgrade.\nThen do it again.\n\nIt's fun to see units pushing back enemies. Despite that, it's a little bit lacking due to the resolution screen of the game.  Clearly the devs have been lazy modifing this game into a pc platform. The game is a day to perfect without the pay to win function (also when the devs removed the base camp respawner).

You pick what members you would like as a part of your army and then the battle begins. Just like Candy Crush, you match the pieces on the board. When you make these matches, you earn more members to your army, thus making it easier to defeat the opposing army. This game is short, easy, and to the point.

The game is a mobile port, the mobile game have been released 3 months before the pc version. The game is a gem matching game,match3 if you want to call it that, with a twist. With each match you summon troops or get coins, more complex matches getting more troops or coins, with which you must defeat the enemy troops and destroy their base to clear the level. The game have 60 levels, each level having few "zones"( they are something like enemy camps, and at the end of the level a fortress ), two levels modes: limited number of moves or time limit, getting aditional moves/time after each "zone" is finished.\n\nThe game have 12 kind of troops, from which you start with 3(I could say 4 as the first troop unlocks after you finish the first level) and unlock the others along your gameplay. There are also 5 items, you get 5 of each when you unlock it, if you use them all you can purchase others with coins. There is also an upgrade system with which you can upgrade your troops, items, your camp life and the ammount of coins received when you make a coins match.\n\nThe game have microtransactions which only give the option to buy coins. The game can be completed without them.\n\nThe sounds are fitting, although they use some from their previous game, they added more for this one.\n\nThe game doesn't have a story, you just pass through levels.\n\nThe bad side of the game is that around level 15 the difficulty sky-rockets and you end up grinding some time. After you get your troops level to mid-max range you will progress easier to the end of the game. At least for me, finished the game on my third time, the first two times abandoning it because the huge difficulty raise mentioned earlier and the loss of the save files, which are stored in registry, from OS replacement.\n\nIf you interested in this aspect, the game features both trading cards and achievement, but where the game is free to play for card drops you need to invest 9$ or you can just use the booster crafting implemented by steam some time ago.\n\nAltought the third time I kinda enjoyed the game, I will have to give this game a negative review because of the huge difficulty increase that I mentioned earlier and the lack of resolution change.","March 18","false","10.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The game's unique feature is that for every tile matched, soldiers are deployed on to the battlefield. The symbol of the tile determines the type of soldier deployed on to the battlefield. You can also upgrade your soldiers stats from attack power, defense, HP, attack rate and critical rate using your gold earned from your battles.\n\nThe build of the game is basically pay-to-win but you can actually clear the game without spending a single penny. It just takes some strategy depending on how you upgrade your army. The pay-to-win part only speeds up your progression with cash being converted to gold but there's no need for it. I actually cleared the game 100% (well, unless there are new updates) for about 15 hours.\n\nIt's a decent mini-game and yeah, there's no need to rant about this game since it's actually free. In my opinion, there's nothing bad about having mobile/tablet games being ported to PC and being sold on Steam. There are games out there that are only available to mobiles/tablets. The PC community is lucky to have such games but if you hate them so much then just don't buy them or play them. Simple as that.\n\nAnyways, I recommend this game to those who are looking for mini-games that can burn off some of your free time.\n\nMy Personal Rating:Gameplay: 6/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nMusic: 7/10\nStory/Plot: n/a\n\nOverall: 6/10","August 15, 2015","true","14.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","7","8","3","0"

Seriously? Grow up people.\n\nHere we have a simple puzzle-quest oriented match them up with a unique concept. If you've ever played any of the Puzzle Quest series these games aren't a simply bash your face into the keyboard when it comes to matching and expect to win. There is actually strategy involved.\n\nThe "Gems" you match spawn units on your side of the field that march to the opposite side of the field in a Tug-O'-War style. That's where the strategy get's involved. First and foremost, you get to CHOOSE which gems "spawn." From DPS archers that if enemy units get up to they get smacked, to Tanky Knights that stand in the frontline and take damage, to even Melee DPS longswordsman that need a tank in front of them or they get mowed over.\n\nOn TOP of selecting your unit roster and hoping you get the gems in the right place (Or if you're skilled enough manipulating the board to get what you want), You get to selectively upgrade your unit stats. Attack, Defense, Crit, HP, are the basic upgrades but at least with this you can fill in weakspots or boost strengths. Add in you can upgrade your "camp" and your "powerups" this game is quite refreshing IF you like the puzzle genre.\n\nBoohoo it's not optimized for computers. Boohoo its just a mobile to PC port. Boohoo there's grinding. Seriously what? As if every game doesn't have repetitive functions or somewhat lackluster options. This is a FREE GAME.\n\nEdit: Recently I've gotten questions and have noticed people saying over and over it's Pay to Win. Well, I'm pretty sure most of those inquiries are from people who are stuck on 20 below levels and haven't spent anytime working to win.\n\nI have yet to pay a single cent, and am progressing past level 50 at the moment so... I guess I will say the game is: "Pay for Convenience."","July 13, 2015","true","14.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

The game is actually quite nice, but I would say the "occasional" time-based levels are completely unnecessary and basically take the strategy out of a strategy game\n#3. it is still quite functional as you can upgrade your troops and it has a large scrolling level design, similar to Candy Crush\n#4. I DOES NOT HAVE ANY LIVES! Failed a battle? try again, it's OK. Failed a 17th time? keep trying or you could farm older levels.\n#5 also, on farming. If you are complaining about farming for levels, go play Earthboud or any other RPG. The farming necessary for this game is miniscule and I doubt it's really that much of a bore, as you can still play the match-3 gameplay that the game is designed for.\n#6, and finally, It runs smoother than an oiled up baby on a slip n' slide down a hill. No framerate issues, and the loading screen lasts a whoe of 3 seconds every time it appears.\nMy only big complaint is that the game crashed for no apparent reason in the middle of a level, but that's not so bad.","September 17, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

What is not so nice is the fact that it is nigh impossible to earn a lot of coins by repeating stages. Even more so, it will become incredibly difficult to make the necessary coins to affors the pricier upgrades. Hence, we are back at what we loathe - micro-transactions, to get the best out of the units, and even if you only want to do a couple of them.\n\nAnd it isn't a particularly long game either. Battle for Blood only took me approximately 3.5 hours to really complete with one straight playthrough (aided by a micro-transaction, though it rather felt like a macro-transaction). As said, it is easy to play, but the coin-earning is a pain. And even with my love for grinding, I have to say: what you get from the already completed levels is far too little to really warrant leniency there.","December 9, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a pretty basic little game that is more suited to a mobile app store, but I wouldn't say that makes it necessarily out of place on the PC. It's becoming a bit grindy as I go on, but I've only completed 11 stages so far, and I've only failed a stage once. I do like the matching aspect though, in that you match specific gems together in order to put specific troops on the battlefield.\n\nThe aspects I don't like is how the game gives you hints about what gems you can match after only about 1-2 seconds of you not making a move. Usually the hint it gives you isn't even the best combination in order to put the most troops out on the field. Past that, there doesn't seem to be any incentive to max a level with a 3-star rating, as your ratings don't unlock any extras in the game, or anything like that.\n\nAll in all, it's a decent mobile-platform game, and it's FTP, so why not? 7/10","July 13, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

If you know what you're doing and don't make foolish choices on upgrading, it's really that easy. It's a simple but fun game if you're into match 3 games with some sort of combat system. I'd say it was totally worth it.\n\nAnd if you would take the effort to play for one more hour (or less) you can still save that dollar to buy yourself that greasy burger you so desire. 20k coins really isn't that much, so for it being 'Pay2Win' I strongly disagree, unless you consider saving just a bit of time that much of a win.","September 25, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many free games are pay2win; however, that doesn't really matter as much as this game is not multiplayer in any way, so you will not be outmatched if you play freely. Paying will definitely make the game much quicker than it should, but you do not need to pay to make progress in the game and it really does not have a grind element. If you fail a level too many times, it begins giving you consolidation coins which equals the amount you earned through the failure.\n\nNow onto the actual game, overall is a nice match-3 type game with combat and some RPG elements and works out nicely. However, there are two issues I didn't quite like regarding the game. The first is the board generation. It's completely up to luck whether or not you can beat a level though you generally get the good side. Example being one of the levels I played that had a timer instead of a move count, I moved once and it spent the next 30 seconds reshuffling the board because it shuffled a board with no moves thus killing the entire time while I only summoned a measly archer.\nThe second thing I noticed is you don't get anything for 7-match. Was tragic. Less of an issue, but I did spend a while setting that 7-match up.","July 16, 2015","true","17.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I must say I was quite disappointed at the lack of variation in the new units you unlock, four soldier types the same except for higher stats on higher tier units, the same for the spearmen though I might give some variation credit for putting a horse under the second two you unlock. The rest was ok but I wanted more, there was no higher tier of archer which I was really looking forward to until I realised there wasn’t going to be one. Healers and wizards were good, though there could have been a bit more creativity put into them, how about wizards with some AoE fireballs and burn damage, overall there was a lot more thought put into the enemy units, some could even freeze stuff, fly, or brainwash your units. Last and definitely least is the peasants…. I don’t expect them to be spectacular but I’m not sure they count for anything as their weapon is a broom. What happened to the hoes!?!.... or shovels… or anything but brooms.\n\nI downloaded it two days ago and just finished the last level so there is definitely something to be desired in the way of new content. I do like the % stat on the units and how it is used to determine what you can put into a level though I did think it would be nice to have the option to upgrade it, by all means make it super expensive but give that leeway to bump it up a little.\n\nI am a big fan of token match games and all in all this was a very enjoyable one (if a bit short) and I was sucked in from the get go. I love that the game really is completely free and you can gain access to everything without spending a dollar. If you want a good, fun time killer then Battle for Blood is a good option and I would recommend it to anyone who likes these kinds of games.\n\n\n\nLooking forward to the next content update.\n","July 16, 2015","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do not take my review seriously as you shouldn't with anyone else's due to that fact. See for your own eyes how good the game is.\n\nBattle for Blood is a VERY obvious Mobile game port that doesn't seem to be any different from the original game, maknig the whole existence of this game on PC very debatable.\n\nThe game is basically a match-3-style game where matches summon units to attack enemies in a way that reminds me of Starjeweled, a Starcraft 2 custom game that is equally free to play.\n\nOnly here, there are different tiles and each tile type corresponds to a unit type, only unfortunately, they unlock as you complete the levels. The game would benefit from each unit type being rebalanced to allow this as it might add some more replayability, which given the fact that facebook, Kongregate, and even Steam itself offers far suprerior match-3 games...\n\nThe game doesn't really do well.\n\nYou can upgrade units, but ofcourse it doesn't matter too much as the game somewhat depends on RNG, hence being a match-3 game.\n\nThe Lives would work only on a phone where you can be notified when you get more, so you can play more, and the skills feel a bit lacking, the first being one to kill units on the screen, which is really all I used or got.\n\nAltogether the game's art style does remind me of Castle Crashers, so there's that, and the soundtrack is decent, but altogether, the game doesn't stand out to me in any real way.\n\nThe game's mechanics don't work on a PC format too well, and it's obviously an unaltered mobile port.\n\nIf it cost money, you could bet that the reviews would be even harsher, so due to it being Free to Play, reviews don't really mean much, mine included.\n\nI liked it, but once I got stuck, I immediately uninstalled and lost interest. I've played too many far better Match-3s on PC for this game to be at all relevant beyond the .6 hours I played.\n\nThis game gets a 5/10 with me. Just average, despite having a neat set of mechanics that would work better if they were improved upon for the PC version.","July 9, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

The game will become repetitive and expensive when you have to buy powers like "God Finger", It'll also be very expensive when it comes to upgrading your warriors to fight those boney little baddies. BFB is a pretty large game for how simple and small the gameplay is, I think there is 7-8 maps on BFB. I rate BFB 9 out of 10, the 1 missing rate is because of how large the cost of cosmetics and upgrades are for the game, other than that the game is F2P (Free 2 Play) and 100% NOT P2W (Pay 2 Win).","July 8, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","6","24","2","5"

You upgrade your army with gold after each battle, there is an option to buy the "coins" instead of grinding for them.  The game flows smooth with no real grinding up until you hit your first stop. for instance if you lose to many "camps" the games version of lives you are forced to wait a real world time limit.

I mean, the enemies sometimes spawn at a moderate pace, but then suddenly BOOM 10-20 enemies on top of each other and your units can't do anything about it. Even if you manage to spam some out with Archers you get some superficial BS that gets you a defeat because they needed an 'easy' way to want you to pay money for this PoS port of a mobile 'match the tiles' game.\n\nThe grammar needs to be checked over again, doesn't matter if English isn't your first language because you can at least hire someone that has it as their first language.\n\nTHEN the upgrades: They're VERY negligable at most. Even when I fully upgraded a few units they were STILL getting mowed over quite easily so NOTHING actually improves on the units at all it seems. Bug? Nah, I think it's just a way for them to be lazy.\n\nIt's a lazily designed game by lazy developers that want to try and make a quick buck off of people who are ignorant to the fact that while the game is free they try to hook you in by make the game artificially difficult.","August 20, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a lot like candy crush, only more complex as your speed and matching choices effect you adorable little army. The game does get harder as you go along and has a mild sense of strategy when you get to higher levels and need to upgrade your little dudes or make sure you send out the right little dudes as fast as you can by matcing the appropriate wanna be candy crush pieces.

Each time you make a match, you'll summon troops to fight the enemy on said combat area; like any match-3 games, higher matches give you better bonuses (in this case, more units per match). You can also get coins during each match to upgrade your units, and there's also special abilities you can use to help them with the fight.\n\nI must say, I was kind of impressed with this game.

The game is completable without any pay to win. There are also two different game modes in the campain. In one mode you play with a limited amount of moves, in the other one with a time limit. The goal is to bring the enemy base down to ashes. Which is sometimes challenging, but most time a relaxing job. What units you use in the battle is up to you. In the beginning you will only have the amount of units you have to use. But later on, you can actually combine them as it pleases you. The way you upgrade your units can be strength, hp for example, but also something like critical hits and walking speed. The achievements are very easy to get. Some will might need longer, especially people that aren't that good in "connect 3  games". But nothing is impossible, promised. The only bummer I had, was that there is no cloud save. If you're unlucky like me, then your pc get's killed 3 times and you need to start all over again every time. What isn't needed, but I still did, was getting 3 stars. In some stages it is ridiculous to get the 3 star rating. But no achievement or in game goal tells you to do so. The music and sound effects are average by best. I was close to mute the game.
