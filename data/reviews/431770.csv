I plugged in a second mouse so players don't need to be right next to eachother, but you're still sharing the same cursor.\n- No graphics or control options at this time. It defaults to a 16:9 resolution, but it maintained proper aspect ratio on my 16:10 monitor.\n- Game is silent (I recommend playing The Matrix soundtrack in the background).\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n- Controller support.\n- Graphics options.\n- When a fight is over, play the fight back in real time.\n- More weapons and arenas.\n- Character customization.\n- Steam workshop support (for the previous two bullets).","January 31","true","2.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eroing/recommended/431770/","eroing","Eroing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eroing/","871 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA wonderful, simplistic little party game.. easy to learn - hard to master.. it's like toribash light, it doesn't take ages to learn, just click and drag the body part and the timer goes down as you drag.\n\nHowever.. there are a few cons which are present, but it might just be that they are not present YET..\n\n* No replays.\nThis is not just a game about winning, it's a game of wits and doing nice moves, even if they don't make you win. A replay at the end of each combat is a MUST for the future!\n\n* No sound or graphics settings.\nGiven I've only played this game for a very short while, I might just not have found them yet.. but the main menu only has "start" or "quit".. you can still use alt + enter to enter / exit fullscreen though.\n\nConclusion?\nFor 3€ - it's a must have! Since it's, to me, not only about winning.. you don't really need a friend to play it with all the time, even though it's even better with a friend.. I'll let you know after the coming weekend! ;-)\n\nso..\n\nTo be continued...","February 15","true","5.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Its really statisfying seeing your weapon touch the skin of your enemy.\n\nThis game can be related to toribash, only this is a bit more casual.
