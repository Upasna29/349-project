Obviously pandering to the FNAF crowd [which I just so happen to be part of], what appears to be a rather unique and quirky little horror game is actually quite the monotonus and eventually pretty dull experience. What ruins it for me is the flashlight. You have to mash your space bar in order to get it to work sometimes, which again, sounds like a great idea. But it will end up causing you to game over as you fall victim to the Molestation Goat and his numerous buddies as you couldn't flash him in time. It feels like a genuine attempt to cause the player to panic which would help add tension, but it's just straight up infuriating. Even more so when you have to keep the flashlight on when exiting a level.\n\nUnlike most horror games, there's no real build up, no tension and the jumpscares end up becoming a genuine annoyance after the first initial few. They really lose their impact very quickly. Even the plot almost seems non-existant and is presented to us in some rather crude Max Payne-style comic book panels.Game looks nice enough and is marketed pretty well on it's store page, but once you get into it, it's just a rather dull experience sadly. Shame really, as it looked like it had great potential.","September 25, 2015","false","0.5"," 132 of 201 people (66%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","66","132","201","10","12"

They seem to have overlooked two trifling little facts in their quest to become the next Scott Cawthon, however:  Firstly, there is generally only so much room in any given market for a glut of similar product, and secondly, Scott Cawthon, for all his flaws, is actually one very clever mother-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•er.  I'm not convinced the makers of this game are QUITE so clever, though I will certainly acknowledge that they appear to be by no means fully "incompetent".  Perhaps "misguided" would be a better word..?\n\nLet's examine what this game does "wrong", as opposed to what the first three (haven't played the fourth yet) Freddy's games do "right".  Firstly, there's no story or context here.  Well, okay, there's a tiny bit, but only if you read the Steam page and/or are able to make heads-or-tails of the brief comic strip-style series of images which precedes the menu screen (which I kinda doubt you could, had you not read the Steam page first)!  Following an admittedly well-executed if completely danger-free stand-alone tutorial, my first foray into the game proper ended within SECONDS, as one of the muppet-y antagonists snuck up on me from some-angle-or-other, and a quick 'n' nasty jump scare later, it's "Game Over".  Unlike Freddy's, there was no foreshadowing that this would happen, no sound that I am aware of that indicated I was in any danger...nothing.  The next time around I thought to use the quick turn-around button, and sure enough there it was behind me, but no amount of shining my flashlight on it seemed to encourage it to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off, so I hedged my bets and just went straight for the door at the end of the corridor without looking back.  Success!  Next floor, well, obviously the exact same strategy didn't quite pan out, and...well, I'm sure there's some logic and strategy to all this, but I'll be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed if I have the patience to suss it all out.  Which brings me to my next point...\n\nThe Freddy's games have CHARACTER.  You're compelled to keep playing because it's all quite immersive and gives you a sense that maybe, just maybe, you CAN eventually beat it...and it achieves this partially by giving you an in-game tutorial which goes fairly easy on you for a while, as opposed to KILLING YOU IN THE FIRST TWENTY SECONDS of official gameplay.  There's "hard", then there's downright ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing frustrating.  The Freddy's games manage to be both of these things, but you're inclined to forgive them because they at least let you make SOME progress, and you "almost" make it through a level SO MANY ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING TIMES that it gives you the faintest glimmer of hope (Cawthon's a complete ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that way, haha).  This game, on the other hand, is JUST hard and frustrating, and frankly not much fun.  There's no sense of trying to "beat" it...just an absolute recognition that it WILL BEAT YOU, over and over and over again.  It's all psychology, really, and where the Freddy's franchise is really clever and manipulative in this regard, 123 Slaughter Me Street just immediately corners you in an alley and fudge-packs you from behind.  Honestly, I've had more of a sense of accomplishment in some of the JOBS I've had in my life, and trust me, I've had some pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing demoralising "occupations" in my time!  I've tolerated them up to a point, however, 'cause money is at times a necessary evil, but I don't play games to be treated the same way.  There's a big difference between a "challenge" and a straight-up ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-raping, I'm afraid.\n\nThe next big problem here is that it isn't really scary.  A lot of people have slammed the Freddy's games for their heavy-handed "jump-scare" tactics, but I'll happily confess that they worked a treat on me.  Why?  One word:  Suspense.  Jump-scares generally don't work without it.  There's precious little suspense in this game:  You're walking down a corridor, and suddenly you're handed an image of a vibrating, screeching puppet and the words "Game Over".  It feels neither fair nor frightening...just cheap.  Oh, and speaking of puppets:  WHY?!  Again, the Freddy's games have a STORY to them...a "mythology", if you will...a REASON for you being menaced by giant, cartoon-ish chickens and bunnies and bears.  There seems very little reason for such antagonists in this game, other than the fact that it's proved a highly lucrative premise in the not-so-distant past.\n\nIn all honesty, I'm not entirely convinced the world needs another Five Nights at Freddy's game, much less an inferior rip-off of them.  Oh, and to the at least one reviewer so far who seems convinced that they'll unearth some deep, hidden "lore" within the game...good luck, pal.  I think you'll find that's just a pipe-dream you're nursing there.  There's precious little TO this game, period, be it mythos-wise OR gameplay-wise.  To heck with hope...an unending supply of PATIENCE is what you'll be needing here.  Even those of you who fancy themselves as SAINTS should probably pass on this one.\n\nVerdict: 4/10.","September 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 58 of 106 people (55%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","55","58","106","10","3"

Not sure how much inout I can give other than the gameplay is literally just walking down a straight corridor and waiting for things to kill you out of the blue. Your supposed to go down to corridor slowly but they include no way to chage your speed so your just left to tap the w key over and over again which of course makes the levels take a million years to complete assuming you can get through it without getting killed by a creature moving faster than the game is allowing you to travel. Once you get to the end of the level, it's basically a gamble at whether the game will allow you to complete the level or just kill you for no reason. The aim is to have your flashlight on at the end of the level but it turns off at random intervals to simulate that it's broken or something which means you can easily get screwed over by your flashlight turning off at the last second.

I'm not even sure.\n\nNow, for the gameplay. This is pretty awkward. This seems like a first person horror game at first, but it's not really that. You can only move forward, and turn around to face behind you. No, you can't go back, and this is a problem when it comes to certain enemies. I'll talk about it in a bit. You can also look to the sides to check if there's a cute cuddly monster on the perpendicular corridors. In this game, you're in a long ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• corridor. where, as I said before, you may only move forward. To the left and right of the corridor, there are random perpendicular corridors that spawn enemies now and then. You go from point A to point B, simple, right?\n\nIt is at first. You just rush through the seventh floor, and the enemy behind you can't catch you. Then, you move into the sixth floor, and this is where it kinda gets annoying. There's a new enemy now that pops out of the aforementioned perpendicular corridors. You can't tell where it's going to pop up UNTIL you are right next to the corridor, and then it will show it's ugly face. Just blast it with the flashlight, and it will go away. Now, if you are rushing, you will NEVER see it coming, you'll just encounter that monster's jumpscare. So, you gotta stutter step all the way each time you encounter doorways, and rush the other part of the corridor, or else the big fuzzy monster will ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you.\n\nOn the next floor, you also gotta watch out for growling in said doorways, you gotta check those long, dark corridors, shine your flashlight, and stun another monster hiding there, or it's game over. Yes, you might sometimes go past the doorway accidentally, because when you stop moving, there's some momentum that might ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up your chance to peek inside of a doorway.\n\nWhen I thought FNAF was cheap with it's jumpscares at times, relying mostly on that, this  game....Oh god, it's even worse. You can encounter a jumpscare less than 5 seconds into the game, and you know what they say. If you're being jumpscared each 5 seconds, it will lose it's magic REALLY FAST. It's not even scary after a while.\n\nNow, about the flashlight. It sucks. Let's move on......\n\nWhy does it suck? Because it only stays on for a few seconds, and it's quite unreliable, sometimes you just gotta "smack it".\n\nThe best part of the game is the cheesy, glorious jingle after you finish a level, eat your heart out FNAF.\n\nThere's a bit of a spoiler here....Watch your flashlight during the cutscenes, or the game will troll you!\n\nSo, I'd say, buy this on a sale if you want, the magic will fade rather quickly, but you will have a few laughs that make this worthy of a random night with friends or alone. It's not the worst I've played, but it's just quite lackluster at the moment.","November 16, 2015","false","3.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

Except it doesn't always work. SO RUN.\n\nTitle: 123 Slaughter Me Street\nGenre: Action, Indie\nDeveloper: Nate Sanders , John Kolbek\nPublisher: Impulse Game Studios, LLC\nRelease Date: 28 Sep, 2015\n\nMain Review\nThe gameplay is simple. Your character is placed in a very narrow and very dark allyway/place/tunnel. There are doors left and right as you try to reach the exit door. You have a faulty flashlight which is your only protection from the darkness.  If you hear growling your flashlight will freeze the monster in place when it works.\nIt's a basic game in that the graphics don't really scare you, but the jump scares give you the fright factor you need if you're looking to be shaken up a little. .. though it can get boring fast. Being killed by Sesame Street style characters is kind of amusing.\nThe tutorial was not very helpful. It shows you how to move and to turn on your flashlight, but not how it helps you survive or what you need to do to survive, which is important.\nThe controls aren't so good and that really brings down the game.\n\nPros and Cons\nPros\n\nSome good jump scares\n\nCons\n\nGame is repetitive\nNot so scary\nBad controls\nLimited gameplay\n\n\nTL;DR\nOverall VerdictI wouldn't recommend this game personally, anything this has, another game does better.\n\nReviewed by: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/jigglesandgiggles","November 14, 2015","false","11.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I am a huge pansy when it comes to scary games and I was more confused as to why I'm dying then being scared.\n\nThere is little to no explanation as to why you die for one, Some monsters are scared of the light, others just kill my throught he flashlight.\n\nThere also seems to be no way to remap keys, which in all reality it's no big deal because the controls are so simple. The gameplay itself is very simple, yet annoying at the same time. There also appears to be a lack of gameplay settings and graphics settings along with the lack of key remapping.\n\nAnother down side I would like to add is there is no Achievements or steam trading cards.. That's also a minor bummer.\n\nI'd like to add that the game itself just seems to lack any substance, area to area it looks the same and I find myself getting bored of dying for no obvious reason and just seeing the same lame surroundings over and over even when I make it past the level.\n\nLastly, I must say if you want a plus on this game, I can say thus far into level 3 it has ran smoothly with no hiccups. There is some positive to all games.\n\nAll in all, I got this in a bundle so I'm not disappointed. But otherwise, at a price point of $8 I don't consider this worth the costs, there are better games out there at a better price for horror games. However, this isn't a terrible game. It's an okay game that fails to match any real reason to consider it over competition.","December 17, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snugglewolfy/recommended/405180/","snugglewolfy","Kulkun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snugglewolfy/","526 products in account","Incredibly lame. The "tutorial" explains nothing other than turning, moving in the one direction, and turning on your flashlight. Somehow you're supposed to guess how to actually play the rest of the game. You'd think they would have included opening the door at the end of the hallways or an explanation of how to deal with the various "monsters." That said, the monsters are extremely lame, like what you would expect a four year old to come up with.\n\nGraphics: Also lame. The design of the monsters is one thing but they also look very poor for what you assume the creator was trying to go for. Blocky and clunky. The alleys look the same and are so small, it's a wonder they had to use load screens between them.\n\nGameplay: Aside from the fact you're pretty much tossed in without any explanation of how to do anything, there's practically none. Go to the end of the hallway and you're done. Avoid monsters with no explanation of how which leaves you guessing different things to do and see if it works. This leads to many "jump scares" but after the first one, you pretty much don't care. Your flashlight shuts off after 3 seconds or so which is super annoying, It's also super clunky in that you can't use the mouse to just look around. Instead you have to go to a certain range in the doorways to be able to turn to your left or right. Your turn-around button is also a Push and hold feature. So you might turn to see a monster, let go of the key for whatever reason, and then it snaps you back around and "jump scare" death.\n\nSo pretty much this game is just awful. People want to compare it to FNAF but that's not accurate. FNAF had a story behind it and it spelled out pretty quick what you could do and how to survive.  "Well it's inspired, not a copy." you say. Fair enough. Like how an ice cream shop could "inspire" a toddler to imitate the experience using play-doh.","November 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I am too scared to play but I just played I got through the first floor (7th floor) on my 5th try. First time I got jumpscared I jumped and landed on my chest.  Second time I actually played and got frustrated because DUH I don't know how to play. I went to the tutorial and it showed me the controls and what to do. As other people pointed out, it doesn't tell you what to do if "The Follower", "The Greeter", "The Waiter", or the "Devil Elmo" appear. So I watched some videos on it and I saw what to do. Still uncertain about the "Devil Elmo" but It gave me some advice. I am glad about that. First, seeing people fail ingame. Then, seeing what to do if they appear. It was quite enjoyable to watch. The jumpscares to me are very affective and always catch me off guard.  "The Follower" is really quick and hard to keep away. That I want fixed for easier gameplay. It is still a fun and hard game to play and I still recommend it!

Basically, you just walk straight, sometimes look right or left and switch your broken flashlight on every few seconds. There are some strange creatures that do haunt you and move in for the kill (jump scare scene that shows game over).\n\nThere are like 7 or 8 levels when you must go forward to the staircase that leads you down to the next level. The aforementioned flashlight is your only weapon for defending yourself. Well, defending means more like ‚Äùstunning‚Äù those strange Sesame Street-like creatures that haunt you for some seconds.\n\nWell, I've only played this game for so long because I do like a good night's sleep:)\n\nSome cons to overall good game:\n- controls are somewhat stiff\n- you need to be somewhat precisely positioned to look left or right into a corridor, but stiff controlls make this one a bit hard\n\nSo, if you like scary games similar to Five Nights at Freddy's or this SCP 87 staircase game then you may give 123 Slaughter Me Street a try. It's simple and it's scary if you play it alone at night.","December 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

While obviously, there is some inspiration from the FNAF games, as well as Jim Henson's creations like Sesame Street, the atmosphere, gameplay mechanics, and difficulty of this game are completely unique. This is by no means a perfect game, but I loved how unique it was, and that the developers took a chance at something simple, yet so addicting.\n\nThe jumpscares were great at first, but got a bit repetitive towards the final few floors. I also found that the inability to use your flashlight when pressing space-bar half the time got quite annoying, and didn't really add to the atmosphere of the game. The atmosphere is AMAZING though, and as you get closer and closer to the end of a floor, it gets incredibly intense. I raged so many times while playing this game, but kept coming back for more, it's just that addicting.\n\nBe warned, this game is VERY difficult. I'd say it's harder than all of the FNAF Games, but there was so much satisfaction when I finally finished the final floor and was rewarded with a very confusing ending. Although I have already done a full lets play of the game, I will look for more hints, secrets, and clues, and try to piece together the story of this game. I do believe that there is a deep lore in the game, and I want to find out why there are these puppets that are attacking Tim Denson.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a very unique horror experience, and doesn't mind EXTREMELY difficult games. While it certainly has its flaws, it truly is a game like no other.","September 26, 2015","true","7.3"," 23 of 54 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","23","54","0","2"

But in addition you have a humerous adaptation of Sesame Street and gameplay mechanics that make this game stand apart. I have always felt that FNAF would created its own horror sub-genre of games. This game is probably the first of many (that isn't a Five Nights at ______) to take a true step in that direction.\n\nThere are only two minor things that I didn't like about this game. First, I wish there was some lore around why this place exists, where did they come from, who made them, etc. BUT I'm sure many of these questions will be answered in the sequel (which I am looking forward to). Second (and bear with me), I wanted it to be harder and with more mechanics/creatures. I keep seeing a lot of people say that this game is difficult to the point of impossible, but I didn't share that same experience. I managed to catch on to a strategy farely quickly and was able to beat the game fairly quicker than I expected to. I WANTED SO MUCH MORE!\n\nSo bottom line, I recommend this game for any horror genre fanatic who loves a little bit of a challenge. I personally really enjoyed the game and I am looking forward to the sequel, which hopefully will include some new mechanics and lore that will put our questions to rest.","September 28, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 21 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","4","21","0","0"

Its origanality is questionable but this is still a solid tittle, with simple but at the same time amazing and challenging gameplay! The Sesame Street like eneimes are truly terryifing, And bring out a childhood fear some people had locked away a long time ago. The graphics are fantastic, the enemy models could use improvment though, my opion: Get this game!","September 27, 2015","true","19.8"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","5","25","0","0"
