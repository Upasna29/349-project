If you're after a thoughtful, no-pressure game then you'll struggle later on where speed is important.\n\nIt's inspired by Portal, with a similar look and narration, but the puzzle mechanic is totally different. Here, it's about painting walls and droids different colours with your paint gun. Droids get pulled towards any surface that's the same colour as them, so you use that fact to move them around the level and position them on pressure pads that open doors.\n\nTo add some action, some droids are deadly to the touch and will chase you around the level if there's no coloured surface to pull them in.\n\nSome gameplay from chapter 2, post-tutorial:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKz5va-z3DM\n\nThe paint-mixing idea is a great basis for setting puzzles, but it feels like they could have done more than just using it to get droids to cling to walls. Particularly because (based on what I've played so far, 3/4 of the way through the game) this is a 3D game that never really uses the third dimension in your puzzle solving.\n\nLike all decent puzzle games, the game intelligently drip-feeds in new elements and teaches you their use, either through direct explanation or letting you discover it for yourself. Chapter 1 is a tutorial with one colour in your gun, Chapter 2 gives you the full three-colour gun and teaches you the art of mixing, while chapter 3 adds killer floor tiles that destroy droids, sometimes to your advantage. Chapter 4 adds walls that remove your paint after a short time. And so on, up to Chapter 8.\n\nBut this is a game with a story, and Chapter 4 ends on an action-packed climax ready for an atmospheric Chapter 5. At this point you wonder if the game up to this point was one long tutorial! Beyond this, the puzzles require faster thinking, faster timing and all-round more speed to proceed.\n\nA few puzzles are inelegantly designed, ones that makes you wonder if you found an unintended shortcut or whether the rooms needed a second draft.\n\nFor instance, level 4.5 was first one where I was stumped for a while - the solution turned out to be mentally putting together stuff I'd done before, but it also required getting a droid to pass a certain point at a certain time that was annoyingly fiddly - I had already figured things out but spent ages running in circles to get it just right. I couldn't work out if it was me or the game at fault.\n\nBut all the puzzles are contained enough to be manageable. It rarely puts a second difficult puzzle after a first within a level (which might mean if you die on the second you'd have to plod all the way through the first again).\n\nSo I've been enjoying this, with reservations. I found the early stuff a bit gentle and I rattled through a lot of the game before hitting the real challenge, but it always changed things up before becoming boring. I enjoy the moments of panic and quick-thinking, and solving a puzzle is satisfying. But some of the timing later on is too tight to be fun and gets frustrating. But never mouse-breakingly so!\n\n* More gaming videos by Randomise User","February 16","true","6.2"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","35","45","3","0"

I'm 70 yrs. old and I'm trying to keep my brain sharp.  But when the game designers INCLUDE a NECESSITY for DEXTERITY in the game, it really ticks me off.  I get really disappointed by the fact that I paid the same price as anyone else, or close to it, but I don't get to finish the game, because my fingers aren't as fast as my brain.  This game does just that.  I love the whole concept of mixing the colors to open the doors, and even getting the colors in the right orders.  It's a cool concept and fun to play and solve the puzzles.  BUT here I am running from a fire that my fingers just aren't fast enough to solve the puzzle.  Although I know WHAT to do, I can't physically do it.  Maybe I could if I did it over and over and over a million times, but I don't care to do that, that's why I bought a PUZZLE game.  Maybe I should have waited a while to cool down before I wrote this.  I recommend this game for anyone that loves puzzles, AND has the DEXTERITY to solve them!","February 27","true","0.9"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","21","24","5","1"

I'm glad I chose to try it anyway.  For context, let me explain that I am an average gamer in my late-forties with serious sight issues, and yet I completed the game in around 10 hours with 100% achievements. The puzzles ranged from easy to mildly challenging. The basic mechanic of manipulating droids by changing their colour, or the colour of their surroundings, is a neat one. The devs have borrowed Portal's premise of a guy (or gal) going through test chambers. Critics might say this is unoriginal and I suppose they have a point, but at least it's better than the cheesy 'contestant in a deadly game show' format utilised by several of the other games in this genre. It also means Chromagun's  levels are bite-size - some of them take a few seconds to complete once you're figured the solution - so if you screw up it's no hardship to restart and try again.  This makes it a good game to boot up whether you have ten minutes to kill or wish to spend a few hours gaming.\n\nTo sum up, ChromaGun isn't an ambitious game. The graphics and sound are solid and unpretentious, it's slick and bug-free, and there's a welcome side serving of humour in the voice over.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/408650/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2516 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================ChromaGun is a puzzle game with first-person shooter mechanics. The concept of the game is simple: use your paint gun to paint walls and droids to open doors and escape each level. But, especially in later levels, some of the puzzles are quite devious. It will take a bit of brainpower and some nimble droid dodging to make your way to the end.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics are large and colourful. Droids are suitably mechanical spheres hovering on small booster rockets, and it's easy to see which ones are dangerous and which are not from a quick glance. Given that the main idea behind the game is colour matching, it's obviously important for you to be able to quickly see the difference between the different coloured wall panels and droids. For the most part, the game handles this well, although in a couple of cases a droid in shadow was actually not the colour I first thought.\n\nGraphics settings are pretty limited, but appropriate: a pre-game dialog box allows you to choose graphic detail (low, medium, high) and resolution, as well as whether you want windowed mode or full screen.\n\nSound - Sound is mostly pretty minimal. The game has some fairly forgettable background music, and the *pew,pew* and *bzzt* sounds of your chromagun and electric tiles, respectively, are okay, but nothing special. The voiceover of your supervisor / tormentor is very well done indeed.\n\nGameplay - In typical puzzle game style, ChromaGun divides its offering into a large number of small levels, grouped into different areas. The areas themselves are fairly unimportant, though, as each level has much the same theme -- there are no different worlds or anything like that -- so it's really just a long list of levels to get through. You start the game as a contractor for ChromaTech, at the office to test the new ChromaGun, a three-colour paint gun capable of colouring certain wall tiles and some droids. Droids of a particular colour are attracted to wall tiles of that colour, you're told in the first level, and from that point on the game has you using your gun to colour wall tiles and droids in your efforts to make it through the testing facility. Switches are introduced early on, and later levels include much harder obstacles, such as droids that can kill you, electrified floor tiles, and automated wall cleaners that remove your paint within seconds of spraying it on.\n\nIt's important for a puzzle game that the player is able to quickly grasp the mechanics and interface, and be able to focus on solving the puzzles. ChromaGun does this well, with a very shallow learning curve in the first two areas leading into some downright tricky later levels in the later areas. I still haven't managed to finish the game: one particular level in area five is doing my head in at the moment!\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Clean, colourful graphics suit the game well.\n+ Voice over and associated humour is very well done. I've laughed out loud a few times while playing.\n+ shallow learning curve makes sure you grasp the simplest ideas well before increasing complexity.\n+ Steam achievements will keep you coming back for one more try, even when your rage meter is approaching the redline.\n\nCons:\n- The primary mechanic is simple, and the game doesn't offer a whole lot more than that. In the later levels it can get a bit repetitive.\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================ChromaGun is a well-made puzzle game with minor FPS components. It has high production values and a core mechanic that works, so it sticks to it.\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","February 18","true","3.8"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","16","26","5","0"

It isn't going to be a review, but more of request for future content. I've completed the game and i had a blast. it was refreshing to play another portalesq game. The commentary was hillarious and the gameplay while a bit easy in the beginning ramped up to a fun and chalenging later chapters. My request is that there eventually either add dlc that adds more levels that are more difficult. Or create a map creator similar to what portal 2 had and allow the community to create maps. This would not only allow new content for players to continue playing this awesome game, but after a editor would be created it would make less work for the Devs to create new content.

There is a good amount of humor and the narrator voice is pure honey, you're going to enjoy listening to it even when it says how dumb you are for failing the puzzle for the 22nd time in a row.\nSpeaking of puzzles, they get challenging pretty quickly and some will test your planning skills as well as your reflexes.\n\nThe game is about mixing the primary colors in order to get some droids to point A to point B, sometimes painting walls, others painting the drones themselves. Other times you'll have to make the drones suicide on electrified floor in order to be able to progress with the puzzle. As the game says: if you went to primary school you won't have any troubles understanding the game mechanics.\nGraphically and musically speaking, the game is average, nothing to write home about, but both get their job done. The music is very relaxing and helps the thinking a lot and the graphics could be better, sure, but could also be much worse.\n\nOverall I agree with most of the reviews: this game is a solid puzzle game that you'll enjoy a lot, with a "portal" feeling to it but also it's own soul.","April 25","true","2.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I have never really been a puzzle gamer, I prefer MOBAs and RPGs, but this game had a neat charm to it that I found kept me coming back for more. The game is challenging, sometimes frustratingly so, but makes you use your brain instead of just letting you autopilot. The mechanics are smooth, the visuals enticing, and the narrator delightfully sadistic. All in all good stuff, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun puzzle game.","May 25","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After 30 minutes of play I was able to complete the first chapter(which is more like a tutorial), and some of the second chapter. With plenty of content left, I can see this game giving you solid play time for the money. If you enjoy puzzle games, pick this one up for sure.","May 23","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is one person whom you'll hear often enough, he explains some mechanics, but most of the time he'll annoy you with some information that you are not good enough. It'll ceasy soon enough, but until then you'll be annoyed\n\nWhile my first playthrough was roughly 2 Hours, it is possible to finish the game in less that 40 Minutes, when you have memorized it at least once. The puzzles were sometimes challenging, sometimes eazy and sometimes you had to know that the solution was easier than anticipated\n\nThere are achievements, some tend to annoy a little bit (after every chapter is one achievement), others are well designed, so you have to search, think and act a little bit different to unlock 'em all.\n\nI personally recommend everyone this game, that likes to think or wants to experience a puzzle-game that is easy to understand, but not so easy to master.","June 4","true","52.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agent_Midnight/recommended/408650/","Agent_Midnight","Cubik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agent_Midnight/","195 products in account","This game is alright as a premise, but I think it needed a lot more work before asking for $10+. The controls are pretty clunky, the rooms are all bland and white, and overall it feels like the Alpha/Protoptype of a game that should've had more development put into it. It also tried way too hard to copy Portal's formula; You are given a puzzle-gun to solve puzzles in white rooms while a narrator watches and comments on your actions, all while the facility goes to ♥♥♥♥ as you are testing in it. The puzzles themselves are fairly simple, which may be a consequence of the simplistic premise that floating robots are attracted to color panels that match their own color.\n\nNormally I really love puzzle games, but I just can't recommend this one as is. It feels like an awkward, free mod to a better puzzle game. I just found it far too tedious and I rarely found any satisfaction in solving a puzzle.","June 5","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
