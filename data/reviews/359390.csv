"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marigold/recommended/359390/","marigold","Demoiselle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marigold/","128 products in account","No, Amnesia: Memories isn't a horror game, unless playing a female protagonist who can date four different guys (and maybe N from Pokémon) in a Japanese visual novel makes you break out into a cold sweat. If you keep reading, I’m going to assume you totally came here on purpose and share my strange passion for dating hot, fictional men who just can’t help falling for me…with the help of a walkthrough, anyway. (Sadly, I have a rotten personality and can never self-insert.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506376209\n\nHey look, otome fans: it’s Amnesia in English on Steam! Those who have been desperately hoping for an English localization of Amnesia (and may even be veterans of the Not-So-Civil Dialoveable-Amnesiac War) will probably get this regardless of reviews. I may just be writing this for my own amusement, but hey, why not? Maybe there's someone on the fence.\n\n...Or in a cage.\n\nLike many of the Japanese games making their way to Steam now, Amnesia: Memories is a port. Unlike most Japanese Steam games’ ports, however, this is Amnesia’s English debut, alongside a simultaneous Vita release. The text is all translated into English with the Japanese voice acting intact.  Fortunately, Amnesia makes a good transition from handheld to PC. Things that may seem like annoyances at first—such as being forced to left-click to progress the text—are easily overcome thanks to the ability to remap keys and controller support.\n\nThe game itself looks great in 1080p as well, with easily legible text, though close-ups of characters and backgrounds suffer from minor aliasing. While the character sprites and CGs are beautiful, the backgrounds seem like stock photographs and simple line drawings with your 12-year-old cousin’s favorite “Unicorn Diarrhea” Instagram filter applied. However, my BFF (who normally has good taste) calls them “stylized” and “appropriate” so it could just be my severe unicorn allergy speaking.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506379697\n\nPlus there are mini-games, so you get to beat your boyfriend(s) in air hockey and cackle maniacally at the first hint of their sad, sad anime boyfriend tears. Or if they beat you, Oh my god I was playing in windowed mode and I accidentally Skyped my mom when I meant to fling the puck back at you, okay, so get over yourself, Kent. There’s also Inexplicably Violent Rock-Paper-Scissors if you prefer. (I would’ve enjoyed seeing additional mini-games, such as Flowerpot-Dodging or Knee-the-Yandere-in-the-Groin, but I understand that this is a visual novel first and foremost.)\n\nAmnesia is a traditional, story-focused visual novel without any stat-raising; endings are determined entirely by the series of choices you make and the parameters those choices affect. Exploring alternate realities and unraveling the mystery of your past(s) is an intriguing approach that takes precedence over the romance in most routes, and completing all five routes is necessary to reveal the full picture. I recommend seeking out the bad endings even if you’re normally averse to your boyfriends hating, stabbing, or dismembering you. Then again, I probably took too much fiendish delight in finding new ways to get what’s-her-face killed.\n\nEach route begins with already well-established relationships, though our heroine has to relearn (and hopefully remember) the exact nature of those relationships over one month. Having amnesia’s rough—even when you regain consciousness and immediately find out you have a hot boyfriend. Ikki’s and Kent’s routes felt like the best introduction to Amnesia’s setting and made the parameters feel especially relevant to the story. There’s no common route at all, so the scenes and events in each guy’s route are unique.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506377418\n\nThe love interests themselves were diverse and well-written, though how appealing the routes and characters themselves are likely comes down to personal preference. I absolutely loved one route, enjoyed two very much, plodded through another because I totally already knew whodunit, and then one I fdgsffdgguyuggyhuyghgyuyuyuygugujyguyuyyujuyyhgnugngnnggyhdfrtgdhftrsgfd\n\nSorry, I must have gotten dizzy after recovering a repressed memory.\n\nIf you’re expecting light, breezy romance, this isn’t your best bet, but the feeling that you’re one misstep away from a horrible fate is far stronger in some routes than others. Your adorable giant bug sidekick Orion serves as the game’s main source of comic relief and also doubles as the heroine’s personality, because she apparently lost hers with her memories. I’m not a fan of “blank slate” visual novel protagonists (probably because of my aforementioned rotten personality), and it was off-putting that the MC doesn’t speak, with Orion reacting, thinking, and narrating in her stead. Luckily, Orion is the best. THE BEST.\n\nEven taking my (exaggerated) criticisms into account, I enjoyed Amnesia very much and am thrilled that it got such a fantastic English localization from Idea Factory International. It took me 47 hours total to complete all the routes with their many endings and they were hours very well spent. I hope this is the first of many Otomate releases on Steam and I’d love for Amnesia to help prove that there’s a market for Japanese otome games here.\n\nOne last thing—I forgot to make fun of the guys’ outfits, which made them look like they all rolled out of a Hot Topic going-out-of-business sale circa 1995 and woke up in a giant barrel full of rejected Final Fantasy characters’ belts decades later. There, my duty is now fulfilled; it is time for me to leave you. One day (probably today), you will forget ever reading this review…\n\nNote: The publisher provided each volunteer beta tester—including me!—with a complimentary Steam copy of the game as a thank-you for testing. Beta testers weren’t asked to write reviews (only bug reports), so this review is all me, baby.","August 25, 2015","true","54.7"," 472 of 504 people (94%) found this review helpful 289 people found this review funny","94","472","504","289","29"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/recommended/359390/","alexngregory","alex.n.gregory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/","3023 products in account","The only game in recent memory where you have to get senpais to notice you in order to get your memory back.\n\nAmnesia: Memories is a port of a 2011 Playstation Portable visual novel, where the player takes control of a young woman who loses her memories and is forced to retrace her steps (and romance one of five vaguely-androgynous men) in order to get them back. Classified as an "otome" (girl) game, Amnesia is equal parts fascinating and hilarious.\n\nThe game starts with your character entering a spirit world, where a being named Orion tells you that he has somehow become lodged in your consciousness, and can't leave until you recover your memories. At that point, you gain the choice of one of four different paths (with one unlockable later), and you have to make decisions over the course of the story in terms how much information you gather and who you choose to romance/hang out with.\n\nThe most interesting part of Amnesia is that there's a lot of replay value. There are five distinct storylines, each with a wildly different set of situations and stories that occur. I was part of the beta testing team for this, and was initially struck by how separate each path is. The first storyline I played through (Shin's) had the characters attempting to solve a mystery, while the second was so off-the-wall that it might qualify as a parody of visual novels.\n\nI know the opening line might seem a bit flippant, but that is the crux of the game. You can only trigger your memories by spending as much time as possible with your respective suitor(s), who have a bad habit of not revealing anything important to you until later on in the storyline.\n\nFrom a plot standpoint, Amnesia is absolutely bonkers. In a good way, of course. The novelty of being a girl trying to collect information about her missing memories is balanced by a set of off-the-wall characters. Depending on which storyline you play, you'll run into a pair of childhood friends competing for your affections (one of whom locks you in a dog cage for half of his storyline), another teen who has somehow been gifted with the ability to be attractive to every woman he sees (thus explaining why he has a harem of girls who harass the player character) and a "Mr. Nice Guy" tutor.\n\nThe art style really sets this apart from other visual novels. Characters are expressive, blinking, moving their mouths and speaking in full Japanese. The backgrounds are generally detailed and varied, and there are nice interstitial moments that break up each scene.\n\nThere are also a pair of minigames that can be accessed through the main menu, but I didn't spend enough time to have much of an opinion. They're very simple (rock-paper-scissors), but are a neat diversion for anyone who wants to go for high scores.\n\nIn the end, Amnesia: Memories is one of the most interesting games I've played this year, and certainly among the best visual novels I've experienced in quite some time. It's well worth a look and offers a lot of value for the money.\n\nDefinitely worth a look.","August 25, 2015","true","5.9"," 135 of 151 people (89%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","89","135","151","22","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/359390/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Part of the reason I played Amnesia: Memories - my first Otome game - is because of an early GameCenter DX episode. Shinya Arino was challenged to win somebody's heart in Angelique Trois, an entry in a highly-regarded Otome series. Despite spending 13 hours, following guides, and doing seemingly everything right, his confession of love to Seiran was met with: "It's 1000 years too soon for you to make fun of me. Wash your face and try again." Working so hard only to fail has to be absolutely heart-wrenching, and yet...strangely exciting.\n\nThe strength of a game is in its ability to engage everyone outside of its target audience. On the surface, an Otome game involves romancing attractive men, which to a straight male gamer like myself, doesn't sound all that enticing. However, by utilizing a compelling narrative and/or intriguing game-play elements, I'll find myself immersed in every aspect of the game. Despite my inexperience with the genre, I believe Amnesia: Memories is a fantastic game. It couples a strong plot with great characters, and the few game-play elements bring everything together.\n\nDue to the meddling of a strange kid named Orion, you've lost your memories. As pay-back for the mess he's put you in, Orion offers to guide you through five parallel worlds. In each world, you meet the same characters, but their personalities - as well as yours - are different. Moreover, the world you choose determines which man you could have a serious relationship with. There are other events that can occur, some funny, some dangerous, but all worth experiencing. Whether you find true love, see the story to its conclusion, or even meet a miserable end, is all determined by what you say and the actions that you perform.\n\nAs in real life, the lack of communication can ruin any relationship. Due to your amnesia, you won't know the right thing to say, so you'll have to pay attention to conversations and keep track of the details. While it would be very easy to use a guide and guarantee the best endings, I think actually putting in the effort to know someone is far more rewarding. On the other hand, my initial play-throughs mostly resulted in failure, so maybe I'm not cut out for videogame relationships. The point is that the less hints you have to work with, the more likely you'll become attached to the person you're interested in.\n\nAs your story progresses, a handy chart tracks your relationship with the male lead, as well as suspicions due to your lack of memories. It's amusing that one of the few distinctly "game-like" elements actually isn't all that effective. For one, it isn't always clear whenever you say the right or wrong thing. Orion or one of the other characters may chime in, but sometimes you're left in the dark. The charts are more likely to shift when your attention is elsewhere, not when you're saving, reloading, and looking for the slightest change in your "does he love me?" gauge. Furthermore, this is all the more reason to not refer to a guide early on. After all, real relationships aren't forged through the use of cheat-sheets.\n\nAs for the guys themselves, I think the writers did a fantastic job giving them plenty of depth. I mean sure, they're attractive enough, but that's to be expected. The most appealing aspect is finding out what they're really all about, and discovering just how much they care. These guys know exactly what to say and when to say it, so those special moments really have a lot of impact. The average story takes about 4-5 hours to complete, and if you're really into someone, there's going to be those few times where he'll really turn up the charm. I'll admit, I get a little light-headed whenever Shin blushes. On the other hand, a couple of the storylines are more intriguing and disturbing than they are romantic. If you've browsed the community hub, or read some of the other reviews, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. If not, then my advice is to play through the stories from top to bottom, exactly as they're listed in the game. In any case, there are more than enough dark and mysterious elements that make for very compelling entertainment.\n\nThis game also benefits from having high production values. Aside from the heroine, everyone is fully-voiced, and the acting is more than serviceable. The CG scenes are very nicely drawn, and the soundtrack is decent enough for setting the mood. The fast-forward system makes replays a breeze, and the mini-games are an amusing diversion. The backgrounds are a little washed-out and bland, but they're the last thing you'll notice when playing the game. Again, this is my very first experience with the genre, but I can tell that the developers really cared to deliver an appealing product. Although, I did notice a few typos in this localization. It's nothing major, especially considering the size of the game, but all the same it's worth mentioning.\n\nAll in all, Amnesia: Memories is a superb example of an Otome Visual Novel. Not only are the stories well-told, but the characters are endearing, and everything looks and sounds wonderful.. It'll take 25+ hours to experience all of the content, so anyone out there wondering if they'll get their money's worth doesn't need to be concerned. Still, I have to admit that I'm a little frustrated with myself. I played through all of the stories and not once was I able to get a good ending without a guide. There was always that one moment where I treated the guy I was dating as a third wheel, or didn't appreciate his gestures of affection, or failed his math test. Ahh...if only relationships were as easy to understand as Dark Souls.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","December 6, 2015","true","27.2"," 65 of 68 people (96%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","96","65","68","10","4"

But, it's definitely much better than the anime. Honestly, I was kind of hoping this to be more dark - but the lighthearted touch in it isn't bad, either. If you're looking for a nice time with guys that like you, give this a try! I would guess there's around 40+ hours for you to spend in here, and I'd say it's worth the money. There's tons of pictures to unlock, minigames, extras. The art's beautiful. Not to mention, most of the usual heroine dialogue is done by Orion, so it's fully voiced - which is a breath of fresh air for me!\n\nOrion starts out as super annoying though, but he grows on you. After two playthroughs, I'm hoping I will find a path where I can have a happy ending with that adorable spirit that's always there for you.\n\nMy complaint would be the lack of no quicksave option. Although right clicking and selecting save isn't that big of a deal, when you're searching for the right options it does make you wish there was a quicker way.\n\nHere's to hoping they will add more japanese otome games to steam!

When push comes to shove, It's nothing that special. If you like otome games and gorgeous art, you’ll enjoy this game. The translation has its flaws, but it’s much better than most of the otome games you can buy on mobile nowadays. It’s also less expensive, since you don’t have to spend $2.99 to buy each chapter. If you want to play this game but have no prior knowledge of visual novels, I would definitely recommend playing some low-key, less intense games before buying this one. I can’t imagine going into this game without being familiar with anime tropes and the culture behind its gameplay, since some of the characters and places can come off as odd or unsettling. The key is to not overthink the story flaws (even though they’re in abundance) and just play it for the romance routes. If I wasn’t a person who relied heavily on story growth and world building, I would have given this game a higher score. It’s not terrible, but with these types of games it's hard to impress me.\n\n10 times better than any Voltage Inc. game, though.","December 28, 2015","true","16.1"," 67 of 75 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","67","75","9","2"

I loved that it was original Japanese.\n- The mystery for each route is very different.\n- Orion is adorable\n- It's an otome game which I think Steam needs more of.\n\nWhat I wish was better:\n- Parameter system is hard to interpret.\n- Backgrounds were monocolored. Not very detailed but that's probably because they focus the attention on the main characters.\n- More save points! Other visual novels can have hundreds of save points. This one has only 24. Considering how many choices you have to make, I think there should be more.\n\nOverall I would recommend if you like visual novels and you don't mind reading.","August 27, 2015","true","19.8"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","38","39","0","1"

On one hand, I think some of the plotlines are interesting, and I ended up really wrapped up in what would happen -- Shin and Ikki were my favorites by far. The character art is gorgeous, and I think that the game did an amazing job with the cliche amnesia storyline -- there's a lot you don't know but I felt like characters were suspicious when they should be and not when they shouldn't. There are things about the game that drive me crazy.\n\nThe character you play is so passive. Orion ends up being the voice for nearly everything that happens and all the recapping irritated me. Yes, I know what that character just said, Orion, I was there and there's no need to tell me yet again. I have no idea why your character would even listen to what Orion is saying given that you don't know him and he's just a random spirit that invaded your consciousness and pushed out your memories. Honestly, the game would have been a 1000% better by cutting the part Orion plays in the story in half. I never fully get why in the Toma or Shin storylines you shouldn't call the police, other than Orion tells you not to, so it ends up making no sense at all. Not to mention how you spend the games supposedly trying to recover your memories, but in the Toma storyline you find your diary and then proceed not to read it for no good reason. Why even have you find it when you did when the game doesn't allow you to read it? Orion might have forgot, but the diary is my character's person, and she definitely didn't forget.\n\nIt seems like a lot of people liked Kurt, but I really didn't, and I was so frustrated when I realized there was no way to break up with him. I would have taken a bad ending death to end their relationship, but I couldn't, and in the end, Orion ended up telling me that Kurt was a nice guy, he cared for my character, and obviously my character had feelings for him. WTF. No, no she did not. Her dialogue throughout the path made that more than clear. You see this again at the end of Shin's storyline when your character is sympathetic and apologetic to Toma who was absolutely terrible. I hate it when games force you to think a way that's completely inconsistent with how you're playing your character. There should have been an option for you to say whether you forgive him or not. (The answer is definitely not.)\n\nI was also a little disturbed by the fact that nearly every storyline but one includes either your love interest physically manhandling you in a way that's scary or uncomfortable, initiating sexual contact without consent, or telling you that something you've said or done is going to get you sexually assaulted. Seriously, game? Whether it's a boy that likes you but you don't like them back, or someone who's sexually interested in you while you're either unsure of your interest in them or don't have any interest at all, the game makes it sound like your character has done something wrong. Also, when the women in the game are jealous, they're crazy and murderous, when the men are, it's just because they love you so much. That's not a good message to send. Jealousy isn't sexy or romantic and shouldn't be portrayed like it is. (And as much as a personally liked Ikki's character, I wish the game had addressed the fact that the members of his fan club were all essentially magically roofied by his eyes. This game had so many consent issues in it, and that's before you get to crazy Toma.)\n\nAlso, while this is definitely less important than the other issues I had in the game. I really became sick of some of the repetive background art, particularly during Kurt's storyline where you seem to walk a lot but with no dialogue the repetition is both more obvious and tedious. As negative as I'm being about the game, I didn't hate it. I think it could have been a really amazing game, and I did like playing several of the storylines. But the physical and sexual aggression we see from guys we are supposed to like was a bit too far for me. I get it in Ukyo and Toma's storylines but I hate that it pops up in everyone single one of them.","August 31, 2015","false","20.4"," 91 of 137 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","91","137","5","5"

I should start with a disclaimer that I'm fairly unusual in that I'm a straight male who generally prefers otome VNs, but if you can get over being a virtual girl chasing after virtual boys (or rather being a virtual girl being chased by virtual boys, I suppose) then I would recommend this VN to you regardless of your preferences... assuming those preferences didn't exclude VNs themselves, I suppose.\n\nThe story is fairly simple- you're a girl who lost her memories because I spirit crashed into your noggin or something and threw them across time and space and you gotta retrieve them by talking to a bunch of cute boys in parallel worlds who knew you before you lost your memories... that's about it (well, for the most part... the final arc has quite a bit more to it, but I'm not gonna spoil). Though this fairly simple setup allows it to focus more on the characters rather than developing a convoluted plot, and it does so very well. The writing is very good, dare I say quite exceptional by most standards, I found myself genuinely laughing and crying many times, it was really quite absorbing.\n\nIf I have any criticisms though, the first one would be the character design. Some of the characters look really good: I love the look of the Main Character (henceforth referred to as MC-chan because I'm a weeb and generally a terrible person) and Orion was cute... annoying at first, but he really grew on me; and Toma and Shin are both pretty good looking, but everyone else out of the main cast have outfits that look straight-up ridiculous... I mean, there's a character (Ukyo) who looks like he was a cab driver airlifted straight from the chessboard dimension... another character (Ikki) has what appears to be a tattoo of a spade on his face, which I assume they thought for god knows what reason accented nicely with his spade hairclip... like, what even the..? I mean, the boys themselves look really good, it's just their normal clothing is generally just absurd. I know this seems like a small complaint and it's totally subjective but considering you'll spend the majority of the game staring at them and reading text, if you don't like the way they look it can get pretty grating.\n\nMy second criticism is that in almost all of the CGs, MC-chan looks like a deer in headlights, like "OMFG HE'S KISSING ME WHAT DO I DO!?", even when there's no reason for her to do so. I mean I'm not exaggerating when I say that there was an instance in which I (and by proxy, she) asked a boy to hug her, he did, and she looked surprised that he did so in the resulting CG... like, why? Did she suddenly realize she left the stove on back home?\n\nOther than that, there's a minor thing of the talking animations being... kinda lazy, it's basically characters just opening their mouths over and over again in the same robotic way until the speaking audio is done, it reminded me of the Putt-Putt games I played when I was a kid. That's pretty minor though since most of your game is spent looking at the bottom fifth of the screen reading text and listening to japanese voices anyways.","September 3, 2015","true","19.7"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","100","20","20","9","0"

Now 2015, it was surely surprising to see that this one got an English localization.  I bought it immediately and I was hooked! This game is not related to the horror game Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, this is an entirely different game.\n\nCrazy boys, gorgeous art and some mystery.You play as a heroine whom Orion (a spirit) accidentally collided into, and because of that you lost some of your memories. In a span of 1 month you need to figure out whom to trust, what happened,  and piece it out (while the people around you should not know that you have lost your memory so you wont get taken advantage of). I've never had a dull moment in the craziness of some routes. Yes crazy I tell you, like being caged or almost dead!   Best of all it's 1080p (high resolution), compared to the original small scaled handheld game.\n\nI have to recommend Amnesia:Memories  because of what it offers: a twist of fun, sweet,  and something crazy. With regards to the difficulty in picking the right direction for a good end to happen, feel free to refer to walkthoughs. I have to say I ran into the bad end multiple times without a guide because the choices are not obvious at all. Just remember that not all choices are good, which makes it even more challenging if you play it without the walkthrough.\n\nWant more Japanese games to be tranlated to English?Diabolik lovers, Shinobi Koi Utsusu, Hakuoki, Norn 9?\nI encourage you to try and buy this game! They're testing out the western market by releasing their first localized visual novel. If this happens to be successful, we can see more visual novels in the market!\n\nNew to Visual Novels?If you're still new to visual novels, think of it as reading a goosebumps book where you can choose how the story ends by picking a dialogue. However what makes visual novels a unique experience is that, you get well known voice actors in the anime industry to voice out the characters, gorgeous art,  mini games, and a friendly fan community.\n\nTechnical Stuff- Unlike the Vita port, you can't individually change a character voice level.\n~ This is a straight console to pc port. They stilll use the Artemis engine.\n+ Xbox360 contrller/generic controller supported\n+ 1080p\n+ Achievements\n+ Steam Trading Cards & Badge\n+ Minigame from the Vita port added.

Maybe at a wall instead? Or....perhaps, do you squeeze the juice out and make lemonade? The possibilities are pretty much endless. Excuse me for my silly segue, but in an odd way Amnesia: Memories reminds us that life is full of possibilities - so, which will you take?\n\nThe BreakdownAmnesia (no, not the horror game that exploded in popularity on YouTube a few years back!) is a Japanese visual novel developed and published by Idea Factory under their "Otomate" brand. Now, if you're not familiar with the term "otome", that usually refers to visual novels with a female main character that dates males. If you don't recognize the term "visual novel", it's basically what it sounds like: a novel of sorts with accompanying visuals.\n\nThe gameplay in Amnesia involves choices quite often, so it's more of a choose your own adventure sort of deal instead of just walls of text. Personally, I really liked this approach because the game has a lot of endings (20+), especially bad ones. The differences between "good" and "normal" endings are usually somewhat minor, but the difference between a "good" and a "bad" ending is huge - usually bad endings result in death, I was really surprised to see this from a visual novel, especially one about dating pretty dudes. Sure, a lot of the bad endings are silly, but some of them were genuinely creepy. The dark aspects hiding under the game's innocent front were a little surprising to say the least.\n\nWhat truly surprised me though was the game's characters, especially the main 5 "dateable" guys. At the start of the game, you're given a choice between 4 worlds (Heart, Spade, Clover, Diamond), each of which has a main dude to focus on. Sure, in most of the worlds nearly all of the main cast is present (which includes coworkers, occasionally family members, and the extra friend or two), but clearly the male lead is what the game wants you to focus on. However, nearly all of the characters in this game are pretty interesting, from the bizarre manager at work to the mysterious Ukyo, the 5th unlockable "true ending" guy. There were a few exceptions, but I think that all comes down to personal preference in the end. Personally I didn't care for Shin or Ikki's routes much, while Kent (my favorite), Toma, and Ukyo all had pretty interesting routes with some nice twists and turns along the way.\n\nI loved Kent's route in particular because it was great to see him develop as a character along the way; he goes from being a serious, rational, analytical type of person with seemingly no emotions to someone who is very sweet and caring. Most of the main dudes also develop along their routes, but just to clarify - it doesn't ever really feel like the game is overly mushy-gushy or stereotypical for visual novels. The dialogue is cleverly written and it helps to make the experience quite enjoyable.\n\nWell, mostly at least. There was one character in particular that bugged me to no end: Orion. "Who the hell is that?" you might ask. Well, he's the little guy who caused you to have amnesia in the first place. He's a spirit that follows you around everywhere, and I think he seriously could have been handled a bit better. Orion loves to state the obvious, and he does so at every occasion. I think the entire game's length could be shrunk by an hour or two if Orion talked less honestly, though some of his dialogue is pretty important so I think he's still a fairly worthwhile addition to the cast.\n\nDespite that gripe though, I really enjoyed my time with Amnesia. The visuals are lovely and the music is a good mix between emotionally stirring melodies and casual background tunes. Whether you're a secret anime boyfriend harem lover, a fan of visual novels, or even just someone that enjoys solid writing, I think Amnesia is certainly a great experience.\n\nProsSuperb writing, dialogue, and characters\n20+ endings, many of which are bad ones that may or may not result in death\n4 dateable dudes with an extra mysterious 5th unlockable one\nTakes about 20-30 hours to get all the endings (about 3-5 hours for each route), depending on how fast you read and how well you manage save files\nLovely music + visuals\nJapanese voice acting\nSteam achievements, trading cards, and Cloud support\nConsOrion (the reason you have amnesia in the first place) can be annoying at times - he talks way too much and his voice isn't exactly easy on the ears after hours and hours of listening to him\nThe outfits of the males (and 1 female) are a little ridiculous.....oh, who am I kidding? This is such a minor complaint. Just go play the game!\nAmnesia: Memories isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn excellent. For fans of otome (girls x guys) visual novels, anime, or just reading in general, this is an absolutely great game that shouldn't be missed!\n\n\n\n\nOh, and Kent is the best. Your favorite is the worst.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9/10","May 17","true","19.4"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","20","21","3","0"

In this, you play as a young woman who has lost her memories. With the help of a young spirit, you must navigate the world around you in order to figure out who your enemies are and who you can trust.\n\nThis is a wonderful game and I sincerely hope that we start to get more translations of popular Japanese otome games on here. Every route in Amnesia is completely different, so at no point was I bored reading through the stories. Highly recommended.\n\nThe Romance Options:\n-Diamond: Toma - aka Mr. Yandere, was extremely disturbing. Not my cup of tea, but the other routes made up for his storyline.\n\n-Heart: Shin - a childhood friend and a storyline that plays out like a detective story. This one was my favorite out of all the stories. I loved Shin, which was unexpected. Going into the game I had expected to like Ikki the best.\n\n-Spade: Ikki - a playboy who has a "condition" where anyone who looks into his eyes falls in love with him. An interesting story that I enjoyed, even if I wanted to shake Ikki most of the time.\n\n-Clubs: Kent - aka the Vulcan option. If you think Spock is hot, then Kent'll be right up your ally. This is probably the one route that was straight romance without a major plot thread involving murder mysteries, supernatural abilities, or crazy yandere boyfriends.\n\n-Joker: I don't want to give much away for this route.

I am that kind of person that enjoys crying while reading, smiling while nice things happen and being excited for several situations that might occur. I am very sentimental, and Amnesia™: Memories reminded me how many emotions you can actually feel while sitting in front of your computer just reading something about a girl with amnesia that is trying to get back all of her memories.\n\nThe storyAs heroine, you get thrown into different worlds that all contain different stories. After meeting up with Orion, a friendly spirit that accidently bumped into your soul, you get to choose a world you want to start in. Every world stands in connection with one specific guy that will either act or actually be your boyfriend. Why act? Because when entering a world, you won't know anything. Starting off with amnesia after an accident, you'll meet a guy that will most likely pretend to be your boyfriend. It's your task to find out if you actually liked this guy before, or if he's just making up a quick excuse to make you do something you don't want to do.\nDuring every walkthrough you will encounter the same people, but different faces. No one will be the same, except for a handful of persons that are trustworthy and willing to stand by your side no matter which world you're in. They won't know you met them before in another world, neither will anyone recognize that those even exist. You are on your own with a cute spirit lurking around in your head trying to help you get through the daily life you used to live before. Will you fall to those guys that are messing around with you, or will you end up with someone that truly loves you?\n\nThe boys (contains spoilers!!)I personally started in the heart world, meeting Shin first. Shin is that kind of guy that girls like because he's a bad boy you can make out with. You don't expect him to want anything serious, but honestly? Shin surely loves his girl and would do anything for her. He will stand by your side the whole time, you can trust or mistrust him and he'll still try to make it work out. If you want someone to fight for you, that's probably the right world to choose first. At least it's easy to get into it, since you'll be introduced to people that are just trying to be nice and not hating on you for things you don't remember. Shin stays by you all the time even while being busy for exams, and you won't regret trusting him on his actions.\nMoving onto the diamond world and finding Toma who first showed up as the caring brother but also ended up being the culprit. In this world, he'll pretend to be your boyfriend. You don't know him so you simply believe him and end up in his hands, not being able to trust anyone but having to rely on him until you and the spirit Orion realize what's going on with this whole story Toma made up for you. Overall, depending on how your story ends, and how crazy your mind is, you'd love Toma. He's a pretty little psycho with a dirty mind as well. He seems a little bit like he's got a split personality over time, but it's nothing that wouldn't make it even more interesting to deal with.\nThe spade world will personally introduce you to Ikki, who has a special condition. Every girl that looks into his eyes falls in love with him, except for you. You don't fall for it which makes it get interesting. Between all of the chicks that want Ikki and the fact how dangerous they are, Ikki would do everything to make you happy. He's like Skin gone sexual, which is pretty much everything you could wish for. Except that his fan club is trying to kill you. But hey, at least you dated him for three months without remembering, right?\nLast but not least, the clover world will bring you near Kent who is the opposite of all the guys listed above. He is a really smart guy, way older than you and has also been a teacher of yours. He's a master at mathematics and also a good friend of Ikki, who of course, would love to seduce you in that world as well. But you will fall for Kent and his love to you. He is trying to understand how love and relationships work, and that's the part where you come in. No matter what you demand, he will go along with it and try to make you happy. He couldn't stand seeing you crying, so he doesn't intend to let you down at any cost.\nThe final world will only unlock once you finished all routes, but it's worth. The joker world will finally bring you together with the guy you loved all along. Ukyo and you meet up in every world you enter, except you will never get to know him any better. He will remind you of how you met earlier, but you won't recognize it. This time, you simply get to see him day by day and having him save your life in a world that is trying to kill you, because you shouldn't exist. Uyko has to deal with a split personality, or also called dissociative identity disorder that formed during his worl travelings. He was trying to find you all along, killing you with his own hands but also trying to save you and make you live. This time he wants to make up for it, and he does pretty well. Although he warns you and tells you that he is dangerous, you won't be able to let go of him. You will love him because you will realize how much you mean to him and if you're going the right path you will realize that it was him all along.\n\nPersonal opinionI am not a novel reader, and I bought Amnesia™: Memories because I saw it on a sale. And after completing one walkthrough around the story with Shin, I just quit and didn't touch the novel for a couple of months. After all I realized how interesting it can get, and how many emotions the game calls up on you. I don't regret spending that much time in it, it was a pleasure getting all endings and completing the achievements. I totally fell in love with Toma because I am a little psycho myself, but honestly Ukyo is my favorite. Just the whole story about how he is only trying to find a world both you and him can live in is beautiful and has a huge meaning to me.\nOverall there's nothing I'm disliking or missing for this visual novel. I mean it even got an anime and both are comparable with each other. It's awesome seeing and hearing heroine and the boys, so I highly recommend watching it after completing the game. Why after? Because you will just spoil yourself trying to get a good ending somehow with avoiding things you've seen in the anime. They are a little bit different. The story is the same but some things aren't mentioned in both the novel and anime, so you'll be better off doing work alone or walking through the novel with guides, which you should preferably do when having finished one ending in each route.\nI'll give this game a 10/10, because this is the best thing I've ever read and I wouldn't mind spending the rest of money I haven't during the sale, because this is definitely worth buying for full price. As long as you're not some dude expecting nudity, because there won't be any.","March 17","true","49.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LiterateKat/recommended/359390/","LiterateKat","LiterateKat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LiterateKat/","10 products in account","Amnesia™: Memories is a fantastic game. Truly an otome game after my own heart, portrayed in a way that's great for those who are not generally fans of the gaming genre or looking to play their first one. Possessing beautiful graphics, an A+ storyline, as well as characters each with their own distinct opinions, feelings and identities, this game was well-worth the time I put into it and hopefully the start of many more otome games to come (to Steam). I found this game to be unique in it's large cast of characters and the relationship dynamics between them, both romantic and platonic. As well as the heroine there are three other girls, Sawa, Mine, and Rika (plus Ikki's crazy fangirls), who each have unique relationships between eachother and the heroine, and of course Waka, the manager, the authority figure of the group who while his personality might change from world to world, his essence does not. The verisimilitude of this game brought about by these dynamics was truly a breath of fresh air. Of course, no game is perfect. There seem to be issues with recieving the Steam achievments for this game (hopefully that will be fixed, the game is still quite new), I found Ukyo's good end to be a little anti-climatic (I'd already seen the anime, so that probably had an impact), the backgrounds were somewhat underwhelming (pointed out to me while I was broadcasting this game to a friend, though I think it helps to not distract from the characters), Orion was used a little too much to portray the characters thoughts and feelings (of course, due to their bond he would know all about them), and I was a little concerned about how in Toma's good end after escaping the cage, kissing and making up with Toma, the topic of Toma's mental health and his extreme actions in locking the heroine in a cage for her protection were never properly adressed and discussed. This game does possess some subjects that while horror visual novel fans might love, some might find triggering. This isn't an innocent, cutesy otome game. While there's no sex, there are mentions of it in discussions, as well as gory off-screen deaths involving fire, knives, roofs, etc. Plus Toma's cage *shudders*.\n\nSo to sum it up;\ngreat game,\nwell-developed characters,\nunique storyline,\na perfect start for those looking to try their first otome game or who are not generally fans of the genre,\nhopefully the start of many an otome game to come to Steam.\nIf this looks like a game you would enjoy and you have money to spare I reccomend you purchase the game, both for the game itself and to show Steam and game developers that otome games have a viable market here.\n\nEditional comments: I broadcasted this game while playing to a few of my friends. One friend's favourite character was Shin, another's Toma, and mine Ukyo (his hair is ever so long and pretty, and he's a photographer).\nP.s. All my Steam friends are male.\nP.s.s.

All of the characters are extremely well-written and with 5 routes *For each different guy*  that carry on their own story... it definitely does not get repetitive unlike other visual novels. Though, choices are a bit limited because it's a story-driven visual novel... and each route has a good and normal ending, along with a few bad endings that don't have an ending scene unlike the other 2 options.\n\nI will not stress this enough, if you enjoy well written characters you will love this game. Each route is unique and has a nice story. Plus, it's strength is it's not just your typical "otome"... quite literally anyone can enjoy this visual novel because it has such a nice story, that was clearly thought out.\n\nNow, there are much better reviews than this one but I have to make a positive review just to give this game a even more positive rating than it already has BECAUSE IT'S THAT GOOD. It will go on sale for $3 on occasion so when it does, go buy it. It is 120% worth it. 10/10","April 13","true","39.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I have neither watched the Anime nor even knew what the story was about, though I could obviously guess part of it thanks to the title. Given the fact that this an Otome game I didn't really expect much, story-wise at least. I thought I'd get some fun hours outta this, with too much cheesy talk and some bishounen without any character depth, so when I actually got into the game I was really happy to discover how wrong I was.\n\nSure, for people who look for a game with much gameplay, who get tired of reading pretty easily this would probably be torturous to sit through and there's no denying it's still an Otome game that fullfils some cliché aspects, but I like how much content and character depth is actually provided, especially compared to other games of the same genre.\nFor once, it actually does have a story (that's NOT predictable).\nYou get to play 5 routes and can achieve over 20 endings. The first two endings took me about 6 hours to achieve, so based on this I'd say you get to play a minimum of 60 - 65 hours.\n\n\nAnyway, this is definitely one of the best Otome games out there and might even be fun for those who are not particulary fond of the genre. Tbf I even think that this is one of the very few ones that even guys could enjoy and it is very much worth the money.","November 2, 2015","true","25.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

All of the sprites and CGs are really pretty, and the backgrounds are sort of a muted colors with white.\n\nUnlike some otome games where you spend the first part of the game getting to know the characters and then figuring out which ones you want to romance, this game makes you choose immediately and then you are locked into that guy's route and can only succeed or fail (spectacularly) at it.\n\nThe good part about this is that the stories for each guy are very different, and as your character starts with amnesia (like the title) the mysterious and unknown parts of your life are different between routes. The relationships you have to the love interests and other characters change, which is really interesting and gives the game a lot of replayability since each route is basically its own thing.\n\nThe stories are all very engaging, but there are some definite yandere aspects to some of the relationships, so if that isn't your cup of tea you may want to look into which guys have that before playing so that you can avoid those routes. Or choose them, I guess, if you want to be locked in a cage by a possessive crazy person. :)\n\nThe bad ends definitely kill you, and since the MC has amnesia, she does tend to fall into the otome heroine trope of being fairly passive. There's a story reason for it, obviously, but if you're looking for a spunky MC with her own personality you won't find that here. MC has a few moments, but she's clearly intended to be pretty bland so that you can read whatever you want into her.\n\nI recommend this game, it's a beautiful game with an engaging story, but it's definitely a Japanese otome game in a lot of ways which can be a good or  bad thing depending on how you look at it.","September 26, 2015","true","19.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guignolsaint/recommended/359390/","guignolsaint","GuignolSaint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guignolsaint/","40 products in account","An official Otomate game on steam that should be played by every otome player. This isn't an indie title or an OELVN, this is one of the most popular otome titles in Japan by one of the largest otome game companies localized for PC. The game goes for $80+ or more in Japan, so $30 is more than worth the price of the game's content. It also gets a lot of discounted sales, so there is no reason to not buy this.\n\nIf you haven't watched the anime, I would suggest playing the game first. Also, consider using a random playing card generator to pick your route order, it was really fun for me lol. Playing in the order from top to bottom is best though.\n\n+ Art is top notch quality and absolutely beautiful. Gorgeous colors, complex character designs, and a multitude of CGs. Although the backgrounds are a little weak, you don't spend too much time in one place.\n+ Japanese voice acting is and always will be an A+ for any game. Personally, I put the text speed to 0, so the text could match up with the spoken dialogue length.\n+ The routes are long. Multiple endings add a lot of replayability.\n+ A great choice system that applies to you (the player) and the heroine's personality. The consequences do matter as you could put yourself into a bad ending. Getting the good endings without a guide was extremely satisfying for me. The effort to reach all the endings don't require walkthroughs (though tempting), it just requires a lot of patience (a quick save/load function would have been appreciated).\n+ A strong mystery story and good use of the amnesia trope. The routes cover entirely different storylines with an overlapping mystery that is revealed through the final route. The story reaches a satisfying conclusion, although bittersweet, and should answer all questions.\n+ Strong character personalities that go beyond otome stereotypes, I was thoroughly surprised that Ikki became my favorite guy when I had written him off as the player type.\n+ A lot of extras such as short stories, minigames, and nice CG rewards for being a completionist\n+ I prefer a balance between story and romantic scenes, which Amnesia does right. There are cute moments and sexual tension scenes. Ikki managed to make me blush after trying hard not to. I felt satisfied with each world's relationships *except Toma's\n+/- The minigames in the menu aren't utilized in the main game at all, even though there are scenes where the minigames could have been used. For that reason, they felt more like an afterthought as an extra. Also, the air hockey minigame has unexplainable lag, which makes it frustrating to beat, but not impossible.\n+/- Music is so-so. It sets the mystery (with a bit of horror) mood, but no tracks really stood out to me.\n\n*A note for achievement advice: the gallery has a hidden minigame. The rose stickers on certain CGs have voice clips hidden in several spots of the photo (follow the controls). I can confirm that you must do this in ONE SITTING to unlock the achievement. Thoroughly click all over the pictures because there is about 6-7 dialogues each (don't forget the variations and zooming out).\n\nOverall, Amnesia has become one of my favorite otome games and I really hope the other titles (Crowd, World, and Later) can be localized.","January 8","true","79.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Intriguing and well-written stories, beautiful artwork, characters you can really care about.  Every individual parallel world / romance option was different and challenging and very engaging.  I'm sorry I'm almost done.  Wish I could start over and envy everyone who is playing for the first time!\n\nOne thing that some may consider a drawback:  the stories revolve around the main character but the main character doesn't develop per se - the development is primarily in the story and the relationships. This bothered me less in this game than it might have because the stories and other characters were so good.  I will add, though, that I did find the MC's passivity to be an irritant; be warned - the best endings required a certain amount making the MC put up with crap.  Again, I tolerated that better than usual.\n\nSome non-game things that impressed me:  English translation had very few typos/errors (this can be really jarring when done poorly so kudos for being done so well); "photo album" with playback feature for key scenes was nicely done.\n\nHighly recommended for escaping reality! :)  [Warning:  there are some disturbing themes in the later parallel worlds.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/virescent/recommended/359390/","virescent","Virescent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/virescent/","999 products in account","TL;DR: 4/5. One of the best otome game I've played so far. I highly recommend it!\n\n---\n\nWarning: This review may contain spoilers.\n\nIn Amnesia: Memories, you first open your eyes to a vast empty space which - you soon learn - is the gateway to many parallel realities. You then meet a spirit (Orion) who basically tells you that he's stuck inside your consciousness; his collision being the cause of your memory loss. The first major choice you make in the game is to pick which reality/world you came from: Heart, Spade, Clover or Diamond, i.e. according to the motifs associated with each of your love interests. There's also an unlockable world (Joker) you can only get after achieving good endings in the other realities.\n\nStory: (5/5)\nUnlike many other visual novels in which you gradually form a relationship with your chosen love interest, I find it refreshing that in Amnesia: Memories you're already in one at the very start. The five routes (worlds) have a similar theme of you having some sort of relationship issues (plus the memory loss), but the plot in each is very different - giving the game a high replay value. Some of the minor characters even have completely different personalities: most notably, Waka, the manager of café you work at. Each route took me about 5-7 hours to complete and the game, around 30 hours.\n\nWhile there are some internal monologues at the end of each route, you are entirely silent unless making a choice. Because of this, I feel that it is easy to get immersed in the story. It's like you're holding a conversation (although one-sided) with Orion throughout the game. Don't worry though, he knows when to make himself scarce during the more romantic scenes.\n\nThe story itself is lighthearted at the beginning, but around the halfway mark it becomes more suspenseful, tragic and even creepy in some storylines; Toma's (Diamond) route in particular (and Ikki's fangirls). The whole incident where he drugs you and put you in a cage made me very uncomfortable; and the fact that we're (as the main character) expected to just forgive him to get the good ending left me really baffled. Other than that, I truly enjoyed the other routes with Kent's (Clover) and Ukyo's (Joker) being the stand out. At least Kent's route provides some reprieve from the craziness of Ikki's fanclub. And Ukyo...I can probably write an essay on how I feel about his story but I'll just say it's worth experiencing for yourself.\n\nThere are also a few things I feel that aren't as clearly explained (e.g. the wishes, Lord Nhil and the world Orion came from) but overall it's very well-written with only a few, minor typos. I also want to mention the various instances where characters tease you with obscure(?) hints (spoilers really) of what can happen to you in the other routes. I find these very amusing especially if you only realize it after playing a few times.\n\nGameplay: (3/5)\nThe game plays like a basic VN with dialogue branches and unlockable CGs. There are unfortunately only 24 save slots in the game. I would've much preferred to keep all my saves instead of having to overwrite each time I start on a new route. If there is a way to watch the complete ending scenes again, I wouldn't mind as much. But since there's not, I think the game could do with unlimited save slots.\n\nThe game provides you with a 'Parameter' system (shown on the 3rd screenshot) to check the status of your relationship and maybe which ending you get in the end(?), but I think it is a bit unnecessary. The 'Suspicion' meter, in particular, maxes out at some point in the story no matter what you do anyway.\n\nThe 2 mini games available are simple, short and somewhat enjoyable. What I do appreciate about the Rock-Paper-Scissors mini game is the Hit 'N' Guard mechanic that ensures it relies less on luck and more on your reflexes. It does make the mini game way easier however.\n\nThere are also a few extra content unlocked after finishing the game including short stories told from the perspective of the love interests that I find interesting. I recommend reading at least Ukyo's.\n\nControls: (3/5)\nI was pleasantly surprised to find out that the keyboard (and gamepad?) controls are re-bindable. Although I don't think I would ever need to re-bind anything for this particular game, I do appreciate the devs putting that feature in regardless. I do wish there was an option to skip the story after picking a choice, but other than that, I have nothing bad to say about the options menu.\n\nGraphics: (5/5)\nPractically every character in the game is gorgeously designed, and every voiced dialogue is accompanied by effective use of expressions and eye blinking. The stylized backdrops with little tints of color suit the game in my opinion and makes it look very surreal/dream-like in its simplicity. A close-up of the curtains at the Shinano mountain lodge in a few conversations, however, looked very messy and amateurish but that's just me nitpicking.\n\nSound: (4/5)\nThe voice acting for all the characters are done very professionally by accomplished voice actors. There are no English voices but the high quality of the Japanese voices more than makes up for it. The lip syncing is just okay; it's a bit distracting when their mouths move even when they're not actually saying anything. Tracks used for the background music are generally soft and tranquil but slightly repetitive. I can listen to the opening song all day though and to a lesser extent, the ending song as well.\n\nConclusion:\nA must try for fans of the genre. I can't say if it's worth it for $30 since I bought it on sale. But for $3, I would definitely recommend buying it.","December 5, 2015","true","39.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It can be quite an emotional rollercoaster. Even though people joke around saying it's not the Amnesia horror game, it can be quite scary in a different sense.\nThere are entertaining little mini-games, side stories and unlockable stuff.\n\nFor the price ($17.99 on sale), I think it is well worth it. I can see why this game is so popular in Japan (with sequels).","August 28, 2015","true","21.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The story is told in a very interesting way compared to most visual novels as you choose the character route at the beginning of the game, and the goal of the game being to get that character's best possible ending. (All characters have bad endings, normal endings, and good endings.)\n\nOne of my favourite things about Amnesia: Memories was that it really builds on the characters as you play, and you sympathize with the heroine as just like her you know nothing about the bachelors and have to learn about them. There was a particular bachelor that I started out hating, and the heroine didn't care much for either - but as you gain her memories back you start to gain insight into these characters and begin to care for them - with this, the game does a great job of putting you in her shoes.\n\nIn short, I honestly recommend this game if you're looking for a great otome game with cute anime boys, pretty visuals, and great music. I hope we get to see more otome games in the future!

After restarting saves, micromanging descisions, and starting the route over again, I had to look up a walkthrough to find out that you have to be super lovey-dovey. but those descisions made him super suspicous so I always rejected those choices, leading to a getting an ending where he was too suspicious of me even though my suspision was as low as possible. Wow that was a long tangent/rant. Anyway.)\n-One storyline is a bit fetish specific and may to off putting to everyone else\n-The achievments are bit broken, for me at least. Totally did what the achievement told me to, but Steam won't give me it\n\nConclusion:\nThe pros massiy outway the cons. I really really enjoyed 4 out of 5 routes (sorry, just not into yanderes).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magnenchesed/recommended/359390/","magnenchesed","Magnen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magnenchesed/","102 products in account","I don't normally write reviews, but this visual novel has left an exceptional impression on me. Since this game is nothing but story, I'll try to keep it spoiler-free.\n\n(Side-note: This visual novel has an anime! It's crap compared to the game though, so I don't recommend that)\n\nOverall Positive Features:\n\nStory - This is the most important part of the game, so respectfully it's the best part. There are five arcs to this game, each pertaining to one of the five main male characters. Even if you aren't the biggest fan of the main male character to the arc, the heroine's relationship to him is generally not the only focus of the story, so it's still enjoyable.\n\nJapanese Voice-acting - the voice acting work of this game is well-done; character voices fit the personalities appropriately, and nobody sounds like an emotionless brick unless they're supposed to.\n\nCharacter art and CGs - The design of the characters and the CGs are really nice in my opinion- even if you're really stingy about art, the designs are at the very least tolerable.\n\nMusic - The soundtrack of this game is fantastic and fits the mood extremely well. The song for the opening movie also has a lot of hype, I love it.\n\nThings You May Find Iffy:\n\nOrion - Orion is a character that is with you throughout the entire game and provides commentary on what's happening around you for the majority of the game. He's also extremely important to the plot, so even if you don't like him, you're stuck with him. Personally I like Orion, but his constant presence can be annoying to players. Since you can't 'disable' him, it can ruin the game for you if you don't like him.\n\nBackground Art - I'll level with you. There's only like three or four colors along with some gradient in them most of the time, excluding white. I personally don't mind this since it allows me to focus on the characters in front of me rather than being distracted by a super-detailed background, but you may find it a bit too washed-out for your taste (check the screenshots on the store page to see if you like it or not).\n\nBonus:\n\nEndings - This game has A LOT of endings. Every arc has at least four endings: The good ending, the normal ending, and at least two bad endings, with a total of 26 endings.\n\nMemories & Extras - Okay, so at some point, you will unlock the item "Memories" for the main menu. The Memories are little bonus scenes where the heroine spends time with that character at some point during the story. Next, there's the item "Extras" which you also unlock at some point for the main menu. These are basically silent thoughts from the main male of a particular arc. And by silent, I mean there isn't any voice acting, it's pretty much just pure reading.\n\nCG Voice Clips: As you unlock CGs, you can review them in the gallery, which is pretty standard. Certain CGs (that is, CGs with a little red rose in the corner of the preview) will play voice clips when you ctrl + left click certain areas with about five different voice clips to each CG (this includes alternate versions of that CG, by the way). While it's a nice feature, looking for these things becomes a clicking hunt as there is no indication that you can actually click there (and for shorter voice clips, you're sometimes supposed to click on an area multiple times).\n\nMini-Games: Okay, now this is kind of silly, but this game has it's own version of rock-paper-scissors and air hockey. Rock-paper-scissors got turned into a reflex game where you have to "attack" if you win so you get a point, or "defend" if you lose so they don't get a point. Air hockey is, well, air hockey. You can play against the five main guys as kind of varying levels of difficulty, and you get an achievement for beating them all. The moral of this story is that if you're getting frustrated at one of the guys, you can just beat them at air hockey and rock-paper-scissors.\n\nMy Final Thoughts:\n\nOverall I think this game is fantastic and while it's definitely not an experience meant for everybody (the heroine having a romantic relationship with one of five guys should have made that obvious) I personally believe that the story is enjoyable to anyone who enjoys romance (I do suggest if you're not of the intended audience you should just look up a walkthrough of this game, and again, don't even bother with the anime).","May 19","true","53.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Gorgeous graphics. Not so gorgeous when they zoom in though.\nEach of the love interests has a different route. So you won't experience the same stories over and over again.\nThe (side) characters will change their personality too depending on the route you are taking.\nVariety in the game is on point. The mini games though, I don't really get that, but it's just so-so. It looks cute, at least.\nYeah.. I would recommend it to people who like those cute love stories with a hint of mystery.\nAnd of course, cute guys !!\nAnd at each guy you can get different endings, a good one, normal one or bad one(s). It all depends on the character how many bad endings you can get. So your choices definitely have some impact.\nThe only bad thing about the whole game is, that when you take a new route you need to go through the memory loss thing over and over again. In each world she loses her memory again in the beginning. And you experience the intro all over again, it's mostly a little bit different each time, but it's kind of the same idea rip.\nIf you want a taste (or some preview) of the game, may contain some spoilers though, watch the anime. If you just want to take a look what the story is about, watch episode 1. The heroine in the anime is kind of annoying though, looks like she isn't capable of doing anything, in the game she (you) is much more fun :)\nTruly a good visual novel. I liked every route.

This is the story of Amnesia: memories.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat if you have an accident and forget everything of the past months? What would you do? How would we start again? When you wake up there's no friends or family at that moment. But maybe you don't wake up in a familiar place but at another dimension. Then you meet someone who wants to help,a spirit - he said, called Orion. He explains what's going on, he's attached to your soul and also, he's gonna help you to recover your memories. And at the end, he gives you a choice, to back to your world. Which one? Several, infinite dimensions, but you have five. Just pick one, and the adventure begins.\n\nIf you love anime you'll love Amnesia: memories. Personally , I'm not a big anime fan but I use to watch some. And believe me, is even better than just watching a series. Here you are part of the story, in a sort of "choose your own adventure" with the condiment of romance and many other things. Things about life after all, and you won't regret to explore every way of choices ahead. Just be careful in what you say or do, things could be good or wrong. You are advised!\n\nGameplay\nHere you play with a girl, and you can choose her name. Personally, I'd love to play as a boy too but I think the game was conceived for visual novel fan girls. When I told you about the five worlds, that's because every world has a male main character and you will see the rest as secondaries. The worlds have a unique history and several endings, some sad, some great and some... spoilers!\n\nHow the game works? basically, you'll have several dialogues, and you Orion, this spirit will help you telling what to do, sometimes Orion could be a little bit irritating sometimes, but he is constantly helping us. Of course, he has his own opinions about what's going on around us.\n\nOld memories are lost but they will come, you have to achieve that, of course, will depend on wich path you follow and how you act with the people around your character.  This is the story of a girl, maybe many girls in many universes with different situations.\n\nThis game has something I don't use to see a lot, even in graphic adventures which I love to play: the voices. Every character has a unique voice and shows perfect their nature, along with the great storyboard that makes this game a jewel in the genre of visual novels.\n\nMusic and graphics: lovely, they are so anime(ish), and all ambience, music, art concept, it's great. I repeat, a jewel in many aspects this game Amnesia: memories.\n\nExtra Issues and final thoughts\nAbout playing... I advise you to save the game when you have the chance of pick one of the five worlds, so you can skip the whole conversation with Orion at the beginning wich is a little long for my taste. Also, save just in case, there are several save slots, use them! So you can go back just in case and let's see what happen if you pick a different dialogue option.\n\nAs an extra there are minigames you can play at the introduction, and also you have steam achievements to get.\n\nThanks for this game, it's really just awesome, maybe on of the best visual novels. Is like reading a book, but with choices, something very immersive. I'm sure you will enjoy playing Amnesia: Memories.\n\nThanks to the developers for such great game!","May 16","true","8.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

When Amnesia came to Steam I got so happy because there aren't a lot of otome games available in english or portuguese, so I used to play the japanese ones. But, I couldn't understand the stories at all, because i'm not so familiar with this language, although i'm studying it.\nThe plot of Amnesia is captivating. After about 1-2 hours of gameplay the story becomes really interesting, and you can't stop playing it! There are some aspects that I want to talk about:\nThe art: Stunning. The design of the characters, the backgrounds, etc are really creative and beautiful. I loved the idea of using poker cards as inspiration for the characters' clothes.\nThe characters: Each one has a remarkable personality and appearance, looks like they are real people. I mean, you can even fall in love for them.\nThe voice actors: All that I want to say is that the seiyuus matched perfectly with the characters(also, i'm a big fan of Kakihara Tetsuya and his works).\nSo, if you want to play a game that has a great plot and amazing characters you should buy Amnesia Memories. And if you watched the anime before, this game is even more recommended ! :)","January 4","true","27.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The mystery evolves very smoothly, and the more you go on the more you want to know what happened to the heroine or what the other characters are 'hiding'.\nSome people may find the fact that the heroin doesn't actually talk till the very end of the game weird or irritating, but I didn't mind it 'cause Orion was always speaking for her (sometimes I wish he would just shut up lol).\nThe minigames are very easy, and I think they were...Unnecessary, maybe? Idk, I played them just to get the achievements, they were pretty boring.\nEvery character is interesting and none of the routes are boring. Well, I already knew about THE THING in Touma's route, so it made me laugh lol. Yeah, maybe that was avoidable. Oh, my favorite pg is Ukyo btw, but his route is full of feels and I actually liked him more in the fandisk (Amnesia Crowd for PSP). I can't decide who gets the 2nd place between Kent and Shin, they were both cute~\nThe translation was very well done imho. I play games in japanese all the time, and translations aren't always well done so I was a bit worried about Amnesia, but I was pleasantly surprised. There were, however, some lines that didn't match at all with what was being said, or lines where the subject of the sentence was wrong, causing a bit of confusion (I remember noticing this near the end of Ukyo's route: the written lines didn't make sense and were a bit confusing, so I ignored them and listened to his voice instead). The lines that didn't match were for the most part minor parts (like insults or short sentences), so it didn't affect the quality of the game. PS: I'm not talking about things hard to translate: they were "normal" sentences which could have been easily translated. I wonder why you do a nice translation and then make such avoidable mistakes or totally change the meaning of a line.\nSo, to sum it up: I LOVE Amnesia, and if you don't understand japanese then this is perfect for you. I bought it when it was €2.79 and, honestly, if I had to buy it now at full price I wouldn't, because I like japanese games more and bought this just out of curiosity. Amnesia is worth its price tho. It's well done, it has VERY nice graphics and a good plot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/visualsandnovelty/recommended/359390/","visualsandnovelty","K-rollin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/visualsandnovelty/","4 products in account","It's not often that you'll hear me, of all people, make a statement like this, but I genuinely feel bad that I got this game at such a high discount. I bought Amnesia when it was 90% off for the winter sale, and it's certainly one of the best visual novels I've ever played.\n\nFor one thing, this game is just incredibly well-made. Now, a good 90% of the visual novels I've played have been freeware ones I've found online across various forums. None of them have had particularly high production values or anything like that; at most they've feature a couple of CGs and a bonus scene or some questions answered by the creator about their game, but besides that they're pretty basic. To get a game with so many CGs, which are remarkably well-drawn and colored; voice acting; an awesome soundtrack (I may or may not have gotten about 60-65% of my playing hours for this game by just leaving it open while I did other stuff on my computer in different windows, just because I really liked the music); mini-games (albeit ones with rather poor controls in several cases, though that may be due to my mouse being particularly terrible);  and over 20 different endings is a completely new experience for me. It's been somewhat hard for me to go back to playing games without most of these nice features, or at least where these features aren't as well done as they are in Amnesia. I feel like I stole something by getting a game this nice for only three dollars.\n\nBut speaking of all of those endings I mentioned, let me discuss the actual routes and characters, since they make up a bulk of the game's experience. The routes are set in different alternate 'worlds', each of which is named after suits on playing cards. Please note that you should probably play the routes in the order they're listed as choices; I made the mistake of playing Toma's route first, since he was the only character I was curious about going in, and I can't help but feel like I would've enjoyed the game that much more if I had just chosen his route last. (In Shin's route, at least, things become a *lot* more predictable once you know the sort of stunts Toma's capable of pulling.) Each route has a good end, a normal end, and several bad ends. Note: there's 5 routes to play, not 4, but the fifth is only unlockable after you've done the others.\n\nNow onto the characters themselves. For the most part, I thought all the romanceable guys were pretty likeable and well-portrayed. Not all of them strike me as 'boyfriend' material, but nonetheless, every one of them was quite interesting in his own right. While the guys are essentially stock otome love interests- we have a blunt tsundere with a heart of gold, a chivalrous playboy whose only *sincere* romantic interest is in you (the heroine), a logical and seemingly cold (but entirely adorkable) nerd, and a yandere willing to do anything to protect you- they're all either played to perfection or with an interesting twist on the usual 'type'.\n\nMy personal favorite character is Ikki, which says a lot, since I typically dislike the 'playboy' type (if I don't ignore them as an option altogether). But Ikki was sweet and had quite a bit more depth to his character than I was expecting, and several times I really wanted to hug him because I felt so badly for him. That said, I don't think I actually disliked any of the love interests, at least not in retrospect. Some of them made me very frustrated, and some of the routes were outright morally compromising (I'm looking at you, Toma), but they were really enjoyable overall. Hell, Toma's route was the first one I wanted to replay- I don't like him as a love interest, particularly, but he was damn entertaining.\n\nAnd while I haven't said anything about Ukyo, he was a different sort of character than I've dealt with in any otome game before. I'm still not quite sure what to make of his route. I will once again offer a bit of advice and say this: DO NOT LOOK UP ANYTHING RELATED TO UKYO UNTIL YOU'VE PLAYED THROUGH HIS ROUTE AT LEAST ONCE. Once again, I made the mistake of spoiling the twist with him before I even unlocked his route, which took away a lot of his charm for me. Instead, playing through his route was something of a drag because I didn't have to piece together any of his cryptic statements or anything.\n\nThis whole review has turned into one long TL;DR, so I'll say this in conclusion: Amnesia was a thoroughly enjoyable game. Even the characters who I didn't particularly like as love interests were quite entertaining regardless, and this is certainly the most professional, well-presented otome game- or visual novel in general- that I've ever played. I probably would've liked it even more had I not spoiled some major aspects of the story for myself, but even given that, Amnesia totally won me over. I'd love to see more on Steam from Idea Factory in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 25","true","89.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Still freaked out later on though.\n- some plot points are a bit over the top  like the fan club\n- the "Good Endings" don't necessarily feel like good ones... I feel like one of them goes through much more/better character development in another guy's good ending than in his own, which makes his development in his own route rather disappointing  Yes, I'm looking at you, Toma..\n- dying feels bad man\n\nDefinitely recommended.

I wasn't really eager to play this at first but I wanted to get a better impression of everything "Amnesia" - related after watching the dissapointing anime. When it was on steam sale I couldn't resist... So... here I am, writing a review about - what I call - a freaking amazing visual novel.\n\nNot only was the story intruiging, well-written, dark, yet romantic, but also mysterious, no, the art is also marvellous and beautiful. I can't really describe with words just how much I enjoyed it up til now. And don't get me started on the voice acting... There aren't all that many things to nitpick on... if you could really call it that.\n\nThe minigames were sweet and funny but nothing groundbreaking. I mean... it's a nice feature but it didn't do much for the visual novel. Even more so storywise. I mean... there was about one situation when those minigames also were mentionned within the story ... but there wasn't more to it. But it's okay...\n\nI'd totally recommend it. It was one of the best visual novel experiences I've ever made. Cuuuuuute love interests 10/10.","May 15","true","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For two reasons. The first one (being a bit of a negative) is at least for me it seemed a bit too easy to get the “bad endings” with most (if not all) of the guys in question which made it a bit hard to carry on when you get invested in a character to basically be in full tears and just want to lay on the floor for hours like human trash. However at the same time this is a POSITIVE partly because it means you can get into the story that is unfolding enjoy to feel those endings and just to hate yourself and what causes said events to happen.\n\nThe seconds reason (which is a big positive) I like how they connect everything. By this I mean the characters and the stories all at once. (not going to go into detail because spoilers) Also all not only do each of the dateable guys seem to have completely different personalities and likes so do the outside characters such as friends and co-workers. Which really gives it a nice touch since it doesn’t feel like you're just interacting with Guy A or Guy B. When you talk to someone like Kent it’s different talking to him as it would if you were talking to someone like Ikki.\n\nThe only other “Negative” that came up for me would be that Orion can get on my nerves. I think this is because after going after the same guy for roughly the fourth time in an attempt to get the good ending you kind of want to strangle him when you sits there just recapping what happened not even three minutes ago in game.\n\nOverall though I deeply enjoyed this game, yes it has some rather adult themes and dark scenarios but I rather enjoyed it since some of them catch you off guard and end up adding something to the story and even making you re-think about some of the characters you meet when you go down different paths.\n","May 14","true","25.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The choices you make don't seem to do much but in the background they do aim towards a good or bad ending.\nIt is a nice pass-time to read and see what else to find but the diffrent path-ways in each world seemed not worth going through the same story again just to see what will be said or would be done. Only in a few were the paths different and lead to more of the story.\n\nThe background scenary are simple with nice effects so you can focus on the character art while still making the world seem alive and more real without getting lost in it.\nThe loading screens and cut-scenes are also wonderful additions and to look back at in the gallery.\n\nUyko was worth unlocking in the end, even if he does have the most bad endings....Ukyo why ;v;\n\nHowever be wary that the Air-Hockey mini-game is laggy/broken and has not been fixed since release. The devs have not come back to fix this either so sadly this is abandoned and it is a shame since it is needed to get the final 5 achievements.","March 13","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was either close the game or deal with orion talking again.\n\nOrion seems rather mentally challenged as he desires to talk endlessly about things you could have easily figured out. Hes more of a bother to deal with then any actual help. Not to mention the fact that whenever you talk to him it looks like you're starring off into space and talking to air. Biggest question is how did he not know where he hit you :/\n\nChecked if there was any filter on the naming system by calling myself Orion as well. Game didn't seem to be aware of that... That or Orion/Kent shipping is confirmed.\n\nThe guy in the clover run is actually rather entertaining. He feels like you hate him so much I sent a affectionate message to mess with him and he said he dropped his phone seeing it XD.\n\nEverything seems to get answered in due time even heard that going through each world unlocks another. Can't personally verify that rumor though.\n\nIf you can handle constantly being stopped by a spirit that has a problem with everything you do from opening doors to answering the phone I'd say go for it. Just remember you don't owe anyone 10,000 dollars, avoid being sent overseas and trust noone. ...or am I doing the spirits job for him?\n\nPlay however you want its your game.\n\n","February 29","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Side note, you can't just call off the relationship with a guy in the world you pick, because this type of game is built with the assumption that you intend to pursue these guys.  It's $3 worth of silly writing, romance, and good-looking guys.  Now... Reasons why $3 is worth your time...\n\nLikes\n1.  Character and CG art are done well.  The artist does a good enough job with mixing up different viewing angles of the scene, but the placement of hair or other parts of the characters makes the viewing angles of their faces look weird (i.e. their noses seem to disappear).  Similarly to CG viewing angles, it was a nice touch to have character sprites facing the player in order to convey a sense of direction.  Likewise, these additions add to some imagination that two characters are directly looking at each other.  There's also lip movement when characters talk so the player isn't staring at stiff mouths all the time.\n\n2.  Plots for 4/5 guys are done well in the sense that it's not romance-focused, but more mystery-focused as the player pieces together what happened before the heroine lost her memories.  At the same time, the player has to take care to not max out the suspicion parameter lest that triggers bad endings or characters may take advantage of that.\n\n3.  Each guy has a distinct archetype so the player can freely pick any to start.  Overall, Shin and Toma are the childhood friends (i.e. romantically aggressive and romantically a doormat, in that order); Ikki, Kent, and Ukyo (<- unlocked after playing the other 4) are the older guys roughly ages 21-26 (i.e. not-typical-playboy; stoic, logical guy; and aloof romanticist).  Word of advice: Don't pick Toma's route (Diamond world) if you're not familiar with an archetype made popular with Mirai Nikki.\n\nDislikes\n1.  Whoever wrote Orion's lines needs to be suspended for a while.  A lot of people hate hearing Orion, and I agree in that Orion was the weakest link.  Although I appreciated Orion's hinting of how to respond to specific situations, his role as the heroine's voice and partner-in-crime was horrible.  The game's rated T for Teens, but Orion's regurgitation of really obvious information and constant attempts to get you to doubt everything were patronizing at best, and very insulting at worst to the average 13-19 yr old's reading and problem-solving skills (or am I giving teens too much credit?).  Furthermore, taking his advice seriously in Ikki's route(Spade) can get you the bad ending quickly.  Likewise, Orion forgot to remind the heroine to read her diary in Toma's route (Diamond) which would've saved a lot of headache.\n\n2.  Beyond Orion, writing is very spotty in Toma's route and a bit in Ikki's route.  Logic was missing and anyone who understood dramatic irony can piece together the mysteries quickly, which makes Orion's remarks even more irritating.  Overall, the heroine is written so then she only has more lines after she regains her memories.  Before she gets all of her memories back, she is practically silent except when picking dialogue choices.  I'm sure people don't stay silent all the time just because some memories are missing, especially if it's a survival issue of not letting others know they have amnesia.  Something to keep in mind is that the almost-silent heroine exists because it's a common storytelling device to allow the players to project themselves onto her (e.g. Persona 3 and 4's silent protagonists... except they had personalities too...).  While I wouldn't mind it in an otome game, this storytelling device was done poorly and if you want a voiced otome heroine, look to Hakuoki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom, Code: Realize, or Norn9: Var Commons.  The wording of the dialogue choices can be frustrating sometimes, because there are the obvious ones and the less obvious ones that boost the trust and affection parameters.\n\n3.  A minor dislike in the backgrounds.  Although stylistic and doesn't clash with character art, the resolution was noticeably awful when zoomed in for the purpose of perspective.  Not only was the resolution bad, but the backgrounds don't look like they were manually drawn and look like filtered photos.\n\n4.  Getting the air hockey achievement wouldn't be so bad if the devs just optimized the friggin' game.  The lag is intense and there has already been a major thread providing self-taught solutions to minimizing the lag so the mini-game can be tolerable.\n\nFinal Say\nFor $3, you can't go wrong with purchasing this game if you're into the otome visual novel genre.  Just think of it as a discounted game that can provide you with a light story and some laughs along the way.  Be aware that this game was released a couple of years ago by the Japanese company, Otomate.  Why emphasize the "Japanese" part?  Because there are plenty of non-Japanese gamers who were instantly turned off by a silent heroine and some of the things the guys say (e.g. "Watch your surroundings full of guys oogling your bikini", "Don't you know it's dangerous to invite a guy to your room when living alone?", "I don't know if I can control my urges" etc) because part of the writing is influenced by Japanese storytelling targeted at Japanese women.","January 15","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hylacin/recommended/359390/","hylacin","bow saint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hylacin/","12 products in account","As like many Otome games, there is obviously a lack of realism. However, trudging through some of the weird premise that all the boys love you without any memories, you'll find a pretty intricate foundation for the world of Amnesia. I found it pretty fascinating in the aspect for world building. I've always been interested in a visual novel that basically goes backwards (due to amnesia).  Story-wise, it's a lot deeper than it appears. It may seem shallow at first, but once added together it has some depth and darkness. It's eerily dark and convoluted for an otome, actually.\n\nA note: Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it to a male audience. I imagine it would be well welcomed by girls (because it's made for girls). The game is also based on Japanese culture, so some parts may not relatable to a Western audience(?).\n\nGame-wise, while I enjoyed the routes to some degree, half of the characters lacked the development they needed/deserved in their respective routes. A lot of issues especially with Toma and Ukyo are shoved under the rug rather than resolved in a constructive and healthy way. I'm assuming that this may be addressed in the sequel games (Amnesia Later).\n\nI really like the characters themselves! Possibly the only reason I continued to read. Their relationship web, aside from the MC, made them a lot more likable. I'm also a sucker for reminiscing in any medium.","December 5, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I've never watched the anime, but I heard bad things about it. But since the game was insanely cheap during the sale, I decided to buy it and I didn't regret it.\n\nYou play a girl who has lost her memories. And depending on which "world" you choose during the prologue, you're the target attention of a certain guy. Your goal is to try and recover your lost memories without letting anyone on to you having amnesia.\n\nThere are 5 guys, each with their own route. In order to unlock the 5th guy's route you have to get the "Good Endings" for the 4 other routes.\n\nThe guys in the game are pretty likeable. At the start of each route, I was like "wtf who the ♥♥♥♥ are you" but by the end of each route, I ended up really liking each guy.\n\nEach of the guys have their own personalities:\nShin- The guy who acts like he doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥, but he actually does give a ♥♥♥♥\nToma- The guy who acts like your older brother, but secretly wants the V.\nIkki- The ladies man\nKent- The nerd who is awkward as ♥♥♥♥ in a relationship\nUkyo- The guy with a double personality.\n\nPersonally, Shin is my favorite (and so is his route).\n\nThe art and music are both BEAUTIFUL. 10/10\n\nThere's also 2 mini-games you can play (by selecting them on the title screen): Rock-paper-scissors and Air Hockey. Unfortunatley, the air-hockey doesn't work for me because it lags a lot :/  The rock-paper-scissors is kinda fun, but I only played it to get the achievements. :P\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game. I did find some of the routes a bit boring, though. I really liked Shin's, Toma's, and Ukyo's route, but I found Ikki's and Kent's a bit boring at times. I still did enjoy them though. :) Now I might try watching the anime series because I heard it's not as confusing if you've played the game.\n\nTL;DR buy this if you want to date a bunch of hot animu guys","December 28, 2015","true","51.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was either close the game or deal with orion talking again.\n\nOrion seems rather mentally challenged as he desires to talk endlessly about things you could have easily figured out. Hes more of a bother to deal with then any actual help. Not to mention the fact that whenever you talk to him it looks like you're starring off into space and talking to air. Biggest question is how did he not know where he hit you :/\n\nChecked if there was any filter on the naming system by calling myself Orion as well. Game didn't seem to be aware of that... That or Orion/Kent shipping is confirmed.\n\nThe guy in the clover run is actually rather entertaining. He feels like you hate him so much I sent a affectionate message to mess with him and he said he dropped his phone seeing it XD.\n\nEverything seems to get answered in due time even heard that going through each world unlocks another. Can't personally verify that rumor though.\n\nIf you can handle constantly being stopped by a spirit that has a problem with everything you do from opening doors to answering the phone I'd say go for it.

Since Steam's change in discount policy, Amnesia has been on sale for $3 after 90% discount.  That alone should be enough to invest at least 3 hours of your time in a guy you're interested in.  Side note, you can't just call off the relationship with a guy in the world you pick, because this type of game is built with the assumption that you intend to pursue these guys.  It's $3 worth of silly writing, romance, and good-looking guys.  Now... Reasons why $3 is worth your time...\n\nLikes\n1.  Character and CG art are done well.  The artist does a good enough job with mixing up different viewing angles of the scene, but the placement of hair or other parts of the characters makes the viewing angles of their faces look weird (i.e. their noses seem to disappear).  Similarly to CG viewing angles, it was a nice touch to have character sprites facing the player in order to convey a sense of direction.  Likewise, these additions add to some imagination that two characters are directly looking at each other.  There's also lip movement when characters talk so the player isn't staring at stiff mouths all the time.\n\n2.  Plots for 4/5 guys are done well in the sense that it's not romance-focused, but more mystery-focused as the player pieces together what happened before the heroine lost her memories.  At the same time, the player has to take care to not max out the suspicion parameter lest that triggers bad endings or characters may take advantage of that.\n\n3.  Each guy has a distinct archetype so the player can freely pick any to start.  Overall, Shin and Toma are the childhood friends (i.e. romantically aggressive and romantically a doormat, in that order); Ikki, Kent, and Ukyo (<- unlocked after playing the other 4) are the older guys roughly ages 21-26 (i.e. not-typical-playboy; stoic, logical guy; and aloof romanticist).  Word of advice: Don't pick Toma's route (Diamond world) if you're not familiar with an archetype made popular with Mirai Nikki.\n\nDislikes\n1.  Whoever wrote Orion's lines needs to be suspended for a while.  A lot of people hate hearing Orion, and I agree in that Orion was the weakest link.  Although I appreciated Orion's hinting of how to respond to specific situations, his role as the heroine's voice and partner-in-crime was horrible.  The game's rated T for Teens, but Orion's regurgitation of really obvious information and constant attempts to get you to doubt everything were patronizing at best, and very insulting at worst to the average 13-19 yr old's reading and problem-solving skills (or am I giving teens too much credit?).  Furthermore, taking his advice seriously in Ikki's route(Spade) can get you the bad ending quickly.  Likewise, Orion forgot to remind the heroine to read her diary in Toma's route (Diamond) which would've saved a lot of headache.\n\n2.  Beyond Orion, writing is very spotty in Toma's route and a bit in Ikki's route.  Logic was missing and anyone who understood dramatic irony can piece together the mysteries quickly, which makes Orion's remarks even more irritating.  Overall, the heroine is written so then she only has more lines after she regains her memories.  Before she gets all of her memories back, she is practically silent except when picking dialogue choices.  I'm sure people don't stay silent all the time just because some memories are missing, especially if it's a survival issue of not letting others know they have amnesia.  Something to keep in mind is that the almost-silent heroine exists because it's a common storytelling device to allow the players to project themselves onto her (e.g. Persona 3 and 4's silent protagonists... except they had personalities too...).  While I wouldn't mind it in an otome game, this storytelling device was done poorly and if you want a voiced otome heroine, look to Hakuoki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom, Code: Realize, or Norn9: Var Commons.  The wording of the dialogue choices can be frustrating sometimes, because there are the obvious ones and the less obvious ones that boost the trust and affection parameters.\n\n3.  A minor dislike in the backgrounds.  Although stylistic and doesn't clash with character art, the resolution was noticeably awful when zoomed in for the purpose of perspective.  Not only was the resolution bad, but the backgrounds don't look like they were manually drawn and look like filtered photos.\n\n4.  Getting the air hockey achievement wouldn't be so bad if the devs just optimized the friggin' game.  The lag is intense and there has already been a major thread providing self-taught solutions to minimizing the lag so the mini-game can be tolerable.\n\nFinal Say\nFor $3, you can't go wrong with purchasing this game if you're into the otome visual novel genre.  Just think of it as a discounted game that can provide you with a light story and some laughs along the way.  Be aware that this game was released a couple of years ago by the Japanese company, Otomate.  Why emphasize the "Japanese" part?  Because there are plenty of non-Japanese gamers who were instantly turned off by a silent heroine and some of the things the guys say (e.g. "Watch your surroundings full of guys oogling your bikini", "Don't you know it's dangerous to invite a guy to your room when living alone?", "I don't know if I can control my urges" etc) because part of the writing is influenced by Japanese storytelling targeted at Japanese women.","January 15","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While every character is integrated in each others stories one way or the other, they tend to be quite different in every one of them, showing that they have a (non stale bread) personality even if they aren't part of the heroine's main story, and that their personality does not revolve around her existing. The heroine barely talks in most routes, since Orion does most of the talking, so, if you come from the anime and hated her in that, this might be a plus for you.\nI have not finished yet all the routes, but from how far i have gotten i have to say i have not gotten dissapointed in the writing (aside from some plot holes).  Love how this allows you to die, as well as for your boyfriends not being perfect ~~uguu angels~~ all the time even in good routes, i'm glad that the creators of this game don't mind stepping on certain toes and decided to keep it true to the original japanese release (as far as i'm concerned).\nCharacters are beautifully designed, amzing color palettes, not too weird anatomy or clothes and the most important thing beautiful beautiful 2D men on my screen.\nEach story is impressively well thought out and can fit in quite a bit of personality preferences you might have without screwing you over in story, so just because you might like a possesive guy his story isn't gonna be less good than the charming suave one, each story seems equally thought out and developed.\nBackgrounds are beautiful albeit a bit repetitive, though they are muted out and not too in your face, so it doesn't really matter.\nAs for the techical side, it runs smoothly, a lot of customization in settings, controller support, clean interface, sikp only read text option, key mapping, non annoying stat bars, amazing voice actors, responsive and smooth transitions, very good translation, a lot of endings, quite a bit of mini games (if you count unlockable ones), incredibly good soundtrack, and lovely LOVELY CG.\nIf you are interested in otome games, or dating sims in general, i seriously cannot recommend this game enough.","May 12","true","33.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll be seeing a lot of the same blurry backdrops over and over, but the engaging story more than makes up for it.\n\nUnravel the mystery of who you are and fall in love over and over again.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to anyone and everyone as long as you're able to get it at a reasonable price.

However, I strongly advise against buying this game for and by young people.\n\nFirst of all, although some of the game plots are interesting, some of the ideas in this game are just plain wrong and often illegal. This is a game promoting violence and objectifying women and glorfying the image of ever timid, submissive and forgiving lady. You invite a boyfriend to your flat for tea - you are asking him to "have his way with you". You are walking alone in the evening - "you are putting yourself in danger and asking for it". The guy turns insane, holds you in a cage, tries to ♥♥♥♥ you - the good ending is to "show how much you still love him". Another crazy dude is killing you in the most elaborate of ways on various occasions - "forgive him and be truly happy together". Most of your boyfriends treat you like crap; to one you are like an item that needs to be protected, another one calls you an idiot most of the time, yet another treats you like ♥♥♥♥ in public. And the good ending to all of that - be timid, don't complain, let them do what they want and be completely forgving and understanding when they hurt you. Otherwise you won't even hear an apology. This is game makes toxic relationships look romantic and "fixable with the power of love". The whole message is so wrong on so many levels that only adult people that already have some life experience and their own opinions should play this game.\n\nThe game is quite passive; a lot of it is just talk talk talk that is basically redundant. The translation is ok at best, there are many grammar errors and weird constructions. The artwork and audio are quite good, though I must admit that in certain CGs or positions the characters look quite "derped". Some of the plot ideas are interesting; for example, Shin's mystery line is quite interesting. Some are really, really dumb - Ikki is pure Twilight. He is also dumb enough not to figure out your amnesia. All in all, this is a 6/10 game for adult audience.","December 3, 2015","false","23.1"," 33 of 65 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","33","65","0","4"

Good for me, because I'm a loser when it comes to horror games. Travelling in a world filled with beautiful, thoughtful yet stubborn men was an experience I was happy to have.\n\nThe thing is, almost all of the men seem to be too unrealistic for my taste. There're many personality disorders, anime stereotypes: you have your tsunderes, overly self-confident guys and everything you can imagine. Considering that this is a "date simulator" - it's completely understandable, that the game developers have wanted to make the guys appeal more desireable and mysterious. The game itself can carry on the story pretty well, but when it comes to your playable character - everything seems to fall apart.\n\nOur protagonist, you, doesn't really have any type of thoughts - besides this mysterious Orion-bugboy, who says everything you supposedly think out loud to you. You won't have any monologue by yourself throughout the whole story - Orion will be the one to take care of that. To be honest that was a bit of a disappointment for me.\n\nOtherwise, the game is fun and you get emerged into the story pretty quickly.\n\nPROS of this game are...\n+ The graphics are beautiful and I really like the voice actors in this one\n+ You've got a variety of supporting characters with pretty interesting personalities. So you don't always have to talk to the guys.\n+ Every milieu is kind of connected and you get to see the different roles of the people on different storylines. This makes everything more interesting and surprising.\n+ The game shows which options you have already chosen, in case you decide to play one "world" again.\n+ You also get fun mini games and screenshots, linked to your actual gameplay.\n\nCONS of this game are...\n- The characters aren't really that original and some of them aren't even good looking. (To me, at least)\n- The achievements are easy, but it's very difficult to know how to get the good endings. I've only managed to get two bad and "average" ending.\n- Some of the parts are the same (obviously) and it kind of boring.\n- The storylines aren't that long, so if you're a fast reader - you'll get through of them quickly.\n+/- You don't get to choose your gender.\n\nMy overall experience was fine. I liked the game, it's fun and it's a great way to kill time. I actually had a little crush on one of the main characters, so I think it worked out for me quite well. It's worth the money, so don't be afraid to get it.","February 23","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

HE TAKES ADVANTAGE!! why would you want to date this young man, please tell.\ni find it insulting that the game devs expect me to want to be with this mutant of a man with glasses and a frankenstiens monster outfit it is just truly disguting and he is tall and wears glasses. he reminds me of the children in classrooms who are sitting in the back and chew on their pencils and sharpen them with their teeth just for fun. this is freakish. who would want to have a fantasy like this induldged???? tell me please. and furthermore, let me ask this; how am i supposed to believe that this mutant thing is best friends with the aforementioned "ladies man" that has gray hair and is ladylike ??? this is a universal improssiblity.\ni cannot remember the rest of the young men they expect me to date because i dont know why maybe they should have tried harder to make me interested in dating these young men but i am not.\ni am most offended by the fact that this company expects and assumes i will believe that this ELF BOY FROM SPACE is just supposed to be inside my head but he can float around and do things on his own??????? does this company believe i am the ♥♥♥♥♥♥??? because i am not and i do not buy this load of absolute BS for one gosh darn second. Not one. NOT A SINGLE ONE. and it enrages me to think that after all this i am supposed to fit my name in the lines that they provide for me to enter my name. i believe there is something like 7 lines for me enter my name into. this is discriminatory. and i do not like people who do that kind of thing. it is insulting. how am i supposed to fit my entire name in there? instead i had to settle for my screenname on AOL HotDog95! and that just sounded ridiculous coming out of the characters mouth when we are doing the romantic things like kissing. It was not acceptable for this to happen.\nI would also like to add i have no idea why the manager is different in every time line and i think its stupid that they did not offer a detailed explanation why this is the case. I would like a DLC in which you get to play the Managers route in every time line to see how each personality is crafted from the different experinces the manager has and why they are different just because you are dating a different boy. i find this offensive.\n\nlong story short good game good family fun time\n\njust kidding this game is trash and i am not okay with its racist attitude.\n","February 10","true","84.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","3"

This by my own volition. A review copy of the game was kindly provided by Ideal Factory International.]\n\nDeveloped by Idea Factory under its Otome game brand Otomate, Amnesia: Memories is among one of the companies pioneering titles that finally gets a western release. And while Otoge or Otome games are meant to cater specifically toward a female audience, a male audience can also partake of them. The story puts players into the shoes of an unnamed female protagonist that has lost her memories after a strange incident. With help of mysterious young boy named Orion, the two work together to help make sense of the heroine’s past life, while trying not raise suspicion from friends and a boyfriend she never knew existed.\n\nWith Amnesia: Memories actually being my first Otome game and looking that is from the perspective of a newcomer, I do think that first timers like myself or those completely new to visual novels in general will be able to navigate it easily. For one, before you even start to meet the eligible bachelors, you will be able to choose who you want to interact with from the start by choosing a world – each holding a symbolic card corresponding to that person. You have the aloof Shin of the “Heart” world, playboy Ikki of the “Spade” world, his logical best friend Kent of “Club” world, and the big brother figure Toma of “Diamnond” world. There is a fifth guy and the route that puts all this into perspective, but needs to be unlocked by completing the others. Not only do each the routes play out differently depending on the world, but also changes how certain people will treat you. For instance, Waka, the manager at the place the herione works at is very nice in the “Heart” route, but his personality does shift greatly in others – going from docile to abrasive. This does apply to the other characters you meet as well to varying degrees, and serves as a nice change of pace to see how each route differs despite the feature being nothing new to visual novels.\n\nEven though the main love interest and their personalities play into the typical paradigm most shoujo anime seems to reach for, I did honestly enjoy exploring the backstories of the guys I did go after. My favorite character would have to be the titular Shin, learning the reason behind his distant attitude that stems from a past event with his father. The writing is very simple in many ways and not that great when it comes to giving the story some interesting twist and turns, but still okay in its own right. The individual routes are fine on their own, but overall does fall short of being particularly great. That’s all I can offer on the subject without spoiling it. By the same admission, the characters themselves also aren’t as detailed as they could be, but still found them interesting. Especially in the case of Toma. Yup, very… fascinating personality shift for that guy.\n\nGetting back to gameplay, the same orthodox process of reading text and making decisions at certain points become the norm like most visual novels, with one exception. Keeping with the theme of trying to piece together your life without letting your boyfriend be any wiser, the choices you make do have implications on 3 values: “Affection”, “Trust”, and “Suspicion”. The goal of is to ideally get a “Good” or “Normal” ending by keeping your Affection and Trust values high and Suspicion low. Again, depending on the choices, these values will fluctuate, so it is important to be mindful of what choices you make and keep tabs on your parameter menu frequently. Often or not, it is pretty easy to know how to response, yet can abuse the system by saving your game and seeing how a certain choice goes. In the event that you do have your Suspicion high, the game will continue, but will be able to get a bad ending more easily from making a wrong choice or simply getting the normal ending for that route if you happen to make it through successfully. Since replay value is a big part of games of this nature, it doesn’t hurt and obvious that making multiple saves will offer some assistance.\n\nWhen you tire of trying to get through the story or even completed the game, besides viewing the CG library for illustrations, listening to tracks, or keeping track of the endings you received, the game does have two mini-games you can play at anytime: Rock-paper-scissors and Air hockey. There not the most interesting thing in the world, but it’s there if you need it as a brief diversion. I would like to detail this section, but since I never actually won a game, I will leave the outcome of what happens (if anything) to be a surprise.\n\nOn the aesthetic side of things, the artwork and animation for the game is very impressive. In a lot ways, the color scheme and style used kind of reminds me of that found in Steins;Gate, despite not having the same exact appearance or as drab. Animations are crisp and lively, and actually show off a lot of technical muscle such as changing the characters sprite angles (seeing them from the side or back) that really makes them come alive without having to go toward excess. My favorite animation would have to be of Ikki holding his signature sunglasses and smoothly slipping them on in the same scene almost like it was in one movement. The musical score is very genteel and well-done, piano pieces being the most prominent holding up the sentimental mood – that admittedly, tends get lost at various times. By the time you get through half of the routes it will become droning, yet mildly tolerable.\n\nWith visual novels gaining more acceptance and familiarity in the West, I do believe titles like Amnesia: Memories will be great boon for its biggest supporters. It definitely isn’t the cream of crop, especially when it comes to the overall writing, but still fairly remarkable in other areas like presentation and making that presentation work for it during the course of the game. While it won’t be for a couple of months until see Idea Factory’s other Otome offerings, Amnesia is a pretty pleasant harbinger of what to expect and do think this one will keep most fans satisfied for the time being.\n","August 25, 2015","true","7.5"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","17","35","0","0"

The guys are relatively attractive. Most of the stories are detailed and interesting. However, I ended up not recommending the game due to Toma's story.\n\nToma's story is extremely awful. It involves abuse, Stockholm Syndrome, and r/a/p/e threats. No kidding. I honestly am not sure who in their right minds would think that this would be a good romantic story. It's a romance story turned into horror. All of the guys do problematic things at one point or another, but they're usually small things that can be overlooked and one can still enjoy the story. Toma's story is just wrong in so many ways that it's sickening that it was even in the game. Honestly, the best part about Toma's story was the normal ending, because the main character gets to escape him.\n\nIn one of the bad endings, Toma has the main character in chains, literally just a bunch of chains. Her memory is completely gone and she's dressed in a maid outfit. There's also the insinuation that he does whatever he wants with her, probably including r/a/p/e. Just to give you an idea of how horrifying this whole thing is.\n\nIf you get the game, please get it on sale and if you have experience with abusive relationships, I truly don't recommend going through Toma's story.\n\nOtherwise, the game was interesting and fun to go through. It's such a shame that such a good game has been tarnished by one story in it.","January 1","false","33.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","1"

Already have 19 hours on it and I have not finished the game yet.\n- Gorgeous graphics and CGs - The graphics are extreamly colourful and beautiful. There are a lot of CGs, placed at the right place and and very emotional.\n- Mini games - the games are very simple and can be beaten fast, but I highly appreciate them being there. Also rewards you for complition.\n- Emotional endings - you have 3 types of endings. Good endings are entirly satisfying; normal endings are positive yet not compleatly satisfying; bad endings go from a standart bad ending (the two characters don't end up togehter) to death (main character dies). I was never disapointed by the endings.\n\nCONs:\n- Bad stories - I still don't have a story I was not bored of. It starts interesting but gets very old in the middle of it. That is due to dragging out plots that are not made for long gameplay.\n- Too long stories - a path is 8 hours (listening to all the dialogs and no breaks), The stories are not made for such long playthoughs so they drag out. The first story (shins) drags out unnessesary long and I was left with the impression 3 times that it was suppose to end.\n- Orion - Orion is a character that from now on became a definition for this problem. The little spirit that is to serve as narator speaks too much and takes too much of the screen time. He always states the obvious and repeats what the player already figured out. Add an option to disable him, would make the best game ever.\n\nEdit: I just finished the game and all the stories. All what I said up stands plus:\nAll the male characters are psychopaths, and the protagonist can get the biggest idiot and a give up on all common sense in order to gain the good ending.\nThe joker conclution of the story is very satisfying with a sick ending.","September 21, 2015","true","28.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One problem though it is otome and by otome I mean... Yes... This is gonna be sometimes weirid. Shy confused girl and a lot of iniciative decisions thrown by others. Plot is forgiving this type of main heroine though, because she doesn't have memories. I am curious enough to reach to the end since, I did not pay much for it. 90% Discount is kinda rare for any VN. Thats why I am writing this recommendation, and maybe because of this Godly opening which forced me into this. I regret nothing.\n\nPS: It is turning out to be quite terrifying, people psychologic can be really sick at times... I am shocked by this. I have seen many things way worse, but its actually more scary just because of reality of modern society is soo high up.

Have you ever watched one with an incredibly annoying narrator who talks about 10x more than the entire narration of the game and his attempts at being fun are just incredibly irritating?\n\nAmnesia is an otome game about a girl who has lost her memories and must discover the truth behind who she is and her situation without arousing suspicion. You can choose from 4 different scenarios in which her life is different from each other. However, no matter which reality you pick, her life is pretty complicated, and you will need to get your bearings fast if you are to make the right choices. To make matters worse, in each world you are pursued by a green haired maniac hell bent on murdering you although the reasons aren't immediately apparent\n\nFortunately you have 4 hunks to help you out, though you can only pursue a relationship with one in each world. They each differ in personality and while they do have the typical Otome game borderline obsession with the comparatively bland protagonist it's very toned back in this game compared to your usual Otome game and they actually have conversations with you and other characters in which the subject of the conversation ISN'T you! For me this was a breath of fresh air since I was sick to death of the Twilight creepy obsession\n\nI recommend this game, but only barely. And the reason for that is the opening paragraph of this review. For those of you who have played Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, you will probably understand what I mean right away. Remember that fairy Navi? This game makes me wish I could have her as my companion again\n\nYou will be followed throughout the game by a shota boy with a chipmunk voice who learned to speak from watching the entire 7 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He gets 75% of the dialogue in the game, no more than 2 sentences can be spoken before he gives his long winded, annoying and completely unfunny commentary, and there's no way you can get this little pest to shut up! The only positive thing I have to say about him is that at least he isn't PewDiePie\n\nI recommend this game, and I recommend that every time you see an Orion dialogue bubble you immediately click past it. Annoying shota chipmunk schyzophrenic delusions aside this is the pinnacle of Otome games, so I recommend it!","August 27, 2015","true","11.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

So far it's really great. I really enjoy the style with the playing card motif as well as how the backgrounds look against the amazing artwork of the characters. The story is great and even better than the anime so far, so I'm pretty pleased.\n\nThe only downsides are more having to do with the actual port of the game to PC and it's translation, rather than the game itself. There's missing translations for the mini games which is disappointing, but it's still understandable enough to play them. I just cannot see why they didn't feel the need to translate their comments. It would've been great if they got the English voice actors from the anime as well but that isn't a must. The port to the PC is kinda strange with the full screen mode being very awkward when you have to tab+enter and click the x to exit out of the game. I also had some random fps issues but it seemed to clear up so not sure if that was on my end. It's better than not having a port to PC at all, but I do wish they'd do a better job next time.\n\nOverall I'm glad to finally be able to play this game and hope we get more otome games localized in the future. I recommend it to anyone who likes romance, mystery or any kind of visual novel. The characters are all really interesting and it leaves you wanting to play it over and over to unlock all the endings and routes. Right now it's on sale and it'd be stupid not to grab it now, especially when it's worth it at the full price.","August 26, 2015","true","50.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It was a very highly received title in Japan as well.\n\nBased on other otome I've played, I think this is... sort of junk food. Lots of people like it, but that doesn't make it good. Even from a graphic novel standpoint, it's not especially well put together. That said, if you like the premise and you like the fetishes the routes offer, of course you'll overlook these flaws. I'm the same way with other games.\n\nMy first issue was that you have to choose a route at the start of the game. There's no 'let's get to know the characters' thing before you choose a route, which is why I preferred when this sort of mechanic was used in Nameless.\n\nAs others said, you have a passive heroine. Normally, this would be ok, since most otome heroines are self-insert anyway, but she is notable among the genre for her debilitating lack of agency. Based on dialogue which hints at your pre-amnesiac self, it seems that you were a bit of a selfish, needy and demanding person before. The guys generally express a sort of relief with this new, placid 'you'. So, basically, the guys like you because you're pretty, regardless of how you act. There's not even the pretense of personality here and for me, that their standards are so shallow makes me like the bachelors way less. I can't even say it's misogynistic either, since your heroine also doesn't have much reason to like these characters besides their looks.\n\nYou get a good ending if you're agreeable, a bad ending if you're not. You start the routes essentially already in a relationship, so for me, that already negates one of the most engaging aspects of these sorts of games.\n\nBoth the characters and the storyline are borderline satire. The smart guy's shtick is that he's like a computer; the 'big bro' shtick is that he's crazy obsessed with you, but seems normal; the crazy guy is laughing maniacally one second and remorseful and moe the next; the story keeps making excuses as to why you can't just do the reasonable thing for the sake of pursuing romantic interests. One step more and this game would have gone into Hatoful Boyfriend territory with the ludicrous nature of it all.\n\nIn total, the game caters to the fetish of 'helplessness', which has seen growing popularity in both Japan and North America. Basically, you have determined love interests (no need to search), in pre-selected routes (no risk of not getting guy), where you have no memory (not accountable for past errors or responsibilities) which is caused by a supernatural force (no concerns over actual medical problems), who takes responsibility over not just your memory, but your relationship status (no need for hard decisions) and your boyfriend(s) routinely put in you in a position where 'they will take care of everything' and restrict your agency. There's segments in all the routes which basically have your heroine wait in her room for days at a time, with occasional visits from one of the bachelors.\n\nFor me, there are other English otome that did most of the elements presented in Amnesia much better. It's a shallow game that caters to the right niches. I don't condemn it for that - I just wish it had catered to mine!","February 14","false","11.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","3"

I didn't know much about the game before hand since I only decided to play this when I saw a friend tweet about it. Good thing I bought it on a discount.\n\nOverall it's a nice game to waste your time with. The character art is so pretty.The routes that I liked at most part was Ikki's and Kent's but barely (one reason why I liked the other is because there's an option to break their kokoro hahahaha). The plot is interesting at the start, but for some reason I end up fast speeding throughout the game. I think Kent's adorable, but he's a jerk. Well, most of the guys are really.\n\nThe plot would have been great if it was executed properly and it maybe it showed us more about the MC's inner struggle instead focusing on her rude male leads. Like maybe add drama to how she felt personally. I'd like to see her looking through old pictures of friends/family and feeling sad. Or how would she react if she realized that her family isn't in good terms? Or wondering if the her before was better than the her now.\n\nI didn't like that most of the guys were passive-aggressive or sexually aggressive to the MC. I can't believe she can't even call the police even though that is the most reasonable choice. Or go to her family. Find her relative's address. Get ideas from her classmates/workplace instead of trailing along strange guys who you happen to be "in love" with in your pre-amnesia days.\n\nMost of the guy's weren't nice at all, especially Toma. If you guys are suffering from a past abuse it'll probably trigger  some bad memories. Love can't alone can't cure someone. In the end, you have to cure yourself. And right now, I think I'm just probably forcing myself to finish the game for the sake of the trophy's.\n\nThe game itself feels like it's forcing you to be a submissive, "innocent" and guy-pleasing girl. Most of the time I had to wince while the guys manhandle the poor heroine. I wish there was an option which allowed the heroine to break up with them and find her own way of solving her amnesia without relying to some strange guy who says he "loves the heroine" meh.  I never felt so happy when the heroine broke up with Ikki it was really satisfying especially throughout the whole time I forced the heroine to handle those scary fangirls.\n\nLastly, I wish the female lead had more voice. She's so passive. So quiet. Why can't she talk back? Why can't she disobey the guy? And why is she blushing when obviously what the guy is doing to you is disturbing, degrading and embarrassing? Why does she have to listen to Orion when some of his advises aren't reasonable at all?\n\nI don't hate the game. I just really am frustrated about it. The story would have been good if they added some emotional moments centering on the heroine instead of her current love problems.

She hardly ever speaks. Everyone talks over her and makes decisions on her behalf without consulting her or explaing the situation and we are supposed to find that endearingly protective instead of HOLY CREEP ALERT, BATMAN. That'd be bad enough already, but those decisions also happen to be life-or-death and incredibly over the top more often than not so it's doubly creepy to be subjected to that and not even get the option to feel mad about it.\nI've only gone through two routes, but with how things are looking I have no motivation to keep reading. I'm seriously worried it might get worse (or even stay roughly the same, which wouldn't be comforting at all).\n\nThe routes I did were basically\nA. "Almost get yourself killed in the name of MANPAIN with a dash of victim blaming"\nB. "Forced isolation, gaslighting and attempted ♥♥♥♥: Stockholm edition"\n...and those were the "good" endings.\n\nThe main mechanic is supposed to be a balance of trust and suspicion, which would make for a really intriguing horror/suspense story. As things are, the mechanic doesn't even count for much, and the romantization of creepy and awful behavior makes it clear that wasn't what the game was going for.\nThe only positive might be the art, but it's hard to appreciate your abuser's pretty hair with all those red flags popping up around you.","September 1, 2015","false","7.5"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","21","45","0","0"

There is a strange creepy vibe and after playing about 2 hours it gets really weird.\n\nArtwork is pretty good- the lanugauage is all Japanese with subtitles. I enjoy watching some anime and this game makes it feel I am watching a show but I can pick some options while playing the main protaganist.\n\nI don't really like the one dimensonal view of the game. It's the equivalent of watching someone play Pong, but with cutesy anime characters. At some points I think playing Atari would be more interesting instead of listening to the characters drivel on and on and on as I keep hitting the action button.\n\nYou'll need patience and a genuine interest in the story line to play this game. If you are the type that enjoys anime AND the Twilight Saga (aka: Tween/young adult)....then by all means check it out.\n\nI'm glad to have helped out the developers with the purchase of an indie game and hope in the future this game will be more interactive.\n\nWould I pay full price?

In a fire for example, though I am not too picky, anything should do the job.\n\nAs the games premise is you, the protagonist, losing all of her memories, it'd reasonable to expect that you would mainly portray apathy towards all of the people you used to know as they're nothing but strangers to you now. In theory the same would go for Orion, who is some kind of Spirit whose objective is to sever hiw tie to you so he can go his way. Specifying any further would be explicit spoilers, though the information is relayed within the first 10 or so minutes of the game.\n\nHowever Orion acts as the protagonsit providing both your reactions and your motivation in all situations, with your choices, the only means of interaction you have, usually just change 1 to 3 lines of dialouge. Effectively whatever Orion says is what you say, even though he is supposed to be nonexistent fo ranyone but you, also he gets into it way too much...\nOrion winds up being nothing but a bunch of plot convenience, e.g. with no explicit spoilers "Oh this route's guy is in some kind of problematic situation with local authoreties, we know he is innocent, but I'm worried nonetheless, and that means you have to be as well even though the story gave you no reason to."\n\nA story that utilizes amnesia as a story relevant tool has one simple advantage, you can forge all bonds and ties to other characters simulatniously to explaining them to the player, meaning, if used correctly you can combine exposition with story telling. It isn't used correctly though, while the protagonist was portrayed as worried I did nothing but shrug in apathy as the whole "conflict" was not an actual issue and easily debunked/resolved.\n\nThe story forces a linear approach on the player, even though the concept doesn't fit that kind of story-telling, causing a huge discrepancy between player and protagonist, having Orion being the actual protagonsit, rather than the player, he makes the calls, influences the interactions between characters and is nothing but a hypocrite in the process and that's putting it lightly...\n\nBy extension that also is quite telling in regards to the writer, here's some examples of the hypocracy and how it's bad writing:\n1st. Orion thinks that Amnesia is treated by confining the patient to a hospital room or their home, took me about 5 minutes of using google to debunk that, he does however know what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ maid cafe is.\n\n2nd. He bases his opinion of humans on the subjective opinion of one of his acquantances and considers them greedy/egoistic, at the same time he thinks you would consider anything they say to be the truth and obey their every whim, making you little else but a toddler\n\n\nThis creates a fun little problem, you are treated as if, by losing all of your memories, you can not understand concepts such as lies, meaning that you wouldn't have common sense either, leading to apathy, otherwise you'd retain things such a common sense thus being able to do simple things such as saying "No" or debunking someones ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t claims.\n\nHere is a direct quote from Orion to put some of the issues into perspective:\n"Hee-hee. I'm pretty knowledgeable about human life, aren't I?"\nThe writer acknowledges the issue, but doesn't bother to fix it... We are talking about a commercial product here, if you know there is an issue fix it, you don't get a free pass by mentioning it and not giving another ♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow here is another fun quote:\n"[...] try to actively meet people and investigate what kind of person you used to be."\nThis represents his initial motivation, as for plot related reasons he wants you to recover your lost memories, shortly afterwards however he ignores this objective in order to waste time on investigating an accident in order to make sure it was an accident.\nYou as the player get to point  out, that the clues at hand are insufficient to really bother wasting time on this investgation, but not a single ♥♥♥♥ is given by Orion and by extension the writer...\n\nI might not be the actual target group, being male and all, but I sure as hell can tell when a story is written in a bad fashion and the fact that some of the issues are acknowledged within the game is quite telling.\nAll I can say is: Don't bother if you are expecting quality, if you can just roll with all kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and don't expect good writing, aka looking for a good laugh, this might be worth 20 bucks or less.\n\np.s. if you are wondering why I didn't use the formatting given by steam in certain places, that is because it didn't work properly","August 27, 2015","false","7.4"," 9 of 59 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","9","59","0","7"

I've played games like the Persona series and Harvest Moon series where there are these type of dating sims, but usually those games focused more on other types of gameplay (RPG and farming sim), but this is my first time picking a otome dating sim game where the main point of the game is to go through a span of 30 days with a chosen character where each answer and choice determines if you will be able to truly unlock the memories you've lost through Amnesia.\n\nI thought that after 1 or 2 routes, I would get bored, but I was wrong. I think the strong element that Amnesia: Memories has is its ability to make you continuously want to know what's going to happen next, if you picked the right choices and what the ending you will get. The plot for each 'world' you choose in order to retrieve your memories is determined by the character you interact with. Every route has its differences and you will see how your chosen character develops through the span of 30 days you are given to unlock your memories. I found myself doing my best to get to the bottom of each conflict in each route and when I successfully got through it and achieved the good ending of a route, I felt rewarded for my efforts. and when I got a bad ending, I'd be screeching at my computer wondering what the heck I did wrong. I never thought I'd be invested so deeply in a game where all I literally do is click buttons.\n\nAmnesia: memories caught my interest primarily because of its art. The CG images that are unlockable with each route and sprites are all so beautifully drawn. I also watched the anime that was revolved around this before I realized the game was coming out a week after I watched it. Watching the anime made me more curious about how the game would be and because of having that background, I was able to see how much more the game developed the characters and plot, something the anime could not (due to the amount of episodes).\n\nThe reason I am giving this game a 9/10 and not a full solid 10/10 is because I think that after I have completed and unlocked everything, the game has close to no replay value. I think that if there was additional content or gameplay, there would be a higher chance of this game keeping my interest in the long run if I ever wanted to pick it up and play it again. Unfortunately, after I complete everything, there's not much for me to go back to.  Since this is my first otome game, I'm not sure if that's how otome games are or if there's differences in each one in terms of mini-games and gameplay.\n\nNevertheless, I have been enjoying this game a lot. I am really happy that Amnesia: Memories was my first otome game. It left a lasting impression and I am eager to look into more otome games. I hope Idea Factory decides to localize the other games in the Amnesia series. I know I'd definitely be picking them up.\n\nGameplay: B+\nArt: A+\nMusic: A\nStoryline: A\nVoice Acting: A+\nReplay Value: C","September 1, 2015","true","48.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basic premise is that you as the main character are suffering amnesia, as well as basically a spiritual possession, and are attempting to regain your memories  and free the spirit from your mind.\n\nThere are 5 total romanceable characters, all male.  The first 4 are available as soon as you start the game, the fifth one unlocks after finishing the good endings for the first 4 characters.  All of them have 1 good ending, 1 normal ending and between 1 and 7 bad endings.  They are all very well defined characters, with elaborate stories and very very different personalities.  You have a tsundere, a popular/playboy who yearns for real love, an intellectual who's aloof and bad with emotions and socializing, and 2 yandere characters that are on opposite ends of the yandere spectrum.  Each one of their stories take place on alternate dimensions, so even though the basic story premise is the same for each, the stories themselves are completely different and the side characters will sometimes have vastly different personalities in each route. As a fair warning, if you are someone who needs trigger warnings, you may have problems with one of the routes.\n\nGetting the different endings requires making different selections during the story branches.  Each selection will either raise, lower, or leave your attributes in their current level of accumulation.  There is no stat raising or grinding, it's just a matter of selecting conversation options to raise or lower your trust, relationship and suspicion with each character.  There are quite a lot of branches, and it felt like there should have been more save slots available because of how many choices you have available.\n\nThe art is absolutely beautiful, the music and voice acting is great and fits in very well, the stories and characters are well written, and the translation is very accurate - though there are a very few spelling and grammar errors, it doesn't stick out horribly or detract from the experience.  After beating all the stories and endings there are also mini games, additional memories and short stories that follow up with the characters, leaving a huge amount of content in this game, it's really surprising how much content the game offers.\n\nPros:\n+5 very different romanceable characters\n+so many endings\n+mini games\n+unlockable bonus content\n+art\n+music\n+story\n+a 12 episode anime series you can watch elsewhere if the game isn't enough for you\n\nSlightly Irritating:\n~a few spelling/grammatical errors\n~no obvious exit option in game\n~while you can customize controls, it doesn't tell you what the buttons do\n~for some people the achievements aren't working (IF is currently working on fixing it)\n~a character who goes too far\n~could use more save slots\n\nCons:\n-I can't really think of anything outright negative about this game.  :)\n\nIf you like anime and/or visual novels I really recommend you pick up this game, it is definitely worth the money, even at full price!","September 7, 2015","true","38.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You follow the main character on her quest to retrieve her memories. In order to do that, she visits 4 different worlds (1 you unlock later) each with different distinct story line. However, in each world you have a different man as the main characters boyfriend. As you play you have to make different choices that in the end, affect the outcome of your story. It is truely a beautifully written game.\n\nYou grow to love all the different guys and you get addicted to their story line. "Just 5 more minutes!" you keep saying to yourself but you find yourself unable to pull yourself away. Each guy is different and unique in their own way. My personal favorite has to be Kent, though Shin is right behind him. Both have an amazing story line. Ikki's story line is fun but you (as well as the main character) feel the frustration. I was very worried about Toma's story line and I would have to say it probably my least favorite. As for Ukyo's, I actually enjoyed his story line and it had one hell of an ending. Overall, I loved the unique story lines and it really pulled me in.

In the anime, the main character seems dull and boring, since she doesn't really have memory to have a personality.

It was a very rewarding experience, and I do recommend it to anyone who's into that sort of thing. I read a lot of warnings about this game (which are important to take note of!) before buying, and was almost scared away. I'm glad I ended up buying it, though.\n\nFirst off: Not all of the characters are nice. I initially thought every character would be trying to sweep me off my feet, but it's not like that at all. You pick a single route to pursue and navigate your relationship with the chosen male character (and your other friends) in each playthrough.\n\nSecondly: There are multiple endings. For some reason, I had been lead to believe there were only the four routes and each had a single conclusion (which is ridiculous in retrospect).  A "bad" character may have multiple sides just as a "good" character does. Keep an open mind.\n\nAnd finally, some have said this game is too hard. I disagree! Which I think I can do since this is my first time completing an otome game. I just had some fun exploring the options, saving often, and checking each character's reactions to my behaviour. Save often and if you absolutely MUST get the good ending, don't be afraid to consult a guide for some help.\n\nOne thing I disliked about this game was  the diamond route. Toma's route really creeped me out. I don't want to spoil much, even under a spoiler tag, but he's horribly abusive to the protagonist. However, all his actions are forgiven when she remembers she loved him prior to losing her memories, so they can be together now! Gross. Game would be better without that route.\n\nOverall, I would definitely say this game is worth the full price, although I bought it when it was on sale. If you like otome games, please buy this to support their english localization in the future!","August 31, 2015","true","54.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Estimate about 30+ hours of gametime if you are a moderately fast reader. Even without all achievements up and running, there is plenty of reason to play through all of the game's many endings. Some style and story choices are hit or miss based on the player: such as Orion either being your best buddie or even worse than Navi. For those who cannot stand horror, this otome may not be for you. While there is little to no mention of gore, if you die you will know. Multiple stories have some involvement of people trying to kill you for one reason or another, so be prepared.

I've played games like the Persona series and Harvest Moon series where there are these type of dating sims, but usually those games focused more on other types of gameplay (RPG and farming sim), but this is my first time picking a otome dating sim game where the main point of the game is to go through a span of 30 days with a chosen character where each answer and choice determines if you will be able to truly unlock the memories you've lost through Amnesia.\n\nI thought that after 1 or 2 routes, I would get bored, but I was wrong. I think the strong element that Amnesia: Memories has is its ability to make you continuously want to know what's going to happen next, if you picked the right choices and what the ending you will get. The plot for each 'world' you choose in order to retrieve your memories is determined by the character you interact with. Every route has its differences and you will see how your chosen character develops through the span of 30 days you are given to unlock your memories. I found myself doing my best to get to the bottom of each conflict in each route and when I successfully got through it and achieved the good ending of a route, I felt rewarded for my efforts. and when I got a bad ending, I'd be screeching at my computer wondering what the heck I did wrong. I never thought I'd be invested so deeply in a game where all I literally do is click buttons.\n\nAmnesia: memories caught my interest primarily because of its art. The CG images that are unlockable with each route and sprites are all so beautifully drawn. I also watched the anime that was revolved around this before I realized the game was coming out a week after I watched it. Watching the anime made me more curious about how the game would be and because of having that background, I was able to see how much more the game developed the characters and plot, something the anime could not (due to the amount of episodes).\n\nThe reason I am giving this game a 9/10 and not a full solid 10/10 is because I think that after I have completed and unlocked everything, the game has close to no replay value. I think that if there was additional content or gameplay, there would be a higher chance of this game keeping my interest in the long run if I ever wanted to pick it up and play it again. Unfortunately, after I complete everything, there's not much for me to go back to.  Since this is my first otome game, I'm not sure if that's how otome games are or if there's differences in each one in terms of mini-games and gameplay.\n\nNevertheless, I have been enjoying this game a lot. I am really happy that Amnesia: Memories was my first otome game. It left a lasting impression and I am eager to look into more otome games. I hope Idea Factory decides to localize the other games in the Amnesia series. I know I'd definitely be picking them up.\n\nGameplay: B+\nArt: A+\nMusic: A\nStoryline: A\nVoice Acting: A+\nReplay Value: C","September 1, 2015","true","48.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I googled the game and took an instant liking to Kent :D LoL, HotS, WoW, GW2 are my bread and butter so Amnesia was something new to me. Regardless, I got really hyped and bought the game. I went for Kent right away and I had so much fun dating him. I went to bed way past 2am, still hyped and determined to play it again. I really like how the game's made. It's got amazing voice acting and great visual style. I love the way the characters were drawn. The funny bits really cracked me up and I found myself grinning at the monitor, thinking 'awwww, ain't that cute?'. Today I chose Toma's storyline and it's quite interesting too. I actually like Amnesia so much that I googled a walkthrough for every character and I'm planning to try all possible endings :) P.S. While googling Amnesia-related stuff I found out that it's based on an anime dating back to 2013! I watched all 12 episodes (+OVA) today and it was so good. I can honestly recommend both the game and the anime :)","December 12, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So things get crazy pretty quick. You have many hours that you can put into the game, depending on how fast you read, it may vary. The characters are all unique in their own way, some more unexpected than others. The Art is very beautiful, followed along with very well chosen voice actors. The stories all can get you very involved and wanting more. Only bleh is some achievements suck and Orion constantly yappin'.\n\nRecommend: To those who like Visual Novels, unique characters, romance, engaging stories, and pretty art.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nGame: There are lots of hours that can be put into this game which is good when seeing the price on this game. You get also a lot of unlockable additional content which makes it more worthwhile.  Such as memories and short stories in the boys' perspectives. Oh and mini-games which are pretty fun if you aren't in the mood for reading. Good amount of save slots, but in the end, I was wishing for more for Ukyo ~ n ~  Also is great that you can choose how it is read. You can turn on and off the V.A.'s, put it on Auto, Speed through text, show text and previous text all together, etc... Made it definitely a good experience. AND to make things better, if you're trying to get a different ending and playing through again, if you speed through, it will stop and play if there is text that you have previously not read in your other playthroughs! And it will highlight which answers you've already inputed. No trying to remember now :3\n\n\nAchievements: Some of these achievemnts are literally so annoying I just gave up -.- One is where you have to click the image multiple times just for the guy to say a couple things. Looked up where to click and it still does absolutely nothing.  Everyone, but Kent's, I have had difficulty getting one part of their picture to work, It is seriously the dumbest thing ever. >_> The others are easy to obtain.\n\nAnime VS. Otome: I found out about the anime first then the otome. I'm happy I came across the otome because now I realize how BAD the anime is. The anime doesn't cover really anything, Like the first 5-10 mins of the boys' story in the otome, so it was nice to really get to delve into these boys stories way more than the anime ever did.  Only thing is I kind of liked in the anime that Orion wasn't there 24/7. The otome he just literally drove me bonkers @ n @\n\nArt: The art is very beautiful and definitely draws you in.  Their character design is actually very well thought out and you see a bunch of tiny things that really bring everything together, Also with their personalities, it ties in with the design. They have different poses which are good as well. The only weird thing for me is how large some of their hands were... But the style and coloring is very pretty. The gallery has lots of pretty images that are saved from your specific route and you can even move around the picture and check out different areas of it. There was a lot of variety and ones you unlock just from completing certain acheivements. Though that stupid ctrl-left click thing for their "hidden" message things were annoying. I'd click and it would end up going to the next image instead. I had an immensley hard time trying to get parts of an image to register. No matter how many times I clicked Toma's fist in the 2nd variation nothing happened, Shin and Heroine picture variation 2, her face would not react at all, Ikki and the heroine at the theatre, the hand wouldn't register. I've looked this stuff up to see if I'm just clicking slightly off, but I am clicking where I need it. So that part gets a 0 in my book because it was just frustrating.\n\nMusic: The music wasn't distracting and pretty good for the most part.\n\nCharacters: The characters all had variety and interesting endings, though some just seemed completely random at times. I wish there could have been more choices to choose from and Orion would STOP making decisions for me -.- I'm looking at Toma's route heavily when Orion becomes really annoying. Speaking of Toma, I wish we could have learned more about why and when he started to have yandere tendencies. Just seeing his past with the heroine, it just seems odd that such a sweetie would now go nut-so if you ask me  I liked the guy characters because they all had their set personality making it fresh when you go to a different route. And many of the stories were very interesting to go into. I don't want to go into too much detail so this will be spoiler free.\n\nShin-> He is such a tsun tsun but  a sweetie ^ u ^ Oh and suprisingly the smartest guy out of the bunch in the end. I guess seemed a bit more realistic to me than the other boys.\n\nToma-> I personally really liked his character, he's definietly not for everyone. I just liked he was really out there compared to the other characters.  Though I think the Heroine shouldn't have been all okay after what he did to her @ m @\n\nKent-> He starts off a total meanie-poo but like Shin he really isn't that bad. He goes off onto a lot of tangents of things like math and what not. But he was an amusing character.\n\nIkki-> The "playboy" or "pretty boy" character but reading his story, there is so much more to him than on the surface.\n\nUkyo-> Prepare for the feels! His story is so bittersweet. You can't help but like this guy T w T\n\nBased on the characters themselves and how much I liked them:\nToma>Ukyo>Shin>Kent>Ikki\n\n\nBased on stories I found the most interesting are in the order:  Ukyo>Shin>Toma>Ikki>Kent. Ikki and Kent's story didn't interest me as much, I guess they just felt, I guess more like slice-of-life, while the others seemed to be a bit crazier with their stories, drawing me in more. (However, this is just a personal preference)\n\nStory itself: I found it a quite interesting premise, though I wish you could voice up more, Orion ends up taking the brunt of everything, which kind of ruins the effect for me. But   unraveling the mystery in some character's stories for why you have Amnesia were actually quite interesting, some were very dumb though...)\n\nVoices: The characters' voice acting is very good @ w @ I really enjoyed them. I especially liked Shins. Haha. But I think they all fit the characters very well.\n\n~Overall. I really enjoyed the story and the characters in  it.  It was an enjoyable experience overall and would recommened to anyone who likes visual novels and an interesting set of characters.","December 13, 2015","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was so disappointed when I heard the Visual Novel was only\nin Japan and on hand-held games however once I heard it was coming to Steam it\nwas so exciting.\n\nThe game has many merits, It's not a short visual novel like most, you're going to get\nquite a few hours out of it and you're pretty much expected to play it over and over again.\n\nThere's minigames and such which are really fun, I personally find Air Hockey THE BEST.\nThe AI in the minigame's aren't too shabby either, they're atually quite good.\n\nOrion, a character, is EXTREMELY annoying. Or at least I personally find that Orion constantly\ncommenting on each and every action and scene can be quite misleading and agitating.\n\nThe Art Style is beautiful and really well done, so are the animations. With this game, comes\nan extreme amount of wonderfully stylistic and unique sets of scenery and characters.\n\nMost characters are pretty unique, some are a little meh but that's only because they have generic\npersonalities that all animes/mangas/visual novels contain to some extent.\n\nMusic helps the scenes and can sometimes be a little freaky, you'll find out why..\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game. I love playing it because it's the best when you want to just relax.","December 8, 2015","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a character who has no memories and the only thing you can remember is a bug-like thing who's just told you the tragic reality that, hey ! He's hogging up all the space that, was originally, intended for your memories ! On top of that, how can you say no to five attractive boys that you get to yourself ? Come on !\n\nOn a serious note though, this game is filled with twisted people, stories, and lots of love but can also be super knife wrenching hurtful to the point of making you scream your throat out as to why it had to happen like that. Ever since I saw the anime series released, I've been waiting for the day to play this game and I totally don't regret spending a lot of time crying and screaming for each of the attractive boys. Whether you be a guy or girl, I still suggest playing this game. Each character are developed in their own unique ways making you want to figure out why ? Why had you fallen in love with him ? And what else beside his attractive looks can be so gosh darn evil ? Filled with drama, feelings, tears, regrets, and loyalty, Amnesia is a roller coaster on it's own. Not only is the art and music for the game breathe taking as it is, each individual boys you take on will be a the best memories to uncover.

Amnesia: Memories features 4 suitors and a special unlockable suitor. The story is incredibly interesting in most of the routes. There’s a character for any kind of fan. I found myself attracted to my yandere boys since that’s my favorite type of character, but there was also the playboy, kuudere, and tsundere guys. Most of the male characters are very nice and I couldn’t help but root for them. The voice acting is fantastic as well. The only thing that I would have liked more was if the heroine had more interaction. She just felt too blank slate-y for me. I like it when the MC’s have a lot of personality and actual dialogue lines! She had 15 lines tops in each route. I’m not complaining fully since I know she had amnesia and whatnot, but she was a bit dull for my liking. My favorite route was Ukyo’s—I honestly found it very emotional and it reminded me a lot of a shoujo/otome version of Mirai Nikki. Which I’m not complaining about, since that’s my favorite manga & anime series ever.   I’m so glad that Amnesia: Memories was localized as it was the otome game I’ve wanted to play the most and hope this means more chances for other games to be localized *cough*Diabolik Lovers*cough*. If you’ve enjoyed games like Sweet Fuse and stories like Mirai Nikki, you should give Amnesia: Memories a chance. It’s a very entertaining game and has a ridiculous amount of content. It’s well worth the price!","September 22, 2015","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just love how each story is so different and seeing how little things about the characters change in each route.  I also love how, aside from a very short introduction, there is no common route to skip through before getting to the actual character routes.  Each character has his own unique route, so when I restart, I am really restarting from the beginning.  It takes away the disjointedness that some other VNs suffer from where the game only feels complete the first time you played through it.  Another really cool feature is that when you clear a route, you can click certain spots on certain images in the gallery for that character to hear new voiced tidbits (and yes, they are subtitled).  It makes me feel like there is a little more to discover about some of the game's sweetest scenes.  If you are a fan of otome or just want to play a really great visual novel with a hint of suspense and mystery, buy this game!","September 25, 2015","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a very rewarding experience, and I do recommend it to anyone who's into that sort of thing. I read a lot of warnings about this game (which are important to take note of!) before buying, and was almost scared away. I'm glad I ended up buying it, though.\n\nFirst off: Not all of the characters are nice. I initially thought every character would be trying to sweep me off my feet, but it's not like that at all. You pick a single route to pursue and navigate your relationship with the chosen male character (and your other friends) in each playthrough.\n\nSecondly: There are multiple endings. For some reason, I had been lead to believe there were only the four routes and each had a single conclusion (which is ridiculous in retrospect).  A "bad" character may have multiple sides just as a "good" character does. Keep an open mind.\n\nAnd finally, some have said this game is too hard. I disagree! Which I think I can do since this is my first time completing an otome game. I just had some fun exploring the options, saving often, and checking each character's reactions to my behaviour. Save often and if you absolutely MUST get the good ending, don't be afraid to consult a guide for some help.\n\nOne thing I disliked about this game was  the diamond route. Toma's route really creeped me out. I don't want to spoil much, even under a spoiler tag, but he's horribly abusive to the protagonist. However, all his actions are forgiven when she remembers she loved him prior to losing her memories, so they can be together now! Gross. Game would be better without that route.\n\nOverall, I would definitely say this game is worth the full price, although I bought it when it was on sale. If you like otome games, please buy this to support their english localization in the future!","August 31, 2015","true","54.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fadedeidolon/recommended/359390/","fadedeidolon","Lucy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fadedeidolon/","487 products in account","Amnesia is a surprisingly good otome game and visual novel.  I went into the game figuring the game would be standard otome fare, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's actually very well written, supplemented with good art and sound.  Each of the routes had their own particular charms, which surprised me, and my own expectations of which routes I'd prefer turned out to be totally wrong due to the strength of the story and the characterizations.\n\nLocalization for the game is very good.  For me, poor localization, typos, and awkward phrasing completely breaks immersion for me in visual novels.  In Amnesia, I can't even remember any awkward phrases, and I found only two typos during my entire playthrough.\n\nThe game does suffer from situations where the protagonist's actions (or lack thereof) defy common sense, though the use of Orion, her onboarded spirit, actually does help.  Orion tends to embody a lot of the inner dialogue (and outrage) of the gamer, embodying sentiments such as "how dare he say that!" that the protagonist unfortunately doesn't really ever act upon.  Amnesia also suffers from the common visual novel ailment where as the player it can be virtually impossible to know how to avoid bad ends.  There were thankfully less of these than in some other games I've played, but I did find it often frustrating how a single choice led to a bad end that the game gave me no reasonable clues to predict.  Similarly, I found the good ends frustrating to get because they didn't really follow obvious choice paths.\n\nOverall though, Amnesia is definitely worth the asking price.  It has many hours of gameplay and for any otome fans out there, it's one of the highest quality otome games I've played here in the West.  When playing, I couldn't put it down and basically marathoned the game for a week, and was left wanting more.

There are a total of 5  arcs that took me 4-5 hours to 100% complete. There are a total of 5 routes 1 which is unlockable after completing the first 4 routes. The routes each have their own individual story lines according to who your love interest will be. The majority of the routes have 1 good ending, 1 normal and 2 bad endings some easier to obtain than others.\n\nMy favorite routes listed in order would be Kent , Toma , Unlockable route , Shin and Ikki\n\nThrough out the game Heroin doesn't do much talking as orion the spirit who got stuck to you helps you regain your memories in each world in order for him to separate from you as explained in the introduction of each route.  He helps you as much as he is able which is mostly helping you in the very few ways he can since he isn't seen by other humans and can't touch any human objects.

I must say... The game is really good... But... I don't think it's worth it's original price...\n\nI got Amnesia on sale, so it was pretty good for its price. I mean, most of us American fans know there is an anime for this game, and I have to say, the anime is such a big spoiler alert. It's not our fault when the English version of the game wasn't even out until after the anime. The anime ruins the imersion and the feeling when you know this and that. I mean like at first sight, Toma and Ikki looked great, but then you know that happened... and it makes you not want to click their route at all...\nI so far finished Kent's route and started on Toma's and Ikki's.. Halfway through Ikki's route and I clicked the wrong option I think at the very beginning for Toma, so I was like, "Nope."\n\nOkay, moving to why I actually recommend the game. The art style is very anime-like and felt very professional. The fact that almost all characters (except for heroine) had a voice actor was probably the reason why it's at a high price. Also, I believe all routes are given four endings, unlike the usual two or three endings. Don't be ashamed to use a walkthrough in this game because you will probably need it. It's not like a sim date game where it'll tell you what percentage your affection level is. As you can see in one of the screenshots, you have three meters in your parameters and it's different for each route. So, yes, the game is a bit of a challenge to complete, but that means there's lots to read. Each character has their own uniqueness and charm to them, but that could only mean that they have a barrier for you to discover and pass through, Most of the game isn't just you going on dates like some games. The game focuses on your daily life with your 'boyfriend' from a diemension you choose so it's a little slow at first, because you might grow frustrated since after finishing a route, you have to go through meeting everyone again to go through a different route. At least, it's a bit of frustration party for me.\n\nAh I'm getting off-topic again. To help make your decision, I also had trouble seeing if I wanted to buy this as I'm on a budget. But like I said, I got this off a sale. To be honest, I'm really in between with not recommending and recommending. It is a really good VN to add to your collection, but it has negative cons so it isn't worth an instant purchase.","January 1","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's been a while where I've come across an otome game with really good voice acting.\n- Very memorable, even after completing the game 100%\n\nCons:\n- I get this weird flash glitch thing of text that pops up sometimes, but I remember reading they were working on it, or have already worked on it.\n- Amnesia Later & World is not on Steam. I want to continue the story asap!\n\nI absoloutely love this game. I've played quite a few Otome games (mostly hand held/mobile) so Amnesia Memories is my first PC otome I've actually played. And I don't regret it one bit. The story is really really rich, the art is great, and the guys are super cute with their own different personalities. I won't add spoilers, but there are times where this game can get pretty creepy. I chose randomly instead of going in order, and the first guy I picked (Toma) made me question if I was honestly playing an otome or a horror game. Seriously, it creeped me out that much.\n\nAmnesia Memories is one of the few games where I actually worked at a 100% completion, and I would do it all over again.\n\nHere's to hoping that Amnesia Later and Amnesia World will come to Steam as well with an English sub! I can't get enough of it! Not even the Vita version of Later and World are in English yet, so fingers crossed!\n\nThis is my first review ever that I've written on Steam, and I really felt compelled to write this after playing the game.\n\nI think a few people will know about this game through the Anime. And as good as the anime was (sort of, not really) the anime does NOT bring this game justice. I mean come on, Ukyo's story got robbed in the anime. Believe me, if you came here from the anime, you gotta play the game. It'll make you question why the anime was so incredibly poorly done.\n\nIf you're looking to get into the otome world, I would absoloutely suggest getting Amnesia Memories, you will fall in love with it.

Especially in the majority of the routes.\n\nGeneral Overview: You play as an amnesiac heroine thrown into a world with established relationships. It's up to you, with the help of a spirit called Orion to navigate and try not to get yourself thrown into the explosions of Bad Ends.\n\nIf you're expecting full-on fluff and all, this VN won't be for you. There're some fluffy moments, mixed with slight comedy but otherwise you're on the mystery/thriller/emotional rollercoaster train. This VN explores some dark elements in terms of human nature, as well as the struggles between doing what feels right and what doesn't, whether to follow your heart or your mind.\n\nAll the routes differ from one another, but overall there's actually a hidden connection between all of them which makes it all the more fascinating.\n\nSo far I'm thoroughly enjoying it. The writing is interesting, though it can be a little slow-paced in a route or two but otherwise it's very well-written. Especially the Joker route. Thanks, Otomate, I totally needed multiple trips to the feels train...\n\nGood endings completed...now the normal and bad ones...\n\nMost memorable line as of far:\n\n"I don't think you can call it deception when the people you're dealing with are stupid." - Shin","December 31, 2015","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like being given the choice of which guy you want to go with, I've clocked too many hours on many VNs trying to complete all routes with the multiple choice mechanic and remembering the right answers can be a brain killer. This VN isn't for those who can't get over the fact it's just a game that has complicated/hard to deal with stories. I for one am already enjoying it regardless VNs with anything hard to deal with is far better than a straightforward lovey-dovey in your face over romantised storyline anyday.","May 9","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You follow the main character on her quest to retrieve her memories. In order to do that, she visits 4 different worlds (1 you unlock later) each with different distinct story line. However, in each world you have a different man as the main characters boyfriend. As you play you have to make different choices that in the end, affect the outcome of your story. It is truely a beautifully written game.\n\nYou grow to love all the different guys and you get addicted to their story line. "Just 5 more minutes!" you keep saying to yourself but you find yourself unable to pull yourself away. Each guy is different and unique in their own way. My personal favorite has to be Kent, though Shin is right behind him. Both have an amazing story line. Ikki's story line is fun but you (as well as the main character) feel the frustration. I was very worried about Toma's story line and I would have to say it probably my least favorite. As for Ukyo's, I actually enjoyed his story line and it had one hell of an ending. Overall, I loved the unique story lines and it really pulled me in. I have only gotten the good endings and I look forward to getting the other ones as well.\n\nThey also made an anime which is very beautiful and I would recommend watching after you play through the story lines if you really love the game and wanna see it animated!\n\n9/10","September 12, 2015","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must say... The game is really good... But... I don't think it's worth it's original price...\n\nI got Amnesia on sale, so it was pretty good for its price. I mean, most of us American fans know there is an anime for this game, and I have to say, the anime is such a big spoiler alert. It's not our fault when the English version of the game wasn't even out until after the anime. The anime ruins the imersion and the feeling when you know this and that. I mean like at first sight, Toma and Ikki looked great, but then you know that happened... and it makes you not want to click their route at all...\nI so far finished Kent's route and started on Toma's and Ikki's.. Halfway through Ikki's route and I clicked the wrong option I think at the very beginning for Toma, so I was like, "Nope."\n\nOkay, moving to why I actually recommend the game. The art style is very anime-like and felt very professional. The fact that almost all characters (except for heroine) had a voice actor was probably the reason why it's at a high price. Also, I believe all routes are given four endings, unlike the usual two or three endings. Don't be ashamed to use a walkthrough in this game because you will probably need it. It's not like a sim date game where it'll tell you what percentage your affection level is. As you can see in one of the screenshots, you have three meters in your parameters and it's different for each route. So, yes, the game is a bit of a challenge to complete, but that means there's lots to read. Each character has their own uniqueness and charm to them, but that could only mean that they have a barrier for you to discover and pass through, Most of the game isn't just you going on dates like some games. The game focuses on your daily life with your 'boyfriend' from a diemension you choose so it's a little slow at first, because you might grow frustrated since after finishing a route, you have to go through meeting everyone again to go through a different route. At least, it's a bit of frustration party for me.\n\nAh I'm getting off-topic again. To help make your decision, I also had trouble seeing if I wanted to buy this as I'm on a budget. But like I said, I got this off a sale. To be honest, I'm really in between with not recommending and recommending. It is a really good VN to add to your collection, but it has negative cons so it isn't worth an instant purchase.","January 1","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess that's cool too.\n- Voice acting is top notch. It's been a while where I've come across an otome game with really good voice acting.\n- Very memorable, even after completing the game 100%\n\nCons:\n- I get this weird flash glitch thing of text that pops up sometimes, but I remember reading they were working on it, or have already worked on it.\n- Amnesia Later & World is not on Steam. I want to continue the story asap!\n\nI absoloutely love this game. I've played quite a few Otome games (mostly hand held/mobile) so Amnesia Memories is my first PC otome I've actually played. And I don't regret it one bit. The story is really really rich, the art is great, and the guys are super cute with their own different personalities. I won't add spoilers, but there are times where this game can get pretty creepy. I chose randomly instead of going in order, and the first guy I picked (Toma) made me question if I was honestly playing an otome or a horror game. Seriously, it creeped me out that much.\n\nAmnesia Memories is one of the few games where I actually worked at a 100% completion, and I would do it all over again.\n\nHere's to hoping that Amnesia Later and Amnesia World will come to Steam as well with an English sub! I can't get enough of it! Not even the Vita version of Later and World are in English yet, so fingers crossed!\n\nThis is my first review ever that I've written on Steam, and I really felt compelled to write this after playing the game.\n\nI think a few people will know about this game through the Anime. And as good as the anime was (sort of, not really) the anime does NOT bring this game justice. I mean come on, Ukyo's story got robbed in the anime. Believe me, if you came here from the anime, you gotta play the game. It'll make you question why the anime was so incredibly poorly done.\n\nIf you're looking to get into the otome world, I would absoloutely suggest getting Amnesia Memories, you will fall in love with it. And with it's current price at $3.29 (CAD) it's a total steal.\n\n10/10 would like to be called baka a million times again.","January 1","true","56.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But more importantly, this game really shines as a whole. A lot of visual novels try just go with the different routes being unconnected so that you get a different experience with each, but not too much of a whole story. Amensia memories is able to provide the unique experience of multiple, separate routes while all braiding back together into a beautiful story.\n\nThe characters are also incredibly well done. While it is true your boys have this tendency to monologue at you, I rarely found myself wanting to skip through it. Often, I would say man, I wish there was a route for the girls in this game just because they too are well done and I would love to see more of them.\n\nThe final detail that makes Amesia Memories unique is the story telling is refreshing because of one lovable spirit. Orion takes the role of the narrator, guide, and friend so while the protagonist is not entirely robbed of her own voice and personality, it puts her on the back burner from having to forcibly describe every scenario and feeling. Often, visual novels get into an awkward form of story telling where the protagonist fails at "show, not tell" and painfully details every thought and feeling. Instead, we have Orion asking your opinion and formulating plans that show how the protagonist, and subsequently the player, feel about it.\n\nYou will laugh, you will cry, you will spend the night in a dog cage, and you will die plenty of times. It's a wild ride, but it really is worth it. I highly recommend finishing each possible ending to get the full extent of its value. Like I said, this visual novel is at its best as a whole, so if you pick it up, be prepared to devote some time to getting the big picture. It will be worth it.","December 29, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it made me wonder, what the whole meaning of this 'getting killed over and over' really was for. The storyline with the parallel worlds and hopping through time is a little irritating, but you get used to it. Amnesia: Memories is a classy otome game and a real good visual novel with real nice artwork from Hanamura Mai. The female protagonist seems to be kind of bland (and never gets a real character development in this first part of the Amnesia Series), but the story makes up for it. Sadly the following games are PS games only, so it's not possible to continue the story. I'd recommend it if you get the chance to buy it with the discount, full price is a little too much I think, since there is no english translation for the dialogues.","February 17","true","47.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a character who has no memories and the only thing you can remember is a bug-like thing who's just told you the tragic reality that, hey ! He's hogging up all the space that, was originally, intended for your memories ! On top of that, how can you say no to five attractive boys that you get to yourself ? Come on !\n\nOn a serious note though, this game is filled with twisted people, stories, and lots of love but can also be super knife wrenching hurtful to the point of making you scream your throat out as to why it had to happen like that. Ever since I saw the anime series released, I've been waiting for the day to play this game and I totally don't regret spending a lot of time crying and screaming for each of the attractive boys. Whether you be a guy or girl, I still suggest playing this game. Each character are developed in their own unique ways making you want to figure out why ? Why had you fallen in love with him ? And what else beside his attractive looks can be so gosh darn evil ? Filled with drama, feelings, tears, regrets, and loyalty, Amnesia is a roller coaster on it's own. Not only is the art and music for the game breathe taking as it is, each individual boys you take on will be a the best memories to uncover. So don't be afraid to say no to one of them because who knows what dark secret you'll uncover from that ?","November 8, 2015","true","50.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm glad I went in neutral because I was pleasantly surprised at what I got. While I've only conquered three endings so far, I plan on finishing more.

But basically, our MC has had an accident, rooted from multiple ways (it's what I like about this game most- after one playthrough with one route, it's not the same base story like other visual novels/otomes when you do another route) and as a result from the accident she has amnesia. In the game, you need to figure out stuff about your past whilst not making it obvious that you have amnesia. Also you pursue a guy.\n\nEssential Characters:\n\nOrion\n-Am I the only one who is heartbroken we can't pursue him? No? Okay..\nSpirit dude who collided with the MC and took up her memories. He helps the MC recover her memories throughout the game and is very adept to do so. A typical shota, energetic and cute.\n\nShin\n-He actually isn't as Tsundere as he seems.\nThe MC's childhood friend. His route is the most mystery/crime surrounded, and I really like that about his route because it gets you hooked. He seems fairly rude at first, but later in the route warms up.\n\nToma\n-YANDERE SATAN. DO NOT TRUST THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ;;\nToma is also the MC's childhood friend. He is very friendly and caring, loving & affectionate towards the MC. He's a nice guy, as you can see, but later in his route you will be suprised. Even shocked.\n\n....if you like being drugged, locked inside a cage, and treated like a pet, Toma is for you.\n\nIkki\n-Don't know what to include in this side note, other than I'm 100% sure his zodiac sign is Leo.\nIkki is friendly. His arch is 'the flirt', though. Girls surround him all the time during his route. He has a certain condition, where his eyes - if looked into - make you fall in love. This doesn't work on the MC, for reasons explained later in the route. His route is quite interesting and even his bad ends make you wonder.\n\nKent\n-Definetly the most romance-ish with his route. It's a great route if you like the 'they thawed the ice-man' type of love story.\nKent is the detached, methodical cold & calculating type. He's a math freak. You have to do a math quiz thing during his route, which is either a great challenge that is stimulating or irritating and pointless by your personality. Don't know what else to put here.\n\nJ o k e r - W o r l d - U k y o\n...... (:\nWon't say anything about this route other than...Be prepared.\n\nThink I covered most of it..\nThere's other characters and stuff, but I only included the main characters.\nSorry if I forgot to put some core-story info in the descs of the characters.\n\n","December 31, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I just love how each story is so different and seeing how little things about the characters change in each route.  I also love how, aside from a very short introduction, there is no common route to skip through before getting to the actual character routes.  Each character has his own unique route, so when I restart, I am really restarting from the beginning.  It takes away the disjointedness that some other VNs suffer from where the game only feels complete the first time you played through it.  Another really cool feature is that when you clear a route, you can click certain spots on certain images in the gallery for that character to hear new voiced tidbits (and yes, they are subtitled).  It makes me feel like there is a little more to discover about some of the game's sweetest scenes.

I wasn't disappointed.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID... I do have some issues with this game.\n\n1. I absolutely hate how passive the heroine is. She just lets all these guys tell her what to do and she doesn't even care. Unfortunately this is a trope that a player will see in almost any otome game they play. :(\n\n2. IF you haven't played this game, which I'm assuming you haven't because you're reading reviews, DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES play the DIAMOND WORLD first. DIAMOND WORLD. Make sure you remember DIAMOND WORLD. Fortunately I didn't play Diamond first but I can say that if you aren't into creepy boyfriends, Diamond World will most likely leave you with a terrible first impression and might even make you never want to play this game. I will always 100% recommend Clover World to start out with because in my experience it is the best and least aggrivating (still somewhat aggrivating however, due to the nature of the man the heroine dates in that world)  I could have a little bit of a bias though because I've always had a soft spot for the nerdy types <3\n\n3. Orion. Most people love him. However, I found him to be a little annoying because he never stops talking.\n\n4. This game does a really good job of making Ukyo freak you out. I have yet to play his story (I haven't unlocked it yet because I can't go back to *shudder* Diamond World to get the ending I need) but from what I hear his actions in the game are justified and he's really sweet.\n\nAll of these things aside, this is a really good game if you want a little bit of mystery mixed with a lot of hot anime boys. I really really liked this game, although it might not seem like it. The hot shirtless anime boy scene was totally worth the creepiness of Toma and Ukyo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonemeadow/recommended/359390/","bonemeadow","Thrúd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonemeadow/","204 products in account","First time I played this I got a bad ending for Ikki, I thought he was a player and didn't trust him very much. He seemed two faced and a bit obnoxious. I told him I hated him and he took his fanclub out to karaoke, leaving me in the yukata and missing the fireworks show. What a prat. If someone had done that in real life, no matter how popular they were, I really would've told them to ♥♥♥♥ off. It ended with him bemoaning how lonely he was and implied that he was off to drown himself in the sea.\n\nSecond time it went a little better. With Shin I appreciated his honesty and trusted him to the best of my ability, earning a normal ending. Sometimes I questioned his actions, but I knew in my heart that I could trust him. I thought I had done enough, but ultimately I couldn't unlock the true ending and didn't managed to confront Towa. I was still happy with Shin, though. He was a good guy who said it like it was, even if it was sometimes a little harsh he had the best intentions. He reminded me of my partner in real life, having a less than ideal childhood and a few close friends. Very likeable once you get to know him.\n\nThird time I romanced Kent. It was really difficult at first, as that over logical personality kept grating on me, but as the character himself admitted, he was used to being "disliked for this reason". I felt stupid around him, which is not an attractive qulaity. However, I persevered, and I grew to appreciate that he really was doing nothing more than trying his best. I eventually unlocked the memories he was so scared of me finding out and in the end, it didn't change my feelings for him one bit. Being intelligent and logical isn't a bad thing, and in the end he found his emotions were more important.  Love isn't an equation. I achieved the true ending in this case, and I did feel very happy knowing my actions didn't cause him to miss out on a chance to study abroad.\n\nUpdate: Fourth, Toma. I just finished Toma's story and I hope he dies in a fire. I actually feel angry at this game for romanticising toxic relationships. As another character says, the dangerous thing is that Toma doesn't realise his insanity. He drugs the heroine, doesn't explain the situation (asserting his control) and when she resists he decides to PUT HER IN A DOG CAGE. I mean, seriously messed up by anyone standards. Worst guy ever. Naturally I got the ending where she remains trapped as his maid sex slave forever, but honestly I would've prefered the ending where I drowned in the muddy well. At least then there's no implied ♥♥♥♥. What a disaster.","March 25","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So things get crazy pretty quick. You have many hours that you can put into the game, depending on how fast you read, it may vary. The characters are all unique in their own way, some more unexpected than others. The Art is very beautiful, followed along with very well chosen voice actors. The stories all can get you very involved and wanting more. Only bleh is some achievements suck and Orion constantly yappin'.\n\nRecommend: To those who like Visual Novels, unique characters, romance, engaging stories, and pretty art.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nGame: There are lots of hours that can be put into this game which is good when seeing the price on this game. You get also a lot of unlockable additional content which makes it more worthwhile.  Such as memories and short stories in the boys' perspectives. Oh and mini-games which are pretty fun if you aren't in the mood for reading. Good amount of save slots, but in the end, I was wishing for more for Ukyo ~ n ~  Also is great that you can choose how it is read. You can turn on and off the V.A.'s, put it on Auto, Speed through text, show text and previous text all together, etc... Made it definitely a good experience. AND to make things better, if you're trying to get a different ending and playing through again, if you speed through, it will stop and play if there is text that you have previously not read in your other playthroughs! And it will highlight which answers you've already inputed. No trying to remember now :3\n\n\nAchievements: Some of these achievemnts are literally so annoying I just gave up -.- One is where you have to click the image multiple times just for the guy to say a couple things. Looked up where to click and it still does absolutely nothing.  Everyone, but Kent's, I have had difficulty getting one part of their picture to work, It is seriously the dumbest thing ever. >_> The others are easy to obtain.\n\nAnime VS. Otome: I found out about the anime first then the otome. I'm happy I came across the otome because now I realize how BAD the anime is. The anime doesn't cover really anything, Like the first 5-10 mins of the boys' story in the otome, so it was nice to really get to delve into these boys stories way more than the anime ever did.  Only thing is I kind of liked in the anime that Orion wasn't there 24/7. The otome he just literally drove me bonkers @ n @\n\nArt: The art is very beautiful and definitely draws you in.  Their character design is actually very well thought out and you see a bunch of tiny things that really bring everything together, Also with their personalities, it ties in with the design. They have different poses which are good as well. The only weird thing for me is how large some of their hands were... But the style and coloring is very pretty. The gallery has lots of pretty images that are saved from your specific route and you can even move around the picture and check out different areas of it. There was a lot of variety and ones you unlock just from completing certain acheivements. Though that stupid ctrl-left click thing for their "hidden" message things were annoying. I'd click and it would end up going to the next image instead. I had an immensley hard time trying to get parts of an image to register. No matter how many times I clicked Toma's fist in the 2nd variation nothing happened, Shin and Heroine picture variation 2, her face would not react at all, Ikki and the heroine at the theatre, the hand wouldn't register. I've looked this stuff up to see if I'm just clicking slightly off, but I am clicking where I need it. So that part gets a 0 in my book because it was just frustrating.\n\nMusic: The music wasn't distracting and pretty good for the most part.\n\nCharacters: The characters all had variety and interesting endings, though some just seemed completely random at times. I wish there could have been more choices to choose from and Orion would STOP making decisions for me -.- I'm looking at Toma's route heavily when Orion becomes really annoying. Speaking of Toma, I wish we could have learned more about why and when he started to have yandere tendencies. Just seeing his past with the heroine, it just seems odd that such a sweetie would now go nut-so if you ask me  I liked the guy characters because they all had their set personality making it fresh when you go to a different route. And many of the stories were very interesting to go into. I don't want to go into too much detail so this will be spoiler free.\n\nShin-> He is such a tsun tsun but  a sweetie ^ u ^ Oh and suprisingly the smartest guy out of the bunch in the end. I guess seemed a bit more realistic to me than the other boys.\n\nToma-> I personally really liked his character, he's definietly not for everyone. I just liked he was really out there compared to the other characters.  Though I think the Heroine shouldn't have been all okay after what he did to her @ m @\n\nKent-> He starts off a total meanie-poo but like Shin he really isn't that bad. He goes off onto a lot of tangents of things like math and what not. But he was an amusing character.\n\nIkki-> The "playboy" or "pretty boy" character but reading his story, there is so much more to him than on the surface.\n\nUkyo-> Prepare for the feels! His story is so bittersweet. You can't help but like this guy T w T\n\nBased on the characters themselves and how much I liked them:\nToma>Ukyo>Shin>Kent>Ikki\n\n\nBased on stories I found the most interesting are in the order:  Ukyo>Shin>Toma>Ikki>Kent. Ikki and Kent's story didn't interest me as much, I guess they just felt, I guess more like slice-of-life, while the others seemed to be a bit crazier with their stories, drawing me in more. (However, this is just a personal preference)\n\nStory itself: I found it a quite interesting premise, though I wish you could voice up more, Orion ends up taking the brunt of everything, which kind of ruins the effect for me. But   unraveling the mystery in some character's stories for why you have Amnesia were actually quite interesting, some were very dumb though...)\n\nVoices: The characters' voice acting is very good @ w @ I really enjoyed them. I especially liked Shins. Haha. But I think they all fit the characters very well.\n\n~Overall. I really enjoyed the story and the characters in  it.  It was an enjoyable experience overall and would recommened to anyone who likes visual novels and an interesting set of characters.","December 13, 2015","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But basically, our MC has had an accident, rooted from multiple ways (it's what I like about this game most- after one playthrough with one route, it's not the same base story like other visual novels/otomes when you do another route) and as a result from the accident she has amnesia. In the game, you need to figure out stuff about your past whilst not making it obvious that you have amnesia. Also you pursue a guy.\n\nEssential Characters:\n\nOrion\n-Am I the only one who is heartbroken we can't pursue him? No? Okay..\nSpirit dude who collided with the MC and took up her memories. He helps the MC recover her memories throughout the game and is very adept to do so. A typical shota, energetic and cute.\n\nShin\n-He actually isn't as Tsundere as he seems.\nThe MC's childhood friend. His route is the most mystery/crime surrounded, and I really like that about his route because it gets you hooked. He seems fairly rude at first, but later in the route warms up.\n\nToma\n-YANDERE SATAN. DO NOT TRUST THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ;;\nToma is also the MC's childhood friend. He is very friendly and caring, loving & affectionate towards the MC. He's a nice guy, as you can see, but later in his route you will be suprised. Even shocked.\n\n....if you like being drugged, locked inside a cage, and treated like a pet, Toma is for you.\n\nIkki\n-Don't know what to include in this side note, other than I'm 100% sure his zodiac sign is Leo.\nIkki is friendly. His arch is 'the flirt', though. Girls surround him all the time during his route. He has a certain condition, where his eyes - if looked into - make you fall in love. This doesn't work on the MC, for reasons explained later in the route. His route is quite interesting and even his bad ends make you wonder.\n\nKent\n-Definetly the most romance-ish with his route. It's a great route if you like the 'they thawed the ice-man' type of love story.\nKent is the detached, methodical cold & calculating type. He's a math freak. You have to do a math quiz thing during his route, which is either a great challenge that is stimulating or irritating and pointless by your personality. Don't know what else to put here.\n\nJ o k e r - W o r l d - U k y o\n...... (:\nWon't say anything about this route other than...Be prepared.\n\nThink I covered most of it..\nThere's other characters and stuff, but I only included the main characters.\nSorry if I forgot to put some core-story info in the descs of the characters.\n\n","December 31, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I was so disappointed when I heard the Visual Novel was only\nin Japan and on hand-held games however once I heard it was coming to Steam it\nwas so exciting.\n\nThe game has many merits, It's not a short visual novel like most, you're going to get\nquite a few hours out of it and you're pretty much expected to play it over and over again.\n\nThere's minigames and such which are really fun, I personally find Air Hockey THE BEST.\nThe AI in the minigame's aren't too shabby either, they're atually quite good.\n\nOrion, a character, is EXTREMELY annoying. Or at least I personally find that Orion constantly\ncommenting on each and every action and scene can be quite misleading and agitating.\n\nThe Art Style is beautiful and really well done, so are the animations. With this game, comes\nan extreme amount of wonderfully stylistic and unique sets of scenery and characters.\n\nMost characters are pretty unique, some are a little meh but that's only because they have generic\npersonalities that all animes/mangas/visual novels contain to some extent.\n\nMusic helps the scenes and can sometimes be a little freaky, you'll find out why..\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gievre/recommended/359390/","gievre","Gievre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gievre/","570 products in account","Visual Novels have always been a guilty pleasure of mine, taken in a large concentrated dose and then forgotten for months on end before the itch ever resurfaces. Usually I'm pretty satisfied when I drop the VNs that I've been working on regardless of completion status, but it's a first this time that not only have I completed Amnesia within 20-25 hours across the span of two short days but that I still want more.\n\nFive paths. All unique. All satisfying. I loved how the characters tied back into each other across parallel worlds, picking each subsequent playthrough based on the character that intrigued me the most in the previous. Perhaps it was just a mark of how well things were done that I felt that with every playthrough I found out more and more about the overall storyline with no extraneous or repetitive revelations (so regardless of order, the sentiment would be the same) or that I somehow managed to pick the one best combination for optimal satisfaction: Ikki > Toma > Shin > Kent. The revelation about the girls at the end of Ikki's route really helped when I met them in subsequent routes. And Kent just ended off everything with the sweetest note.\n\nSinful voices. Gorgeous character art. Memorable personalities. And happily ever afters that I just want more of. Some of the paths are a little counterintuitive (to my personality) but there isn't really any choice that doesn't have plenty of clues laid out if you're paying attention. If I have one complaint is that there isn't more of the side characters; you do get more of them when you pursue Bad routes, but I'd have liked it more if the MC could've had both guy and friends, y'know? I felt awful about the lack of attention that Sawa got for the most of the game if you were trying for the Good ends; you needed to ignore her so many times!\n\nStill. If you like VNs and you haven't played this game, please do. If you like anime, give it a shot since everything is fully voiced anyway, so you could technically just set it on autoplay, kick back and enjoy it. 10/10 would play again. Confession? I'm considering doing another run through of all the Good endings so I can end it on an Ultra high (since I had to work out all the Bad endings).","January 10","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've got normal ending first for other guys' blind playthrough except you know who (though I cheated a few times)\n\nThe side mini-games are quite fun too though you might get a bit bored after a while. Also, some texts have some...grammar errors? But the translation are mostly accurate~\n\nAnyway, my favourites guys in order:\nOrion (Best buddy, not love interest)\nShin (I love him! My husband haha)\nKent (I love how he doesn't want me to die haha)\nUkyo (He's very faithful)\nToma (erm...cage?)\nIkki (I felt like slapping him on my first hour of his route, still didn't like him at the end)\n\nI do hope Otomate/Idea Factory or whoever considers bringing the sequels to the west! (I might consider importing since that's how good this game is!!)\n\nTL:DR: I'll give this game a 9/10! Buy it and play! (When it's on sale, who doesn't wanna save some money)","January 11","true","38.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I told myself I wasn't going to play the game. And then it went on sale for like $3 and realized I didn't hate it THAT much. The art is nice, the music is scene-setting, and the characters are amazing! If you judge the franchise based on the anime like I did, then that is a HUGE mistake. The heroine actually has a lot of spunk for an otome game which is really refreshing. Its also fun to see the different outcomes and endings.\n\nThe thing I probably had the most fun with however would have to be the minigames!

If you aren't familiar with otome/dating sims, I suggest holding off on playing it until you're more familiar with the genre. It isn't a difficult game, exactly...but it definitely takes some common tropes, character types, and events from other dating sims and messes around with them a bit.

Amnesia: Memories doesn't want you to make it through the story alive, so you have to work your butt off to not die while on the prowl for your big strong man.\n\nReview\n\nSound: 10/10 -- Game is fully voice acted in Japanese with a beautiful backing soundtrack. I don't mind that it's repetitive in nature, it's a studio-quality soundtrack. Atmospheric and easy on the ears.\n\nArt: 8/10 -- I personally enjoy the blurry, hand-drawn look of the backgrounds for each scene, but I know not everybody would agree. Also the outfits on the boys take me to the lawlacaust.\n\nStory: 7.5/10 -- Overall the plotlines in each route are at least tolerable, though the protagonist can be incredibly frustrating and downright stupid. Holes in different places. Not Swiss Cheese holey, but still holey.\n\nBoys: 7/10 -- For what we get to see of them, the boys whose emotions we get to know the most intimately are Shin's and Ikki's; both of these boys have powerful feelings that come through without them always having to say it. Toma and Ukyo both felt out-of-touch for me, because their characters were a bit outlandish. Toma felt far more troubled than he let on and Ukyo had lost his ♥♥♥♥ing marbles. I'd have liked to learn more about them. The most "alive" of the boys, for me, was Kent. Kent reminded me of a very close friend I used to have and I'll say his characterization for prickly-intellect was spot-on.\n\nCharacters: 10/10 -- THE CUSTOMER IS THE ENEMY!!!! For real though, I enjoyed the supporting characters and how you saw them treat the protagonist in each route. It always changed depending on the love interest and I think it made them more human.\n\nOverall: 10/10, Senpais noticed me\n\nRoutes\n\nHearts: Shin is the dream bad-boy of a girl that never grew out of her "edgy" phase. He's an insensitive ♥♥♥-hat at his worst and a loving protector at his best. The plot of his route is overwhelmingly melodramatic with a super-secret-agent-spy-detective-mission. By the time you get to the conclusion of the mission your heart is achy and confused. Your animu best friend tried to kill you. This is the childhood romance stuff that's so cute I could puke. Shin is a great character and feels like the "canon" route aside from Ukyo.\n\nDiamonds: Toma is attractive, intelligent, and protective of the protagonist even if it means locking her in a cage. His route follows preventing the protag's imminent death and harassment from Ikki's fan club. Toma would do anything for the protag because that's what he feels his responsibility is as an older brother and oh my god this whole route made me want to strangle the protagonist because there needs to be a "tell Toma how you feel" option WAY early on. All the BS could've been avoided.\n\nClubs: Kent is a hyper-critical young man with a hard gaze and soft heart. His social awkwardness will melt the ice on your heart. His logical processes behind every action he takes will make your eyebrows raise up. Kent's route is about learning to live life before he leaves to study abroad. He is the only male that communicates with Orion throughout the game. His character really pulls on the heartstrings with his long thoughtful walks and desire to spend time with the protag. He feels like a real person.\n\nSpades: Ikki is a gorgeous playboy with a fanclub full of stalkers. You're the only girl that his magical, hypnotic eyes[en.wikipedia.org] never fully worked on. To win this beautiful boy's heart you have to not fall victim to the fan club's attempts to kill you, take advantage of his gentle heart, or lie to him about your behavior being different after your accident. Ikki is a wonderful, loving young man that hasn't had the chance to fall in true love because of his cursed magical hypnotic eyes[en.wikipedia.org]. Let him love you. Please. He's so great.\n\nJoker: Everything is out to kill you. Even Ukyo. It's do-or-die in the final route of the game, and your memories of your original world true love are hazy. Who is this strange guy with green hair predicting the future? Why is he trying so desperately to keep you safe? Why does he get so emotional over something as simple as you wanting to see him? And why, for the love of god, does he pull an Edward Cullen every five minutes? "I love you. but you can't be near me. I'll hurt you. Don't hate me. Forgive me. Still love you."\n\nGood news! You're going to find out!\n\nBad news! You're probably going to die a dozen times to get there!\n\nConclusion\n\nAll-in-all this is a super enjoyable visual novel. I got it during the Steam holiday sale but would happily pay full price to have the same experience again. This is exceptionally polished work, although I'm always going to wish I had more backstory on the boys. Recommended for visual novel fans that like a quirky story and weird characters. The only Mary Sue in this otome is you.","January 27","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one isn't quite as amazing bad ending wise, as other Otome games but - There still were many bad ends with several CG's, and it allows for further interactions later.\n\n1) Music: 8/10. The music Looped really well, and I didn't get annoyed with it despite playing the game continually from start to finish.\n2) Voice/Translation: 10/10. The voices came out really well and I actually liked all of the male actor's voices in this. In the story, and the "extras" which I won't spoil. There were no bugs or typos in the translated to English version.\n3) Artwork: 10/10. This was beautiful. All of the CG's/Artwork was impeccable with this. I didn't find any weird looking scenes or anything off with any of them. All of the characters looked like themselves, and MC looked pretty in any of them where you see her.\n4) Characters: 8/10. There's a few things I didn't like which I'll place in spoilers, ordered by who I liked best (A), to who I didn't like much.(E)\n\nA. Toma Not yandere enough. He only went full blown yandere even in what is arguably the "scariest" ending for Toma in Ukyo's route.  Toma didn't get maniacal enough on any of the bad paths in his route so it made that one end on Ukyo's route, creepier. Oh, and the fanclub thing. Toma handled it better than Ikki which made me like Ikki less.\n\nB. Shin  I couldn't figure out his character typing. Somewhere between kuudere and tsundere. That annoyed me, he also had a few wtf  choices to get his "true" path or all CG's. I also didn't like how Shin confronts Toma at the end for the True End. I get that he's not a criminal but it seems a little tame to just let Toma go with a punch to the face.\n\nC. Secret Path  Ukyo was kind of a cry-baby, I'm not into that type of character either, but at least he had no math and a ton of endings lol. Ukyo's related bad ends in other guy's routes either as they weren't dark enough to make him appear as disturbed as he's portrayed in his own route. Also a couple of his bad ends were similar. I think that there could have been a few more alternate ones added, to tie up what he says to heroine for "advice". I think it would have been an interesting bad end to get between Shin and Toma since Ukyo tells you not to, but you really only see Toma lose his mind and go crazy whereas Shin doesn't do anything.\n\nD. Kent  If I recall correctly one of his bad ends literally made me have blank stare face, since It was that predictable too. Not to mention the rival confusion which was MC's boss (yikes.). The math questions... WHY??? Those were not fun to work out in my head when I was just interested in getting the story. To pair all of it off, out of all the guys, Kent to me was the least good looking character model. His hairstyle threw me off, and I didn't like his attitude. It was only later on in the path that I found him okay and I liked his True end. He didn't appear to be as "book-smart" as Shin, although he was the character is meant to be mathematical - so that didn't make sense to me. I get that he's supposed to be the intellectual guy but Shin seemed smarter.\n\nE. Ikki I seriously didn't enjoy this path. At all. I actually found his paths to all be boring to find/get. He didn't seem to have any emotion when MC was being threatened by the fan club at first. and he seemed like a huge coward/paper boyfriend. A few of the options for his true end seem wrong, and it was not that romantic or sweet. I wasn't a fan of the CG for his true end either, and I hated Ikki's personality. This could be bias because I hate the "player" type in these games. They have similar "fanclub" problems, which gets annoying. It didn't seem like Ikki cared a whole lot, and he didn't give his fanclub a harsh enough punishment for doing what they did to MC. >_> *tosses him in the trash*\n\n\n5) Story: I haven't watched the Anime Entirely yet, so I'm not certain how much of this comes from the Anime or if the Anime was made based on this game, BUT - The storylines here get pretty deep and they all have at least one or two things in common. I do think that overall the story was really good, but it had a few places where the story seemed to be a little slow, or a few extra days where they weren't really adding much to the story. I also want to say that some of the bad ends I would have prefered to see CG's on. They didn't really seem to have much "closure" and the fade to red thing seemed a bit cheap, given how hard some of those ends are to find.\n\nThings I liked:\n*CG Menu.\nI liked the fact that you have the cg with ability to scroll over and see the whole image as some of the cg images are rather huge. I also liked that they're organized by the character's name, as it makes it easier to browse though.\n*Extra stories/Minigames:\nI liked the extra stories that you can unlock, as well as the minigames. At first you don't realise that some of the things are only unlocked by playing these.\n*Bonus True Ending: TL;DR: That path ties everything together and makes the game make sense.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n* No ability to Replay Endings from the Endings menu.\nI didn't like this because while it is fine to replay a game, It's really hard to remember what the right choices were if you have "already seen" answers highlighted.\n\nAdvice on what I would do differently:  If you could have the ability to re-watch the full story with an ending that you already unlocked. Then have the game just let you click/confirm the choices for you since you've already unlocked the path. That's something I haven't seen in any other otome game.\n\n*MC wasn't voiced. I don't like this because in auto mode, if MC says something, it skips over it instantly.\n\n*Spoiler for CG's: Point and Click - CG Game. This sucked. To get literally every single CG done, there's no icon change, or any sort of way of telling which picture you have left to click through. It made getting that harder than it needed to be.\n\nBonus:\nThe Secret Character path... Spoiler alert:This was my third favorite path simply because of all of the bad endings. I wished that all of the other characters would have equally as many bad paths, especially Toma. I don't know if that's related to the anime, or whatnot however so I understand why that is. (Still other guys were not as "bad" as they could have gotten on the bad ends.) I sincerely loved the "true ending" on the Secret path because it filled in a few of the "gaps" that the story left out in the other worlds.","December 3, 2015","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atsvie/recommended/359390/","atsvie","rayrayhime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atsvie/","69 products in account","Amensia memories is a great otome game thanks to the beautiful art, developed characters, decent voice acting, and the good writing. But more importantly, this game really shines as a whole. A lot of visual novels try just go with the different routes being unconnected so that you get a different experience with each, but not too much of a whole story. Amensia memories is able to provide the unique experience of multiple, separate routes while all braiding back together into a beautiful story.\n\nThe characters are also incredibly well done. While it is true your boys have this tendency to monologue at you, I rarely found myself wanting to skip through it. Often, I would say man, I wish there was a route for the girls in this game just because they too are well done and I would love to see more of them.\n\nThe final detail that makes Amesia Memories unique is the story telling is refreshing because of one lovable spirit. Orion takes the role of the narrator, guide, and friend so while the protagonist is not entirely robbed of her own voice and personality, it puts her on the back burner from having to forcibly describe every scenario and feeling. Often, visual novels get into an awkward form of story telling where the protagonist fails at "show, not tell" and painfully details every thought and feeling. Instead, we have Orion asking your opinion and formulating plans that show how the protagonist, and subsequently the player, feel about it.\n\nYou will laugh, you will cry, you will spend the night in a dog cage, and you will die plenty of times. It's a wild ride, but it really is worth it. I highly recommend finishing each possible ending to get the full extent of its value. Like I said, this visual novel is at its best as a whole, so if you pick it up, be prepared to devote some time to getting the big picture. It will be worth it.","December 29, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It got lots of content, very different characters and even the posibility to see it fully animated before or after playing with the anime!\nYou wont be disapointed!\n\nThis is how Otomes should get carried over from Japan, not on cellphone apps and as a pack feature in other games.

Do not confuse it with a Horror game of nearly the same name, because rather than leave you fearful, this title has the potential to leave you with a tremendous sense of awe, and almost sadness; not that the story is sad, but that it is over and you will never again experience it as you did that first time.\n\nI 100%’d this game, something I almost never do, simply because I HAD to see all the endings, and the thought of being done with this game was more than I could handle. It is voiced (a big plus vs. other otomes) and keeps the story moving without burdening you with excessive side jobs to grind likeability stats.\n\nI'll attempt to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you don't want to risk it, I will say this: get this game. This is the first game I have purchased where I wish I had spent MORE on it. I got this game on sale for $7, and I've seen it go under $5. It is worth full price. If you see it on sale, do not hesitate, grab it. This is a beautiful, smart and joyful game any visual novel fan should experience. Use one of the guides, I recommend Pie-inator’s, to help you get to each of the endings and enjoy.\n\nPossible Spoilers Below\n\nAmensia: Memories is about a girl who loses her memory when as stray spirit collides with her head. Whoops. Now, instead of any sense of self, she has a friendly little guide by the name of Orion to help her get through life and figure out who she is, and who she can trust. After a brief introduction to Orion, you’ll pick your world, meaning, pick your guy.\n\nThe first choice is Shin. Shin’s path is a good mystery. He’s a pretty typical tsundere, and your childhood friend. His best quality is that he understands the MC and will do absolutely anything to help and protect her. This path’s main function is to introduce you to the cast of characters that will play important roles as you continue your journey to understand the truth about this world you have stepped into.\n\nNext up is Toma. If you didn’t think there is a little something wrong, and dark, about your situation while playing Shin’s path, you will understand it now. Toma’s path is not overly unique for otome’s and visual novels, but it’s pretty twisted. Orion’s interaction with your character takes it to the next level, especially if you’re going for the happy ending. It’s pretty great making bizarre choices in a game and having someone actually call you out on it.\n\nNext up is Ikki, a playboy type who you think you have all figured out the moment you meet him. But this is the path where you begin to realize this world has some really strange things going on, far beyond the normal. Ikki’s path is very sweet and really turns all of your assumptions about the character around. By the end, you’ll probably have a little crush on Ikki, and that’s ok.\n\nThe forth path is Kent, a character who has mostly sat in the background in the previous paths. He is quiet and intelligent, and a bit harsh. As you begin this path, both you, Orion, and the MC wonder how it is that you are actually dating this guy. Your relationship is pretty rocky, to say the least. But the further you go down this path, the more and more Kent’s true character comes out. This is probably the most romantic path, and ends in such a sweet way that you may find yourself falling for this adorable nerd.\n\nAlong the way, as mentioned, you’ll also be interacting with Orion. His presence up until this point is pretty much a mystery, though if you’ve been paying attention you’ve started to get some clues as to what’s going on. His company really elevates the entire experience so far through his adorable reactions and unwavering support of the MC.\n\nIf you’ve gone this far, you have also met the strangest character in the cast, Ukyo, and buckle up, because now that you’ve completed the other four guys’ paths, Ukyo’s is now available to you. This is where the story goes from strong to unreal. Ukyo’s path is the story of the world, the overarching plot that ties all other paths together and explains exactly what happened to the MC. It is heartbreaking and beautiful and very well may have you in tears by the end. Not to mention Ukyo’s path has a grand total of NINE different endings.\n\nWalking the path with Ukyo is dangerous and confusing, but leads to one of the biggest payoffs I have ever experienced in a game. It takes some time to get to this path, but to not experience this path is to not experience the game.\nOverall this game is breathtaking, with beautiful art, fantastic music and an out of this world story. It is a SMART story, and doesn’t talk down to the player, but rather challenges you to accept unbelievable circumstances as truths. It is not your typical otome. There is a depth to this world that you would expect out of a big triple-A RPG, not a casual visual novel. It is a must have for any visual novel fan.\n","May 2","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike other otome games, this story changes radically depending on what answers you take and what man you go for. It's nice to know I can pay full attention to the game after just one guy, unlike others where sometimes picking someone different just changes maybe about three or four scenes tops and it's all the same the rest of the time.\n\nThe only thing is that it's hard to get a handle on the guy at first, though considering you don't know him it fits the story, but it's also terribly hard to know which action will please him. Spoiler: Going with what you think Kent wants to hear will win you no points, but being very affectionate despite that being clearly stated rouses his suspicions about you is much more helpful.\n\nStill, I haven't gotten any bad endings on accident so far, so while getting the best endings aren't easy the first time through, normal endings are still satisfying. Also, as said before it does fit the story so I can't complain too much. Reading them is just hard at times is all and replaying to just make a few different choices can break the experience a little, though it's a minor complaint.\n\n10/10 Not completely perfect, but leagues above others and only nitpicks that can't be against the game, just my own bad choice making it would seem. lol","May 4","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a heroine who wakes up with amnesia and you must try to hide your amnesia. This concept works really well because you as the player don't have any idea what's going on with the heroine's life. All the characters have their own charm and they're not stereotypical or flat. The UI is super smooth, the art is gorgeous, the music suits the mood and doesn't get too repetitive, and the voice acting...-it's really good. I got this game on sale and I felt like it was a great catch. This game made me question my choices and I actually learned a bit more about myself and how I would react in certain touchy situations.\n\nI haven't completely fallen for any character yet (mostly because I'm most looking forward to Ukyo's route, haha).\n\nSome minor complaints I have is that some scenarios aren't really consistent. It seems like only the good end route is the route that's completely consistent, while in the other routes the game seems to forget some details based on the choices you make. I also am not too fond of rereading the same text 4 times to get all the endings since there isn't too much variation in the story except for the end, but most VNs are like that. It also bothers me that the lip flap movements don't sync up with the voice acting, especially when the speech is being dragged out (I'm looking at you, Toma's seiyuu), but it's easy to ignore if you're reading the text most of the time. I really love the character art, but when the characters look surprised, they actually look like they're terrified...but these are all pretty minor flaws.\n\nOverall, this game is fantastic and I would definitely recommend playing if you're into dark romance dating sims!","May 5","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't disappointed.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID... I do have some issues with this game.\n\n1. I absolutely hate how passive the heroine is. She just lets all these guys tell her what to do and she doesn't even care. Unfortunately this is a trope that a player will see in almost any otome game they play. :(\n\n2. IF you haven't played this game, which I'm assuming you haven't because you're reading reviews, DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES play the DIAMOND WORLD first. DIAMOND WORLD. Make sure you remember DIAMOND WORLD. Fortunately I didn't play Diamond first but I can say that if you aren't into creepy boyfriends, Diamond World will most likely leave you with a terrible first impression and might even make you never want to play this game. I will always 100% recommend Clover World to start out with because in my experience it is the best and least aggrivating (still somewhat aggrivating however, due to the nature of the man the heroine dates in that world)  I could have a little bit of a bias though because I've always had a soft spot for the nerdy types <3\n\n3. Orion. Most people love him. However, I found him to be a little annoying because he never stops talking.\n\n4. This game does a really good job of making Ukyo freak you out. I have yet to play his story (I haven't unlocked it yet because I can't go back to *shudder* Diamond World to get the ending I need) but from what I hear his actions in the game are justified and he's really sweet.\n\nAll of these things aside, this is a really good game if you want a little bit of mystery mixed with a lot of hot anime boys. I really really liked this game, although it might not seem like it. The hot shirtless anime boy scene was totally worth the creepiness of Toma and Ukyo. The math part of Clover world almost makes me turn the game off and chuck my laptop (I really hate math yo) but Kent keeps me coming back er'rytime.\n\n19000000/10 would touch Kent's butt again.

Orion annoyed me so much, I finally muted the game so I didn't have to hear his voice (right clicked volume in taskbar, opened volume mixer, muted game... in case anyone else wants to). I also wish there was a way to ONLY skip over Orion's dialogue, because all he really does is point out the obvious, and reiterate what we've already learned. He also asks questions that annoyed me, like "why is he acting different suddenly?" and I would heckel him the ENTIRE time, asking if he's even paying attention to the story or the datable males. If he asks a question requiring a response, the scroll wheel works to see what the question was when the options pop up.\nI did experience the weird screen glitch where some green writing would be displayed for a split second, but it didn't bother me because it was so fast.\n\nI finished this game in a matter of days (two, I think?). I stayed up after midnight just to finish one storyline.

Although I've seen plenty of them before, but there're just not many of them that have been translated so I just be impressed about the beautiful artwork. I'm glad I started with this one.\n\nAt first I watched the anime long time ago, and I did like it a lot. The story is nice and does make sense in a lot of ways. I just didn't found it interesting enough for me to remember it. The first 4 routes are pretty normal, a bit too narrowed, to be quite honest. I just find this game impressive after I played Ukyo's route. I find it the most throughout route. Others are just pretty narrowed compared to it. I found Ukyo's the one that loved the heroine the most, the others are just nothing compared to him.\n\nThe only thing that I want to complain about this game is the first 4 routes don't really affect me much, unlike Ukyo's route. Plus, I know Orion is there only to express thoughts, but sometimes he just talks too much.\n\nAside of that, the art is super gorgeous (which make me pay attention to this game in the first place), the music is nice (I got chills whenever I heard the horror music). I run the game smoothly without any problems.\n\nI hope more sequels will come to steam though.","May 19","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish they had done it like OZMAFIA!! and not bothered putting unachievable achievements in it.","February 1","false","59.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it was well worth it. ^^ I'm still working my way through the game (though also having achievement troubles where they don't unlock even after meeting requirements), but I've enjoyed all the stories thus far. Also, it might just be me, but I seem to have an issue of lag with this game... Which wouldn't normally matter except when you're playing Air Hockey, and somehow I've still managed to beat everyone except Ikki. ^^; Either way, I really love this game and its stories, and I hope we get more in the future. ^^","May 27","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I might be the only one here, but Shin's route is my favorite. I got it in November when it was like $4 or so during a super sale and it was one of the best game purchases I've ever made.","May 28","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously, this game blew my mind. I've never written a review for a game before, but I just had to comment on this. The story was majorly engaging, and I'm still obsessing about the game (and dying over the fact that I can't find English localizations of the sequels).\n\nHighly recommended!!","May 29","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
