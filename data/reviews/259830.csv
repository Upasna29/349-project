I spent a large amount of time replaying and replaying levels due to my constant deaths. The game is difficult, really, but it’s an amazing experience.\n\nThe game started with a very simple story. Badguy shows up, badguy steals goods, goodguy must return the goods. It’s primitive, yes, and not really unnecessary, but it lays the foundation for how the hero goes about getting the goods back. The controls are very simple, with new abilities introduced over time, allowing plenty of time to get used to each ability and its corresponding button. I never found myself mixing up the controls. You end up having access to four different attacks, each with its own advantages. Some of the major attacks have other major uses, like jumping higher, or swinging across the level.\n\nThere are a variety of enemies scattered throughout the nine levels of the game. I wasn’t sure if each dealt a different amount of damage, but later in the game, it certainly felt like I was taking more damage by the new enemies being introduced, some even killing me in a single hit. The enemies and obstacles both progressed in difficulty over the course of the game and this was a reasonable pace, up until the final level. The final level was excruciating to complete. That level contained the final boss, who I actually defeated on my second try, but the segment leading up to the final boss was just painful. I died many times in an effort to complete that level. It seemed as if they took the difficulty of the rest of the game and squared it.\n\nWooden Sen’SeY also featured a water level in which the protagonist traversed an underwater cave in a spherical submarine. This added a bit of variety to the gameplay, but I did not find this level as enjoyable as the normal, land-based levels. The level was a bit annoying at times too, especially near the end, when I had to find my way through a maze of wooden crates infested by enemies.\n\nThe game’s graphics were simply stunning. When placed on their highest settings, it was just.. amazing. The style chosen for the landscape, characters, and textures blended well with the platforming genre as a whole. The character models reminded me of Double Fine’s “Stacking”, but in a more “cartoon” way. The game’s music was also great, and makes me wonder if there is a soundtrack available?\n\nWooden Sen’SeY’s primary fault is the length of the game. It took me roughly two hours to beat. That’s nowhere near the amount that I wanted, but it was an enjoyable two hours nonetheless.\n\nWooden Sen’SeY also has a time attack mode, which consists of 30 small stages that truly test your platforming skills. I still find myself stuck on a single one, because I cannot pass it fast enough, but this mode does add some extra length to the game. It reminded me of Rayman’s time attack modes, on a smaller scale. These stages are surprisingly difficult, and I found myself stuck on certain stages for upwards of ten minutes. I’m still stuck on an early level, but they are fairly entertaining and I recommend playing them after beating the story mode.\n\nOverall, Wooden Sen’SeY was an excellent experience. Fun, challenging gameplay bundled with amazing graphics. I cannot wait to see what Upper Byte Studio brings us next.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuUAgYSG_1o","December 9, 2013","true","2.4"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

Your basic attack barely reaches in front of you, so before you finish the first level you'll be "axe-slamming" into enemies (jump, then down+attack).

The game looks great and the music is fantastic. In that regards, it really should appeal to those who like 2.5D platformers in the vein of Donkey Kong Country or Giana sisters.

Various moves/attacks available, with time attack, leaderboards.

On level completion you get to see % of enemies killed, 'sey' collected and a few other stats.\n\nMy one complaint so far is that there is this 'boost jump' move that, on an xbox controller is "A" followed by "down on movement stick" combined with "X" button.  This move is required to jump higher to reach/attack a lot of things so it seems like an oversight not to allow it to be seperately customizable as a key or button.\n\nThat said, overall recommended if you like platformers with enemies and 'gotta catch em all' collectibles as an optional goal for each level.","February 15, 2014","true","1.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The controls are not very precise in some aspects, but they're bearable. Art direction is nothing to write home about either, but it works.\n\nThen, you start noticing little bugs, like hit detection on enemies or hit detection on your rope swings.\nThen, you start noticing little balancing issues, like ranged enemies that have a high enough fire rate to keep you at bay with knockback and kill you unless you glitch it, or rows of 8+ scarcely dangerous enemies inserted as padding right after a checkpoint. They also begin almost every difficult section with an extra life, showing they have no faith in either the audience or their platforming balancing.\n\nAnd then, the final boss. The final boss made me throw the towel.\nRemember all those tactics you learned through the game? Learn how the enemies move and take them out with your axes... Carefully swing around to get that one item so you can get back to 4 health... Explore the environment looking for secret areas... Good, now forget it.\nThe final boss is nothing like that. The final boss is a runner with no checkpoints and riddled with insta-kill traps. A section like this (which closely resembles Bit Trip Runner with its timing nature) requires tight controls, something that this game doesn't have, and it especially shows in this final stage.\nFirst, you have 10-15 seconds of running, which is padding.

You can boost-jump through 2 of these but not all 3, because otherwise you'll be too slow before the boss catches up to you.\nThen you have some precision jumping (with insta-kill blades in-between), some precision swings (with death void below), and then god knows what because I gave up after the rope didn't hook to the ceiling for the Nth time even though it should've.\nWhat makes it worse is that you have 4 lives and no extra ones can be found in the level (as far as I could manage to last). This means you get a 15 second cutscene after loading the level, then you can die 4 times; when you do (and you will), you're forced to wait about 10 seconds (loading + death screen), then another 15 seconds for the boss cutscene.\n\nHad it been for the early 8 stages I would've suggested this.

The main character was cute and the story is basically nothing besides a basic premise established the first level. There is no talking. I liked the japanese setting and the music fit the game. Every level was quite varied in look, and featured some sort of new obstacle. Most of the enemies were the same and were rather repeitive, with only 2 real boss fights. The game is super short being a little over 2 hours. There are collectible barrels and list of how many guys you killed for the level out of a certain number, but neither mattered. Once i realized collecting was worthless, I stopped wasting my time. This is Creavures game have the same problem, don't sprinkle collectibles if they literally don't help your character progress or do anything at all. I liked the slam jumping as a component, and the swinging was fun too. They were mechanics not really used in the game and they worked fine. I don't know why people were complaining about swinging or player control, they must have just been idiots that played a side-scrolling platformer without a gamepad, which is on them, not the game. I do wish they wouldn't have relied on the jump slam for every part and fighting every enemy. They make it the only way to hurt people without getting hurt, because swinging your sword is useless. So that means you spend the entire game jump slamming every enemy, which gets repetitive. Sometimes you throw the axe at birds, but thats it. There are throwing stars, which do no damage, and some bombs, but that's basically it. There was collision detection problems, as I would get hit approaching things or even if I landed over them or jumped before them. It was annoying how the game featured only partial controller support and numpad didn't work, as that would have given even more control. The final boss has this super stupid being chased scene where you have to keep slam jumping and swinging, but its stupid because of the analog stick, which you have to be holding to the right, to then switch and move down when you jump while pressing x, and then move back up. I died so many times because the game didn't register the analog stick down, all which could have been avoided with numpad use as an option. Also some levels are ok, but some parts are super stupid with checkpoints and are spaced wayyyyyyyyyyy too far apart. Also it makes no sense with the lives, how you have to restart, you should just get to restart from the last checkpoint like every other platformer since the year 2000 (this isn't mario anymore). So the final part is super stupid because of lack of checkpoints and analog stick. Also jumping shouldn't always have to be a 3 part movement with x and down and square, it just overcomplicates thing. Gameplay, shortness, and repetition weight this samurai down.  7/10.","March 5, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Various moves/attacks available, with time attack, leaderboards.  You get a couple extra lives per level to restart from last checkpoint, after those extra lives are up you have to restart the level.  You can find extra lives as pickup items in a few places per level usually in harder/trickier to reach places.\n\nLevels take a few minutes to clear, there are hidden/hard to reach extra lives and collectibles throughout each level.  On level completion you get to see % of enemies killed, 'sey' collected and a few other stats.\n\nMy one complaint so far is that there is this 'boost jump' move that, on an xbox controller is "A" followed by "down on movement stick" combined with "X" button.  This move is required to jump higher to reach/attack a lot of things so it seems like an oversight not to allow it to be seperately customizable as a key or button.\n\nThat said, overall recommended if you like platformers with enemies and 'gotta catch em all' collectibles as an optional goal for each level.","February 15, 2014","true","1.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

At all?\nIt occasionally toys with a few decent platforming ideas, I guess. The graphics are passable.\n\n...\n\nThat's... about it. There's not much else to redeem it.\nFor starters, the music is godawful and the sound FX even worse - I had to mute the FX because they gave me a headache, they're that bad. If the problems ended there maybe I'd be okay with it.\nGood thing the game's just shoddily put together as a whole.\nFirst, bugs. Enemies sometimes don't seem to take damage; have had to land 5 hits on enemies that normally take 2, and I have no clue why. As well, the springs sometimes decide to send you flying in not quite the right direction. Usually you need to be holding an arrow to even have a chance of going to the right spot, but even then it's not 100% you'll get where you need to go. And I've gotten stuck/forced to restart levels in combat scenarios by killing the last enemy too quickly such that it doesn't trigger the battle's end. Which is great.\nThe interface, also, is worth mentioning. You can't restart a level from inside the level, you have to exit to the main menu, choose the chapter you were at (always starts at the prologue so you get to scroll every time) and only then can you restart. What should take less than a second takes something like 15, The time attack menu isn't any better either. From one time attack level, you cannot access the previous or next, you have to exit to the menu and manually select it. And there's an incredibly long ~5 second countdown before each time attack attempt, where the levels range from 6-15 seconds. That's waaaay too long of a countdown. Go look at Dustforce for how to do that countdown right, ugh. And you don't even start on "Go", you have to wait a second or so after that.\nThe game also sets its standards way too high for the shoddiness of the controls. Speedrun times are only barely possible after extensive practice and usually require some luck to not get the game to screw up in one way or another. The time attack challenges are also picky by milliseconds, way tighter than they have any right to be. There's no in-level indicator of collectibles or monsters killed, too, so you can never be sure if you missed something until the end. And the levels can go on pretty long your first time through.\nAlso there's a lives system which is completely out of place for how long the levels are, definitely.\nLevel 3 is an underwater level in an absolutely awful submarine thing, that has a huge hitbox and tiny bullets, and can only move up by hammering the space key. There's an instance in the level that is literally impossible to get past without taking damage near the end if you arrive at it from a fresh run (i.e. not after dying and reloading at a checkpoint) which is just beautiful. Honestly this level does nothing for the game anyways, I don't see why it exists.\nThe game runs out of ideas fairly quickly, as well. I've played through level 5, and while the first four levels all add at least something (well, not really level 3), all level 5 adds is... an incredibly irritating palette to create a darkness effect it does nothing with. There's no other new obstacles, it's very tedious and dull. I hope the last four levels at least have something else I'm really going to get bored.\nHonestly, the fact that the game is apparently pretty short might work in its favor. I'd hate it even more if I knew I had 20+ more levels to slog through as opposed to only 4.5 more (still have to speedrun level 5, whatever.) The time attack levels are, aside from their strictness, somewhat enjoyable though, 30 of them and they're all pretty short but usually toy with a decent idea, I've played half of them to gold medal status and all.\nI'll probably finish this game but I don't have to be a psychic to predict that my early judgment isn't going to change by the time I do complete it, there's no way to redeem this one.","February 6, 2015","false","9.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Would feel better playing in 10 minute chunks on mobile than longer sessions on PC.\n\nFrom what I can tell, you play as someone with a drinking problem who's chasing after someone who performed an intervention and took away all their booze. Movement is okay and responsive, you get a grappling hook to play around with, but the game doesn't really have any story and the seems a bit generic.\n\nI wouldn't recommend at the base price ($9.99), but maybe on a good sale if you're into the genre.","January 15, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's colourful, wacky, and cute.  There's a fair bit of variation between levels and the levels aren't overly long, so it's hard to get bored.  The music isn't bad, it's quite fun - but if you're replaying a level it does become a bit grating because the music itself is highly repetitive.  I like that the SeY bottles you collect are clearly placed, so you don't have to spend a lot of time searching them out, something I found annoying in other platformer games like this.\n\nI feel like the makers of the game probably really enjoyed making it and put in a lot of effort.\n\nWorth getting for the standard price, definitely get it on sale.","February 17, 2015","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main character was cute and the story is basically nothing besides a basic premise established the first level. There is no talking. I liked the japanese setting and the music fit the game. Every level was quite varied in look, and featured some sort of new obstacle. Most of the enemies were the same and were rather repeitive, with only 2 real boss fights. The game is super short being a little over 2 hours. There are collectible barrels and list of how many guys you killed for the level out of a certain number, but neither mattered. Once i realized collecting was worthless, I stopped wasting my time. This is Creavures game have the same problem, don't sprinkle collectibles if they literally don't help your character progress or do anything at all. I liked the slam jumping as a component, and the swinging was fun too. They were mechanics not really used in the game and they worked fine. I don't know why people were complaining about swinging or player control, they must have just been idiots that played a side-scrolling platformer without a gamepad, which is on them, not the game. I do wish they wouldn't have relied on the jump slam for every part and fighting every enemy. They make it the only way to hurt people without getting hurt, because swinging your sword is useless. So that means you spend the entire game jump slamming every enemy, which gets repetitive. Sometimes you throw the axe at birds, but thats it. There are throwing stars, which do no damage, and some bombs, but that's basically it. There was collision detection problems, as I would get hit approaching things or even if I landed over them or jumped before them. It was annoying how the game featured only partial controller support and numpad didn't work, as that would have given even more control. The final boss has this super stupid being chased scene where you have to keep slam jumping and swinging, but its stupid because of the analog stick, which you have to be holding to the right, to then switch and move down when you jump while pressing x, and then move back up. I died so many times because the game didn't register the analog stick down, all which could have been avoided with numpad use as an option. Also some levels are ok, but some parts are super stupid with checkpoints and are spaced wayyyyyyyyyyy too far apart. Also it makes no sense with the lives, how you have to restart, you should just get to restart from the last checkpoint like every other platformer since the year 2000 (this isn't mario anymore). So the final part is super stupid because of lack of checkpoints and analog stick. Also jumping shouldn't always have to be a 3 part movement with x and down and square, it just overcomplicates thing. Gameplay, shortness, and repetition weight this samurai down.  7/10.","March 5, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At all?\nIt occasionally toys with a few decent platforming ideas, I guess. The graphics are passable.\n\n...\n\nThat's... about it. There's not much else to redeem it.\nFor starters, the music is godawful and the sound FX even worse - I had to mute the FX because they gave me a headache, they're that bad. If the problems ended there maybe I'd be okay with it.\nGood thing the game's just shoddily put together as a whole.\nFirst, bugs. Enemies sometimes don't seem to take damage; have had to land 5 hits on enemies that normally take 2, and I have no clue why. As well, the springs sometimes decide to send you flying in not quite the right direction. Usually you need to be holding an arrow to even have a chance of going to the right spot, but even then it's not 100% you'll get where you need to go. And I've gotten stuck/forced to restart levels in combat scenarios by killing the last enemy too quickly such that it doesn't trigger the battle's end.

If you like dying 24/7 play this game but otherwise save yourself and dont BUY THIS GAME.","March 28, 2014","false","2.9"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","0"

But certainly not 15,- currency alright. I've played one session and then had enough (uninstalled). I really hate it when you have to collect stuff to get 100%, but then tere are passages where you only have one chance to reach something. Which is the case with this game as well.","December 15, 2013","false","0.9"," 6 of 28 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","6","28","0","0"

Still can't clearly tell if it's worth $12 now (or $15 at full price), but the game's fun so far. It's kind of a hack-n-slash action platformer, with some precision platforming thrown in for good measure. Enemies start getting badass, though early on you're wondering what damage can they do. It is by no means easy, nor difficult. Lots of stuff to collect, so you can easily play levels again as well.\n\nThe really good part is the graphics/visuals. The water reflections? Oh my...amazing. Soundtrack is not too bad too.\n\nIn the end, this is kinda like an "easy to love" action platformer.","December 6, 2013","true","2.8"," 35 of 98 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","35","98","0","0"
