The controls are terrible even if I could have remapped the buttons or the joystick axis, which wasn't even an option. The tank is the best thing about the art and that's not saying much. I don't know why this was done in a custom engine instead of literally anything else available. The physics are atrocious, with hitboxes that do not even remotely agree with the graphics, and I finally gave up when I fell through the world and never hit a kill plane despite waiting for over five minutes.\n\nThe level design is beyond bad and is something I would have done better at than when I was doodling on paper back in grade school. Blind death jumps everywhere with no indication of what you're about to get into, and the 3d platforming is a cruel joke, only made immeasurably worse by the abysmal camera angles that this game inflicts upon you.\n\nThe music is the best part of the game in that it's merely acceptable rather than torturous trash.\n\nThis is the first game I've purchased on Steam that made me want a refund. At least when I was gifted Bad Rats I knew exactly what I was getting into accepting it.\n\nNow I feel sorry for my two brothers, whom I gifted copies of this game on the hopes that it would be at least enjoyable.\n\nI think I would rather play Blaster Master 2 for a full weekend on loop than ever sully my monitor with this "game's" presence again.","May 1, 2015","false","1.2"," 60 of 78 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","60","78","9","3"

Stock: 4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Am7/","218 products in account","¡I played this game for about 35 minutes and i have to say i enjoyed it quite a lot, so i'll make a honest review of it!\n\nBasically, it is a very good TRIBUTE to Blaster Master using a lot of it's design choices and taking some alternate routes to modernize and make the game more accesible for new generations, the developer has made it clear that it is a tribute, and a pretty good one, i have to say.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are not bad, but they could use some polish, especially in the textures department. I understand the game goes for a retro inspired look, but even Blaster Master had gorgeous graphics for it's time, perhaps the developer could try to mimic these textures, that would be appreciated in future updates.\n\nMusic: I didn't find the music to be bad, not good either, it is not the strongest aspect of the game, but i haven't found a song that became tiresome... It could be a lot more memorable though (Like the original game's soundtrack)\n\nGameplay: The part i liked the most is the gameplay, and what a shame it is that a lot of people could put down this game solely based on the reviews i've read. Guys, sincerely i had fun, it is an enjoyable experience, the platforming is entertaining (especially after you get some of the upgrades) and the changes in gameplay style (the game offers a sidescrolling and 3d tank view, and the same for the human driving it.) are a welcome breath of fresh air. I never encountered a part where the gameplay was a bother (some jumps are harder than others, but i saw that in Blaster Master too!).\n\nWhat i liked:\n\n+ Mantains the retro style gameplay, the challenge, the feeling of loneliness and the mystery of the original game.\n+ Expands on these concepts with new ideas, 3d enviroments and responsive controls\n+ The developer put the Hover ability (a very useful one that you used to get in the final half of the game) almost at the start, which for me is a big plus, because i love it and it makes the game a lot more enjoyable.\n\nWhat i DIDN'T like:\n\n- The textures are not appealing, the enviroments look a little bit dull.\n. A minor complain: The enemies have no animations, they just jump/shoot at you (I think this was a choice made to mimic the original enemies in Blaster Master, but i think that it looks a little bit... awkward and overly simple.\n- The music (which was a BIG part of Blaster Master) is not memorable at all, sorry, but it could use a big overhaul.\n- I would have loved to play at a higher resolution, or remap the keys, which at the current version, is not possible.\n- I loved the story of Blaster Master, i think the story could be a stronger part of this game too.\n- The bosses of the original game where amazing, in Helena the 3rd, i couldn't find any boss fight at all, and i think that's one of the achilles heels of the game. It was very dissapointing to be honest.\n\nI didn't fell through the floor, maybe it was pure luck, i've read reviews of people that had this issue, so i hope it is promptly fixed. BUT i did found a game-breaking glitch... The hover ability is bugged, absolutely broken. I won't say how, because that would RUIN the experience for other players. I found a way to refill the hover everytime i pressed a button, so PLEASE, PLEASE fix that! I could get to places i shouldn't have because of this issue, and in a Metroidvania game this is fatal! (If the developer wants more information about this, feel free to contact me, i will give all the details about this bug)\n\nOverall, for 5 bucks (i got this game even cheaper in an indiegala bundle so check that out!) the game is awesome for the price, i loved it and would like to see updates to it, i consider myself a fan of the original Blaster Master, and this game almost hits the notes, so keep up the good work guys!","July 12, 2015","true","1.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

I'd love to see this project go somewhere but seems it was most likely abandoned. I actually just played it for about a half an hour outside of steam and while going to press escape, hit 'F1' to find dev tools for anyone who might be insterested.. To the actual devs, GET TO WORK! .. And lower the price! This is more like a pre-alpha; you're waaaay overcharging. I can't say I recommend this title at all. And it's sad because I was actually really excited for this. The two things I hate most about this game are the 'nerf-like' look of the bullets. Like working with a FPS templete in the Unreal Engine that has a completely empty layout. Secondly, the enemies! Seriously, those geodudes just hopping at you? I mean, come on.. Aiming while on foot, better aiming in 3rd person, these are a few noteable annoyances as well but the first two really get on my nerves. Thing is, I always thought the Blaster Master series was interesting, but I never wanted to play it because of how restricted it felt. Today these restrictions have been lifted and to limit yourselves to what this is is really a disservice to the dream of making this game in the first place as well as the buyers. In no way is this worth $5. While playing I was thinking, "wow, this was $2?". Seeing that I'd mistaken and it was $5 I just couldn't believe that.","February 17","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I used the gamepad which used one joystick for moving, one for aiming, one trigger for jumping, and one trigger for shooting.\n\nThe depth perception in the 3D mode while jumping is a little tricky since you sometimes need to jump up or down and the camera didn't help much with that, so sometimes it was just a jump and hope you land in the right spot.\n\nThe A.I. enemies are very basic, they run straight for you and if they touch you it hurts. The first enemies can only jump, but some enemies can shoot soon after.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the 30 minutes or so I played to test the game out, and I plan to play more in the future to see all the cool upgrades the tank gets, and different guns the human gets.\nFor my money, I'd give this game a 8/10 for price and enjoyment.","May 1, 2015","true","0.5"," 13 of 38 people (34%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","34","13","38","2","0"
