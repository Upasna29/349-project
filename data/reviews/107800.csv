With it's addictive puzzle/physics gameplay, and awesome soundtrack Rochard is just one of those indie games that needs to be played even if you are not into indie games. Your main use of interacting with the world around you is with the G-Lifter, much like the gravity gun in Half life 2 you can accomplish puzzles and defeat enemies with this neat little tool. The story is also what makes this game immersive, and want you to keep playing. It mixes a blend of puzzle solving with action so you never get bored. You play as John Rochard who is a miner and he and his team of miners are not having much luck when it comes to finding Turbinium a valuable resource in the game that is worth a lot apparently......until one day!

It's a really fun 3D platformer with physic puzzles, time/gravity manipulation, and a whole lot of action. You play a humble hero with moderate abilities tinkering with gravity-gun-like devices in an outer-space cargo containment center. Playing with the mouse and keyboard is fine but, in my opinion, Rochard plays best with a 360 controller, a beer, a couch, and some friends around. It has a fairly shallow learning curve and anyone can jump into it at any stage. It took me 2 days to beat, we were sad to see it end, but I just recently bought the expansion pack DLC so I cant wait to try that out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/107800/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Rochard is a sci-fi platform game which was initially released on the PlayStation 3 network in 2011, but was eventually ported to he PC later in that year.  The game  revolves around taking control of gravity, and using the gravity gun called the G-Lifter. This is used to manipulate objects around the levels.  This game has it all, increasingly challenging environmental puzzles, action, a rich story line and plenty of humor.\n\nThe game play is a two dimensional side scrolling platformer that takes place in three dimensional scenes. You work your way through the environments completing a series of puzzles and combat encounters.  You are able to change the gravity in the room very easily at just the press of a button. All of the puzzles are easy enough for you to not get stuck on them for ages, but hard enough so that you can't just stroll into a room and instantly be able to figure it out. It hits the sweet spot just right.\n\nThe graphical fidelity is very pleasing, it has a nice art style which works well with this type of game. All of the character models look well polished and has brilliant animation. The voice acting is also top notch here too, something a fair few games manage to fall down on.\n\nWhile the single player story mode took me about five hours to complete; I felt as if it managed to fulfill its potential in that time. There is also some DLC available for a very cheap price which includes four new challenging puzzle levels. Granted there is more of an emphasis on the puzzle solving as apposed to the combat, but even for the most experienced puzzle platforming players you'll find them difficult. I did have to check out the walkthrough because I was stumped at times.\n\nThis is a really well ported game, I didn't have any technical problems, you are able to play in higher resolutions and the game does work with the keyboard and mouse, however it is highly recommended you use a controller with these types of games.\n\nI would recommend Rochard to people who really enjoy the puzzle platforming genre, people expecting an action packed side scrolling shooter will probably not find the thrill they are looking for. But if you want a couple hours of figuring out puzzles in a sci-fi environment, you may as well try Rochard\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's got beautiful 2.5D graphics, meaning that gameplay is strictly east/west, but the background recedes in beautiful 3D depth and give an illusion of greater space. Sort of like Trine, but deeper and prettier.\n\nRochard also has a good story, told through cutscenes and voiceover.\n\nThe main gameplay mechanic is a gravity gun; you manipulate the environment around you with this one device to solve puzzles, clear passages and fight bad guys. There are other twists, too, like gravity manipulation.\n\nAlthough I admire Rochard, it wasn't for me. I found that some of the puzzles required more timing finesse than I cared to put up with. Still, I give Rochard a thumbs up, because it's a very good entry in the platformer genre. It's made with great attention to detail, sports a low price tag, and there's a free demo so you can try before you buy.

D:\n- The story is clichéd. However, it does not matter because games do not always have to be original and groundbreaking in every aspects to be fun. You have to fight and stop the corrupt corporate mastermind who is trying to take over the universe, or something like that; the story flows and fits just fine with overall tone of the game and the execution is also great.\n\nCONS:\n- I really can't think of any cons.\n\nFinal Remarks:\nEven though Rochard is categorized as indie genre, all work is done by professionals and you will know what I mean once you get your hands on this game. You should expect Bastion kind of quality minus a big budget and Warner Bros..\n\nDLC Review:\nHard Times\nSoundtrack and Artbook\n\n.

It's a platformer with logical and action elements, the puzzles usually revolve around shifting gravity or moving the objects. All three gameplay types are perfectly blended together, the game flows very well and you don't get stuck often. Because of that, some people may consider it easy. That's why there's a DLC with higher difficulty. For me, it was very pleasant to be able to play without getting frustrated, which is a downside of many great and challenging games.\n\nAs for the graphical side, I can't complain. Rochard is somewhat cartoonish, but very pleasant to look at and rich, colorful. Music and sound effect are well-done too. But what I really love is the main character. I grew sick of the manly, model-like and virtuous main characters who lack character that appear in many current games . John Rochard, on the other hand, is a man around 40 whose figure is far from perfect. He is funny, but not in an obtrusive way. His voice acting is great and he's very easy to identify with. Even the other characters are well-done, all are very believable.\n\nEven though I think the game is worth the original price, if you are not sure whether to buy it, wait for a sale.

The combat has a lot of depth to it because there are multiple ways of taking down enemies like reflecting bullets with objects or throwing objects at enemies or you can just use bullets or missiles. No method of combat is overpowered enough to use all the time but I've noticed some methods are better in some situations for example I now know not to use the assualt rifle when surrounded by multiple enemies in multiple spots but to just reflect the bullets with objects until there are a small amount of enemies standing then I can easily kill them by throwing the object at them then throwing a grenade or shooting a missile.\n\nThe graphic style consists of a nice colour palet of faint blues and greys and strong yellows and oranges, the chatacter models are slightly over exaggerated but hold lots of detail. Textures are for the most part high quality and there are some brilliant lighting effects throughout the game. Rochard also ran at 60 fps at maximum settings on a 650 so optimisation wise the port over from ps3 is good and you're more than capable to play with mouse and keyboard however I preferred to use a 360 pad because I found that it was easier to multi-task moving, firing and appling zero gravity on the 360 controller.\n\nThe only issues I had with the game are that it should of been about two hours shorter because it became a bit of a chore to play at the end. Also in my opinion the plot is a bit lackluster but in Rochard's defence the platform genre isn't known for their gripping complex plots even the greats like Fez and Rayman Origins barely focused on the plot however Rochard does but the plot just isn't very good. Whatever I have to say about the story I still liked the space mining theme because it reminds me of the show "Red Dwarf".\n\nLastly the game brings in new items and abilities often and if you haven't mastered each mechanic in the short amount of time you might fall behind. Sometimes I found myself being overwhelmed with the options I had in combat situations like whether I should throw a grenade, use zero gravity, fire bullets or missiles or block myself with an object, this can be a sign of two many powers and abilities in a short space of time because the player hasn't gathered enough experience with each weaopn or abilty to know when to use each of them at the right time.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with my purchase of around £3 (I can't really remember the price I paid but it was one sale at the time), anyway I got more enjoyment out of the game than If I had used that money to buy a Mcdonalds burger and coke.","November 30, 2013","true","7.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Although they all look the same, it adds a degree of replayability to the game for those who like to get every achievement in games.\n\n- The soundtrack is very enjoyable and always fits the situation perfectly.\n\n- The voice acting is decent, especially that of the main character, John Rochard, voiced by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem himself.\n\nOverall, it's worth buying, although wait for a sale.

You play as Rochard, an asteroid miner whose team makes an unusual discovery while digging.  Of course, the bad guys move in and try to claim it for themselves and eliminate you and your pals.  Rochard has to fight back using his G-lifter gun.  Using the G-Lifter (aka gravity gun) takes some practice, but it's actually quite fun once you get the hang of it.  Once the G-Lifter is upgraded to also shoot laser bolts and bombs it's even better!  Also, the game has two gravity settings: regular-G and low-G, and the player can switch between them at will, which is great because it changes the game's physics to your advantage.\nNavigating the different levels is a challenge.  Sometimes you really need to think to figure out what to do to overcome the obstacles in your way (force fields, laser turrets, environmental hazards, enemies, barriers, etc.).  But even when what you need to do is obvious, the execution is often tough.  Sometimes it requires several tries to get it right...enough to be challenging, but not enough to where the game bogs down and becomes frustrating.\nLastly, the game has fun, cartoony graphics with nice visuals and animations.  It's also quite funny at times -- for instance, the Sky Cops are hilarious ("I TOTALLY need a manicure!" Haha!)  Anyhow, I'm having a great time playing it.  Highly recommended!\nP.S.

Since the dawn of the digital age, man has struggled with crates. Inexplicably, video games contain about a hundred times more crates than exist in the known universe, some to be pushed, some to be broken, and some to arbitrarily block your progress. Rochard is, first and foremost, a game of crates. There's shooting, there's some cute writing, but there's mainly a lot of crates.\n\nIf you're like me and have been wondering what the hell kind of name "Rochard" is, it's the name of the pot-bellied protagonist, John Rochard. A blue-collar asteroid miner down on his luck, you control the surprisingly spry fellow on a day when everything goes to hell. Your main tool in this adventure is the G-Lifter, a gravity gun knockoff that can lift crates, drop crates, launch crates, and do some other stuff like double as an assault rifle and grenade launcher. You'll also get control over gravity for much of the game, and the interplay between your crate gun and gravity manipulation is the basis of most of the puzzles.\n\nGenerally your challenge is getting from point A to point B by stacking crates, swapping fuses, and finding ways around force fields and chasms. The force fields are actually a nice touch, with some blocking organic matter, some inorganic, and some energy like weapon fire. They're color-coded to function, and my favorite puzzles are figuring out how to get yourself and the items you need through networks of force fields. Still, I have to stress that a lot of your puzzling will depend on crates, so if the stacks and see-saws in Half-Life 2 burned you out, you might not last long with Rochard.\n\nThe other major part of the game is combat. Rochard is way more combat-heavy than I expected, with most puzzles needing to be cleared of enemies and turrets before working out the solution. Your G-Lifter can switch to pew pew mode with the touch of a button, and crates make very deadly weapons here, so combat is at least integrated pretty seamlessly and offers plenty of entertaining options. You'll get weapon and life upgrades as you progress, and there are collectibles to find if you need a little extra puzzling, but most of the game is very linear and offers the same challenges in mounting degrees.\n\nLook, do you like crates? That's really all this boils down to. Rochard looks, sounds, and plays really well for a platformer, but everything revolves around crates and what you can accomplish with them, and at this point in our lives I'm not entirely convinced we really need much more of that. It's a solid game that'll last you 3-4 hours (plus some additional challenges) so as long as you know what you're in for, it'll fill your crate quota.","February 5","true","3.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","6","8","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zyrxil/recommended/107800/","Zyrxil","Zyrxil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zyrxil/","580 products in account","Rochard is a physics puzzle platformer, which came out a few years ago, long before the current glut of physics puzzle platformers. In retrospect, Rochard is obviously an older game with many design flaws that were the result of not being able to learn the mistakes of other titles in the genre.\n\nFirst of all, the game's positives: Rochard has fairly good graphics and 90s cartoon art style. The protagonist is not a faceless muscular commando, but a working stiff with a potbelly and some personality. The supporting characters are similarly varied, and the entire cast has decent voice acting. The writing is nothing special, but the style of story does fit well with the cartoony art aesthetic, though any plot twists are obvious from a mile away.\n\nThe problems with the game are that it focuses on both combat and puzzle solving, but does neither very well. Combat is done using a combination Gravity Gun/Laser Blaster against mercernaries or bots. Enemy AI is simplistic, reminiscent of very early console platformers. There's very little challenge in that area, so you would expect something more from the puzzle department. Unfortunately, that is not the case, as puzzles are equally simplistic, never reaching the level of mind-bending challenge that a dedicated puzzle game like Portal or The Swapper provides. So what's left? Nothing. No high score mechanic, and no exploration. There's a barebones badly executed attempt at Metroidvania elements for collectables which forces some backtracking, but that's not at all enjoyable due to lack of fast movement abilities, and lack of enjoyable combat.\n\nAll in all, Rochard is simply less than the sum of its parts.","June 24, 2014","false","2.3"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","0"

This was one of the earliest games to utilize the Unity Engine. It benefits from it, and will feel current for many years.\n\nHighlights\nWithout its charming indie feel and homely 80s personality Rochard would've been just another, slightly above average, platformer. But some really symbiotic design and gameplay elements elevate this to something a little better than the rest.\n\n* Great characters that didn't even need to have personality but were given tons\n* Incredible voice acting for a game of this budget\n* Above average lighting and background design\n* Fairly challenging at times, brain required\n* A good, 80s-feel soundtrack\n\nMistakesPlatformers are relatively simple in their design and tend to need combinations of good mechanics, unique or useful collectibles or alternative ways of solving things. Rochard suffers from a lack of these and often feels bland and samey.\n\n* Very annoying AI and level manipulation at time, repeating the same mistake a few times is jarring when it's the game engines' fault\n* Mechanics, despite working well, feel repetitive after so long\n* Bland and slow paced at times\n\nRecommendationsRochard clocks in at 6 hours play time and doesn't have much re-playability, but it's relatively cheap; £7.99/8.99€/$9.99 at the time of review and it goes on sale for up to -90% regularly on Steam, so is definitely a buy at less than 1 Buck, Quid or Euro. It's available on mobile and a ton of other platforms and comes up in bundles, so look out for it being cheaper somewhere else if you care about a few cents.\n\n* The Hard Times DLC is pretty difficult and challenging, and only adds challenge maps. It's probably only worth considering buying after completing the full game.\n* The voice of John Rochard is played by Jon St. John ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_St._John ), who also helped voice elements of Duke Nukem, Dota 2, Sonic Adventures, Guild Wars 2 and Amnesia.","May 25, 2015","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What I mean is that when you start to get to the later levels it seems like it's never going to end. It seems like it lasted much longer than the 6 hours it took me to beat it. However I suppose that isn't entirely a bad thing because most games it seems are too short nowadays.\n\nRochard takes a great idea and turns it into a great game. Your beam gun and eventually laser attack gun are a lot of fun to use to figure out puzzles. I never really found the game challenging. Pretty easy actually, but still fun. Most indie game purposely try to be hard it seems nowadays so having a fun casual experience was a welcome change. It isn't too super easy though. Some parts are a little challenging. The music is pretty good and the sound effects are good, and the voice acting is great. The effects are done well and the game looks really nice too. Overall it looks more like a AAA game than a indie game. If you want a real challenge get the hard times dlc.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/107800/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","It's a very good title if you like physics-based mechanics, but the game doesn't exactly involve a lot of physics puzzles. For me, that was a good thing, because I am personally not a huge fan of pure physics puzzles games. They tend to feel kind of shallow.\n\nRochard's two biggest uses of physics are A) Catapaulting heavy objects on top of enemies to kill them, and B) a wide variety of anti-gravity navigation situations.\n\nEnemies can be shot directly. Or you can throw heavy crates on top of them. Or---when applicable---you can break/pull the floor out from underneath them so that they fall to their death or land in an electric field. You can hold a crate in front of you at such an angle that enemy laser fire is deflected off the crate and ricochets into other enemies (but this requires a little bit of luck and is hard to execute intentionally). You can use your gravity gun to redirect mounted lasers into enemies to kill them. Later in the game, just like Half-Life 2, you can power up the grav gun to pick up the enemies themselves and throw them. You also receive three grenade types throught the game: a grenade that bounces and has a timed explosion, a grenade that sticks to a surface and has a detonated explosion, and a grenade that sticks to a surface and causes whatever it's touching to float into the air. Experimenting with all the different ways to kill enemies is one of the funnest aspects of the game, and successfully killing them with crates or other environmental hazards does not get old.\n\nThe game's puzzles often involve "switch" puzzles that change the colors of force fields. Blue lets everything pass through except crates/fuses. Red lets everything pass except for Rochard. Orange lets everything pass except for gunfire/explosions. White does not let anything pass. You will often have to exchange fuses and flip switches to create a path for Rochard or other objects through a maze of force fields. Other puzzle elements include gravity reversal switches (i.e. flipping between walking on the floor and ceiling), elevators, and doors. Often you will need to use crates and fuses to complete a puzzle and you'll have to figure out how to make a short supply of these objects go a long way. Suffice to say, the puzzle variation is great. The puzzle difficulty ranges anywhere between cakewalk and moderate. (With the exception of the Hard Times bonus levels. Those get much trickier.)\n\nThe anti-gravity stuff is pretty fun to play with too. If anti-gravity is on, you can pick up a crate, jump into the air, then launch the crate to send yourself flying through the air in the opposite direction. This includes jumping and firing a crate at the floor to launch yourself higher. One upgrade to the grav gun gives you an ability called "G-Swing". If zero G is on, this ability lets you jump into the air, then latch your grav beam onto certain fixed objects and slingshot yourself around the environment.\n\nThe only complaints I can make about this game are as follows:\n\n1) In the very late levels when the difficulty starts to spike, the game starts to periodically break one of the golden rules of game design, which is this: "Don't subject the player to a challenge that they could not possibly overcome or recognize the solution to without dying first." The primary way the game does this is through "think fast" type situations. There will definitely be times when you'll walk through a door and so much sh*t comes at you all of a sudden that you get boned before you have time to figure out what is even happening.\n\n2) Skyler's fake English accent. No offense to Lani Minella. She's worked on a lot of games, and I'm sure she's great to work with. But there are  plenty of real English people in the world, and there is nothing distinctly English about Skyler's character. She could have just as easily been American. The team should have hired someone who actually HAS or can actually DO an English accent or just had Lani use her normal American voice. I hate to be so blunt to nice people doing honest work, but that accent was.... quite bad.\n\n3) The grav gun has a tendency to aim-correct toward objects the player is PROBABLY aiming at but are targeting just a little too wide. In a lot of cases, especially early in the game, this is nice and makes the gameplay a lot more slick. However, later in the game the screen gets super cluttered with enemies, turrets, crates, bots, and platforms that you'll find yourself depserately trying to target X with your beam, but you keep latching onto objects A, B, C, D, E, F, and G instead. When this gets paired up with a "think fast" type situation, it leads to a certain degree of annoyance. Thankfully, this only happens a few times, and mostly in the late game.\n\nA good little title that deserves more respect.","March 16, 2014","true","9.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Puzzles usually aren't a challenge, but are fun to do. I thought combat was fun, since you could (after a point) either fire your gun or hit enemies with objects you pick up with the G-Lifter. There are hidden collectables for you to go back and find if you miss some, but that's just a staple of these kinds of games. The story is interesting enough; your character, Rochard, is easily the best personality in the game. The visuals and atmosphere are well done. Overall, it's just a really fun platformer, and I hope there's a sequel some day.","December 24, 2012","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't normally play platformers so I was a little skeptical that I'd enjoy it. After 1-2 minutes I was hooked (hah!) on this game. Firstly, the game looks great, the backgrounds are wonderfully done and the visuals always seem to be exactly right. As far as mechanics go, the gravity mechanics are flawlessly done. The puzzles are intuitive yet challenging. The combat mechanics/gun mechanics are also great. I played with a controller but I imagine that'd it'd be just as easy to use KB/M to play. Lastly, the voice acting and storyline are great. There's something definitely PG about the dialogue and the quests but you don't really care, you laugh along with Rochard's corny jokes and the campy dialogue. The only downside is not really a downside in my opinion; there's no sandbox mode, the zones are a tad short and I doubt the game has much replay value. This is not really a downside in my opinion insofar as not every game has to be an infinite task (Skyrim, Etc). This game starts and ends at just the right time, leaving you satisfied and you always seem to be perfectly frustrated when the game adds a new element to spice things up. This game is a breath of fresh air and likely unlike anything you currently have installed.","December 29, 2013","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It kinda reminds me of Trine, just not as good. It's a decent game, I will admit, but it does have some lacking areas. The gameplay is pretty fun, how you can change the gravity of any area to help you through a puzzle, and the G-gun is cool to play around with, but the puzzles are very basic and easy and the combat is underdeveloped, for lack of a better word. Although, the game does have a pretty rockin' soundtrack that goes along with it.\nAll in all, I wouldn't suggest this game to everyone. Its one of those games where you really have to be a fan of the genre to really enjoy it.

It created little fanfare when it was released, and it hasn't gotten much publicity on Steam since, but it's a solid and entertaining little physics platformer.\n\nIt starts off a little slow, with Rochard's abilities being quite limited, and the rock blaster barely able to fire 3 bolts in a row. By the end of the game, though, you will be zipping around in low gravity, blasting turrets in mid-air, while launching sticky bombs at enemies, and throwing their corpses at their friends. In the beginning, it might seem like combat is limited, but sweet merciful crap does it get fun by the end or what.\n\nThe music is very well-done, although unfortunately you rarely ever hear it. The song that plays in the casino is amazing, and it made me glad that I bought the soundtrack version. The graphics are also well done, using the Unity engine, although some of the texture work is a little shoddy.\n\nThe puzzles are also top-notch. There were only a few that genuinely stumped me for a while, but they all at least require thought and a little bit of planning. Sometimes I evem got the feeling that my solution was not the one the developers intended, and I love when I'm able to do that.\n\nControls on the 360 gamepad are solid as well, for the most part. There were a few tricky sections where I needed to aim the right analog stick to the right while pressing A and holding down LT, though, which required a little digital (get it? fingers) acrobatics. I didn't have any real issues with it, but I could see it being a problem for some others. I imagine keyboard and mouse controls would work just as well, if not better, but this game seemed to scream "360 CONTOLLER" to me.\n\nThe voice acting is really the only sore spot in this game (other than the hilariously flamboyant Skypolice), but as the tone of the game is less-serious, it came across more as funny than anything. Some of the dialog is pretty hilarious as well, but I won't spoil anything.\n\nOverall, I rather enjoyed this game. The gameplay didn't devolve into rote pattern memorization, the combat was very fast-paced and fun, the puzzles were clever, and the sound/music added to the whole experience.\n\nI recommend picking it up. It's a game that almost anyone can enjoy.","May 31, 2013","true","5.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I hope that my arguments against this game will be justified and fair.\n\nThis game is a puzzle-platformer most of the time and this is one of the better elements done in Rochard. Puzzles and mechanics aren't clever or original (main gimmick is a gravity gun and lowering/increasing gravity force), but most of the time they are nonintrusive. I also liked some sections where you are performing Tarzan using mentioned gun. This was pretty fun.\n\nUnfortunately, all other important aspects fall flat for me. ESPECIALLY combat. Sometimes you are forced to shoot some dudes. I can understand that it was added to vary the pacing, but at the end it was implemented very badly on many levels. One, ludonarrative dissonance. Your protagonist is presumably a nice and caring guy, yet you gunning down mercenaries like heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Two, gunplay is pretty boring and unsatisfying. You basic gun makes only minor "pew pew pew" and most of the time shooting you feel empty. Three, enemies are morons. They literally get crushed by the slow moving elevator without any reaction. "Moving away from the lowering platform? Nah, I will stay here! Nothing important to consi..." <Dead>. This is a overall how they function. Expect idiots everywhere.\n\nStory is extremely problematic. You can see first plot twist from mile away and game expects you to be shocked. Dramatic scenes are made laughable thanks to poor and repetitive 3D animations. Characters are really bland and except for the main protagonist, they have no personality whatsoever. I'm a person that can ignore story problems if characters are likeable, but this is not the case. Mid-game they are trying to set up the "big reveal" at the end. Of course there are no actual hints or information what's going on, game only insist that there is a MASSIVE revelation down the line. After pretty weak bossfight at the end of the game you will learn the truth! SPOILER ALERT You get nothing. To sum up: uninteresting characters, no actual story development, weak villain, no pay-off. Nothing.\n\nGraphics look kind of nice, but level design is uninspired (many annoying forcefields of different kinds that block you, block things you carry or block your shots) and art assets are reused very often. best looking locations are to ones that are more unique - Third level for example.  Game has also a VERY bad habit of not telling you important things. Example: "Great! You found an upgrade station!", "What does it do?", "I don't know!". Other example: You are expected to lower gravity in one room to reach higher ledge in one of the early levels. I was stuck there for few minutes, I didn't know that I can do that. No button prompt, no voice information. This could be understandable in more basic game, but in that moment I was thinking that I'm getting a puzzle wrong. Until I checked the control scheme and discovered the button for gravity change (note that effect of button press is not instant), I was painfully stuck\n\nOverall, I would call Rochard an unpleasant experience. Puzzles are okayish, but combat, story and questionable omissions in basic game design make this one part boring, second part infuriating and third part plain mediocre. I simply cannot recommend it. People may like this game, I don't know how, but that's good for you.","November 12, 2014","false","8.3"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","22","43","0","1"

You can utilise the items around you, using the gravity gun (normally cargo boxes) to either jump on, kill bad guys, duck under.. well, you get the idea?\n\nYou can also control gravity, once you've located the gravity generators.

Again, just don't take it too seriously.\n\nI have to admit, there's been a couple of times when I've had to scratch my head and actually think about how to solve a problem. Moving fuses though certain types of electric fields, or trying to avoid a large laser. Some of the puzzles are time based, like jumping from moving platform to moving platform, and I can imagine some people loosing their rag very easily.\n\nI've found, personally, that playing with mouse/keyboard much easier than a gamepad, as I feel I have more control with the mouse to move the gun about, but each player has their preferences overall.\n\nMusically, it's nice to listen to.

It's definitely not the longest game out there, but the length is quite reasonable for the price.\n\nThe game mechanics focus around your G-Lifter, which combines a gravity gun, laser rifle, and grenade launcher into one device as well as gravity manipulation.  You will unlock grenade types as you progress through the game as well as new abilities for the G-Lifter.  The pacing is quite good and new mechanics are introduced at regular intervals.\n\nNone of the puzzles are terribly complicated and shouldn't take much thought to complete.  Finding secrets requires a bit more thought and use of advanced game mechanics but are all still pretty easy.  It's definitely not as much of a thinking game as other puzzle platformers like Portal.  That said, it's still quite enjoyable, and I think the game could easily become frustrating if the puzzles were made too difficult.\n\nOn the negative side, the voice acting is terrible.  It's not Two Worlds bad, but it's close.  The writing isn't much better, but at least the story is decent.\n\nThe DLC is a short series of challenge rooms and much more of a challenge than the puzzles in the main game.  While very short it is quite enjoyable and satisfying to make it through them, especially if you can manage to do it without dying.\n\nIf you like puzzle platformers or physics platformers, you should play this game!","April 21, 2013","true","16.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Rochard is a 2D physics-based puzzle-solving and combat game.  Nothing it's doing is entirely novel, but gameplay feels good and does a good job of co-opting Half-Life 2's gravity gun while mixing it with variable environmental gravity levels.  The weapons that you eventually acquire are satisfying, but combat is at its best when you use objects and enemies' weapons against them instead of attacking directly.  Likewise, puzzles are fairly straightforward but will sometimes surprise you.  There are a fair few very memorable moments throughout the game.\n\nThe whole experience  is imbued with some pretty decent personality and humor; you've seen better characters and more comical narratives, but what's here certainly helps the game to stand out.  It's also filled with beautiful, atmospheric environments and scored with a gorgeous and diverse soundtrack.  Rochard is pretty delightful for its entire 6-odd hours; I definitely recommend it.","September 16, 2012","true","6.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

None of the puzzles are demanding, with the challenge resting on your patience to go through the same thing over and over again.

More to follow, but I want players to know about this game while it's still SO cheap.\n\nAmazing graphics, pretty good story, great voice acting, stellar music. This is a thinking player's game, heavily involving physics. Gravity, and gravity control is a big part of this game, and so far using gravity to place and throw objects is used instead of traditional weapons. I must say, squashing bad guys with huge, heavy boxes, or grav-throwing explosives at them is FAR more satisfying than just....."bang". (Nothing wrong with "bang". I LIKE "bang".) And to grab an errant robot with a gravity beam, then smash it rapidly against opposing walls is oddly....calming.\n\nIf you typically avoid platformers, or like me, buy them expecting to fail, "rochard" may be your solution. Many, if not most, of the multitudinous puzzles seem to have more than one solution. One, the typical "brute force" sort, but also a much easier, more "scientific" one.\n\nVery good learning curve. Short, reasonable checkpoint intervals. AND a hero who looks and sounds much like so many of us! MOST importantly, this game is really a LOT of fuN!\n\nIf PORTAL was a platformer, it just might be "rochard".\n\nAt this price, WHILE it's this price, you owe it to yourself to at least take a look at the Store Page. What's to lose? $1.49 is all! ($2.09 with soundtrack & artbook.) At this price I have to give the HIGHEST possible recommendation.","April 20, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

It was in my Steam list because I apparently got it from Humble Bundle 6. Well it looked like an action-y physics puzzle platformer (think Trine) and I like that kind of thing so I went ahead and launched it.  I'm glad I did!\n\nThe game was enjoyable, accessible and pretty unique, mostly because there aren't a lot of entries in this genre. Despite the fact that the game flew under my radar, I found the art, effects and voice acting to be pretty top-notch for a game of this type. It's clear that the team loved about this game. It was short-ish, which is expected. About 6 hours. And the story has a fairly unique premise, but it gets kinda mucked up with some really stupid cliches. Despite that, I found Rochard himself to be the game's most lovable character. A rotund, twangy and kind space-miner.\n\nThe game spends most of its time allowing you to use a Half-Life 2 style Gravity Gun in many of the same ways Half-Life 2 does, but with a few twists, such as pairing that concept with low-gravity, and solving larger-scale platforming puzzles. It's shameless, but still different.\n\nThere's a lot of things that don't fit together with the game's theme... like how many people you actually end up just gunning down as cartoony cannon fodder... and the stupid native american mysticism subplot. Regardless of my complaints, I have nothing against Rochard and genuinely enjoyed my time with it.","May 27, 2014","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The plot, as well as the conversations during the game are boring.

Rochard is a puzzle platformer with Metroid/Castlevania influences. Just the way I like them. The puzzles are on the light side and really shouldn't take long for anyone to figure out. There's also quite a bit of combat to be found in this game, with multiple ways to take enemies out, thanks to your multi purpose gun. Along the way you'll be able to find (optional) upgrades and collectables. As far as I know the collectibles are just that, collectibles, and will not unlock anything.\nAn average gamer should finish this game in 3,5 hours I think, which is long enough in my opinion. The open ending suggests there will be a Rochard 2 someday.\nAlso, the graphics are cute and clean and the voice acting is a hit-and-miss.\nOther than that, it's a great game, like I said.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","January 19, 2012","true","4.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I did enjoy playing with the gravity and solving some of the puzzle presented. The puzzles weren't really challenging and in the end forgettable. After one point in the game you are given an item that makes the game entirely too easy that it isn't even a challenge and in result a real bore.

The blues music, gravity-manipulating gameplay, and Metroidvania-esque exploration of the opening quickly give way to a tired plot, repetitive puzzles, and a soundtrack that sounds like it could be pulled from any sci-fi game or movie without having any personality of its own. Worst of all, the game ends its generic, uninspired story with a cliffhanger for a sequel that may never materialize-not that I can say I'd be all that keen to play it if it ever did.

The story isn't too impressive, and seems rather stunted, but that's ameliorated some by the setting, which is delighfully reminiscent of the first Starcraft's blue-collar spacefaring culture. Lastly, due mainly to unfortunate timing and the PSN collapse of last year, the company behind this game nearly died, and a game this innovative deserves a purchase if only to keep them afloat.","October 17, 2012","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely worth it when on sale, maybe not quite at regular price.\n\nIt's not very long, and it generally is pretty easy, but it's well-made, has interesting mechanics, and is overall quite fun.  I found the "ancient Native American legend" bit of the storyline a little goofy, but that doesn't detract too much from the enjoyment of the game as a whole.  The look and feel of the design is great, the voice acting is quite good, and the music is enjoyable.\n\nSome might find the game too easy, but I like the feeling that I am making progress, so it didn't bother me that much.  It is a little short, but that just means that I enjoyed it enough to want more.  It's short enough that I'm not sure I would have paid full price for it, but on sale it was absolutely worth the money.\n\nMy biggest complaint actually has to do with the ending - if you die, the game has you restart from the last checkpoint, which works well throughout most of the game.  In the final battle, however, the last checkpoint comes before the fight starts, before the villain does his stereotypical villain monologue in a cut scene.  And there is no way to skip that cut scene.  I died several times before beating the final boss, which means that I had to sit and listen to that monologue over and over, punching buttons and hitting keys in hopes of skipping the damn thing.  Oddly, the same thing happens when the final credits begin to roll.  You had better enjoy that theme song, because you are going to have to listen to the whole thing - I could find no way of skipping the credit sequence.\n\nOverall, however, I quite enjoyed Rochard.  If you enjoy a good indie platformer with a heavy dose of puzzle solving, I recommend it, especially on sale.","November 12, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a perfectly functional game, everything works well and I don't recall any glitches.  Unfortunately, that's as far as I can praise it.\n\nThe puzzles start out very easy, and for the most part stay there.  There are some interesting mechanics, but they're never taken far enough to actually be interesting.  From beginning to end, you'll pretty much be solving the same few basic puzzles over and over again.  The gravity swinging is the best part of the game, but again it never goes beyond very basic use.\n\nCombat is a chore.  Point at the enemies, hold the attack button.  If you're feeling daring, throw a crate.  It's very easy and serves no purpose other than to pad out the game.\n\nRochard, the titular character, is a space redneck working for a mining company.  The game tries to present him as some heroic badass, but he's mostly just annoying.  It doesn't help that he has a groupie/love interest following after him, singing his praises.  The villain is a short German guy, and the vast majority of the enemies you'll be slaughtering throughout the game are flamboyant homosexual stereotypes.\n\nI don't consider any of this a spoiler, since from his very first appearance it is blatantly obvious that the German guy will turn out to be evil.\n\nThe game is functional.  A completely standard puzzle platformer that does nothing to stand out.  Puzzle-platformers are hardly in short supply these days; in a genre with so many excellent examples I really see no reason to ever play Rochard.\n\nThe DLC is the best part of the game by far.  The puzzles are actually somewhat tricky.  But again, they never go beyond fairly basic and the whole thing is quite short.  Not worth buying or playing the game for.","December 17, 2014","false","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No bugs that I could tell.  Finding all the secrets were pretty easy for the most part, but some may take a little thought.  All in all, a great side-scroller to bide your time and have fun with.

So having just bought the Soundtrack Edition of the game, I listened through the soundtrack first before playing the game. Yes, Space Debris is such a great track, but the rest of the soundtrack certainly didn't disappoint either; from the '90's 'Independence Day' feel of John's Theme, to the excellent Tangerine Dream techno-ambience of The Fight, the Rochard OST is so enjoyable from start to finish..........so what about the game itself?\n\nRochard is a light-hearted physics-based side scroller set in a future-grunge world of space mining. Playing as John Rochard, you use your grapple gun and anti-grav physics to overcome environmental obstacles and enemies.\n\nThe production of Rochard is top-notch and the physics superbly done. The game starts off easy enough and the first couple of levels act as tutorials easing the player into the physic-based system of the game. It's too early for me to say how the game pans out, but I think it's hardly going to disappoint from what I've experienced so far. Great characters and enjoyable cut-scenes, I'm genuinely looking forward to spending more time with John Rochard & friends.\n\nEdit:\n\nAs it turned out, Rochard was an immensely enjoyable game from start to finish. The game was lean with no padding. Checkpoints were frequent and positioned so there was rarely any grind to get a previous position after dying. The length of the game was also satisfying, never threatening to outstay its welcome.\n\nPlaying with a PS3 controller (360 mapped), the controls were very responsive and satisfying. There was also a good balance between combat and physics-based puzzles.\n\nThere are Gold badges to collect throughout the game. They don't contribute to any weapon upgrades, etc, but are positioned in the levels to add extra challenge for the obsessive collector. After beating the game, I find I can select individual levels to find badges I've missed which adds to the replay value. I'll probably enjoy playing through Rochard a couple of more times whilst patiently waiting for Episode II.\n\nAddictive gameplay, tight controls, challenging puzzles (never too hard), varied combat, collectables, cute characters with a great central eponymous hero:\n\n9/10.","April 26, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world and characters at first are very fun and engaging, but there's a lot of little things that really bug me about it. The plot is interesting but it's theming through mechanics is really poor and I ended up feeling really bad after killing the 70ish to 89th flamboyant cop or stupid pirate. If it's on sale 2 dollars is really good value for a solid gameplay experience, but the plot is just compelling enough to be really dissapointing and the ending feels like a stupid sequel bait that felt like an insult for playing.

It's definately worth it's price when on sale.\n\nThe combat is nice, the platforming is ok and the puzzles are somewhat easy, but it gives you good variety throughout the 5 hours or so campaign. The animations are good, the VA is weak but does its job and the soundtrack is very nice. The story is kind of irrelevant (and the ending is pretty unsatisfying), but for a platform game it's not a big deal. The AI sucks, with enemies shooting each other and standing unresponsive on top of grenades...but this is the only flaw that I have to point out.

The game tries to be a mix of puzzle game and platformer, but can't end up doing a very good job of either one. The puzzles are too simple and repetitive when they're present, and the platforming is oftentimes thoughtless. It's not necessarily that either element is too easy, but that they used no imagination in their execution, take no imagination to solve, and generally feel the same throughout the entire game.\nThe game would have received maybe a 5.5/10 if not for the story. Aside from a horrible case of purple prose and poor dialogue, it packs more cliches than I thought possible and plays them all straight, without any indication that the writers had any awareness of its laughability. The voice acting also really grated on my ears, and the only reason I finished the game is because I kept telling myself it had to get better eventually.\nIt didn't. I applaud the creators for their work because creating a game is no mean feat, and it took dedication to get this far. But if any of them should happen to read this review, I suggest focusing on one genre and doing it well, rather than trying to combine genres or elements of genres before you've learned what makes either of them work.\nI will not be recommending this to fans of platformers, puzzle-solvers, or puzzle-solving platformers. If you want a recommendation and don't mind a challenge and antiquated graphics, look up Defy Gravity on Steam instead.","June 8, 2014","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are likable and you can even get attached to them, which is always good in a story, but the plot seems like it was written by a child or someone on drugs. Makes no sense. You think things will eventually be explained but nope, never happens.\n\nThe game mechanics is interesting and well implemented. The game managed to be sufficiently entertaining for me to play through the entire thing, but just barely! the combat has some nice depth to it, with several ways to take the enemies out you're always trying new thing. The puzzles are boring. It follows the half life school of puzzle design, where attaching an extension cord to turn a machine on counts as solving a puzzle.

The story is interesting enough. You're Rochard, a backwater space miner who's down on his luck trying to bring his mining company to new sources of fuel. When they do finally strike the motherlode, Rochard and the crew discovers their find is far more valuable than they anticipated.\n\nUnfortunately, from that point, the story is pretty flat and predictable. The mechanics behind moving your 'weapon' are neat, and using anti-gravity in combination with moving heavy objects around is pretty seamless and fluid. Unfortunately, the puzzles are quite easy, but they did rectify some of this with the cheap DLC. Voice acting isn't half bad, nor is the music, but it's still not enough to get me to recommend this game to anyone but true puzzle fans.","June 9, 2014","false","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe one hit kills could be better overall and the upgrades disabled alltogether.

Its not super fast pased, but it is fun and enganging. The puzzles are tricky, but not impossible and how you resolve some certain situations can go any number of ways. The addition of force fields that block certain types of objects (organic (you+enemies), blasts, inanimate objects, really adds to the puzzle appeal. While picking up upgrades later for a blaster of your own and even a grenade launcher add to the smash it up feel.\n\nDefinitley worth picking up on sale to play on a casual Sunday.","July 4, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rochard (not pronounced "rock-hard" to my dismay) is a nice little platformer with multiple ways to deal with enemies/platforming.

Thankfully I ended up satisfied with my time with the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66cos8RTooA\n\nRochard is a sidescrolling platform, action, and puzzle game. You take control of a miner on a distant asteroid that has had little luck finding resources. Your team stumbles upon an important artifact that your boss hurries to investigate when pirates attack and things go awry.\n\nThe story is pretty thin, and while they seemed to get the space redneck Rochard just right, some later Native American themes felt pretty out of place. I emphasize the story, setting, and characters so much because that damn theme song sold me so hard. I'm a sucker for space cowboy antics.\n\nRochard, the protagonist and player-controlled character, uses a mining gun to pull objects close to him, shoot them away, and eventually shoot lasers and bombs. Throughout most of the game, Rochard is able to alter the gravity of the level, which becomes second-nature and part of the player's elegant jumps, swings, and attacks. It's fun to take on enemies by dropping boxes on their heads while leaping gracefully over a platform. There are collectibles for people who want to test the limits of their abilities, too. I didn't bother with every one, but I liked the additional challenges.\n\nIf you're like me, you got this game from a Humble Bundle a while back and never gave it a try. If anything I shared here interests you, load it up! I enjoyed my several hours with the game.","July 21, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Okay, physics is actually a major gameplay element in fights as well as in puzzle-solving: you get to switch between normal and low gravity, and your main weapon is basically the gravity gun from Half-Life.\nThe visuals and audio aren't as shiny and rich as Trine, instead going (successfully) for a more clean look and feel. Still, the game features Jon St. John (Duke Nukem!) hamming it up as Rochard, and the main theme is done by Poets of the Fall, and everything fits together quite well, with nothing out of place.\nThe story doesn't take itself too seriously - suffice to say it's your traditional sci-fi action movie stuff.\n\nAnd there's just something so satisfying in taking out lots of enemies with what's essentially a power tool while hopping all over the place in low gravity.","January 28, 2012","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The primary gameplay is mixing gravity manipulation with shooting, and it works very well.  The production values on this game are very high.  It's fully voiced, has a polished artistic style, was completely bug free for me and the physics engine worked very smoothly.\n\nHowever, there are some negatives.  First, the game ends on a cliffhanger.  The developer has talked about a sequel, but none has been announced.  Second, and more imporant, is the fact that the game utilizes some unfortunate stereotypes.  For example, there is a Native American character - he runs a casino and has feathers in his hair.  Also, some of the bad guys have pronounced lisps, like a stereotypical American gay accent.  This really ruined what I thought was an otherwise perfect game.  The developer is Finnish, so they may not have realized the cultural implications, but that's not much of an excuse.","July 29, 2012","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ten bucks for this piece of garbage? For one thing, it is only in 2-D. You can only face one direction, and basically the whole game is moving boxes and stacking them so you can finish levels. I wouldn't pay ANYTHING for this, if I had known what it was like. I'll write a memo never to get anything by these developers ever again.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I was on a bit of a rage there, and had only played for ~10 minutes. After playing for longer, I realised that this is, behind the camoflage, a great game. Scrap what I said before. This game is fun, has nice, simple controls, good graphics, and fun gameplay. I will, however, keep my old review there, to prove the point that you can’t judge a book by its cover. Or in this case, a game by the first 5 minutes.\n\nDefinitely get this game.

Definitely worth it when on sale, maybe not quite at regular price.\n\nIt's not very long, and it generally is pretty easy, but it's well-made, has interesting mechanics, and is overall quite fun.  I found the "ancient Native American legend" bit of the storyline a little goofy, but that doesn't detract too much from the enjoyment of the game as a whole.  The look and feel of the design is great, the voice acting is quite good, and the music is enjoyable.\n\nSome might find the game too easy, but I like the feeling that I am making progress, so it didn't bother me that much.  It is a little short, but that just means that I enjoyed it enough to want more.  It's short enough that I'm not sure I would have paid full price for it, but on sale it was absolutely worth the money.\n\nMy biggest complaint actually has to do with the ending - if you die, the game has you restart from the last checkpoint, which works well throughout most of the game.  In the final battle, however, the last checkpoint comes before the fight starts, before the villain does his stereotypical villain monologue in a cut scene.  And there is no way to skip that cut scene.  I died several times before beating the final boss, which means that I had to sit and listen to that monologue over and over, punching buttons and hitting keys in hopes of skipping the damn thing.  Oddly, the same thing happens when the final credits begin to roll.  You had better enjoy that theme song, because you are going to have to listen to the whole thing - I could find no way of skipping the credit sequence.\n\nOverall, however, I quite enjoyed Rochard.  If you enjoy a good indie platformer with a heavy dose of puzzle solving, I recommend it, especially on sale.","November 12, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were puzzles that were harder, but it wasn't that I couldn't figure them out, they just didn't work.  Like, I'm sure I have to make this jump, but the game won't allow it.

The puzzles are not very difficult, but are never so patronisingly easy that they ruin the game. Additionally, even if the core concept is simple, they manage to keep it interesting by changing the setting, adding different puzzles (a variety of force fields, low gravity, reverse gravity, electric fields, shielded enemies, improving weaponry with new features etc.).\n\nSpeaking of enemies, they can be taken out in a variety of ways, such as dropping heavy stuff on them, pushing them into electric surfaces, manipulating giant mining lasers to cut them into pieces, throwing malfunctioning robots at them, or just plain shooting holes in them.\n\nThe story is simple, but the nature of the boisterous main character makes it interesting and fun.","September 22, 2013","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play a redneck asteroid miner with a physgun and solve puzzles in order to save your friends and uncover a native-american-alien-conspiracy whatever along the way.  The plot doesn't really go anywhere and the ending might as well have just said "Congratulations, you did the thing, the end."\n\nHowever, the production values are extremely nice for an indie game.  The voice acting is great, the game opens with an awesome song by Poets of the Fall, and the graphics and art are visually pleasing.  However, I get the feeling that this is probably the reason why the developers have been MIA for about two years (as of late 2015).  The link to the game's official website is dead, as are the social media accounts associated with Recoil Games, and although they talked on Facebook about their desire for a sequel, they said that they didn't have the money to make one.  So you should probably not expect any sort of closure unless they suddenly make a kickstarter.\n\nThe game itself is an indie puzzle platformer (if those three words in sequence turned you off, this is easily the least pretentious indie game I've ever played) with a focus on gravity, so imagine a 2D version of Half-Life 2's physics puzzles with a button that lowers gravity.  It's pretty fun for what it is and it nicely kept my attention for five hours, so I'd say it's worth saving for a rainy day if you got it in a bundle like I did.","October 17, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definately worth it's price when on sale.\n\nThe combat is nice, the platforming is ok and the puzzles are somewhat easy, but it gives you good variety throughout the 5 hours or so campaign. The animations are good, the VA is weak but does its job and the soundtrack is very nice. The story is kind of irrelevant (and the ending is pretty unsatisfying), but for a platform game it's not a big deal. The AI sucks, with enemies shooting each other and standing unresponsive on top of grenades...but this is the only flaw that I have to point out. Still makes for an enjoyable (yet easy) combat.\n\nIt deserves to be played if you like the genre and have some money on your steam wallet during a sale.\n\nOverall I give this game a 7.5/10.","June 17, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game pretty much fell through the cracks when it was released, and it's a shame, because it's a delightful pleasure almost all the way through.  The main mechanic is a special gun which gives the hero (John Rochard, a working-class stiff beautifully voice-acted by Jon St. John) the power to grab things at a distance (like the gravity gun from Half Life 2), control gravity, swing himself into the air, toss people around (eventually) and so on.  The gun also can be used as a gun, and the main weakness of the game is an occasional overreliance on straight combat instead of puzzle-solving.  However, eventually you learn to combine both fighting and environment manipulation while playing, and then the game is serious fun.  It's also light enough and short enough for casual gamers (like me). I wish enough people would play this so we could get a sequel.","June 18, 2015","true","54.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No game is perfect and I always feel that the number one thing a game should always be is fun, which this one is. However, since this is a review, I'll break it down by different components.\n\nGameplay: 2D puzzle-platformer that does not treat the gamer like an idiot. You need to actually think on how to solve a puzzle and there are a few different ways to solve each which can be combined with the combat in the game. The puzzle solving and combat can at times go hand and hand which adds a level of difficulty to the game which is all the more satisfying for completing it. The combat itself can be straight forward but that mostly depends on you as a gamer which makes the game feel all the more freeing because you can choose to simply shoot the enemy or figure out a complex way to kill them.\n\nVoice Acting: The cast is small but that is not a terrible thing, Lani Minella who has voiced over 500 animated/video game characters plays Skyler while the main character John is voiced by Jon st. John who is famous for being the voice of Duke Nukem.\n\nDesign: The game design can feel almost reminiscent of classic platforming games from the earlier days of video games and that is not a bad thing, the character and level designs are bright and eye catching. John, the main character, isn't your average muscle bound hero, he's an over weight miner just trying to make a living so it's easier to put yourself in his shoes and sympathize with him.\n\nMusic: The music is great, though I have a bias since it was composed by Markus “Captain” Kaarlonen from one of my favorite bands, Poets of the Fall, who also composed/wrote music for the game Alan Wake. and had work featured in Max Payne 2.\n\nI would recommend this game and the price isn't that high, considering there are far worse games on Steam asking far higher prices.","October 21, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play a redneck asteroid miner with a physgun and solve puzzles in order to save your friends and uncover a native-american-alien-conspiracy whatever along the way.  The plot doesn't really go anywhere and the ending might as well have just said "Congratulations, you did the thing, the end."\n\nHowever, the production values are extremely nice for an indie game.  The voice acting is great, the game opens with an awesome song by Poets of the Fall, and the graphics and art are visually pleasing.  However, I get the feeling that this is probably the reason why the developers have been MIA for about two years (as of late 2015).  The link to the game's official website is dead, as are the social media accounts associated with Recoil Games, and although they talked on Facebook about their desire for a sequel, they said that they didn't have the money to make one.  So you should probably not expect any sort of closure unless they suddenly make a kickstarter.\n\nThe game itself is an indie puzzle platformer (if those three words in sequence turned you off, this is easily the least pretentious indie game I've ever played) with a focus on gravity, so imagine a 2D version of Half-Life 2's physics puzzles with a button that lowers gravity.  It's pretty fun for what it is and it nicely kept my attention for five hours, so I'd say it's worth saving for a rainy day if you got it in a bundle like I did.","October 17, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No game is perfect and I always feel that the number one thing a game should always be is fun, which this one is. However, since this is a review, I'll break it down by different components.\n\nGameplay: 2D puzzle-platformer that does not treat the gamer like an idiot. You need to actually think on how to solve a puzzle and there are a few different ways to solve each which can be combined with the combat in the game. The puzzle solving and combat can at times go hand and hand which adds a level of difficulty to the game which is all the more satisfying for completing it. The combat itself can be straight forward but that mostly depends on you as a gamer which makes the game feel all the more freeing because you can choose to simply shoot the enemy or figure out a complex way to kill them.\n\nVoice Acting: The cast is small but that is not a terrible thing, Lani Minella who has voiced over 500 animated/video game characters plays Skyler while the main character John is voiced by Jon st. John who is famous for being the voice of Duke Nukem.\n\nDesign: The game design can feel almost reminiscent of classic platforming games from the earlier days of video games and that is not a bad thing, the character and level designs are bright and eye catching. John, the main character, isn't your average muscle bound hero, he's an over weight miner just trying to make a living so it's easier to put yourself in his shoes and sympathize with him.\n\nMusic: The music is great, though I have a bias since it was composed by Markus “Captain” Kaarlonen from one of my favorite bands, Poets of the Fall, who also composed/wrote music for the game Alan Wake. and had work featured in Max Payne 2.\n\nI would recommend this game and the price isn't that high, considering there are far worse games on Steam asking far higher prices.","October 21, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Throwing ♥♥♥♥ and the like. The moments when I had most fun with the game was dispatching a roomfull of enemies without using the laser gun.\nAlso, by the end Rochard is very overpowered. Maybe one hit kills could be better overall and the upgrades disabled alltogether. By this I mean beggining with the ability to grab people and suddenly come ungrabable enemies.\nOr, for a completely oposite direction, make the game a metroidvania and adding more upgrades and abilities.\nIt felt a little in between metroidvania (minus exploration) and puzzle platformer (with a bit too much enfasis on combat).\nAnyways, good fun for an afternoon, but could be a little more clear on what it wants to be.","July 19, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The formula resembles Portal 2 because they mix puzzle and action elements with a funny story.\n\nThere are some rough edges here and there, but the mechanics are very fun and the puzzles (so far) are balanced.\n\nAt sale price it's a steal.","May 18","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A good solid game all around, but short; it took me three hours to complete. Get it while it's on sale and you won't likely be disappointed.","September 23, 2012","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is solid, and the gravity gun mechanic is fun and extremely well implemented. The puzzles are also pretty rewarding, and break up the pace of the game nicely. Unfortunately it ends on a cliffhanger, and it doesn't look like a sequel is coming...\n\nOn another note, I found this game to be a great learning tool for the Steam Controller, using the left touch pad as a joystick and the right as a mouse.\n\nI'd recommend picking this up on sale.","June 2","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
