There are minor hints at mobile heritage, but nothing that would stop anyone who might like a computerized card game from having plenty of fun.\n\nProgress Disclosure: I finished the game and have every achievement. I didn't collect every card. That took about 14 hours. It could probably be done in 8-10 hours by someone hurrying.\n\nUpdates: It's over 2 months later, and this game is still getting free content additions.\n\nThe mechanics have clearly received attention and tuning; the basics work nicely on their own, and as more abilities are introduced they interact in interesting but not convoluted ways. The interface in general is good; however, it is full of tiny delays for animations and pointless confirmations of non-permanent actions. Combat animations can be set to anywhere between 100% and 200% speed in the options, at least.\n\nThe tutorial was good, even having heard and read nothing about the game except the store description before playing. The difficulty hasn't sharply spiked or stayed tutorial easy since; the AI can be observed getting steadily more competent in addition to having better cards. Most games are semi-close wins, and the occasional enemy provokes a new deck style. I have a win ratio around 5, and I doubt that's exceptional.\n\nDeck size is allowed to vary between 25-40 and failing to draw causes damage, so milling is a somewhat viable strategy with the right cards.\n\nThere's an deterministic, seemingly associative 2-input alchemy system. The vast majority of combinations are disallowed, and this is indicated by dimming incompatible cards; there's still a pretty large space of recipes, though. A little experimentation produced some deck-worthy but not ridiculous cards. As an example, two Pancakes gives a pretty good milling card. I didn't find a guide, so I'll warn that in my experience combining a alchemy-created card and one of the ingredients used to craft it is allowed but just gets the created back, effectively throwing a card away.\n\nThere are 6 icon-identified deck slots; a card can be used in multiple decks. The deck building interface is passable if imperfect; it lacks bulk management options, and the sorting options are deficient. It could use a tweak to show more cards on a PC screen. Cards used in decks are hidden on store and alchemy menus (for good reason).\n\nThe art style is pleasant. The dialogue is mildly humorous overall and better in parts; the optional dialogues are pretty extensive, as well.\n\nThe achievements look to be quite doable, so it would probably be good for 100%ers. The non-trivial ones (10+ attack and 9 combo) are easy enough to manage once you have a 6+ arrow card and deliberately try.\n\nAs described, there are no hidden in-game currency, card, or booster purchases.\n\nAccessibility: The game is fully turn-based with no time pressure ever. The interface doesn't require great precision, but it does require dragging. The interface is fully mouse-driven, except optionally entering your name. There are no vital sound-only cues. No lines are voiced; all dialogue is presented in text. Nothing relies purely on color for identification. As a non-expert, I see no problems.","February 14, 2014","true","16.2"," 183 of 197 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","183","197","0","7"

I really like it so far, and plan on putting a good bit more time into it. I'm gonna try to give you a good idea of the game becuase not too much is explained here or anywhere online so bear with me.\n\nIt's a very simple little card game wrapped in a Yu-Gi-Oh-esque adventure shell. You go through different locations battling people, getting more cards, getting new decks, all in an effort to get the 8 legendary cards and become super cool and powerful and make mad bank at a tournament.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simple. There's a world map that you click locations on to go there and interact with or battle people (also, click around the environment to find hidden coins!).  The card game puts a heavy emphasis on positioning. All the cards have arrows on them, and you want to put your cards together so their arrows point at eachother. Connect (usually) 3 arrows and you can make a combo to either do damage, increase your defense(HP) or other effects. That's it. You win when your opponent has no defense or can't play another card.  After you win, you generally get a pack of cards to build your deck with, and some money to buy more packs.  Your deck must be at least 25 cards, but they can be bigger.\n\nI really like the story, well what little of it I've seen so far. It's basic, you know, get the best cards and be the best. That's good enough for me though, and it should satisfy anyone who grew up watcing shows about kids playing card games.  So far, it's bee pretty light-hearted, it's silly and kinda funny which I dig. The art style is childlike and well drawn in a good way, it fits the theme of the game very well. Now we move to the music, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ do I love it. Seriously, I hope I can get the soundtrack, because it's probably my favorite part.\n\nThe last thing to mention is the price. It's 2 bucks right now. Yes, it's clearly a port of a tablet game. No, it doesn't have visual/sound options aside from a resolution changer and a window/fullscreen button. No, it does not have multiplayer. Let me bring this up again. IT'S 2 BUCKS. Even when it goes to full price at 4 bucks, it's still totally worth it. If you like card games, you should buy it. Even if you don't like card games, but cheap and charming games, buy it. Anyone can get into this, and you should get into it.","February 14, 2014","true","3.3"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","42","49","0","3"

You're basically fighting eight gyms, getting booster packs along the way in a story that's utterly forgettable but at least is a decent nod towards other video game greats.\n\nBut the story doesn't really matter (In fact the game basically says this multiple times), what really got me hooked was the puzzle-esque card battling system. At first you think it's really clear cut, and just go straight for your opponents life points. But then the game throws opponents at you for which this strategy is basically impossible, and it makes you realize that there are a LOT of ways to play this game.\n\nThe art is fantastic, each card is humorous in it's own regard, and the entire aesthetic of the game is just awesome to look at. It's almost a trying hard to look like you're not trying hard sort of art style. The music though leaves something to be desired, it's basically the same tune for each area that you're in, which means it keeps looping and looping and looping.\n\nBut hey, for $4 you really can't go wrong with this.

Music was cool and visuals was colorful, lovely to look at.\nI didn´t care much about story or characters, but this game wasn´t about it.\n\nMy problem with CCN appear after few hours of playing. AI was really, really dumb. There was practically no challenge, and when you master some tactic and technique you simply can´t be beaten by them. This was drastically changed by final boss. I can´t tell if it was caused by my s**** decks, or it was caused by something else from my play, but i couldn´t defeat him (and i envy to all smart people, who pass this without trouble). After several hours of trying, i simply rage quit, discourage and beaten.\nDont get me wrong, i like challenges but when you suddenly raise bar from nothing to something this big, it raise question: "Why other matches couldn´t be harder?"\n\nI will eventually come back to this game and claim what is rightfully mine.\n\n7.5/10","June 18, 2014","true","11.4"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

It's charming, with very simple rules, while still requiring thoughtful tactics. It's not a hardcore trading card game, but it's not casual either. It's more of a distillation.\n\nYou have to "link" cards in a 3x3 grid to activate them, but specific cards can only link in certain directions (there are arrows on the cards... check out the screenshots). This mechanic allows the game to have very simply cards (there aren't really stats on cards) and still require thought.\n\nIt ticks nearly all the checkboxes, deck building, booster packs, good art direction and music.\n\nIt's set in a neat universe with some irreverently quirky characters. As rich as the universe is though, the story's a bit thin. You have to collect legendary cards from various "bosses" to enter an ultimate tournament and win a million coins. It's little more than a reason to be playing cards with every person you see... which isn't a bad thing at all.","February 14, 2014","true","0.9"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Unheard of in this day and age! I enjoyed this game from beginning to end. The unique artwork and character dialog fits the tone of the entire game. There are a lot of unique characters with crazy and varied personalities. The way they battle during matches also happens to be in sync with their character. Each fight is more like a puzzle piece and the same strategy can't be used for every battle in the game. For those who are looking for true randomness in each battle in reference to the opponent's card might have to look elsewhere. The story is your typical I need to win the card battle tournament at the end but how it's presented is what makes this title unique. Of course there are the usual twists and turns during the whole event. The music is also amazing and is a mix of both melodious and upbeat jazz styled tunes.\n\nDo yourself a favor and purchase the soundtrack. You'll have the manually search for it on Steam since it does not show up under the game's main page as DLC. Get it here http://store.steampowered.com/app/285150/\n\nI've played my fair share of card battle games in my day. Everything from Magic the Gathering to Yugioh to Pokemon to SNK vs Capcom Card Fighters and more! This game's mechanics is totally different from them all thanks to the grid like interface which quite frankly was refreshing to me. Get this game! The only feature it lacks is multiplayer. It would be amazing if this could be added in a future update or even as part of a sequel. Despite all of that this game is an absolute steal for the price!

However, unlike most CCGs, you do not have to BUY the booster packs either through in game currency or real money. You earn them through the gameplay which is a major bonus to me.\n\nThe story is better than you would expect from a game of this genre as well. If you choose to, you can find that every person you come across has several (sometimes more than a dozen) different things they will say to you. And what they say will change depending on whether or not you have defeated them yet.\n\nThe actual gameplay is quite balanced. As you get stronger, so does the opponents. And there are many different strategies you must use. Going all out offense will work sometimes, but some characters are built to counter with good defense and the ability to disable your best cards at just the right times. You must choose your deck wisely depending on your opponent. This depth is part of what makes this game so fun.\n\nThe art style may turn some people off but I think it's very endearing and original. I don't know any of the indie games that this takes it's characters from but it's cartoonish and quirky and simple and it fits the overall mood of the game.\n\nThe best part of the whole game however must be the music. Everything from the menu screen, to the various places you visit, to the battles have music that is perfect for the situation. It's soothing and it's energizing at the same time. This, along with the humor of the game, and the visual styling make this a game you will never want to put down.\n\nAlthough I have not beaten it yet, I know from reading around that the game has more things to accomplish even after you defeat the 'final boss'. So replay value is strong here too.","September 7, 2014","true","23.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

In the card game proper, each player has a 3x3 card grid, and seven Defense Points. The goal is either to fill up your opponent's grid with occupied space, or decrease their Defense Points to zero.\n\nCards have three main categories: ATTACK, which can disable opponent cards, or damage your opponent's Defense Points; DEFENSE, which can increase your own Defense Points; and REVIVE, which can bring your disabled cards back into play.\n\nThe challenge of the game is that cards must be played in combos. Each card has a specific set of arrows which tell you where on the grid it can be placed for maximum efficiency, and cards in a combo must point to each other in order to be played. While some cards have multiple arrows, others only have one (some trick cards have none). They can also have additional effects such as rotation, teleportation, or extra damage, making gameplay interesting, unpredictable, and especially fun.\n\nThe game works in an almost Rock-Paper-Scissors type of balance, where a specific strategy you use for your deck to counter that of your opponent's will expose you to another vulnerability. Having the freedom to make your own deck allows you to explore and create your own combos. Each NPC uses a consistent strategy, making training accessible, but not simple-minded, since the variability of play is kept intact by the limited number of cards you're allowed to use at once. This could actually be printed as a physical card game, and I would invest in it without hesitation.\n\nPersonally, this game meets all my standards for a perfect single player game: completely replayable, expansive but not overwhelming, customizable, encouraging of practice, and a smooth, approachable mood shown through the art style, music and NPCs (I once spent a quarter hour just reading the funny lines of the gossiper at the city mall).\n\nAn online multiplayer mode would send my love for this game over the top, like a rocket that shoots through the sky and explodes, scattering its awesome rocket parts over the world. Seriously, game designers, if you're reading this: give 'Card City Nights' an online multiplayer mode, or the aforementioned physical card game.","December 31, 2015","true","20.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Finished the entire story (which includes post-game events) in roughly 15 hours. Story follows the courageous attempt of "SpacePirate", aiming to be the best card player in the city. Comparable to Pokemon games, in a way. Rather than collecting gym leader badges to reach the elite four, you're collecting legendary cards to battle the Card King.\n\nGame is fairly straight forward, though not as casual as it may seem. You travel from location to location in seek of information for legendary cards. Each victory earns you gold and a booster pack which may contain a common, special or rare card. There's a variety of different booster packs, which further adds to the gameplay and replay value if you intend on building your deck around a specific type or card. Legendary cards pack unique abilities, further adding to the variety of options available. You can also buy or merge cards to create your ideal deck - Whether that be an all out offensive deck (which is what I used), defensive, deck burner, healer, focused on a combination deck, or various other combinations. Storage space of 6 decks, with minimum 25 and maximum 40 cards.\n\nGameplay is also fairly straight forward, though the battle phase is not like your average trading card game where each card has an attack and defence point, but rather connecting card arrows to form an attack, defence, heal, and so on. Victory is earned by either depleting the opponent defence points, burning their deck, or forcing them into filling up their playing board by stunning cards or hoping they can't match anything. Very formidable opponents late game, including some challenges early on when trying to understand the type of deck you want to build and the cards to include in this construction.\n\nVisuals are both charming and delightful. Several cards and characters, from my understanding, are characters from the Ludocity franchises - Including Ittle Dew. No complication in terms of settings and adjustment. The game in general is very accessible and user-friendly. Soundtrack is a mixture of beautiful jazz and hip-hop.\n\nOverall: A very charming and delightful card game topped off by a remarkable soundtrack.

There are more than one way to win in this game, it offers a few different strategies and how you play it out can change quickly, which makes it an interesting game!\n\nYou get into the gameplay quite easily & quickly, the tutorial was short but covered everything I needed to know about the basics of the game.\n\nEventually new cards are introduced with more "advanced" abilities, but the core mechanics/gameplay remains the same and doesn't change the game that much as a whole.\n\nThe game features deck building with up to 6 custom decks, as in other TCG/CCGs you have a library of cards that you earn from battles or purchase from the in-game shop. You get to choose from these cards to form decks that you bring into battles later on.\nThe lack of filters in the library is a bit annoying, but there's not too many cards so it's acceptable.\n\nUnfortunately it doesn't seem to be possible to purchase booster packs, depriving you of the suspension & kick that it is to rip open a new booster ;)\n\nIt seems to be a mobile game that has been ported to PC (Unity3D) which is obvious in some of the UI choices, this is probably related to the input lag as well as UI lag that occurs frequently.","February 15, 2014","true","7.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

It's a CCG set in a modern world small town with a cute story wrapped around it. You collect booster packs via duelling NPCs in the game, buy individual cards from the in-game store with gold coins that you get as you duel or explore, and form decks using one of a few varying strategies to finish the story and defeat all your opponents. I read other reviews that said defence decks were great, I used an offensive/disabler deck that worked well from start to end too. It's not grindy at all, you can easily play start to end without sitting around and grinding certain cards or something, though you can if you want to as well.\n\nBut there are a number of strategies you can employ to build your deck around, which is a neat concept, though there's little advantage in not maxing out the size of your deck, and the AI can be spotty in places, though it's not entirely horrible. The card combining system I found to be a little wonky too, although I didn't play with it fully.\n\nLove the art, dig the character writing, and the music is fun and addictive and on both Spotify and Steam, apparently.\n\nIt took me about 8-10h of casual playing to finish the game, the rest of the time it was just sitting idle behind some other games, which is why the gameplay time is a little inflated.","May 27, 2015","true","31.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There's no description of this event but the game throws the hint right at the start if you know where to look. You get to pick your portrait and name and next thing you know you'll be battling your first few opponents. The story, because yes, there's a story, is barebones but this isn't a bad thing, quite the opposite. You want to win the Card City tournament because of reasons and get its prize but you need 8 legendary cards to even get to participate in it, so you must win those cards first. That's the whole story right there. It's nice to see a card game that doesn't take itself too serious and the story is a amusing distraction from the proceedings.\n\nThe game is incredibly simple to pick up, the tutorial is short but effective in telling you the principal mechanic of the game.\nEssentially, the game plays out in two 3 by 3 grid, one for you and another for your opponent. The cards you use have arrows on them pointing in any of 8 different ways and one or more of 4 symbols attached to it (attack, defense, neutral, revive). You PLAY the cards by placing them on your grid but you USE them by matching arrows and symbols, making combos. You need at least 3 symbols linked by arrows to make a combo. Meanwhile, your opponent is trying to do the same. There's a little bit more nuance to this but that's THE game right there.\n\nYou mix and match the cards in the deck(s) to your style of play, since there are no "set" decks. You edit them in any way you like on up to 6 different decks, using the cards you get via randomized booster packs that you win after defeating certain opponents. The total number of cards in the game is healthy enough to actually require some tough decisions as to what cards to actually put in the deck.\n\nThe battles themselves can be won in few different ways. Two examples would be, you can attack your opponents defence, bring it to zero or disable his cards with those same attacks for a grid lock, where he has no legal move. Either way, you win (or your opponent does).\n\nHowever, there is definitely some concern about balance. For example, you can have 3 uncommon cards and 5 common ones in a 40 card deck. In reality, while playing, you'll find that 3 uncommon  cards that are straight-up upgrades from common ones (as in, they have the same everything the common card has but with one extra bit, like an extra arrow and/or special ability) are much more worth having.\n\nThere's no real reason to keep common cards around because they will eventually just take up room from the more useful uncommon cards, unless you need A LOT of cards with arrows pointing the same way, which you won't, since it's counter-intuitive. And since uncommon become powerful on their own (like damaging the enemy just by placing them, for example), and booster packs are always available to be won, you can, with a little luck in the boosters while farming them, steamroll most opponents early on, if not for the entire duration. So this warants these two paragraphs.\n\nThe A.I. isn't particularly challenging but with more card variety, the possible moves it makes also increases, so it keeps you guessing the first or even the second time you battle a particular opponent, which is nice. There's no multiplayer, for those more inclined to battle humans, so this feature lacking is going to put off some people, which is understandable but it's not a major gripe, in my opinion, obviously.\n\nIn conclusion and to make a long story short, it's a casual card game that offers some solid gameplay with solid mechanics. It doesn't reinvent the wheel because it doesn't have to as far as card games are concerned but it stands out enough to warrant a look. And for it's price tag, it's a great steal. Buy it, play it, no real reason not to.","February 15, 2014","true","13.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The card game itself is fun and varied, and leaves many opportunities for customising one's own deck. While a direct and offensive tactic can be used to beat most opponents, each uses different strategies that can seriously complicate such an approach, making it optimal to research tactics and learn more about the individual card synergies.\n\nThere is no penalty for losing and always a reward for winning, so it's very much so a gentle game for those who may be unfamiliar with battling card games in general, making it playable and appealing for new or veteran players alike.\n\nThe music is enjoyable and adds flavour to the already living world, and the artwork is unforgettable and appealing, in that "trying hard to look like it isn't trying hard" way. The palette choices and composition are aesthetically pleasing and give the world a setting all its own, despite borrowing elements from many other games that the developers have made. The default gender for the player character and most npcs is female, with most characters being confident and punkish, breaking the common representation of female characters in video games as passive, mousey, and largely helpless.\n\nI loved this game every moment that I played it, and though it can be frustrating to find an opponent who is difficult to beat, that just requires more familiarity and effort with your deck. It's seriously a steal at its price.","February 21, 2015","true","21.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

You have 5 cards in your hand at one time, and take turns with your opponent to place a card done on a grid.  Create combos of 3 or more by connecting arrows between cards. Place them carefully, as when you run out of spaces you'll lose the round.  Since HP is capped at 10 and there are penalties for running out of cards, each round goes fairly fast and you won't get into stalemate situations.  It may not be as strategically deep as other card games where you have to manage resources etc., but it's easy to pick up, and fun.\n\nIn between card battles, you can organize your card decks, buy cards to augment your decks using virtual money (you can also get booster packs by battling, and there are no IAPs) and go around town to talk to other characters. The storyline is rather silly (but are you really playing a card game for the story?) and humourous.  The charmingly cartoony art fits the game well, as does the cheerful music.\n\nMy only drawback is that the AI appears to be on the easy side so far, but as I've not gotten too far yet this may be something that fixes itself later on.\n\nCard City Nights may not be a super-challenging card game, but it's good for a breezy time of card-battling fun. For casual fans of the trading card genre, this could well hit the spot.\n\nEDIT: as I've progressed, the game has indeed become a little more tricky. The developers have also released a patch that should make the AI stronger, so consider me a happy camper :)","February 16, 2014","true","13.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerfrosti/recommended/271820/","killerfrosti","Pepsiman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerfrosti/","606 products in account","I picked this game up because I love trading card games. I've played a lot of YU-GI-OH back in the day and quite a lot of Magic the gathering and I'm familiar with a few other TCG's like Pokémon and Duelmonsters and this game is really cheap. I'll admit right away that I didn't really like the game because this card game is not my cup of tea but I can imagine there are a lot of TCG fans out there that will like it.\n\nThe game pretty much is a card game, you battle opponents, gain boosterpacks to change your deck  and earn money to buy cards so you can take on stronger opponents. The game does have a storyline, all I know about it is that you have to collect the 8 legendary cards by defeating the holders of those cards so you can take on the champion of the game, but it's a card game so no need for a fancy story there anyway.\n\nIts kinda hard to explain how the card game works so it might be better looking up some gameplay videos but I'm gonna try anyway. Both players start with 7 shields (hp). You win the game if your opponent drops to 0 shields or if he can't play anymore cards. The playingfield consists of 3 by 3 spaces where you can play your cards, the goal is to create a combo of 3 cards and that will trigger a certain effect based on the types of the cards used in the combo which I'll explain later on. You must play one card a turn and you cannot remove any of the cards on the playingfield so if you donnot make combinations you'll run out of spaces and lose the game.\n\nThere are 4 types of cards: defensive, offensive, revive and neutral. If you make a combination using 3 defensive cards you gain 3 shields, if you make a combination using 3 offensive cards you can deal 3 damage to the shields of your opponent or disable one of his cards on the playingfield, if a card is disabled it cannot be used for combinations and it just stays on the playingfield. Use a combination of 3 revive cards and you can re-enable a disabled card and neutral cards don't have any effect and are just used for making combinations. The way combinations are made is rather interesting. You can combine all 4 types of cards in the combinations, for example you can use 2 offensive cards and 1 defensive card in a combination, but ony one effect can happen based on the most cards of a single type within the combination so that means this combo does damage but does not give you additional shields and because there are only 2 offensive cards in the combo it only does 2 damage. The position of the cards on the playingfield also plays a role, the playingfield consists of 3 by 3 spaces and there are arrows on every card indicating in what directions they can make combo's, for example you place a card in the centre of the playingfield and it has 2 arrows, 1 pointing up and 1 pointing left. That means it can only make a combination with cards placed above or on the left of this card if however that card also has an arrow pointing towards it. I hope that kind of explained how the game works.\n\nThe reason why I give the game a recomendation is because the card game is solid and I cannot deny that. Because it wasn't my cup of tea doesn't mean I cannot recomend it to others especially because it's cheap and solid. I won't give it a rating though because I would give it a low rating because there wasn't much fun to be had for me personally and I rate games based on the fun factor. If you like TCG's you should definitely try it because there is a fair chance you will like it and it's only 4 bucks (if not on sale). They're practicly giving it away.","February 17, 2014","true","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought "Why not?" and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.\n\nWhat I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose "defense" (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.\n\nWhile - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements.

I was satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nThe aesthetics are nice - the artstyle is cute and charming. There is a large variety of cards to collect and use, each with its own unique picture and text flavor. The sounds and music are decent, however, I quickly muted the latter in favor of my own. You can buy different game boards to place your cards on during matches, and your opponents will often have their own boards that are distinct from the default one. The story is highly reminiscent of a hybrid between Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh - you must obtain 8 legendary cards to qualify for a hefty gold prize, playing against an assortment of different characters along the way.\n\nControls are super simple and consist of mouse clicks. There is a helpful tutorial in the beginning that will show you most of the things you need to know, however, I found that some aspects of the game have to be discovered through play. For example, many possible strategies will be more salient to you when you've encountered them in a match - like using mainly defence cards to outlast/fatigue your opponent. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with trading card games. You may have to do a bit of grinding at times to farm enough cards/money to build better decks. A big thing I didn't like about this game is how you cannot just scrap decks (you can have 6 built at a time) to start from scratch - you have to manually click and drag 25 cards from your "deck list" to your "total cards list" one-at-a-time.\n\nGameplay consists of placing a single card from your hand of 5 onto a gameboard every turn - the board can hold a maximum of 9 cards, and filling it will cause you to lose the following turn. You will also start to take increasing damage every turn if you run out of cards. Cards have a certain number of differently-oriented arrows along the border. You must chain combos by matching up arrows between cards. Each card has an icon on it (a shield, sword, circle, or healing cross). Once you have matched at least 3 icons together (usually meaning 3 cards; they cannot all be circle icons), you will trigger an action. Shields provide you with +1 health/defence per icon, swords do +1 damage per defence icon, circles are neutral icons, and healing crosses will reactivate cards.\n\nWhen you chain together an attack action, you can either attack your opponent's health, or one of his/her cards. Attacking a card (regardless of damage) will cause it to be deactivated, preventing it from being used to chain arrows. They will stay on the board, and accumulating too many disabled cards may result in you filling up your board with 9 cards, resulting a loss on your next turn. To revive cards, you must chain together healing icons. These cards are also useful because it will immediately remove all cards that are linked to it (possibly saving you from filling up your board with useless cards). Since cards with healing icons always have at least 2 icons, this means you can usually revive a card using only 2 cards (versus your usual 3 card set). Later, as you unlock more cards, you will encounter cards that may have 2 shield, sword, or circle icons.\n\nMany cards will have an extra effect - for example, "placement" effect cards will trigger something (deal 1 damage to your opponent, gain +1 HP, or lose 1 card from your deck) once they are placed on the board. Other cards may rotate 180 degrees or move horizontally every turn, allowing you to pull off creative strategies and synergies. An effect you will frequently see is attack/defence/revive combos, which are effects triggered when using certain actions with that card. For example, a card may have an attack combo that removes a target card - using that card in an attack action will allow you to remove any card that has been played. Note, however, that chaining this card with different icon types (ex: shield) and using it to perform a different action (ex: increasing your HP) will not trigger the attack combo effect. Rarer cards will have multiple effects, and many cards with significant effects (ex: deal an extra +1 damage) will have a trade-off to balance things (card starts off deactivated, or it deals 1 damage to the owner whenever it is disabled).\n\nMatches may be a best of 1, 3, or 5. At the end of every match, you will usually be given a booster pack with 5 cards of random rarity and/or some gold. You can sell cards at the mall for gold, and also purchase new ones. You may sometimes have to beat opponents before unlocking more difficult ones (including bosses that will give you a legendary card for beating them).\n\nOverall, the game plays fairly well and is a nice time-filler for anyone interested in the trading card genre. The arrow-connect style of play is also a nice change from your typical Magic TCG/Yu-Gi-Oh style of placing monsters/characters to down to fight each other. Matches are usually very quick - easily one of the quickest trading card game I've encountered. If you enjoy playing with cards, then you should definitely give this a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","May 22, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Card City Nights is a lot of fun and combines the elements of card collecting and battling.\n\nPros:\nThe three things that I would say set this game apart from other card games would be the card battle system, the graphics and the fact that earning a new booster pack is as simple as defeating an opponent (no cash shop). The battle system is similar to card battling in Final Fantasy VIII but with various factors that allow you to create decks with different win conditions (Attack, Defense, Board Control. The graphics are skillfully done and keep the game feeling fun.\n\nCons:\nThe main con for me was that the game is somewhat short. At casual playspeed it took me 8 hours to beat the game. I had so much fun that I was sad to beat it. If there was more content to this game I could see people easily spending $20+ for it. As far as other cons, the only thing that comes to are some minor UI problems that the developers have been quickly fixing.\n\nOverall this game is a hidden treasure and I highly recommend it to any strategy/card game lovers.","February 25, 2014","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But it captured my attention. A cute little card game with a unique twist and simple gameplay, but still having some brain crunching in deck building. At first it was a bit awkward to get used to this spacial placement of cards in a grid and connections between them. Especially when trying to figure out which cards with how many connections and what directions do you need while building a deck. Btw, don't make too many decks as you will have 25 cards wasted per deck, if you don't really want some of them anymore. No way to delete a deck and get back those 25 cards. I needed just one to complete the game and it stayed 70% unaltered for second half of the game. Either i'm so good at deck building or i was lucky to strike the attack/defence/trick balance early. Only in the end i faced an intended roadblock and was forced to switch to a secondary all attack deck and then wiped that last foe easily. You might need a second deck to complete some achievements. I wasn't so lucky (if possible at all) to receive a card with 8 connections, so doing 9 cards combo and 10 attack combo would be easy. But i had fun completing them with just a 5 connections card. That was tough, luck involved, but satisfying after all.\n\nNow i'm sitting and looking at print and play pdf and thinking that i would rather pay for published game.

You collect cards that have arrows on it and you line up the arrows to combo into different actions (attack/revive/defense). It sounds simple, but the game pulls it off really well and makes you consider if placing a certain card down into a certain position is the right thing to do. I'd say the level of difficulty really depends on the player, but I'd give it a medium difficulty. It's the uniqueness of this game that makes me recommend it, I can't think of any other TCG game currently that utilizes this style of gameplay. The storyline is average/straightforward, not particulary interesting but fun enough with humorous dialogue here and there. I wouldn't say this game is incredibly replayable - there aren't any "random" opponents to play that have really new strategies every single time, you'd be playing the same characters over and over again if you wanted to keep playing after defeating everyone. The AIs will stick to their playstyle - defensive, offensive, etc. I guess it really depends on if you *really* get sucked into the gameplay. For me, this is probably the only time I will be playing it through unless if new content was added. It was really compelling to finish the game and I found the experience thoroughly enjoyable; and here I am, writing a review days after buying the game and "completing" it - after completing it though, I just don't feel the urge to keep on playing and rebattling the revamped opponents (the game kicks up the difficulty a notch once you complete the storyline).\nIt took me around ~15 hours to achieve 100% but I'd say 2-3 of those hours I spent idle/afk, also, I could probably get another hour or two of new gameplay in if I went ahead and challenged the "revamped" characters.\n\nVerdict?\nThis game is well worth the money regardless if it's on sale or not.

With an offensive deck you have three ways of winning: reduce the enemy health (9% of the time), wear them down till they run out of cards (1%) or disable their cards until they run out of viable placements (90%). This last strategy is so effective that the game ceases to be fun - whatever cards the opponent has, they're not going to be able to use them. It's not an AI problem, the AI is fairly good - the problem is that there are too many ways of getting a 2-card attack while the computer opponent is lining up the normally required 3 cards. Usually if you can disable the card in the middle of their board they will end up not having any moves they can make, and you just win. It's a fundamental flaw with the game design. And the writing is full of that annoying "zany" American humour that also ruined Psychonauts for me.

That said, I don't think that's because it's badly made or anything. But it completely failed to inspire me in ways I expect from customised deck construction games.\n\nI appreciate that the game is self contained. In fact, I was hopeful I would like this simply for that fact alone. I've largely given up on most deck construction games (digital and print) simply because of that lack of self containment. Those few that I do still play are either LCGs that I stopped buying when there's enough cards to build a decent range of decks, or long out of print games that aren't ever going to get bigger than they already are. But I'd also like something electronic that I could play like that same vein. Card City Nights clearly isn't going to be that for me.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is that I just didn't care about the cards. Without that inspiration, I looked at the deck design screen and felt zero motivation to refine my deck and eke out those tiny optimisations that I like to obsess over in this genre of game. I think this comes down to the interdependency between all the cards. Almost all the cards are only conditionally useful. It just ends up feeling to my CCG-addled brain that this is a card game made up solely of suboptimal cards. From an objective mechanical standpoint, that's fine. But to me personsally, it just feels like I don't get what I actually want from a CCG-like game. Those moments where I draw exactly the right card or discover an unorthodox combo to turn the game around feel completely absent.","November 20, 2015","false","1.9"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","3"

The game has the same quirky drawing style and sense of humour as their previous title Ittle Dew, and many of the characters from Ittle Dew have become usable cards in Card City Nights.

There are attack cards,defend,revive cards, and cards that have special effects.Thit not a fantasy styled card game,but keeps the strategy of card games to heart.There are different varieties of cards :Legendary (8 only),Rare,Uncommon, and Common. There are various ways you can get cards in the game which from trying them all are relatively pain free. You can grind battle and win packs,buy cards from the mall,take your unwanted cards and trade them in for a random deck, and even take two cards and turn them into a different one. Combining cards is not random they have specific combinations they can have.\n\nThe battle is pretty simple, you have best out 1,3, and 5 as far as victory conditions. Each player has  7 life points and each card can do anywhere from 1-4 attack points depending on if they have a bonus.Default max for attack,revive,defend is 2.\n\nFrom my playing the  Boss A.I. seem to be sorta cheaters but I am not fully sure.Each boss I card battled against more often then the regular fights could counter at least 80% of my strategies.This becomes far more shown when you are 1-3 attacks away from winning.

And I enjoyed it. That isn't to say the game is perfect. It has a number of flaws, some inherent to being a single player card game, and others that are the problem with the game itself. I'll list the pros, cons, and things that are more up to a person's taste.\n\nPros:\n-Unique gameplay. Unlike a regular card game like MTG, this game is played on a 3x3 board and the cards have arrows on them. You must connect cards using the arrows and then use them for attack or defense (depending on the card symbols). I can't really think of a game that has utilized this style of gameplay, and the fresh take on the rather traditional style of card games is a nice break from the games that are more in the style of MTG.\n-References galore. If you played any of this dev's previous games, you'll probably get a heap of enjoyment out of all the references made.\n-Deck progression. I guess that's a good term for this. Traditional card games you usually end up just buying a number of cards, and you have a solid deck right off the bat. I enjoy the progression of a single player card game, replacing worse cards for better cards as you continue to play the game.\n-Cost. I purchased this for $2. Regular price is $4. You'll probably see it going on sale during the Summer/Winter sale for $1. I'm basing this review off the $2 price point. You won't be getting a full card game for $2 (not unless you're insanely good at Hearthstone's Arena). I bought it with money I made selling Steam Trading Cards.\n\nCons:\n-Very Easy. I didn't lose a single best of three or best of five. Even the final boss I beat with three wins in a row. They very much need to ramp up the AI. They make some very silly plays that have the put a card in a location where they are unable to connect to anything.\n-Weak story. To be fair, who expected a good story from a card game? Still, it's a con.\n-No multiplayer. For a $4 indie title, this isn't much of a surprise. I personally don't care, as I was looking for more of a single player experience, but plenty of people will definitely find this to be a black mark against the title.\n-Lack of variety. The card effects basically boil down to: attack, defense, disable, revive, rotate, remove, move. While the connect three mechanic helps make up for this overall, it does prevent the game from being more enjoyable. I like me some crazy card effects.\n\nUp to Personal Taste:\n-Art style. I'm neutral to the art style. That's generally how I am for most games. Look at the screenshots and decide for yourself if the art style is going to throw you off.\n-Humor. The game seems to be trying to go for some humor. I chuckled once, and that was it. However, I didn't find the humor to be intrusive to the experience.\n\nBtw, game took me 11 hours to beat. In my opinion, that's a solid amount of time for $2.\nAnybody who enjoyed the old Pokemon TCG game or the Yu-gi-oh Single-Player games, I'd very much recommend getting this.

Just go buy the freaking game.)\nI would like to start out by saying that I have a lot of experience with TCG's. I played Magic: The Gathering for a while, and I liked it but I was never in love with it. The game that I really fell in love with was Yugioh- which, from about 2010 to early 2012, was the best card game of all time, no holds barred, perfect pacing, for most of those formats well balanced, all playstyles were represented, and most importantly a deep, deep, deep, DEEP card pool that constantly rewarded me for scrolling through lists of cards, pointing at a random one with weird subtext and saying "I'm gonna make a deck around that one!" But eventually, konami ruined everything, the game sped up until it was too fast, the power crept up until I couldn't build a creative deck and survive against anyone competent for more than a turn or two, and the community got even worse. The state that it was in was much akin to the happy accidents of "Super Smash Bros. Melee" or "Marvel vs. Capcom 2" in that they probably didn't actually think about how the things they added affected the meta game, but eventually it somehow turned out fantastic. I'm saying all of this because Card City Nights reminds me of this era of yugioh. Very different gameplay, yes, but I'm not talking about the gameplay. There are two very important things that this game gets very right and other digital tcg's get very very wrong: card collection and deck building.\nWhen you play hearthstone, and even scrolls (despite mojang having no motive to do so since it already costs 20 bucks), you might notice that you get like, 1-2 packs a day. Even if you get really good at drafting in hearthstone, you get a good pack or two every hour- if you're really, really good and really, really lucky. Card city nights, on the other hand, gives you a pack like every 5 minutes. And then gives you the option to use your extra cards to get more packs. And then gives you a fusion system to get more cards. And gives you a large singles shop. Seriously, collecting all the cards available to you in their maximum usable quantities seems so doable in this game, whereas every other online tcg asks me to grind for weeks or months just to finish my damn deck!\nPerhaps the best part of the fact that Card City Nights gives you so many cards, is that the deck building involves a lot of creativity and strategy and is just overall fantastic. Deckbuilding in other games seems very one-dimensional compared to Card City Nights... Cards fit together in unique ways, and not only do you have to think about your strategy and what each card is contributing to your strategy and the synergies between them and all of that stuff, but you have to think about the synergy between their arrows, think about the combos you could make with this deck... it adds a lot of depth to deck building. I'm not entirely sure if it was intentional or a byproduct of the gameplay, but either way I love it. Other than that, for a game I spent $2 on, the card pool is impressive (with an implication of more cards coming at the end) and the cards are designed well, giving some good strategies and combinations to build decks around without enforcing them as cards that need to be used together.\nSo all this should come together to be a great card game, right? Well, this review unfortunately ends in tragedy, as Card City Nights lacks a key component to this equation- multiplayer. It practically ruins everything I've just said. I can build all these great decks and collect all these cards and it won't mean anything in the end, because there's no ultimate test of my deck against another and there's no one who cares about my innovation when it's all within a relatively easy single player game. However, it's not a stretch to say that, in the event that online is patched in, and more cards are released, and the game is balanced a bit for competitive play, this could become the best tcg on the market.\nIt has a good base and a fun singleplayer, even if it lacks some fundamental elements necessary for it to become really great. It's worth the price of admission, and it could eventually be worth 100 times that if the game's potential is explored. In the end I still had a great time with it, even if it never becomes more than it is.","February 18, 2014","true","21.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although, the nature of the game allows almost any card to be countered pretty easily. The moment I played through the first fight, I knew I'd be going for a full Attack deck 'cause it's basically a fast tempo deck; Quick damage to the enemy.\n\nThe enemies past the first two areas finally start to challenge you, but the initial battles felt way too easy. The AI basically plopped cards randomly onto the board. It really gave me a sense of, "this is gonna be bad." But eeeh, it turned out great.\n\nThe music is so freakin' good, it's definitely got to be one of the reasons I couldn't let the game go in my most recent, 9 hour session.. Instrumental hip hop beauty, like nectar to the ears :P\n\nThe developers really liked to give their stance on the corporate life. So subtle, so Business Casual. It didn't take away from the game all that much, but the issue goes back to the intial battles.... Making battles far too easy to make the enemy player seem incompetent. It kind of ruins the flow of difficulty.\n\nEither way, great game, very much a throwback to Pokemon as far as story, goals, and battles come into play. The two points lost were due to the integral loss of difficulty and certain card combinations _somewhat_ breaking the game. Would play again in the future, most definitely.","April 15, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The video, good player reviews and the great price (2 Euros) made it quite a no-brainer for me and I wasn’t a disappointment. The basic rules are really simple, and even though there are lots of special cards/rules, it isn’t exactly mind-bending (and I mean that in a good way) the gameplay is still fast and fluent.\n\nI haven’t completed the game yet (about 80%) but definitely will. The NPC players have different playing styles what makes the deck-building worthwhile (as it should be in a single-player game). The overall difficulty progression feels good to me. Replay value is most likely not that big, at least at my current point of view.

I am a casual player and don't have the patience for anything "hardcore" or otherwise overly time consuming. So I usually play fairly shallow "casual" games and then figure out what the mechanics are and get bored, or I try deeper games and then the difficult ramps up too high for casual play.\n\nSo far this has been a game which I keep going back to because the difficulty ramps up gradually, introducing interesting variations on the core mechanic. For instance, I built an attack-heavy deck and was coasting through most battles until I got to an opponent that had a better attack-oriented deck than mine. I was at an impasse, but then one of the characters recommended that I try going for disabling cards instead of dealing direct damage. Great suggestion! Now I'm thinking future opponents will try this strategy on me and I'm considering adding more revival-type cards to my deck. What I appreciate about this game is that it's got me thinking about strategies without going into hardcore deck building territory. However, it's not a shallow game like you find with, for instance, most mobile games. There's a story, characters, and a progression of mechanics so you're not just playing the same board over and over. It's the perfect mix of narrative and strategic depth with casual play.\n\nI got this game on sale on a whim and now I wish there was a Kickstarter because I'd like to give them 10x what I paid so that they will make more games like this. I guess I will just go buy all their other games too! Good job you guys, you've made a fan.\n","February 16, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seems simply at first, and you'll steamroll the first few guys who are pretty aimless, but when the tricks start to come out, you can't help but be personally challenged! I was actually disappointed because I hoped for more development and more difficult tricks on the opponent's side to make things more interesting, but not because it bored me so much as it would keep me playing longer!

It reminds me a bit of the Final Fantasy 8 card mini-game.  You and your opponent place cards on a 3x3 grid.  You link your cards together via connecting arrows and, depending on the card effects and icons, can either attack your opponent''s health, disable their cards, increase your own health, or revive your own cards (for the most part.)  You build your own card deck and unlock new cards as you go.  The AI is pretty mediocre.  It's enjoyable enough, but really would need another couple game mechanics and a better AI to really shine.\n\n(Minor spoiler) The biggest negative I have against the game comes at the very end - the final boss is deliberately unfair.  They even say straight up that they don't have to follow the same rules as you do.  Just because the game's AI is ♥♥♥♥ doesn't mean that it's fair to balance it by straight up cheating.","April 7, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am a casual player and don't have the patience for anything "hardcore" or otherwise overly time consuming. So I usually play fairly shallow "casual" games and then figure out what the mechanics are and get bored, or I try deeper games and then the difficult ramps up too high for casual play.\n\nSo far this has been a game which I keep going back to because the difficulty ramps up gradually, introducing interesting variations on the core mechanic. For instance, I built an attack-heavy deck and was coasting through most battles until I got to an opponent that had a better attack-oriented deck than mine. I was at an impasse, but then one of the characters recommended that I try going for disabling cards instead of dealing direct damage. Great suggestion! Now I'm thinking future opponents will try this strategy on me and I'm considering adding more revival-type cards to my deck. What I appreciate about this game is that it's got me thinking about strategies without going into hardcore deck building territory. However, it's not a shallow game like you find with, for instance, most mobile games. There's a story, characters, and a progression of mechanics so you're not just playing the same board over and over. It's the perfect mix of narrative and strategic depth with casual play.\n\nI got this game on sale on a whim and now I wish there was a Kickstarter because I'd like to give them 10x what I paid so that they will make more games like this. I guess I will just go buy all their other games too! Good job you guys, you've made a fan.\n","February 16, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't find myself being forced to change strategies or build specific decks to beat the opponents which just meant replacing attack cards with blatently better attack cards and changing which legendary I'd use every now and then.\n\nAnother problem is that there's no way of telling how many total cards you've collected so there's no way of seeing if you've collected all the cards in a certain pack or gotten all the cards in the game which would of been nice to see, the only real stat it gives you is a win/loss ratio.\n\nOverall I think I got my moneys worth out of it and with 183 cards (apparently) there's plenty of different decks to make though there's not many characters to try them out on and they won't put up much of a fight.","February 16, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rather than going for a complicated ruleset, the base rules are straightforward, but there's just enough variety in the cards available to allow for a number of strategic options in deckbuilding, and the excellent soundtrack helps the game's upbeat feeling. The difficulty curve is just about perfect if you hate getting "stuck" in games, as well... only in one or two places did I ever feel I wasn't quite "getting it."\n\nThere's also some fanservice here, as the characters/cards are mostly from the company's other games, but it's unobtrusive enough that those unfamiliar won't find it distracting. (Of course, if you're me, you will squeal in astonished joy the first time you see an Iji or General Kor card.) Those seeking a great story should look elsewhere; although the characters feel well fleshed out and the writing is clever, more emphasis is put on gameplay than worldbuilding or plot, which I feel serves the game well. The card game mechanics form a solid core, and nearly everything present here is in service of that.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a definite recommendation from me. It won't change your life, it won't suck away weeks of your time, and it won't provide anything truly revolutionary that you'll measure other games up against for years to come... but what it will do is provide a solid, fun experience for relatively little money. There's some great value here. Give the game a try; it's fun stuff.","March 29, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the game you play as a kid who just found out about a new card game that has become real popular. By playing with some kids you find out about 8 Legendary cards that if all collected let you face the card king. The gameplay is a 3-3 grid per player where you place cards with arrows any try to connect them for combo effects. There are 4 different types of cards Attack (damage/disable), Defense (heal), Revive (recover disable) and Neutral (any). Comboing cards and using special effects makes the game a blast. You can build your deck however you want and there are a lot of ways to beak opponents such as milling, (removing cards from deck) or board crowding (filling up opponents board). Every deck has its weakness and even the best player is vulnerable. The cards themselves are past games the developer has done and its adds nice style and character to the game.

First off, it serves a satire of other TCG shows and games. If you've played the Pokemon TCG game for the gameboy color, you will notice the parallels. Parallels which are twisted into a funny, lighthearted experience. At the same time it is a crossover of many of Ludosity's different titles. If you're like me, the only character is recognized was the protagonist of Ittle Dew, a game I still haven't played (for now).  The game developers did not let this stop them from making the experience enjoyable, and made the rather smart decision of making said characters alternate versions that reflect the original form's personality and behavior but belong exclusively to that world. The visual designs have also been updated to maximize the effect. And as a result, the cards you collect become more enjoyable, as you draw the parallels between the characters of Card City Nights and the characters of the original games. And speaking of cards, the actual game is a nice, casual experience. The developers were able to take a rather simple concept for a card game, and still make it enjoyable. The music is wonderful as well. It is a light treat for the ears that doesn't provide any distractions that might ruin your cool strategies. My one complaint is that the game is only single player, but the games build up as a casual adventure doesn't really allow for that. I would recommend this game if you love TCGs and/or are looking for a casual experience. I also recommend you experience with different decks and go for all of the achievements. With only 8 achievements, it is very easy to obtain 100% completion for this game. Happy dueling, and may the 8 Legendaries fall into your hands!","March 28, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is good humor and design in the art and characteres and presentation; it really draws you in by virtue of being friendly.\n\nAbout the game itself? Masterpiece. This kind of card game is hard to come by - that is, a game that is played casually, with simple rules, but has an underlying complexity when determining strategy. It seems simply at first, and you'll steamroll the first few guys who are pretty aimless, but when the tricks start to come out, you can't help but be personally challenged! I was actually disappointed because I hoped for more development and more difficult tricks on the opponent's side to make things more interesting, but not because it bored me so much as it would keep me playing longer! As an added touch, it's the only card game I've ever seen where the players sit side-by-side instead of facing each other when they play.\n\nBuy it? I already have it, but I would buy it at full price, even if the cost was doubled or so.

It reminds me a bit of the Final Fantasy 8 card mini-game.  You and your opponent place cards on a 3x3 grid.  You link your cards together via connecting arrows and, depending on the card effects and icons, can either attack your opponent''s health, disable their cards, increase your own health, or revive your own cards (for the most part.)  You build your own card deck and unlock new cards as you go.  The AI is pretty mediocre.  It's enjoyable enough, but really would need another couple game mechanics and a better AI to really shine.\n\n(Minor spoiler) The biggest negative I have against the game comes at the very end - the final boss is deliberately unfair.  They even say straight up that they don't have to follow the same rules as you do.  Just because the game's AI is ♥♥♥♥ doesn't mean that it's fair to balance it by straight up cheating.","April 7, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I only used my mouse and didn't try the other control methods, or was even aware there were any.\n\nTrue to its name, Card City Nights is a collectible card game with a strong focus on combat.  As a new arrival to the island, you quickly learn about the game and how everyone is positively bonkers about it.  The plot is fairly basic--find the eight Legendary cards and face the Card King in combat for the million-coin prize.  The protagonist resists at first, but they have a free deck of cards and there are plenty of people to face, so why not?\n\nThe tutorial gave a pretty easy overview of the rules.  You and your opponent each have a 3x3 board, a coin is flipped to determine who goes first, and you both draw five cards to form your hand.  Then it's a matter of linking your cards' arrows together in order to attack, defend, and recover.  You lose if your life hits zero, if you fill your board and can't place a card, or if you completely run out of cards to play.  Matches are played in best of 1/3/5 format, and there didn't seem to be a penalty for losing other than having to start that fight over from the beginning.  Several cards have a variety of effects, such as one reviving a random downed card and then disappearing off board, or moving to an open space every time you start your turn, or having an additional effect depending on what kind of combo it's a part of.\n\nAnd like most other card games, most of the game takes place outside of battle where you try to put together a deck that can't be beat.  You have to build a deck of 25 to 40 cards, and you're allowed five dupes of common cards, three of uncommon, only one rare, and only one total Legendary per deck, so there's a lot of options.  My interest in the game kinda waned until I woke up and just made a deck from scratch, paying attention to arrows and effects I wanted.  Everyone in the game uses a different deck though they only stick to one, so you could honestly tailor a deck around destroying specifically everyone as you play.  In battle, you're at the mercy of RNG on your draws as well as what the opponent feels like using on you, but outside of perceived biases, the game felt fair about random targets.  Kinda hard to say that when victory is snatched from you with a convenient draw for your opponent, though.\n\nI was kinda surprised at how much dialog there is.  You can talk with several people at each location and everyone has quite a few things to say, especially if you can fight them since they'll have different things then.  Of course this is entirely optional, but it's kinda neat.  Characters have things to say about other people, or you, or other things.  One NPC in the mall had what felt like 100 things to say, though thankfully that wasn't the norm.  That all of the characters come from prior Ludosity/Daniel Remar games might be a treat to some, seeing familiar faces in different roles (and on the cards), but this was my first so I'll be facing retroactive recognition whenever I go back for Ittle Dew and pick up some of the others.\n\nAs for things I didn't like...I initially didn't like that you couldn't outright buy new cards.  When the shop unlocks early in the story, you're only able to buy extra copies of the non-Legendary cards you have already.  To get new cards, you have to fight certain NPCs for their boosters (or trade them in later on), so you're at the mercy of RNG for what cards you receive, but each booster NPC provides only one specific pack and each card is tied to a specific booster.  You can keep fighting them to eventually get the cards you want, but my only other complaint is that there's no card catalog to fill out.  It'd have been especially helpful to at least see what cards you have/have seen/haven't seen so as to know how to get that amazing card you saw your opponent use and to scratch that completionist's itch, but I guess the guides on Steam have you covered there if you want to do some cross-referencing.\n\nOverall, I liked CCN and I think it's definitely worth the buck I gave for it.  If you're into card collecting or deck building or whatnot, you'd probably like it too.  Difficulty is kinda hard to pin down since each person has their own deck setup, so you can go from being stonewalled to being locked down to being blitzed to being drained of cards.  You'll probably have to lose your first fights with everyone so you can learn their decks and how to counter them, so that might turn some people off.  But as someone who seems to have interest in card games but rarely plays them, this was not a waste of time at all.","May 13","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The basics are "Combine this card with another card so the arrows line up on each other". And that's all you basically do. I wasn't drawn into this game really, since it's pretty much a farming Card Game.\n\nLet me explain: You fight against someone and you can get a Booster Pack. That is the ONLY way to get a booster pack as far as I've seen it. The game gives you coins from which you can buy new Boards (cosmetic) or cards. Cards you already own to be exact. So you have to beat one guy over and over to have a chance of a new card. Why can't I buy booster packs with higher rarities with my money I earned?\n\nPersonally, I can not recommend it, since it feels too farm-intensive to be truly enjoyable. The graphics and the music are quite nice to be honest.","July 7, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/recommended/271820/","fortheussr","chairbender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/","342 products in account","This game has cards that are strictly better than other cards. At some point in the game, you get into a situation where you need to grind for better cards by continuously re-battling opponents. If the card game felt super-awesomely fun, this would be perfectly acceptable, but it tends to feel more frustrating and anti-fun than I'd expect in a game. Some battles are best of three or even best of five, which is normal for how card games work, but just feels like kind of a repetitive slog.\n\nThis would be more fun as a mobile game (and it IS available on mobile platforms) where you're not sitting down and expecting a game to provide you with an evening of entertainment. As a desktop game, it's kind of lacking in the entertainment department when you look at all the other games you could be playing on PC that you can't play on a mobile device.\n\nI'm not a big fan of most turn-based games for the PC, though (but I prefer it for mobile games). Usually, it's because they lack the level of excitement that you get from time constraints and developing reflexes and hand-eye coordination. This game certainly doesn't go the extra mile to buck that trend and provide a sense of excitement and engagement.\n\nI like the art style, writing, and music. I just don't much care for sitting at my computer playing what feels like a mobile game. Also, I find the mechanics of the card game  and the game in general to be frustrating, especially with cards that have random abilities, cards being strictly better than other cards, and having to grind to get better cards.","October 9, 2015","false","2.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

There is a surprising amount of depth for what at first seems like a really simple game.  That being said - I have been using the same basic deck for the whole game with little challenge.  The game actually gets easier as you go (at least through the turnip factory/bar) - I had the most trouble with the first boss mainly because I was learning the game.  Each opponent brings a different feeling deck to the table, but some of the decks only work in theory.  The AI is very basic - I would love to play this multiplayer.\n\nThe legendary cards that I have encountered so far are pretty weak.  Out of the 3 or 4 I have gotten I am only using 1 and I could easily take it out with no effect to my deck.\n\nWhen I first wrote this review, there was a game breaking bug.  It was fixed in under a day. This tells me that the developers care about this game and are willing to put in the effort to create a good product.","February 14, 2014","true","11.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

For the price, you could easily do worse. But, when I honestly think if I'd recommend this game to someone... I have to say the answer is no. But you could easily do worse, and there's a fair amount of content for the asking price.\n\nFor the game itself, it's fairly simple. You play a relatively simple card game against AI opponents throughout a number of enviornments. The core of the game is easy to pick up without much difficulty. You connect cards on a 3x3 grid using the arrows on the cards to do an effect. The effect depends on the card, which will have symbols on it. You win if your opponent can't play anymore cards due to their board filling up or if they lose all their health. Personally, I found attacking opponents' cards and stalling their board to be the most effective way to deal with most opponents.\n\nIn order to not go on and on, here's a list of the things I liked and disliked about the game.\n\n+Simple art style\n+Low price\n+Decently entertaining gameplay\n+Good Sense of humor\n-Art style seems too simple sometimes, with repetitive designs. Card art style seems unfocused.\n-Cheating AI (sometimes literally)\n-Gameplay gets old fast\n-The system to get new packs and better cards feels somewhat convoluted and grindy.\n-There doesn't seem to be an options menu I could find. I couldn't figure out where to change my board, or adjust volume, or do similar important things.","December 17, 2014","false","10.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The card game is fun, but it's too easy to just nuke most opponents with a very aggressive deck, especially with the cards that instantly do damage. There were only TWO times that I had to make a special deck to defeat someone, and that counter-deck-making is usually half the fun in this sort of game. The cards are all based on characters from Ludosity's earlier games, but you don't need to be familiar with them (I wasn't). I guess that being familiar with them would make it easier to guess what cards to combine to get new ones, but there's a guide for that here on Steam. The game's writing is very entertaining (I didn't expect to see a ROT13 reference in 2014!) to the point where I went out of my way to milk every bit of dialog from the characters.

The card game is fun, but it's too easy to just nuke most opponents with a very aggressive deck, especially with the cards that instantly do damage. There were only TWO times that I had to make a special deck to defeat someone, and that counter-deck-making is usually half the fun in this sort of game. The cards are all based on characters from Ludosity's earlier games, but you don't need to be familiar with them (I wasn't). I guess that being familiar with them would make it easier to guess what cards to combine to get new ones, but there's a guide for that here on Steam. The game's writing is very entertaining (I didn't expect to see a ROT13 reference in 2014!) to the point where I went out of my way to milk every bit of dialog from the characters.

So far its ok I have only played about one hour. The whole game is to make 3 cards touch arrows to either do damage or defense. The rules are a slightly more complicated but thats about the gist of the game not including the strange cards that turn some cards upside down and other strange cards.\n\nThe artwork is nice however the game features no animation in any of the boss battles or the people you meet or fight against. A little animation would have been nice, maybe moving a arm or having one of them wink something right now it feels like a comic book.  The music is very nice and relaxing and does fit the play style of the game. You can also talk to certain people in this game however its a very short conversation mostly just lets fight or tips on how to play so far.\n\nThe card battles are ok.  Bascially you have a deck of cards in your library and they shuffle them up and give you 5 of them and you have to be able to play at least one or you lose. The game does have potential however a few things hold it back for me. The game feels lifeless to me the people you meet are boring/lifeless and the card game while fun is kind of the same. The game is just dull over all.\n\nExamples the smashing sound when you hit an opponent  should be a Boom! instead you get pew pew the you win sign should be booming instead you get a sign saying win with little fanfare. I do like the art style of the cards. I really dont hate this game however like I have stated I find it kind of boring overall. I think a small part of it has to do with little to no animation in the game. The cards  are static, people are static the only "action" you do see on screen is the hits and a rotating circle sometimes. Again lifeless comes to mind for me a lot. I can find no fault but I dont find anything compelling about it as well .. A game should hook me and want me to play further and so far there just isnt a big enough hook. 5/10 is what I would rate this right now. I may change my mind later after more playing.","February 15, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Card City Nights is an indie trading card game from Ludosity. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nOnce you figure out that the strategy of crippling the cards your opponent has on the board is the only viable strategy, you’ve found your golden ticket to finishing the game.\n\nThe store system was easy to use and it’s always nice to be able to supplement your deck with better cards sans a booster pack. (The booster packs were usually alright though).\n\nTo it’s credit, there are no in game transactions for real money in CCN, a problem that plagues games of this nature nowadays.\n\nThe Bad\n\nAt first, CCN seemed like it would be pretty fun. I was swiftly proved wrong by how incredibly repetitive the game got. You’re going to get bored, I guarantee it.\n\nThe Meh\n\nThere wasn’t really much of a story, the characters are largely forgettable, and you’ll finally realize this is time out of your life that you’re not getting back which, unavoidably, leads to a mild feeling of depression.\n\nVerdict: Nay\n\nMaybe if you see it on sale for super cheap and you’re really curious about whether or not CCN is as bad as I think it is, you could get it. Or, you could be wise and spend your money on a better game. As always, thanks for reading and apologies for the short review.

You then place cards on the board and match these direction arrows up to make "combos". A potentially fun concept but it really struggles in its execution.\n\nA lot of different arrow combinations means you are going to struggle early in the game when you don't have a good number of cards to draw from. This is a problem because that moment when you place the cards perfect and get a nice combo together, you get that warm fuzzy feeling and it is the primary draw of a game like this. Those moments however, will be few and far between in the early going. This leaves the user with a sense of confusion and lack of will to keep trying to better their decks.\n\nI may perhaps have a higher standard of TCGs, as I'm a long time player of games like Magic, 7th Sea, and others. You may find some enjoyment here that I could not, especially if you are willing to tough it out in the early going.  If not however, you will be very disappointed in the games fun factor.","February 18, 2014","false","3.0"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesnoctis/recommended/271820/","milesnoctis","Miles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesnoctis/","411 products in account","Summary: A very simplisitc game that seems to be targeted towards casuals, and even they may have trouble enjoying the game.\n\nThe basic gameplay is this: The two players play on separate 3x3 boards. Each draws cards from their decks and place them on the board, one per turn. The cards have arrows pointing in anywhere from 0 to 6 directions. Linking 3 or more to make a combo is your primary method of attack and defense. You can do damage to the player or disable their cards on the board. The advantage of disabling cards is they can no longer link together, though they can be healed. You win if you can drop their life to zero or their field fills up and they can no longer place cards. If a player runs out of cards, they don't immediately lose, but damage is dealt to them each turn by the board.\n\nThere's very little strategy involved. You fill your deck with cards that will link together easily. Beating enemies is mostly luck based, since they tend to have weird and unpredictable cards, like ones that randomly rotate or move cards. The winning strategy is often just to disable as many cards as possible without regard to health.\n\nOverall, veteran gamers will find this simplistic and boring, while casual players with not be especially enthralled.","March 27, 2014","false","2.0"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

Meaning you keep getting the same cards so there's no way to build a better deck by vs-ing the same\nold opponents.\nThis isn't a negative, I'm just stating it.\n\nOne thing I did find strange though, is there's no penalty for losing, at least from what I recall.\n(it's been about a month since I've played and I've just started getting into the game from scratch again.)\nWould be nice for some sort of 'Hardcore' mode where you lose something from losing, cards or something.\n\nThere's a nice degree of humour in the game.. I've never played the developers other games such as The Little Dew.\nBut from what I can tell it isn't necessary to have experience in that lore.\nHumour such as; early on you'll be dualing with cards titled 'Stick' which is a weapon that's just a stick.\n\nThere is a decent variety of decks, as you progress.\nWith the early decks being comprised of 'sticks' and 'old men.'\nSome other decks are futuristic decks, monster decks, and a few others I can't recall off the top of my head.\n\nWell enough of my blabbering on.\nIf you ever get an itch for a Singleplayer CCG, give this game a whirl, it should suck you in nicely.","February 2, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don’t like TCGs IRL but I do tend to like them on a PC, and I really enjoyed this game. So if this is in your wheelhouse, buy this game immediately!\n\nThis is a great fun game, what indie games are all about. The graphics are average, there is no voice work, the music is repetitive (though not terrible for an indie like this), the conversation is in the cheesy tongue-in-cheek variety but none of that matters, nor detracts from the fun. I understand this is also an Android tablet game, and it does have that feel, but not in any kind of bad way. Just that it feels like I could easily play it on one of my tabs and get the same enjoyment.\n\nThe card system is very simple but well thought out and complete. With 187 or so cards well designed around specific ideas, there is room to make several kinds of successful decks. The balance (as of 5/22) is pretty good. I found a deck attacking the opponent’s number of cards was the most challenging to make work right and an attack deck the easiest, so the balance does tip a bit to the attack and defense based cards.\n\nI have 10 hours in, I got to 100% completion and I enjoyed every minute. My 10 hours would probably be around 20 if you grind. However, I don’t like to grind and the devs give you an easy way to avoid that without throwing the game off with cheats. Your card library is in a text file that you can edit to add more copies of cards you already earned (and add new cards as well, if you are so inclined). So you don’t need to go through hours of battling to gain booster packs or gold, and just do the duels you want while using in-game tools (card recycler, card mixer) to expand the kinds of cards you have quicker. I really appreciated this!\n\nEven at my 10 hours and at the non-sale price, I would say you get great fun for your buck. The only thing I would like to see in a sequel is multiplayer. Other than that, more cards for more deck ideas and the ability to import/use our deck and library.

The game features characters and art styling from Ittle Dew, which may mean it is set in the same world. The goal is to defeat the opponent by either draining their defense to 0 through attacks or forced card draws (the opponent looses defense when they are out of cards and are given random cards) or forcing the opponent to fill their 9x9 card board with cards, leaving them with no way to complete combos. Card combos are made by linking three symbols from cards  in a almost tic-tac-toe fashion, where each card has an arrow pointing to where it can be connected. Combos include attack to damage defense or disable enemy cards, defense to restore your defense, revive to enable disabled cards and neutral to act as filler for other combos. Some cards have different effects, such as multiple symbols so it only needs a second card instead of a third, or rotating player or enemy cards.\n\nIt's a cute little card game that's quite casual, and most importantly, inexpensive at full retail.  I found the character design and interactions to be rather charming and definitely a more laid back exprience than Magic or Hearthstone.  I don't feel like this is a must play by any means, but it is a good CCG that in the worst case scenario, won't hurt your wallet much.","December 15, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By the time the game increases in difficulty, you will have some legendary and rare cards to deal with it.\n\nThe downsides are that the game only has a story mode (no multiplayer). The art style may turn people off too, but I like the charm of the characters and cartoon nature of it. The company that makes this game makes apps too, but I've never played any of them, so I don't recognize any of the characters.\n\nThis charming, strategic card game is $4, and you will easily get your monies worth. I highly recommend this game.","February 26, 2015","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I have yet to play through the game again with the new patches but from the little I replayed so far, the game is still as fun as I left it the first time I completed it) Card City Nights is a good small game to enjoy with some decent fun being able to be had for simply 15 minutes of Gameplay.

So yes, I have to recommend this game for those who like casual puzzle games, solitaire games, or trading card games. I've never played "Magic: The Gathering" or similar collectible card game, but "Card City Nights" has a unique card-linking mechanic that appears to set this game apart from the other games.\n\nThe game has very pleasant cartoon-style imagery and pleasant-enough music and sound. The interface is easy to come to grips with, and the tutorial mode is reasonably effective in teaching you the basic gameplay mechanics. The story is pleasant and involving enough, providing the motivation to keep playing further.\n\nIf you’ve noticed, the key word I’m using to describe “Card City Nights” is “pleasant.”  The basic card-game mechanic is challenging and fun, and I’m motivated to keep playing until I beat the game.\n\nIf you like “casual” games like “Bejewelled” or “Solitaire” or other such games, I think you’ll like this one, although it’s a bit more complicated due to the “card collecting” motif. “Card City Nights” is certainly a worthy game for anyone who likes casual games or “collectible card” games.","June 8, 2014","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has such a low price that I'd argue I'm stealing from the nice people at Ludosity, and that'd make me sad.

Firstly, it's manaless, which means that you do not require any farming of resources to play a card, and secondly, you create combos to attack and defend yourself, using the arrows drawn on the cards. At the same time, it has good drawings for each of the cards, most of which are characters from Ludosity's earlier works. For a price of $3.99, it is a must buy. Great replayability, as you constantly want to improve your end-game stats. It does not have any in-app purchases, which means you are not troubled by any future payments for additional content in the game. However, it lacks constant game updates, which means that the game content stays stagnant for a significant amount of time. Also, it is a single player game, this makes it impossible to challenge human players who have newer decks, further incresing our gaming experience. So we can only play with A.I. opponents. This makes the game frustrating to play. At the same time, this game does not deserve a TCG tag, because you don't get to trade cards with other players in the game.","March 30, 2014","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are few things as fun as opening packs of cards, and this game throws enough your way as to make you positively addicted. The game's main flaw (it is rather short) is also its saving grace, as I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to tear myself away from the screen unless I had already accomplished everything within the first day!\n\nPros:\n- Innovative, fun, and clever gameplay. It may appear simple at first, but there is surprising depth.\n- You get to open tons of booster packs and form a huge card collection. How sweet is that! Also, there's no in-game purchases or anything like that. My hat is off to you, Ludosity, for having some moral fiber, especially within a genre of game that seems to feature some of the most rampant abuse of "pay-to-win."\n- Super lighthearted and dumb characters, cards, and locations. The aesthetic quality of the art is great!\n- Really nice music. I'm a musician and producer, and I really enjoyed the tunes. Game music is often tired and boring, but not here.\n-Crafting and recycling system which allows you to get rid of excess cards that you don't want, and discover new cards!\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat short game. I've played a total of 7 hours, and done all the fights and achievements. To be fair, I went through very quickly, playing a very fast "RDW" style burn-to-the-face deck. I'm fairly experienced with CCGs, so I was able to be pretty efficient. Also, this was before the balance patch, so that particular style of play is a bit harder now.\n- General card and deck management is kind of annoying. It can be a bit of a pain to constantly have to scroll through your collection, especially once you open a few hundred boosters. Additionally, when you're buying and selling cards, it's difficult to know how many of each you actually own, because cards that are currently in decks can't be sold.\n- Rehab expenses are pretty high if you want to stop playing Card City Nights for good.\n","June 4, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it in the initial sale, and it's one of the more satisfying $3 I've ever spent on a game.\n\nThe card game itself could probably use some more balancing, but since you only play against AIs which are not always the smartest about how they play (and seem to all cheat a bit about what is in their hands), it's hard to say how things would work out between humans. As it stands, it seems like pure attack decks (with only a small amount of defence/revival in the form of cards with special properties) are unreasonably good compared to practically anything else. Part of that is that players only have 7 life and that maxes out at 10, beyond which more defence won't help, and the attacking player will also have the option to disable the defensive player's cards about as quickly as they can attempt to form combos. With a decent attack deck, you can easily deal a consistent 4-6 damage every 3 turns, with an occasional burst that's even higher if you get a nice hand. (It's possible to win on turn 3 before your opponent has a chance to even do anything.)\n\nI think it would be reasonable to increase the starting defence and to increase or remove the cap.\n\nI beat the game the first time through with an infinite win/loss ratio using essentially the same strategy the whole way, augmenting my deck with cards as I obtained them. But despite the fact that it's on the easy side in absolute terms it's still a lot of fun to play. It could use a New Game Plus sort of option, and it would also be nice if after you won the game, the bosses and other characters would all play cards, rather than just the few characters which offer booster packs.","February 22, 2014","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It turns out there's more to the card game mechanics than it would seem at first glance. Card City Nights gives you a 3x3 grid to play cards on, and asks you to make combos by joining groups of two or three cards together to perform certain actions. Cards connect to each other only in certain ways, so making sure you've got the right cards in your deck and knowing when to deploy them is crucial. Later you'll discover different ways to interact with cards, including rotating, moving and disabling cards, lending additional depth to the game.\n\nBeating the game itself is relatively straightforward, though certain opponents will exploit weaknesses in your strategy, forcing you to take a second look at your deck. The real fun parts lie in trying to get the achievements, which really get you to closely examine the cards available to you and think about how you can combine them to achieve goals that seemed impossible at the start of the game.\n\nOutside the basic gameplay, the art style's pretty neat (though it's an acquired taste) and the music is pretty addictive. The story is really just there to lend some structure to the card battles, but the recurring cast of characters are at least endearing and goofy. Overall, I was surprised by how much I liked this game. Definitely worth the four bucks.","February 22, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems inspired by a bunch of card/collection-focused games, from Triple Triad (some gameplay mechanics) to Pokemon (mainly story progression and characters), and it all works pretty well together. The presentation/art is pretty good too, simple but very likable, although it does have some tablety crap going on here and there in the UI, like possibly the worst scrollbars I have ever seen in my life.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward, matching arrows on the sides of cards to chain them together and make combos to attack/defend/cause other effects. The basics were very easy to pick up, and the addition of extra effects on new cards you get as you progress adds more depth to it. Unfortunately getting new cards that do interesting things feels kinda slow to me, and I think I'm losing interest in the early part of the game faster than it's giving me stuff from the later part of the game. I don't see myself finishing it, but it's so absurdly cheap that it could be worth checking out if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nEdit: A better card game (not on Steam) that I've been trying to think of the name of all day since playing this one is The Trouble With Robots.

It's simple but charming and along the way you run into a nice cast of fun characters to battle against and earn cards, gold and sometimes even new boards from.\n\nI found the rules really easy to understand and the discovery of new cards very enjoyable. An autosave function after every match or change of environment means that you can quit and continue later at any point in the game.\nThere are also other functions where you can combine some cards into new ones as well as trading in cards you don't need for boosters.\nThe graphics were quite charming and some of the illustrations made me laugh a few times.\n\nOn the downside I'd say that the game was a bit easy and I wouldn't mind a filter option in the alchemy lab.\n\nAll in all, with lots of cards to collect and being able to continue even after finishing the game I say that this is a really good casual card game that I had a lot of fun playing. In addition to that it's also very cheap!\n\nI believe the game deserves a 4 ^^\n\n1 - Crap, don't buy\n2 - Fun for an evening\n3 - It's an alright game but not my taste\n4 - Great game\n5 - One of the best I've ever played","February 20, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And unlike your run of the mill card games this one, although is still somewhat based on the luck of the draw, if you balance your deck well you may still be able to win even with a bad hand.\n\nThat's what's so good about this game, there's barely any grind and winning is not based on how good your cards are but how you play them. It's also different in that as you progress, you don't simply get better cards to play with and have a easier time winning. Even in the final battle you'll find yourself using some of the starter cards.\n\nIn short, if you want a brilliant combination of a 2D puzzle, strategy and a card game that is unlike any other card game I've played, I highly recommend this.

This genre of game is one of my favorites, as were Magic: the Gathering: Shandalar and Pokemon Trading Card Game for Game Boy Color. So few of these games are made nowadays that really, I'll take whatever I can get, so when I saw this game on sale for $2, I jumped on it.\n\nIn the card game, you place cards on a 3x3 grid. Link arrows on the cards to make combos, which can lock down your opponents cards, release your own, boost your life total, or hurt your opponent. You win by reducing your opponent to 0 or by making them unable to play by filling up their grid or depleting their deck. The nice thing is that the game is fairly elegant, and most of the game's strategies involve using relatively simple cards. The strategy in deck building comes from putting together a good theme and making sure you can get the arrows to line up properly. There are a lot of card with powerful abilities that are rendered near useless because they only have one arrow.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, it's clear that this game was meant to celebrate this developer's previous titles. The only one of those games I had played (or heard of) previously was the fairly good Zelda clone, Ittle Dew, so I got a few of the self-referential jokes. Even if you're not in on the references, though, and I doubt you will be, this game has a lot of goofy humor, between the bizarre characters and funny backgrounds. I thought the music in this game was fine, with the exception of one or two tracks thay annoyed me. The art style is very cartoony and drawn in very thick lines, and I think the graphics work well enough. I would have liked a few more choices for your avatar, though.\n\nOverall, Card City Nights is a pretty solid card game and an amazing bargain at $4. If you enjoy collectible card games, then this is definitely worth picking up and playing for a few hours.\n\n","February 18, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lot of complexity, choice, and expression in building your own deck.\n\nI'm going to be printing a copy of this game out for my personal use and potentially recruiting friends into purchasing/playing this game with me.

It emphasizes positioning with the various card abilities. The cards are on a 9x9 grid (like tic tac toe), and you can win by full out assault, by making your opponent run out of spots to place cards, or by making your opponent discard to zero cards. The AI is terrible in the beginning, letting you experiment with different strategies. By the time the game increases in difficulty, you will have some legendary and rare cards to deal with it.\n\nThe downsides are that the game only has a story mode (no multiplayer). The art style may turn people off too, but I like the charm of the characters and cartoon nature of it. The company that makes this game makes apps too, but I've never played any of them, so I don't recognize any of the characters.\n\nThis charming, strategic card game is $4, and you will easily get your monies worth.

But I was looking through my library the other day, and thought "ah what the heck, I'll give it a try." Immediately I was taken in by its undeniable charm. The cards are whimsical and have an Adventure Time-esque kind of zanyness. At first I was worried that the cardgame mechanics were too simple as they were introduced, but as I saw more of the cards I became convinced there is a lot of depth to this unique system.\n\nI have only played 2 hours and found 3/8 of the Legendary Cards but so far, so good!

I've been an avid player of CCGs for a number of years and I've seen some great ones and some terrible ones, both in physical and in digital formats.  This is one of the better ones.  I wouldn't say it's a great CCG, but it's definitely not the worst, nor is it even close to being so.  It's quite good.\n\nThe game's mechanic of connecting points at the sides and corners of the cards took me a little getting used to as it's different to what I'm used to as far as making attacks, but once I figured out how to effectively build a deck, it's fun.\n\nSpeaking of deck building, one awesome feature of this game is that it's a one-time purchase.  You buy it and you get access to all of the cards in the game via gameplay (either by winning them, getting them in booster packs, or buying them with in-game currency).  None of that "buy the game for $20 and then pay $1 for boosters" crap.  This game knows that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and it deosn't play that way.  It loves you and understands that your money is valuable to you.\n\nThe artwork is a little "meh", but it's whimsical at teh same time.  I've never played the game that it's based on, Ittle Dew, but maybe that's part of the charm that I don't get because of that.  The humor in the game is clean and chuckleworthy.  The game has in-game strategy help via talking to the characters in the game.  Unfortunately, the in-game characters are the only ones that you'll meet as there is no multiplayer support.  My only real complaint here is this, but, it's a BIG one.  This game is fun but after you beat it (which takes all of about 8-12 hours, from what I hear).  My only other complaint is that there's no cloud saves.  If this could happen, I might buy the mobile version to play on the go.  Fix both these issues, and you've got a classic...\n\nFrom what I've played so far, this game is quickly becoming a new favorite of mine.  If you like CCGs, whimsy, and good clean fun, try this one on for size.     7/10","February 23, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game features characters and art styling from Ittle Dew, which may mean it is set in the same world. The goal is to defeat the opponent by either draining their defense to 0 through attacks or forced card draws (the opponent looses defense when they are out of cards and are given random cards) or forcing the opponent to fill their 9x9 card board with cards, leaving them with no way to complete combos. Card combos are made by linking three symbols from cards  in a almost tic-tac-toe fashion, where each card has an arrow pointing to where it can be connected. Combos include attack to damage defense or disable enemy cards, defense to restore your defense, revive to enable disabled cards and neutral to act as filler for other combos. Some cards have different effects, such as multiple symbols so it only needs a second card instead of a third, or rotating player or enemy cards.\n\nIt's a cute little card game that's quite casual, and most importantly, inexpensive at full retail.  I found the character design and interactions to be rather charming and definitely a more laid back exprience than Magic or Hearthstone.  I don't feel like this is a must play by any means, but it is a good CCG that in the worst case scenario, won't hurt your wallet much.","December 15, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll try to keep this short, and to the point, first of all because I don't want to waste your time, but mostly because it is currently 6 AM, and I've been up all night finishing this game. Anyway, to get started:\n\nMUSIC: Let me tell you, this soundtrack is great. It's catchy, and I find the tunes stuck in my head after I close the game.\n\nGRAPHICS: Unique, cartoony, and easy on the eyes. The artwork on the cards is great, too, of course.\n\nSTORY: Although others are saying that the story is forgettable, I'd have to disagree. Although not the best around, it's compelling, and is easy to get into. Essentially, you're the new guy/girl/vegetable in town, and as you explore the city, you meet zany characters, get yourself a rival, and play tons of cardgames. Your goal is essentially to defeat the 8 people who each have a legendary card. If you win, you get the cards, and if you collect all 8 of them, then you are allowed to fight against the Card King, the greatest card player in the city, and claim one million coins. There is also a little more content to explore after defeating the King, like fighting the former legendary card holders looking for a rematch, or facing off the Card Gods, who are four great card players, who use illegal cards.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The battling system is very unique, and lots of fun. To simply sum it up, each card has a different symbol (attack, shield, healing, neutral) which do different things. Attack does damage, shield heals your health (a maximum of 10, by the way), Healing can revive a knocked-out card (which get knocks out by taking damage), and neutral mixes with anything. The catch, however, is that each card has arrows, which you must use to connect the various cards to group together a total of 3 symbols. If one symbol is more dominant of the others, then your combo will go to that automatically, but if there is a tie, you get to choose what symbol you want to activate (Ex. Your card combo has 2 attack and 1 shield, then you will have to do damage to your opponent; Ex. Your card combo has 1 attack, 1 shield, and 1 neutral, then you get to choose to either attack for 1 damage, or heal yourself for 1).\n\nOthers:\n+You get to play as a carrot, with a fedora. 10/10\n+Ludicrously low price. 11 hours of fun, for 4 bucks? That's what I call value.\n-One of the worst final bossfights ever. It's tough as hell, and not very rewarding, but the content that becomes available afterwards (the cards gods, and rematches) is a pretty good reason not to give up.\n\nOverall, this game is really great. Really a hidden gem. To be repetetive, I was really pleasantly surprised at this. Anyway, that's just my 2 cents. I think I'll go get some rest.","February 17, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The adventure mode seems to be a homage to old school light RPGs.\n\nThe music is equally creative, and without a doubt the soundtrack is 5 stars.\n\nThe GUI for managing decks is not perfect, but I could deal with it since the rest of the game is fun. The gold earnings and store could be tweaked. Your games are saved locally. I've read some negative reviews on here and don't agree with criticisms about the AI or strategy.\n\nThe game is priced exceptionally. I enjoy the increased difficulty, personality of opponents, music, control over deck, collecting booster packs.

You must play cards to link the arrows until you have three symbols matched in which case the majority symbol action is taken and the activated cards are removed.  Reduce your opponent from 7 starting health to 0.\n\nAll the cards are contained in the game with nothing more to buy.  You fight card battles to win more cards.

It has a ruleset that is fresh and different from other card games I have played.  It is very simple and easy to grasp, but after you start in a little bit you will see there is a ton of viable strategies for deck building and you can come up with some really interesting combos.  As you play different people in the game you will be rewarded with booster packs with random cards in it that allow you to expand your library and tinker around with your strategy.  Different opponents give you packs from different sets and I found it really fun to see what else I might get with repeated battles.\n\nThe AI  starts off really horribly stupid, but this is fine since you start with a limited starter deck, and the difficulty slowly increases as it gives you time to build a library and contruct different decks for different situations.  The story is super silly and light-hearted.\n\nThe only downfall is that there is no multiplayer.  I would love to play my decks I've built against a friend online.  I'm half tempted to find a way to make these cards in real life to play as I think it would be a fun game with friends.\n\nEven without multiplayer I think that Card City Nights is worth the purchase.

It's encouraged me to check into other card-deck games, but so far this is the one I like the most.\n\nI would recommend this game to any person who is new or an experienced hand to the genre - even if you play FPS or point-and-clicks like I do, you'll get some fun out of this nice title.","March 14, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of each card having a direct ATK/DEF on it, you pair cards together to do a combined ATK, Defend, Heal or special effect. It's  little more strategic and has a story to go with it. The atmosphere is a lot like the Costume Quest games. Similar art style and humor in them, so that is a plus to any Costume Quest fans.","December 28, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay involves battling against AI opponents by slotting cards into a 3x3 grid to form combinations that translate into various actions. At first, a single, balanced deck suffices and your matchups are fairly easy, but as you follow the story (which, without feeling intrusive, guides you around town to increasingly challenging opponents) and meet foes with different kinds of decks and playstyles, you begin to realize that you have to adapt your own card choices and strategies accordingly.\n\nI think it was this subtle sense of progression and the variety that a change in deck could bring that kept me hooked on what at first seemed like a very simple (albeit fun) game. Your options for deck-building improve as you play, since each time you defeat a foe, you're rewarded with cards that are then added to your library. The characters you meet are quirky, offbeat, and humorous, and I appreciated how many times you could talk to them without their flavor-text dialogue repeating. Replayability is high: new opponents emerge and existing opponents improve after you finish the story; you can continue to earn cards and fine-tune your decks; and the story was always secondary anyway. The game settles into a nice balance where you think just enough that your victories feel satisfying, but it's never so hard as to be frustrating.\n\nI got Card City Nights dirt cheap as a part of a Humble Bundle, and I feel like I underpaid.","January 22, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wasn't expecting much, and I must say the graphic style and silly nature made me overlook at first what turned out to be a complex and interesting game. It is sort of a combination between a TCG and a board game in which you try to make combos so that you dont run out of space by filling the board with cards. The combos are made by matching 3 or more cards with the arrows they have on them. It's pretty simple. Reminds me a bit of the board game "Illuminati"...\n\nAnyway I would totally recommend it to TCG fans, or board game fans.

The gameplay is vaguely similar to the Triple Triad minigame from Final Fantasy VIII, but with more cards and depth. Although there aren't as many fiendish combos as you'd get in a top CCG like Magic, there's still scope here to build decks based on damage, milling, denial, etc. The only negative is that you start off slowly with some crappy cards, and it takes a while for deckbuilding to become a serious option. The setting, art, and music are really fun so hopefully that gets you through the initial bit until the fiendish gameplay kicks in. I think this is a bargain at full price, and there's more like 18 hours of game here than the 8 hours they advertise.

Meaning you keep getting the same cards so there's no way to build a better deck by vs-ing the same\nold opponents.\nThis isn't a negative, I'm just stating it.\n\nOne thing I did find strange though, is there's no penalty for losing, at least from what I recall.\n(it's been about a month since I've played and I've just started getting into the game from scratch again.)\nWould be nice for some sort of 'Hardcore' mode where you lose something from losing, cards or something.\n\nThere's a nice degree of humour in the game.. I've never played the developers other games such as The Little Dew.\nBut from what I can tell it isn't necessary to have experience in that lore.\nHumour such as; early on you'll be dualing with cards titled 'Stick' which is a weapon that's just a stick.\n\nThere is a decent variety of decks, as you progress.\nWith the early decks being comprised of 'sticks' and 'old men.'\nSome other decks are futuristic decks, monster decks, and a few others I can't recall off the top of my head.\n\nWell enough of my blabbering on.\nIf you ever get an itch for a Singleplayer CCG, give this game a whirl, it should suck you in nicely.","February 2, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This genre of game is one of my favorites, as were Magic: the Gathering: Shandalar and Pokemon Trading Card Game for Game Boy Color. So few of these games are made nowadays that really, I'll take whatever I can get, so when I saw this game on sale for $2, I jumped on it.\n\nIn the card game, you place cards on a 3x3 grid. Link arrows on the cards to make combos, which can lock down your opponents cards, release your own, boost your life total, or hurt your opponent. You win by reducing your opponent to 0 or by making them unable to play by filling up their grid or depleting their deck. The nice thing is that the game is fairly elegant, and most of the game's strategies involve using relatively simple cards. The strategy in deck building comes from putting together a good theme and making sure you can get the arrows to line up properly. There are a lot of card with powerful abilities that are rendered near useless because they only have one arrow.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, it's clear that this game was meant to celebrate this developer's previous titles. The only one of those games I had played (or heard of) previously was the fairly good Zelda clone, Ittle Dew, so I got a few of the self-referential jokes. Even if you're not in on the references, though, and I doubt you will be, this game has a lot of goofy humor, between the bizarre characters and funny backgrounds. I thought the music in this game was fine, with the exception of one or two tracks thay annoyed me. The art style is very cartoony and drawn in very thick lines, and I think the graphics work well enough. I would have liked a few more choices for your avatar, though.\n\nOverall, Card City Nights is a pretty solid card game and an amazing bargain at $4. If you enjoy collectible card games, then this is definitely worth picking up and playing for a few hours.\n\n","February 18, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not a huge card game buff, but the mechanics of this one feel fresh and unique. The cards are easy to understand, deck building is simple enough, and I love the hand drawn feel of the game. The characters are silly and cute and the game is a reasonable length with some replay value. The only thing I wish it had is multiplayer.\n\nIf you like card games, it's worth the time and money to give CCN a try.","May 25, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(For the record, I haven't played a card game since yugioh like 10 years ago, so my opinion about card games may not be that informed)\n\nLike other card games, you will need to gather cards(by beating enemies, buying from stores, combining unwanted cards, you can get a special card by beating each boss) and build your decks. To beat the enemy in a match, you either have to reduce his hp to 0, make the table full of cards so the enemy cannot place any more cards or make the enemy use up all his deck.\n\nBased on these different winning conditions, you can design your deck accordingly. For example, if you want to play aggressively, you can put many attack cards that can easily combo(the cards have directions, you need to connect cards of the same type(attack/heal/revive/neutral) to combo) in your deck. You can also pick many cards with disable/rotate effects. If the enemies do not have revive cards, they will get stuck with too many cards(either disabled or in wrong directions) on the table. Alternatively you can build a large deck with lots of healing cards and try to outlive the enemy. This works well when the enemy has a small deck(there are also cards that let you directly remove the enemy's cards).\n\nDifferent AI enemies will use different strategies. There is enough variety. In particular, bosses will have special cards that have powerful effects, like hp regen every round, attack card that can be reused indefinitely, shield that prevent any damage to the owner's hp(but you can disable or remove the card). The bosses are appropriately challenging(tho I don't feel that they are cheating). You will have to use the correct tactics to beat them.\n\nThe graphic of this game is ok(you can see screenshots on steam). The story is not very serious. The dialogues sometimes can be pretty silly but funny. Anyway I think the focus of this game is the gameplay. For someone like me who doesn't usually play card games, I have lots of fun playing this game. It even makes me want to try out other card games. For 2 bucks, I think it is really worth. The only complaint I have is that there is no multiplayer mode.","January 2","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be it combat with an executive turnip person or duelings with a ghost or three, there are few digital card games that outright wants to have fun, in both execution and style. It never had me laughing out loud but the cartoonish surrealism and genuinely well crafted card play brought me back again and again.\n\nThe card play itself has more of a boardgame feel to it, with a 3x3 board both you and your opponent have free reign of placing down cards on. These opposing boards basically demand that you have preplanned combos in your deck, as the only person that really can determine if you're going to have the upper hand or not is you. While the decks are randomized, luck isn't really as much of a factor as it is a gameplan, which you'll probably have to change up often as you go into new battles with different variety of foes. "Matching" cards is done through connecting the arrows each card possesses. There are eight points of contact in all; the angles and the sides. The majority of cards you collect will only have two or three arrows each, where special silver, gold, or platinum cards can vary from all 8 to just 1. Having cards that line up with each other is crucial, and demands a certain kind of forethought that you will build over the course of the game. It's far more complex than it sounds, and a variety of special abilities and different ways you can win makes the game an utterly fascinating breakaway from the usual fare.\n\nIs there bull**** moves that even the computer abuses? Yes. Yes there are. Matches can go on forever, and when it follows a 2/3 game style, not knowing if your hardfought victory is going to happen twice is a horrible feeling, especially when what you fear comes true. While this does garuntee that even the easiest matches still demand some thought, the over all repetition can eat away at you near the end like it did me. I do love this game for what it is, but at the end the final couple fights feel downright unfair, and that's where the 2/3 deal often works at its worst. The experience as a whole was absolutely worth it, but who knows, you may grasp the rules better and stand a greater chance by the end of it.\n\nWhile I haven't checked out Little Dew yet, I'm probably going to have to make that as one of my next stops. For the insanely cheap asking price of two bucks, CCN is of such insane quality that anyone would be hard pressed not to pick this bad boy up. Also, the soundtrack is wonderfully funky and fits the game perfectly. Don't miss out on this one if you can, and if you ever see this on sale? You have no excuse.

As someone who loved Yu-Gi-Oh! and dabbled in Magic The Gathering, I thought I'd give this a shot since it was only $2. When you start the game, you're thrown into a tutorial and it teaches you the unique way to battle. The way this game is different in how you battle is that not only do the cards matter, but where you place them matters even more. Each card has its own unique layout of arrows that you have to connect with other arrows on other cards, as well as matching the different card types (Attack, Defense, and Neutral). Using this, you go through the town and battle different unique and quirky people and work your way to the top.\n\nThe only thing I'm not that fond of in this game is there's really only one dominant strategy, and it's offense offense offense. I wish there were different ways to beat enemies, like milling or a defense-type thing. But even then, there is strategy in building your deck on how you should be offensive.\n\nBut all in all, the battle system is unique and the characters are fun to talk to and battle. Seriously, buy this game. Buy it for full price, because it's worth it. And if it's on sale, that's even more reason to buy it!\n\nP.S. If you go on the "Dollar per Hour of Gameplay" motto, I got it for $2 and it took me 8 to beat the game once and an additional 2 to do some of the post-game stuff.","December 26, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game mechanics are fun but the problem with the game is in the card collection and deckbuilding.  My favorite part of trading card games is being able to put together fun and creative decks.  This game, especially as a single player game, takes far too long to start getting any interesting cards, and even then you usually only will get singles of cards.  Deck building is extremely limited because of this and essentially you will just toss together whatever cards you have at the time, rather than try to build a deck with any intentional strategy.

Some opponents give you a booster pack upon winning, most give you money to buy single cards of.  Some areas you unlock let you recycle or combine cards for new cards.  Some areas make you battle in sequence without changing your deck, and some battles are best of 3 or 5.  Similar to Yu-Gi-Oh handhelds, but with a lot less blockading your progression than in those games and no grinding a fight 10-20 times to unlock a pack.\n\nGame mechanics are fairly simple and fluid, but you may find yourself a little disappointed if you are used to MTG or Yu-gi-oh.  There aren't too many special tricks the player can do without a bit of grinding, meaning most times you will have a fairly rounded generic deck against themed decks.  This means a lot of fights will go to deck-outs since you will be even against other mixed decks, unable to break your opponent's defensive decks, and you don't encounter a truly difficult aggressive deck until midway through the game.  Taking this, I somewhat luckily found a card-mix recipe early that produced a strong milling card (Business Casual Man).  I made two of them a and sailed through most of the game easily with a mixed-mill deck, only adjusting my deck for 3 fights to be more defensive.  Only the mid-point aggressive boss and last boss required multiple tries to beat.\n\nI ended the main game with a 56 W / 9 L score, and only battled a few optional fight-for-booster opponents multiple times.  I'm not new to card games and so making a strong deck wasn't too difficult, and I ended with just under 10 hours playtime.  Because of my milling strategy its hard to say how difficult some of these fights would have been and how that may have elongated the game.  There is optional postgame content against some difficult opponents, and you can complete a full collection if you are so inclined.\n\nThere is unfortunately no multiplayer, but I imagine the difficulty there lies in the problem of deck archetypes.  A strong burn / aggro deck is incredibly difficult to fight unless you have a defensive or disruptive deck, defensive-mill decks destroy any delay or mixed, etc.  It would come entirely down to archetype advantages determining who would win.\n\nAll in all, for $4 retail I'd say its not at all a bad game.  I got this game in a bundle, and I think its on iOS for $2.  If you see it at 50% off and want a casual game that's well-designed enough to appeal to gamers, then I'd say go for it.\n\n(Business Casual Man recipe :  Itan Carver + Jenny Bun)","April 16, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
