Big names but this might just deserve the attention. Interesting story, smooth remappable controls, beautiful visuals and great performance. Games somewhat linear though levels are designed with alternate playstyles in mind, one run won't be the same. Fun just repeating rooms while trialing different clearing methods. In-game options were plenty, only thing missing was fov toggle. Uses Unreal Engine 4 so tweakable further to your hearts content.

I don't think this game is terrible. But I simply do not reccomend it. I do not regret playing the game. But this is not a game I would say to someone "yes, you should buy this and spend time playing it".\n\nI bought this game and let's played it on the Geek Remix channel because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I cannot understand why everyone loved this game so much. It is just okay.\nPros:\n\n-Cool game mechanics. Interesting use of rendering two environments and switching between them. Some of the puzzles were cool. None of them too challenging.\n-If you are the type of person who only cares about gameplay, you might enjoy this. Maybe. But the game is too short.\n-Female protagonist who is PoC.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Too short and yet at the same time too long. It's only 2-4 hours depending on how you play. By the end I was just wanting it to be over.\n\n-A lot of bugs. Sometimes cutscenes only start after .....???????? I stood in a room for a while walking around wondering what to do. Then suddenly the cutscene to progress the game started.\n\n-The story is not nearly as good as all the other reviews made it out to be. There were some refferences to the origional heroes series, and to the side projects of the heroes reboot. Nothing too amazing. Everything just felt like one of the weak episodes of a tv show. The whole game feels like a DLC.\n\n-Graphics were on the level of an early xbob 360 game. And yet this still somehow put a bit of a strain on my PC, that has 32 gigs of ram, an i7-4790, and a R9-290. Along with unusually long load screens for what seems like a low graphics game. I was playing on "Epic".\n\nAnyway i feel like i got my points across. It's just an overwhelming sense of "that was okay i guess".","January 30","false","4.3"," 86 of 127 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","86","127","7","10"

Yeah i can sense it had a low budget, but this is a wonderful blend between Mirror's Edge, Singularity, TimeShift and Bioshock.

Dayum, this is nice. And well worth the price, I must say. It LOOKS good, and it plays in a very unique way for a first person action game. The powers you get are loads of fun, and allows for variety in how you tackle enemy encounters. Certain parts of the platforming remind me a lot of Mirror's Edge, although it's not really quite parkour, at least not as intensive as the one in ME. And this is a small thing, but it's always refreshing in a first person game when you look down and are able to see the rest of your body rather than just empty space where it should be.\n\nI guess my only gripes are that it's really, really short. You can finish it within 3 hours, 2 if you're blitzing it, and the replay value is very little. I'm gonna play through it again to get some of the secrets I missed, sure, but once I've managed to 100% the achievements, that's pretty much it. Another thing is that I wish there were a few more...puzzle-like elements to the game. I feel like it would've been so much better if they mixed some puzzles or at least light puzzle elements into the game. Would have worked well with the powers at your disposal. The most you get is literally just a pressure plate, and that's it. Gurl please.\n\nAlso another thing to add is, if you're hoping for some sort of good story with this game, you'd be disappointed. The story is really bland and uninteresting. The characters are all cardboard cutouts, and the dialogue can be very cringeworthy at times. Story-wise it's completely unremarkable, so if you ARE interested in getting this game, that's one thing to note. The gameplay is where you'll get the most out of it.\n\nBut all in all I had a real blast with this game. I'd recommend it, but it's not a MUST play by any means.","January 19","true","5.5"," 42 of 61 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","42","61","4","1"

Basically, the whole package feels underfunded and/or amateurish.\n\nHowever, playing the game lets you do some neat stuff with time shifting and telekinesis.  Freeze bullets and fling them back, slow time to dodge enemies, mentally throw barrels and desks at bad guys, shift yourself into another time frame to rest up and spy on the guards through a little time rift to plan your return.  The game has some cool concepts that could have been better executed but -- for a 4-5hr game -- are still worth taking a spin through.\n\nI'm giving this a "thumbs up" but I couldn't recommend spending the $15 MSRP on it.   Pick it up in a bundle or something but it's worth trying once it's in your collection.","May 23","true","8.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Considering that this was clearly a low budget game, the development team really spun this game's combat mechanics to its full potential.\n\nCons: the dialogue can seem a bit flate at times, and it's a little bit short compared to 15 euro - good thing that it's currently on sale for 10 :)\nSometimes the cutscenes seemed a bit random, and at tmes I'd be left in a room thinking 'So, what now?" and waited for a minute or 2 before the objective became clear to me.\n\nI Would definitely recommend this game, especially if you're a fan of the series!","February 6","true","7.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It is a short game telling the story of Cassandra, a young adult who is looking for her parents in this world that sort-of reminded me of Infamous as it has people with superpowers and villains trying to capture and ‘research’ them.\n\nThe thing that makes this game different from the others is its unique gameplay. You can parkour anywhere as Cassandra, even though the levels are limited and I would’ve enjoyed some more parkour areas. But for most of the time you will be fighting people with its combat system which you can kill enemies in many ways. You can pause time and run, grab objects and throw them, or use a combination of some or all of them to make a combat system that is very unique and interesting. Definitely how you can use this system with the environment.\n\nThe levels are well created too and while in the middle part of the game it does start to seem recycled and boring, it soon becomes fun again with new powers and upgraded abilities.\n\nThe soundtrack doesn’t do much and is pretty repetitive with its electro tone as I could’ve used for some more variety but just like the music, the levels are pretty repetitive and while Cassandra jumps through time to see the huge modern buildings of 2008 to the ruined old buildings covered with moss of 2014, it still isn’t enough variety. Luckily the game is short enough to still make me enjoy it and is costed fairly for its length.\n\nBut the main problem with this game is its story. The voice acting is terrible with the moments when I’m meant to feel sad about a character ended up making me cringe and even some bits where the gameplay and story don’t tie in together. Plus the story is awfully predictable with all characters just being stereotypical and boring.\n\nThe graphics though, are done very well and look amazing, this is the first game I’ve played on Unreal Engine 4 and while I have heard that other people have had a couple issues with the game, I have had none performance wise. Although there were a couple times I had to restart from a checkpoint because an objective marker would not show up.\n\nWhile the story and soundtrack completely sucks, by the time I finished the game I knew that it still deserved a positive review. And that’s because of the gameplay. It completely saves the game and makes it a must play to people who enjoy high tense action games, even though there are obvious flaws.\nWe give this game 3.5/5.","January 23","true","3.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I’ve neither watched the television show Gemini: Heroes Reborn is based upon, nor have I played the iOS-only prequel no one knows exists. Maybe in this pre-established universe, people are extraordinarily cavalier about suddenly developing superpowers in impossibly convenient situations.\n\nCassandra certainly is. After delving into the ruins of a derelict building, she takes a nasty fall and then watches her friend get dragged away by a group of mysterious armed guards. She then, rightfully, starts to panic as one of the soldiers breaks off from the pack to examine the debris in which she herself landed. About to be discovered by an angry stranger with a gun, and with her friend lying unconscious and bleeding only a few feet away, terror sinks in. She starts to beg and plead not to be discovered. When those pleas seem to fall on deaf ears and her discovery is imminent… she teleports out of the crumbling ruins of a forgotten building and into a pristine basketball court.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12833/pc/gemini-heroes-reborn/review.html","February 17","true","6.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
