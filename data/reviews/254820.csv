Apart from that, have at it and enjoy, I have not had any compatibility problems so far on Windows 7 64.","July 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

Working excellently on Win 10 and graphics are still quite good, considering how old the game is. But gameplay, gameplay is still very good and I am enjoying this game again a much. Even controlls are still accetable for such a old game. Highly recommended. I just put down all fallout 4, FM2016, NFS and playing this game.

It was one of the first RTS games I had played that ditched resource management and focused solely on squad tactics. The game succeeded wildly in hooking me into the story, through its excellent voice acting and deep gameplay mechanics. The visuals still impress me even today, 15 years later!\n\nFun Fact: Jennifer Hale is the voice talent behind the game's protagonist, Sarah Parker. Her work alone makes the game a delight to play.\n\nI include Ground Control with the likes of Homeworld as members of a gold standard for unique, top-tier RTS games. If you want a fun sci-fi story coupled with deep strategy, you'll want to pick this one up.","July 11, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Hands down my favorite RTS of all time. But its 2015 and this could use a remaster to fix a few annoyances. Its needs wide screen, window mode support, and better cursor acceleration options. Homeworld received a remaster, so I hope for the best here.\n\nOn wide screen if the resolution is streched, you may run into the issue with the cursor whipping across the screen horizontally and it might sometimes move at a crawl vertically. If you have third party mouse drivers that control DPI, you might want to disable them here and tweak the game's mouse sensitivity to your comfort. The awkward acceleration on modern hardware does make it tricky to micro your squards to move them out of focus fire and/or friendly fire in the heat of combat.","October 24, 2015","true","51.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Starbomba/recommended/254820/","Starbomba","Starbomba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Starbomba/","171 products in account","Ground Control is one of those games that i highly remember after all this time. Played it ~10-11 years ago (got it FREE from FilePlanet, who can remember that?), and even now, after countless computer upgrades, it has not lost it's shine (entirely), nor looks bad as other "old" games (and it runs fine on W10 without doing anything to boot).\n\nI have yet to see more RTS's with this style, where the units you have at the beginning are all you will ever get. The only game i can recall at the top of my head is Soldiers: Heroes of WWII (which is also one of my favorites). This makes the squad configuration critical for success and not just a race of who can mine resources faster to spam units.\n\nIf you love RTS's, i cannot recommend this strongly enough. After StarCraft, AoE, RoN and others, i can still get back to this game and not feel disappointed at all.","January 4","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Finally Ground Control on Steam and working on windows 7! Two tiny issues I'm having.

Ground Control Anthology offers a thrilling RTS experience beloved by fans and critics alike. With a trendsetting mixture of 3D action and strategic combat, it’s still just as epic as it ever was. The year is 2419 and mankind is on the brink. War has devastated Earth, and mega-corporations take to the stars to fight over colonised planets. Your employer, the Crayven Corporation, chose you to command an army of ground and air forces on the distant world of Krig-7-B. You thought it would be just another brush-fire war in a longstanding dispute. You were wrong. - Highly Recommended!","August 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

This game focus seriously on the tactical side of the RTS. You don't base build, you select and equip your drop ship for the up coming battle, while the game has soft and hard counters in play, it doesn't feel like its a rock paper scissor game as you need to take care in the using the terrain to the advantage.

I played the demo on a PC Gamer demo disc. The 3 missions that were on the disc hooked me into buying the game. Of all the games I have ever bought, Ground Control, Homeworld, and Red Alert 2 were underpriced according to the experience they gave. This game was produced when the RTS genre was in it's prime and Ground Control reflects that era perfectly. Ground Control should have gotten more publicity than it recieved.\n\nIt plays on the more tactics base that RTS veterans should know rather than spamming hundreds of units to win. This game, hands down, has the most valuable units of any RTS due to the fact every unit plays a role and they can not be replaced once lost. This game will hammer the importance of tactics, unit placement, and formations into you. If you want a challenging RTS, (coping with the stupid AI is a task of it's own) this game will deliver. You better be on your A game with the higher difficulties where it incorporates friendly fire.\n\nThe soundtrack is outstanding and complements the story and gameplay very well.This is probably the most immursive RTS you will ever play. As much as I hate IGN, they were right on the money with this one.\n\nThe graphics are dated, but the game retains its more defining features that separated it from the rest.\n\nI did an entire playthrough of the core game recorded and uploaded to Youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM7mhYKvQns&list=PL7ZUst3xQwwDmW0EYN1w4IxcWs7e_eN55","April 30","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
