In Cryptark you play as the mech pilot for a Privateering company who have recently received a contract to take over what is known as a Cryptark space-hulk. But you can’t just take this Cryptark on straight away! You must first take over smaller alien space-hulks to earn more money and unlock better gear.\n\nPresentation\nIf you’ve played Apotheon or Capsized then you know that Alientrap make some great looking games, Cryptark does not disappoint. The almost cartoon-y style that they’ve gone for with Cryptark fits it perfectly and everything, from the giant space-hulks to the tiny repair bots, look absolutely fantastic. Some of the visual effects in particular look great, such as the napalm weapon that can be seen in one of the screenshots on the store page. The menu and UI are both clean, simple and easy to navigate making this game’s presentation excellent in all departments.\n\nGameplay\nA game of Cryptark takes place over seven missions, six smaller space-hulks and then the Cryptark itself. Every time you progress to a new mission you’ll be given a choice between four different space-hulks of varying levels and classes. The highest level space-hulks with the most difficult classes will offer far greater rewards for beating them but will obviously be significantly more difficult to beat. Since you start with a budget of $500k sometimes you have no choice but to take on these incredibly difficult missions if you want to avoid running out of money which ends the game.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen which space-hulk you’d like to take on you travel to it in your little ship where you can choose a loadout and test your weapons before going into battle. Each space-hulk has several different systems, such as shield generators and drone factories, on-board so the next step is to decide which system you want to take out first and where you want to enter the space-hulk. As far as I know the only system which you absolutely have to take out is the shield system since it defends the core but taking out other space-hulk systems will make it far easier to eventually take out the core, specifically the drone factories and alarm systems.\n\nHow much you get paid for capturing a space-hulk depends on several things, the most obvious being how tough it is. There are some other variables which seem to differ mission-to-mission but there is one worth noting, how long it takes you to beat the mission. Depending on the level of the ship you’ll be given a certain amount of time to capture the space-hulk within, if you manage to capture it during this time you’re awarded a substantial amount of bonus pay which is incredibly helpful. I know a lot of people aren’t fans of time limits in games, I’m certainly not, but I actually found that the time you’re given to complete the mission for these bonuses is very generous, I never went over the time limit and I’m not particularly good at the game.\n\nCustomisation\nWhile you can’t change your physical appearance in Cryptark, there’s a fair amount of customisation when it comes to what weapons you take with you on missions. Your mech has four weapon hardpoints as well as four slots for support items (such as hull repairs) and you start off with a few weapons to choose from. As you explore different space-hulks you find alien technology which can be collected, the company hiring you to capture the Cryptark gives you new weapons in exchange for these alien technologies dotted about on the space-hulks so you quickly unlock new weapons for your arsenal. Weapons aren’t cheap though so you have to keep an eye on how much you’re spending otherwise you’ll very quickly end up losing the game with no money.\n\nAudio\nCryptark’s audio is pretty much flawless across the board. The voice acting for the characters in the game is excellent and very believable. The sound effects are all great and sound pretty realistic. Lastly the sound track of the game is very good and fits well with the action packed gameplay. It is worth mentioning that the game is very loud, you’re going to want to turn down your speakers or headphones before playing.\n\nMiscellaneous Cryptark is an incredibly hard game, I generally start failing missions on the third or fourth mission and I haven’t had much luck getting to the end of the game. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, just worth keeping in mind if you’re not a fan of particularly difficult games\nI noticed one or two typos in the menus and in the game, nothing major but it’s still a bit irritating\nHere’s a short gameplay video I recorded:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTMmdAbxM58\n\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nCryptark is an excellent rogue-like action game with a great art style, fun yet challenging gameplay and quite a lot of replay value. If you’re a fan of Alientrap’s other work or you just like 2D rogue-like games in general, chances are you’re going to have a lot of fun with this one.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","October 7, 2015","true","5.0"," 103 of 122 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","103","122","0","7"

Each mission will have you running against the clock and your ammo count as you tally every second wasted and each piece of hardware you carry against the mission payout. You need to be quick, careful, and keep moving.\n\nSome of the following points are objective fact, some are just my opinions.\n\nGood:\nVoice acting is clear and character looks suit their voices, the portraits also lip-sync well.\nFlexible 4-hardpoint loadout system lets you have any amount of any gun and fire them all at once if you want.\nA nice assortment of consumable items to keep you going and help fight tactically.\nFree weapon testing in your hangar lets you get a good feel for your loadout without paying anything.\nHandy bonus objectives for each derelict let you reap more rewards.\nEntering the map/waypoint screen mercifully pauses the action and allows you to get your bearings.\nNeutral: Some of the small sentry drones have terrible aim when charging at you and will sometimes go off at an angle to smack into a wall instead. They are hard to hit though, so they still pose a threat.\nThe alien ship areas look good, but can easily hide drones and turrets along the walls that you can't detect until they start moving to attack.\nThe minimap is clear but small, a button to enlarge it would be helpful. An map marker indicator arrow or ring around your mech or reticle would help too, as you don't always have time to find the tiny dotted line somewhere in the bottom corner of the screen.\nDebris is both a blessing and a curse as the parts block both your shots and those of the enemy. Shoot and move for a better angle to avoid getting blocked. It all looks great, but it's easy to confuse an enemy ship for a piece of scrap.\nSome of the bonus objectives can be hard to the point of sillyness (loadout armour 3 or less, for example) but if you can pull them off and survive they usually pay out well.\nVisual style is fairly clear cut but weapon effects have too much glow on them, You can't tell if there are enemy bullets flying towards you behind your own.\nBad: The mission clock time limit seemed a little tight to me on the early missions. In the later ones you get more time allowance and you feel like there's room on the clock to breathe.\nExplosives appear to be weak and generally pricey for the ammo you get.\nThe map waypoint system doesn't always account for doors or open gaps in the hull you can get through, so it'll only give you a helpful course about half the time. Being able to set a series of waypoints in order to plot the course you want to take would be helpful.\nAlarm lasers are hard to spot if you're distracted by threats, this makes it difficult to avoid tripping the alarms while you zip around in combat, causing enemy reinforcements to converge on your position.\nGamepad mode is on by default. If you try to configure your controls without turning it off and click one of the button bindings you won't be able to get out of control settings without a gamepad plugged in unless you forcibly quit the game. Hopefully the devs will make the escape key back out of setting controls even in gamepad mode to fix this.\nYour pioneer suit will immediately feel fragile and there are no variants to pick something that suits your style, faster movement but fewer hardpoints, for example. You can increase armour but it quickly becomes expensive per point and doesn't help you much for the cost.\nWhen you die the entire derelict gets left behind, ignoring all the work you did to shove you into a new vessel. You also get slapped with a fee and receive nothing for your work, so you can literally go broke and while making no progress. The only benefit is that you keep whatever tech you grabbed.\nSome weapons cost more but perform worse (I'm looking at you, melee saw).\nEMP weaponry costs more and stuns your targets briefly but doesn't appear to do any damage. I hope you brought a melee weapon to save money on ammo.\nEnemies will quickly overwhelm you on some ships if you don't destroy the drone factories first. Once active they can produce too quickly to keep the numbers down and kill the spawner.\nEnemies float through doors as though they weren't there. This occurs for both locked and unlocked doors, which is frustrating when you are trying to get somewhere but can't because there are drones flying through the door you wish to open. Doors should be obstacles to AI as well.\nSome ship systems just take too long to kill on a time limit because of the limited opportunity they present to damage them, and your weapons generally aren't high powered enough to knock them out fast within that window.\nThe screen gets far too busy during the later stages. There is just is just so much gunfire and stuff all around that you can't hope to properly see threats coming at you.\nThe game is fairly short. Sure things are randomized so you can do several playthroughs without running into the same ship, but for the most part the experience will be very samey until the devs add in more main and unique objectives than just "kill the ship's brain" every time.\nNo story to speak of, which makes the missions feel unimportant except to fill your bank account. Plenty of room for rival contractors and corporate espionage to interfere with your zero-g picnic and develop intriguing extra mission choices should the devs decide to add more content.\nBugs: Due to an unknown glitch you will occasionally get stuck on empty environment and be unable to move except at a snail's pace. Firing high-recoil weapons helps push you a bit in reverse but this is hardly a worthwile solution as you will quickly expend all your ammo and get nowhere.\nThe ship generation system sometimes makes hull gaps which seem big enough on the map but are in fact too small to fit through, this causes wasted travel time and having to deal with security on the way that you could have avoided. Worse still it can deploy systems and pickups in these locations, buried in the walls or impassable crawlspaces. Hopefully this problem will be ironed out in future updates.\nSometimes the security cage protecting door lockdown control snaps closed long before you can hack through. The first time I tried to disable the systems the third gate snapped shut on me by the time I pressed the first two symbols to hack it open. This happened several times in a row before I gave up. On a later mission I managed to hack the gates open just fine, so I'll assume it's a bug.\nOverall a good game in my opinion, definitely one for people who like fast and dicey combat. I honestly went bankrupt on the second ship, dying over and over just short of victory, but I got to play with some cool toys at least and had fun with shotguns.\n\nRecommendations\nI think the game is good fun for a thrash about but not much more at the moment. I would suggest that others hold off until the developers add more to the gameplay. If anyone does pick this up I recommend dual Zipguns, Shotguns or Frag Shotguns for a main weapon choice and Frag Grenades as an effective explosive.\n\nThere are some cheats in this game if you can find them, which will help you take that loadout you always wanted. *cough* "console" *cough*\n\nI hope to see some fixes and new features soon.\n\nEdit: I have removed the notes about door keys because I may have misjudged how they work. I currently believe that keys aren't tied to specific sets of doors and holding a door key allows you to unlock any single locked door (red on the map).","October 10, 2015","true","7.8"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","32","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tacocat3/recommended/344740/","Tacocat3","PandACT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tacocat3/","60 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is an analytical review, which tries very hard to be unbiased. If I liked the game, I'll try to give you the positive and negative. Though I love these devs, I won't try to sell you this game.\n\nGameplay & StrategyOn the matter of strategy: you can go reeeaaally deep, but they didn't make it necessary. On a rogue-lite, you don't make next-to-impossible levels. However, there's still a great deal necessary. Ship design and course are a big deal, to be sure. Should I destroy the alarms, or is it too risky for my hull? Should I destroy the repair system with one of my four missiles, or save it for more defended systems? Should I add an extra 20K with a remote nuke, or 10K with smaller nuke-rockets? A shocking amount of strategy, and about as much as it seems at first sight. (Perhaps a little more)\nI almost didn't buy this because, somehow, I got the wrong idea about gameplay from the trailer. It is strategically isolating enemies, and as much of a stealth-game as it is a bullet-hell. There are infinite different styles of gameplay, due to the customization of the suits.\nOne con: in order to have the style of gameplay you want, you first need to get the weapon(s) you want. Dying removes these.\nCertain things are unplannable, and INSANELY FRUSTRATING to me. That one mine that doesn't show up on the radar and boom, boom, BOOM! You're dead. Shiny, expensive ship and your plan blown to pieces. One bad move can set off a massive chain reaction that kills you instantly. Also, encountering new things can be dangerous. A new system or drone can blow you badly off course. (Sometimes literally.)\nThe only other con I can think of: Bugs. The infamous invincible minelayer, or the perma-shield can hamper gameplay badly. The good thing? These will be gone in a month. The devs are great at killing bugs, and not very good at making them.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nReplayabilityA rogue-lite is less frustrating for some, and less fast-paced for others. The amount of replayability depends on how much you like the genre, but here's my opinion. (Which prefers a complete rogue.)\nThe game will force you to play over and over, as it's a rogue-lite. With 10-15 hours, I still haven't got to the end. You are likely to get a completely different experience on every play-through due to the massive amount of content already. The maps are TRULY randomly generated (With their share of bugs), and about 15 different systems that you can encounter, so you are rarely faced with a ship that's the same. You can unlock new weapons as you play, and I KNOW I haven't seen half of those.\nThe one thing I don't like is the permanent unlock system. While infiltrating these ships, you can meet special objectives on certain, not-very-rare-at-all ships. Meeting these objectives earns you an artifact. Two artifacts unlock a suit. One unlocks a skin. No unique ways, no secret events, no special things for special suits. In most rogue-likes, there's some daring mission that's off to the side, or perhaps a buried secret that you have to discover and reach. Nope. You find yourself without a lot of purpose once you've unlocked everything... I was almost glad for the bug that wiped my data.\n\nreplayability: 8/10\n\nOtherEarly access is usually a bonus for me, and this is 90% finished JUST AFTER coming out! Don't be suspicious of this early access title. With only 500 or so players, this is definitely a bonus.\nOn the matter of bugs: They have some. The problem is they're abundant. I've got my progress wiped once and crashed (Without losing anything... Cheers for autosave!) at least 10 times. A nuisance, but I'm willing to put up with it for now.\nGraphics: so insanely good, that I had to turn it waaaaaaaaaay down to avoid crashing and immense lag. It still looks really, really good, and sadly lags slightly.\n\nOverall9/10 (And I'm serious. This is among the best of my games.)","January 2","true","146.8"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","3"

You’re contacted by a rather shadowy government agent who has commissioned you and your crew to board and pacify the Cryptark.\n\nThat’s what you’re getting into. The question is … are you ready?\n\nGameplayTime is Money and you don’t have any time. Keep that in mind while playing. Time is essential since you only have a specific amount of time to finish a level. I mean hey the government agent wants those space hulks in a timely fashion. You don’t want to disappoint him do you?\n\nTime isn’t the only thing that you should pay attention to. Before you set out on a mission you’ll have to choose which of the four available space hulks you’re going to conquer. Choose your victim, err, Space Hulk wisely. Each of the Space Hulks has another difficulty and requires more money. So it’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to risk and spend more money for a greater reward. Each of the space hulks has different bonus objectives as well.\n\nHowever. Before you set out on a mission you have to choose your loadout and that costs quite a fair amount of money. You can choose what kind of weapons you want to use on a mission such as the machine- or shotgun, the amount of grenades you’ll want to use and you can even upgrade your shields. So you see you can pretty much change everything before a mission and sometimes you even have to if you want those bonus goals. Some require you to go out on a mission with a max loadout of 60k for example.\n\nThe good and the bad part about the game is that you will be forced to tackle those goals at one point of the game. Because money’s everything in Cryptark. Once you’ve spend all your money it’s game over.\n\nLet’s talk about a space hulk for a bit.\nThe goal of each mission is to go and destroy the core. But before you can do that you have to take out the shield system. You see the shield system protects the core from taking damage.\nThat’s not the only system that will try to make your life is hard as possible. There are all kinds of systems like sentry guns, a repair system which will repair the last destroyed system, a fail system, which will take control of the last destroyed system and so on. So you see you can’t just rush into a space hulk and hope for the best. You should have a plan and use your map.\n\nIn order to move through a space hulk you’ll have to defeat all kinds of enemies and collect key cards. A lot of doors are locked and you need a key card in order to unlock a door. That means that every locked door requires one key card.\n\nOverall you’ll be put under quite a bit of stress while playing and to be completely honest … I seriously love it. I loved every minute playing it and I can see it become one of my favorite roguelikes rather easily. Of course that depends how this game evolves over the course of early access.\n\nYour goal is to board and pacify the Cryptark\nYou’ll have to play six missions before you can lay your eyes on the Cryptark itself.\n\nSo that means you have to spend and earn your money wisely in order to fulfill your contract.\n\nVisualsA wise choice. The cartoonish look I mean.\nThe only thing that does bother me quite a bit is that you’re not able to change your physical appearance. That’s the only thing that bothers me though. Everything looks good. Seriously. Be it the sentry guns, the drones, the cores, the laser beams, the particles … really everything looks just insanely good.\nThe game features a very clean User Interface and I even like the look of the menu.\nOverall the game's just looking fantastic.\n\nAudioThe music is just so good. I seriously adore the track that’s played during the main menu. It’s peaceful yet it does sound a bit dangerous and that you won’t know what will come.\nOverall the whole sound effects, music and even the voices … they all just sound so good and work extremely good together. I mean sure once you’re surrounded by drones, sentry guns and whatnot you’ll find yourself overwhelmed with sounds and explosions but there’s always this time when you can catch your breath and you’re greeted by one fine tune.\nPersonally I’m really looking forward to be able to buy the OST.\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for Cryptark in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nLooks beautiful? Check. Sounds awesome? Check. Incredibly enjoyable? Check. Roguelike? Check.\nIt’s one incredibly good game. The whole look and feel of Cryptark just leaves you longing for more. You will have a hard time fighting against the timer and the enemies which dare to stand in your way and … money.\nIf you’re looking for a new roguelike you should definitely give this game a try. You won’t be disappointed.","October 14, 2015","true","2.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","4"

A moment ago I was staring at a screen that tells me 'DEFEATED BY CRYPTARK'.  I must have stared at this screen for more than twenty minutes, dazed and unable to move.  My reward is negative one hundred thousand monetary units.  I have seen this screen before.  I have seen it many times.  Usually this screen angers me.  No... it usually enrages me.  The chair I'm sitting in is missing the right armrest because I tore it off in a fit of rage at the sight of this screen.  But this time is different.  The last level.  The last Artifact.  It is my goal, my mission, my reward, my... Precious.  I wanted it so badly.  Though I've tried in vain over and over again to quit this game, it beckons me.  It calls me.  Like heroin, I know this game brings me great pleasure.  But eventually, that pleasure will end in pain and emptiness.  To receive the last Artifact one must complete the mission with a 'Loadout' of a hundred thousand monetary units or less.  It is a seemingly impossible task.  After many futile and laughable attempts I finally stumbled upon a Loadout combination that brought me increasing success.  Time and time again I attempted this method, refining my strategy until this night I progressed much further than I ever had before.  Much much further.  With nothing but a Saw Arm Blade and a handful of nuclear grenades I snuck through the corridors and shafts, painstakingly murdering one by one the ancient long dead cybernetically animated creatures of the Cryptark.  I bathed their ship systems in nuclear fire.  I murdered them... until only one system remained.  The final Brain.  As I approached it, a mine lay in wait.  I saw it.  I attempted to delicately strike at it to destroy it while keeping my distance so as not to activate it.  I had but one life unit left after all my murdering.  I had used all the repair pods.  The mine exploded.  I don't know if I misjudged the distance or perhaps there was more than one mine.  I miraculously survived the explosion, yet through some sort of vile and twisted mockery of computation, some sort of insipid error of computer science, I was launched not away from the Brain system, but towards it, and pinned in a corner where I was cleansed of life and soul by its purifying energy waves of death.  It happened so fast.  I was so close.  Now I am dead.  My spirit floats among the grinning skulls of prehistoric aliens, haunting the Cryptark forever.  I am not angry now.  I am glad it is over.  The fear.  The anxiety.  The dread.  It's all over now.  I am at peace.","February 25","true","52.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","17","19","9","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastatsan/recommended/344740/","mastatsan","Carlz0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastatsan/","1578 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've been enjoying this a lot so far, so I thought I'd go ahead and leave some nice words.\n\nEarly Access / Developer stuff\n\nFirst of all, since the game is currently in Early Access, the first thing you should be asking is "Is this game worth buying NOW?"  And I would say yes.  It's already very feature-rich, very enjoyable, and I have not encountered any major bugs yet.  I did find a minor bug, and a developer already acknowledged that it's something they need to work on fixing in a future update.\n\nThat leads me to another thing I look for in a good Early Access game: developer interaction with the community.  The main point of Early Access, in my opinion, is to get feedback on the game, so the developers know what to fix, tweak, improve, etc.  So far, the developers have been very active in the discussion boards, taking feedback and bug reports and responding in a courteous and timely manner.. so A+ there.\n\nThe Game Itself\nOverview\nYou've seen "procedurally generated" in the description of this game, and you might be the type of person to wonder "Is this a permadeath game?"  To which I would answer "No, not really.  Kinda?  But not really"  More on that later in the "money and failure" section.\n\nYou've been tasked with making your way deep into a flotilla of derelict alien spaceships, disabling them to make money, so you can continue to delve deeper into the fleet in search of the Cryptark: the fortress-like flagship vessel of the fleet.  So where's the challenge in exploring derelict vessels?  Well, I'm glad you asked... the inhabitants may be gone, but the ships are still programmed to defend themselves, and they are equipped with a multitude of defense systems and automated drones to try and keep you out!\n\nAs you first begin a run and enter the flotilla, you'll be able to choose from 4 ships to raid.  Each one has its own unique layout, but each ship also belongs to a category that will determine what kinds of systems and enemies you may find inside.  Each ship also has it's own set of 3 bonus goals, which include leaving certain systems intact, destroying certain systems, keeping your loadout cost below a certain value, etc.  Completing a ship while adhering to these bonus objectives will earn you extra money.  Completing the mission within a certain time limit will also give you more money.  Neutralize a ship, and you'll be given another set of slightly more difficult ships to pick from for your next raid.\n\nMoney and failure\n\nSo what is money for?  This comes back to the "permadeath" question from earlier, actually.   See, each time you set out to neutralize an enemy ship, you must choose a loadout of equipment before leaving your own ship.  The loadout includes your hull strength, any weapons and equipment you've found from the Tech Advance stations within the enemy vessels, and how much ammo you're taking with you.\n\nYou don't want to show up unprepared, but you also don't want to waste money.  Especially since if you fail and die, you'll lose all that money you spent, as well as an additional fee for replacing your mech-thing.  So dying doesn't immediately end a run, it just forces you to a new set of ships to pick from and try again.. however, if your money goes into the negative, you lose, and THEN you have to start over.\n\nSystems\n\nNow, back to these automated ship systems that I've mentioned a couple of times.  They are perhaps one of the most important things about Cryptark.  Each ship has its own set of systems that perform different tasks.  Some spawn new drones to fight you, or provide a shield around the ship's core.  There's a system to run the alarms, and a system to repair damaged systems.  There's even a system that immediately adapts to assume the functions of the last system that was destroyed!  That's just naming a few, there are many more.  What systems are present, and how many, are determined by the type and difficulty rating of the ship you're heading into.\n\nEach system will attempt to defend itself from destruction, and each type of system will do this in a different way, such as throwing additional enemy drones at you, shooting at you, creating a shield that reflects your bullets, etc.  They're almost kinda like mini-bosses.  If you manage to defeat a system, its functions within the ship cease, making things easier for you.  Just be careful not to waste ammo, time, and your hull going after too many systems.. If you don't manage to destroy the core, the only thing you'll keep from your run are any tech advances you found.\n\nConclusion (for now)\n\nIf I think of anything else to add, or if future updates prompt me to update my review in any way, I'll do so in the future.  For now, this is all I want to say about the game.\n\nAnyway, if you want my opinion, definitely get this game.  If you've read reviews, watched videos, looked at screenshots, and you think this is something you'll like, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  If Early Access isn't your thing, put it on the wishlist and buy it later.\n\nThis is the type of game that makes Early Access a good idea.  It's a quality product, the developers seem to care about finishing it, it's already fun to play, and it's not yet another god-forsaken half-baked Unity-based first person survival and/or zombie game.","October 9, 2015","true","2.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

With games like this I tend to just charge in and hope for the best.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/344740/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCryptark is thrilling, surprisingly clever and terrifyingly hard.\n\nThe goal is simple - choose a derelict spaceship to board, then shoot your way through it and destroy the core. En route you'll deal with turrets, drones and locked doors. Repeat several times in a run to complete the campaign.\n\nBut every ship is a procedurally generated maze, and you'll need to destroy some randomly located ship functions before you have any chance with the core. These functions exist in the game as mini-bosses - tough, static enemies that require different methods of killing (including, in one case, a "press arrows in sequence" mini-game!).\n\nDestroying a ship's function will do things like reducing the armour of all enemies, opening all locked doors, stopping new drones being generated or removing the shield protecting the core. Most are optional - yet often necessary if you don't want to be overwhelmed.\n\nThis is the first reason that you'll need a strategy head for this game. Going to the map will pause the game, and you can plan your route through the ship with care, seeing which functions to destroy in what order. The order can be crucial - for example, if you leave the "repair" function online, any other function you destroy will eventually reappear. But what if it's too hard to reach the repair function without destroying the drone factory first? And so on.\n\nCash is the second reason you'll need to be strategic - your bank account is king. Permadeath in this game is a result of going bankrupt, NOT by running out of health and failing a mission (which, if you've been prudent with spending, you can recover from). This makes planning ahead crucial and introduces a great risk/reward mechanism.\n\nThis mechanism is based on the fact that all weapons and ammo you choose for each mission needs to be paid for - the more impressive loadout you choose, the higher the cost. You can spend more money than you have, but you'd better make enough back from the mission to cover it or it's game over.\n\nGameplay video showing off two missions:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBEFWSe1-t4\n\nYou make cash by completing a mission (by destroying the ship's core), and get bonus cash by achieving some randomly generated bonus goals, and by beating the clock. Conversely, failing a mission or completing a mission too slowly will result in cash penalties.\n\nNeither of these strategic considerations get in the way of the blasting action. Your character glides around with ease and your default loadout includes a shield that you can activate when not shooting - so failing to dodge a bullet hell always feels like your fault, not the game's. Accessing your weapons feels natural if you're using a gamepad, with items such as health packs mapped to the D-pad.\n\nThe loadout mechanism is simple - you have four weapon slots and four item slots, all customisable with a small range of basic weapons/items, plus any extra things you found on previous missions in this run. Extra stuff is dotted at random around spaceships and include variants on existing ones (more powerful machine guns, sticky grenades etc) plus all-new stuff such as rail guns and mines.\n\nTruth be told, having to loadout your guy for every mission does become a chore after a while - and it's essential you keep tweaking it with upgraded weapons, because each new mission is tougher than the last. Another minor problem is that the optional GPS waypoint system isn't great at finding the quickest route through the ship (and it's hard to see on the minimap), so if you have a tricky destination in mind you'll end up flicking back and forth with the map screen.\n\nBut other than those minor quibbles I struggle to find fault with this, even at the very start of early access. The core game is there and completely solid, with the tantalising prospect of more of everything in future. Unlike many modern roguelikes, nothing carries over from game to game so you get better at the game by becoming more skillful and strategic, not through mindless grinding.\n\nAll in all it's a genuinely thrilling action roguelike, my favourite in a long time, and it deserves to do very well.\n\n* More Randomise User indie game videos\n\nThanks to the developers for providing a pre-release version for review.","October 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

This leads to Exhillarating payoffs as you see a shield system burn to cinders,\n\nEverything builds up to destroying the core in malestrom of pink brain lazers and grenade exposions everywhere... It's a very suitable climax, everything you did up to this point leads up to it, and it never disappoints or feels stale.\n\nOnce the core is destroyed, everything slows down and stops... and everything you were doing catches up with you. I have never felt so fatigued after finishing a level, I can rarely play this for more than 30 minutes without becoming exhausted.

It looked cool as hell.  The trailer I watched wowed me with it's pumping dark-industrial soundtrack and polished voiceovers.  The GUI, that monochrome glow of an archaic but somehow still futuristic display screen.  The gameplay chaotic but controlled.  Dangerous and kinetic.  I doubted the game would resemble anything near what I saw in that trailer.  Then I played it.\n\nHoly freaking crap, this game is solid!  Every element comes together to make something memorable, exciting, and addictive.  The 11 year old arcade rat in me would have committed arson for this game.\n\nCryptark has its problems.  The difficulty balance still needs work.  The proceedurally generated "hulks" sometimes come out funky and hard to navigate, and the campaign's budget vs. payoff framework seems unrealistic, but, overall, this is a clean, gorgeous, and deceptively deep game you need to buy right now.\n\nPros:\nGreat presentation.  From the beautiful space-retro monochrome menus and backgrounds, the awesome character and environment art, the top-notch voice acting, to the ABSOLUTELY KILLER SOUNDTRACK, Cryptark stuns from start to exit with a polished showmanship not easilly found in games like this.  Somebody loved making this game and it absolutely shows.\nSolid gameplay that delivers on multiple fronts.  Not only is the game simple to get into, it offers an RPG-light depth to keep you engaged and searching for each new weapon license.  After your first wave, you'll already be itching to try out newfound weapons or rigs so you can hammer down precisely what you want to take in with you while keeping your deployment budget to a minimum.  The rogue mode changes things up and give those that hunger for more shooty-shooty and less checkbook balancing something to really sink their teeth into.\nIt encourages and rewards critical planning and informed snap decision-making.  You'll study for this game.  You'll get to know the symbols on the planning map by heart.  You'll re-map routes on the fly when intel on expected resistance washes.  You might be tempted to turn off your brain and let the bullets fly but the game will do it's best to keep a grip on your brain's balls 100% of the time.\nCon:\nThis game is really ♥♥♥♥ing punishing, sometimes to an unfair extent.  Mistakes cost big and, when every bullet -and every dollar- counts, you will learn very quickly that seemingly deserted alien space ships are not to be trifled with all willy-nilly.  That being said, sometimes you are going to get effed in the "A", no matter how careful you were sneaking around and it often leads to a "shields gone, tell my wife I loved her"-type situation.  A better balance of enemy health vs. damage dealt OR an adjustable ship level progression seem like the best way to fix this.  Why not keep the hulks from levelling up until an artifact is gathered?  Then, wimps like me can float around in level 2s and 3s for a while before we take the plunge.","April 11","true","15.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

While pretty polished for an alpha, there are a few glitches that are annoying. Sometimes the map is glitched which pretty much makes you lose no matter what as you can't properly plan ahead.\n\n\nGiven the high level of replayability, I can't wait for glitches to be fixed. It's an engaging game with tons of action, great complexity that forces you to plan your attack and a wide variety of guns and strategies.\n\nI bought it and don't regret it, but if money is tight, wait until a few of the glitches are fixed. My main gripe is the glitched map making you lose certain fights automatically as you can't plan ahead. Once that's fixed, it'll rooooooock.\n\nWord of warning for people with weaker PCs: Sometimes when you're being swarmed with enemies, frame rates can drop a bit. I'm on a Macbook Pro with a Nvidia 750m and it's still totally playable even with tons of enemies, but I can see this turn into a slideshow for some. It's an alpha of course, so further optimization is to be expected.\n\nI prefer this over Broforce which is somewhat similar because this one's more complex and I can see myself play this for longer.\n\nI give it a 7 out of 10 now but this game has so much potential...once glitches are fixed, this will likely move up to 8/10 or 9/10.

Depending on your picks, you'll have to pay some money.\nYou can go all-in guns blazing and destroy all enemies, but rewards might not quite cut it for you. So, balancing your loadout price and rewards is very important, since when you're out of money - you lose.\nYou can get additional money for doing bonus objectives (which can be quite damn challenging).

Second mission I changed out to different guns, and it felt like a completely different suit.

Alternatively, you can go slow and steady, but expect to not make as much money or even lose money! Speaking of the money mechanic, the only real way to lose the game is to run out of money.

Cryptark falls into this category, as the roguelike elements and different options of weaponry available highlight risk/reward, but smart decision -making while doing it. The visuals definitely were unexpected for the smaller title, especially with the strength of the character portraits in question. It's the gameplay that shines here, with strong variety in terms of gameplay and mechanics, and it sounds like they'll be adding even more as time goes along. While the genre can feel stale at times, this felt fresh even if the mechanics at times were what we've seen before, with strong enemy design and objective based gameplay. I'm probably harder on Early Access games because where they are in the gaming sphere, and what I've seen in the past from them, but make no mistake: Cryptark IS worth your time and money.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/5ocRJ1yy3Rw\n\nLists:\n+:\nGreat Emphasis of decision making before mission with objective based gameplay and loadout selection. Good variety of selections to take on specific missions with.\nLike the modules within the procedurally generated levels which force you to go after certain modules or avoid them in their entirety.\nRe-playability is high. Even though there could be more variety in the long run, I felt like most games played differently and kept me on my feet.\nDifficulty is high, but I love it like that.\nWeapons feel reasonable different with good secondary effects (example EMP grenade). Good\nreasons to change up based on mission, while still keeping a core strength there.\nGreat controls on both the keyboard and the controller.

Didn't crash, rare performance issues, but honestly I've seen steam releases from triple A games that didn't run as good as this. Good to see.\n-:\nPathfinding for map in terms of setting objectives is off, it won't usually show you the most direct path, or will literally send you into the exact wrong direction.\nThe difficulty spike from 2-3 seems unnatural compared to the others, like it needed a bit more ease into it.\nWith large amounts of actions/explosions on screen, can cause performance hitches.

It is an interesting twist on the roguelike formula, the only similar game I can think of is Deadnauts. The game is a space salvage roguelike/2D Mech shooter. You are an independent contractor hired to recover ruined vessels in deep space by shutting down the wreck's security system. Along the way you can recover tech upgrades that give you access to new weapons. This game differs from traditional roguelikes in that the permadeath is of a financial variety. If you cannot stay within budget, you lose.\n\nYou begin by selecting a wreck to investigate, then selecting a loadout, which costs money. You are given a scan of the wreck which gives you a floor plan and location of security systems, tech upgrades, repair pods and ammo pods. You successfully recover a wreck when you destroy the central core, but will want to plan a route through the ship that enables you to shut down the shields and other security systems while picking up tech upgrades on the way to the core.  Eventually there is a final mission which, if you complete it while remaining under budget, wins the game.\n\nThe graphics are colorful and cel-shaded, giving a nice presentation without being ultra-detailed or complex. As it is, in this early access state, the game is great fun, and can only get better.\n\n8/10 - Fun, difficult, but not impossible. Anyone who likes 2D shooters or roguelike games should at least check out gameplay videos.","October 7, 2015","true","3.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Very challenging, love the graphics and music.  Love playing this, must buy.\n\nMy only gripe is the time mechanic.  I understand speed runs, adds to the challenge, but I would like for it to be a reward as opposed to a punishment.  Sometimes I just want to go in and take my time to see everything and clear everything out, cannot do this without eventually going bankrupt it seems.  The more you gear up, the more likely you go bankrupt.  IMHO that is what leaderboards are for, when I want to challenge against everyone else, I will speed run it, but when I am just playing for fun, I like to take my time, check out all of the weapons (gear up to the max), and just go doom style.

It's the roguelike R-Type mashup I never knew I wanted. Unfortunately, I ran into a problem where the key bindings on my gamepad got irreversably screwed up (somehow the D-pad and thumbsticks got reversed with no way to switch them back) so I had to abandon my game on the 4th level, but hopefully these are teething problems that will get sorted out shortly.\n\nA couple of improvements that I would like to see:\n\n* Change the in-game display to match the correct button(s) when you remap keys. (I switched A to interact rather than Dash, but it still shows (X) on screen for any object interactions.\n\n* A larger test chamber for weapons. (it's kind of hard to judge range and speed in such a tiny test chamber)\n\n* Some sort of basic stats (velocity, range, accuracy, damage, etc.) for each weapon that you can see at the time of loadout. I have no idea if the energy blaster or shotgun does more damage than a machine gun bullet, and am too busy not dying out in the field to manually count how many shots from each it takes to kill a given enemy.\n\n* The mission timer is incredibly annoying. It's basically impossible to complete all subtasks and remain on target. I wouldn't mind having a lower difficulty setting that simply turned it off, switching the timer to a bonus if you complete ahead of schedule, and/or handing out bonus time for locating interesting artifacts or completing subtasks. (after all, if they want you to fight halfway across the ship to destroy some door controls, the least they could at least give you a 30 second bonus for doing so... damn tightwads)","October 11, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I very rarely write reviews, I could not normaly be bothered, but this game deserves recognition; these people deserve money.\n\nThis game has everything: Mechs, evil Skeleton aliens, strategy, skill requirement, occational panic-inducing Bullet-Storms. It pours on the nostalgia while adding refinements made over the last two decades. The gameplay is smooth, 10 hours in and glitch free, everything works and feels like it should. Even as early access, this game plays like a finished product, that is to say, better than most released games these days.\n\nPros:\n-well balanced procedural map generation: the ships are wierd and confusing, matching the general "horrible"ness of the alien looks.\n-all the tools you need to beat the game are there, you never feel like the game screwed you, if you loose, you know it was your fault. Rare for a roguelike in my experiance.\n-extremely polished gameplay: the visuals/sound and controls all feel perfectly aligned.\n-wonderful weapon selection: every weapon has its place and the game can be beaten with the starting weapons if you have the skill.\n\nCons:\n-the music is uninspired, but it is there i guess :/\n-early access balancing. IE: the flak cannon wins everything, they need to make it more expensive.\n-the difficulty is all opt-in during the game, no difficulty settings, just personal willingness to punish yourself.\n-the game is too short.\n\nOverall I say that this game is very much worth the ~15$ it costs, I will be returning to this game frequently and even if I don't I feel like I have gotten my money's worth at 10 hours. The largest impression I get while playing this game isnt that its too short or that the difficulty isnt right or anything, but that this game has massive potential.

It didn't feel like an early access game; it felt incredibly complete and polished.\n\nOne thing which I really like about the game is the fact that it is slightly more forgiving than some similar games (such as nuclear throne), but it still pushes you. You can lose a level and as long as you still have some cash inthe bank (after paying an additional penalty for dying), then you can continue trying (maybe this time with a different loadout). Also on all but the final level you have 4 options of which target to choose so you can try to pick one that better fits your desired playstyle.\n\nIt took me 4 attempts and 12 hours to finally reach and beat the final level:\n- Attempt one: beat level 1, died on level 2, died on level 2, beat level 2, died on level 3, died on level 3 and game over\n- Attempt two: beat level 1, beat level 2, beat level 3, died on level 4, died on level 4, died on level 4 and game over\n- Attempt three: beat levels 1-3, died on level 4, beat levels 4, 5 & 6 and got to the final level\n- Final level attempt 1: Chose a decent loadout and blew 1/3 of my stockpiled cash ... died in 40 seconds\n- Final level attempt 2: Modified my loadout to include more medkits and swapped out my railgun for a pulse gun ... died a few minutes later\n- Final level attempt 3: Picked out the biggest/baddest secondary weapon which I could find to help deal with the gargantuans and went in for my last try ... Got wrecked by a pair of gargantuans anyways ... game over\n- Attempt four: I decided to try a different chasis which I had recently unlocked. Had a really hard time adjusting and died once on each of levels 2, 3, and 4 before beating them. Discovered a set of weapons/abilities which I really liked and proceeded to wreck levels 5 and 6 which got me to the final level with a good bankroll of $1mil\n- Final level attempt 1: Spent half of my cash decking out my suit with enough ammo to take down a small army and a copious number of medkits. Made my way through half of the level before finally running out of medkits and dying\n- Final level attempt 2: Planned out a new route to take when securing the level and switched out my sensors for even more medkits. 50 minutes later I beat the level with one medkit to spare. Best feeling ever.\n\n10/10","December 3, 2015","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though its in Alpha they could get away with releasing this on mobile platforms IMO. The game looks polished, it plays well and is very interesting overall.

The first time I left my shuttlecraft through the airlock, the music and SFX volume both dropped and I thought I'd found a bug--then I realized it was because I was now in space where nobody can hear you scream. Sure enough, once I entered the derelict (but still pressurized) vessel through its airlock, the sound picked right back up.\n\nThe premise, or if you like the pretext, of why you're blowing up all these drones (who, after all, were minding their own business before you boarded their ship), is so simple as to be refreshing: you're doing it because you're getting paid to. On top of everything else great about this game, there's a distinct contrast between your employers (a group of reptillian aliens in suits and ties who speak with a Received Pronunciation dialect), and the multispecies blue-collar salvage crew who actually get things done. I haven't beaten the game yet so maybe it ends with an interstellar proletariat seizing the means of production.\n\nIn short, if you like science-fiction roguelikes, twin-stick shooters, or joy and happiness, you owe it to yourself to try this game.","May 29","true","36.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I probably would have given the game a 10/10, but it doesn't work on laptops. The game was really slow, and there was massive lag between, say, moving your mouse, and the game actually responding. I have a good laptop, which should have been able to handle the game with ease. There is a fix on the forums posted by the devs about dedicating it to one specific core, instead of integrated, but after attempting the fix, it was ineffective. I couldn't get past the starting small-room thing in the tutorial due to lag and stuff, so yeah. Devs, pls fix. If i hear that the problem has been resolved/the game more optimized, then I'll be sure to buy it again, but for now... well, I'm waiting for my refund. The gameplay itself looked cool, so if you play on a desktop, then I guess probably get it, I can't say from my own experience whether the gameplay is good or bad, as all I've experienced for myself is some cutscene stuff and a room, being told how to exist by some frog thing whose voice I realized was that of the youtuber Jerma985........ so yeah....\n\n\n\n*EDIT*\nSo, thankfully, with the help of one of the devs (Thanks a whole lot Vermeulen!) I realised that I had done the fix wrong. After trying again, and also fixing other problems I'd had doing the same thing with other things (now that I actually knew what to do) I got Cryptark working, and it works well.\nAnyways, ignore the stuff from above, and now I'll get on with the actual review. I have only played a little bit as of yet, but it seems to have all the ingredients for a delicious cake of mayhem, destruction, and.... budgeting? Well, I haven't seen that angle of things in this genre before, but Alien Trap made it work quite well, adding this sense of a need to conserve ammo and other supplies, while finishing each level quickly, so you can keep your budget up, as well as so you can... You know, survive and stuff. Also, in each level-ship-thing, there are multiple systems, with increasingly difficult enemies and other defense systems. There can be door-control systems, jammer systems (which knock out your map, which actually makes it quite a bit harder to beat that ship) repair systems, alarms, drone-factories, and the way all of these work together really makes you feel like the ship is a living thing, reacting to your every move in a really fluid way. The combat is cool, with tons of weapons to unlock, the music is quite nice, and overall the game seems really nice and polished. Btw, I know it is an early access game, but it feels close to completion. I haven't seen anything game-play related or otherwise that stands out as unfinished. I highly recommend picking up a copy (and making sure you change which graphics card the game uses correctly, if you're a laptop user.)","November 7, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","8"

However, it has some problems (which are to be expected, it's Early Access).\nTo name a few:\n\n- Even at 1280x720, there is serious lag. This is fatal for a quick-reaction game like this, I can't hit anything reliably and end up getting annihilated constantly. This is undoubtedly the biggest problem.\n- Mouse sensitivity seems completely out of whack. This is largely a function of the first problem, when the reticle is moving almost a full second out-of-step with the input, any but the slowest mouse sensitivity results in comical flailing.\n- The mission timer is a really stressful gameplay mechanic, and seems entirely unrealistic. Is this meant to be achievable by the average player? Maybe I'm just terrible. Anyway, be aware that timers can really stress people out, even when the time is entirely achievable (see all the angst over the Majora's Mask three-day timer, which in practice was totally reasonable). Could this maybe be a countdown for a bonus, rather than a necessity to avoid a penalty?\n- This game seems really difficult, though again it may be a function of the previous three problems. Could there perhaps be an easier difficulty in which the timer does nothing, or is twice as long, or something?\n\nThat said, this game IS in early access, and I think it has a lot of potential. I love the art, I love the characters, and I think once it gets the kinks worked out it will be a really good game. I love Roguelikes, and this could be really great.

On paper everything works; the combat is really good, the options/loadout system are fairly deep, there is a pleasant amount of variety between ships (levels) and enemies, and the concept of optional objectives works... in theory.  However unfortunately the rest of the game has kind of attached it's self to the good combat and spread like cancer.  For example every mission/level you have to spend money to effectively rebuild your mech (money that almost entirely vanishes no matter how well you do); it's not bad on paper, but I found it to be dislikable.  Then there is how the game will allow you to try to limp along after you blew all your money on a failed run without a quick restart button to just accept that it's over.  At some point you might also become aware of how much the game fails to mention; for the longest time I assumed the ship types were just fluff until I ran into a 'ghost ship' where I couldn't see the walls/layout in advance.  Then there is how punishing some of the 'optional' objectives are.\n\nThe issue I have is that I really like the combat, building mechs, trying to do all the things, but all the little issues get in the way.  How messing up one important mission in the campaign ruins an entire run.  How the game didn't seem to mention exactly how some things would work in advance.  How the nav system sometimes routes me through a wall.  No doubt I will play some more, but I keep putting the game back down after shorter and shorter plays.","March 9","false","10.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

The art, the gameplay, the voice acting - hell, even the loading screen right before you choose your loadout gives you a feel of anticipation.

It goes from a challenging game to one that might put others off and never play it again.\n\nNote: I would never want others to be robbed of their masochistic need for a hardcore game, and nor do I want a walk in the park, but there must be a way to have both.

The core gameplay is solid, the music and sound effects are good, the visuals are a little cluttered but usable.\n\nThat said, it's main flaw -- and the main reason that I'm giving it a thumbs down -- is that you're entirely at the mercy of the random map design.  Sometimes you'll end up with something that's navigable and a good balance of open space and hallways, and sometimes you'll end up with something critical hidden in an unnavigable crawlspace.  It's annoying when you end up having to bail on a mission because the map is literally unwinnable, and that seems to happen with some regularity.\n\nThere's other balance issues that don't help.\n* The timer is too short; if you have more than one "must kill" system then you're not likely to be able to get in under it, and then you're penalized a chunk of change you probably can't afford.\n* The rewards are too small, the refund value on your suit too low: it's possible to clear a mission in a single go while completing all the objectives and still lose a prohibitively large chunk of money.\n* The gamepad controls are not great; mouse and keyboard ends up being (I think) the best way to actually hit what you aim at, despite the fact that it looks like it was designed with a two-stick gamepad in mind.  Some sort of mild aim assist for gamepad seems like it should be in there, especially given that most of the 'minibosses' require some degree of precision aiming to hit their rather small weak spots.\n* The mapping system seems to want you to make a tactical plan but then the waypoint system doesn't really support it.\n* The way some systems interact can make certain combinations ridiculously difficult, which I don't think is well reflected in the difficulty estimate when you select a system.  Two spawners and a repair system, for instance.\n* Given how tight money is, some of the bonus objective combinations are also prohibitively difficult (6 max hull points while not destroying the alarm, for instance).\n\nSo it's definitely a well done game with no real technical issues outside of the map generation; it's just that with the random map issues, the way it requires precision shooting but doesn't have the controls that support it, and the high, extremely random, and unadjustable difficulty level, I just don't happen to find it fun.  To the extent that those issues sound like they'd bother you, you might want to avoid it.","October 11, 2015","false","1.6"," 19 of 50 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","19","50","0","2"

It's not one of those game when your bored and then you just play it for a couple of minutes while waiting fopr something.

If there is a community the developers should listen to popular ideas and impliment them into the game while making fixes for bugs. I'm not trying to say how to be a good developer i'm just trying to give some recomendations for the developers so they can create a great game that everyone would like to play. all in all i think this game is lots of fun on its own and for an early acess game its one of the best i've played and its really fun to play. It's not one of those game when your bored and then you just play it for a couple of minutes while waiting fopr something. It's one of those games that takes effort to complete like most games which makes it even more fun to play because it would be a geat addition to your steam library and even playes on the PS4 which makes it even better for people with a sony console can also try this game out.  Anyways this game has lots of feats but a few downsides but the game if good enough for these downsides to just be little issues that can be fixed in later updates to the game","December 15, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You generally have 2 choices of ways to deal with a level: you can either try to go in guns blazing, mortars firing, lasers buzzing and rockets exploding, or you can play it slow and tactically. the first level or two, go ahead and go guns blazing. After that, you better make friends with the tab and shift keys fast. There's 5 ships in the game currently and the best is most defiently the salamander. It comes with hazard coating which protects you from fire and slime, important since 2 of your starting weapons are a flamethrower and a slime mortar, but it also comes with the all important melee saw which can be used as an offensive tool to kill or a defensive tool to knock enemys or bullets away. In general, make sure one of your weapons always has infinite ammo, be it from melee or from energy weapons, because you can run out easily in ships 4+ if you don't take enough ammo. As a general rule, explosives are awesome for taking out either juggernauts or ship systems. My favorite tactic with the explosives is nuke missiles to take out the systems since the explosion can damage systems even though some of them are shielded like the shield system. you can also use them to take out juggernauts, which you MIGHT have to do since juggies can go through ship walls, though it's balanced since they are huge targets and are SLOW. When your shields are down to no hull points, you can keep going, though you die in 1 hit, and speaking of, death sucks in this game. When you die, you lose your entire suit and an extra 100k on top of that. If you spend 350k+ on a ship and get screwed because you got lynched by juggernauts, you are out 450k. Until you are confident in your skills, ignore the "3 max hull" objective, because you will probably die.\n\nOnto bad things about it: on later levels, unless you have a decent computer, your FPS will drop somewhat and will likely get you hit or killed. I would like to see some kind of graphics selector since a lot of things going on like that is crazy and kills my computer. I've also experienced some bugs in game. Once my game crashed while starting a mission and i spawned in with no weapons when I loaded the save. Another time, it crashed and i had to go into task manager to close the process so I could restart it.\n\nIn general, if roguelikes are your thing, this is a great game to play, and if they aren't, try it anyways. You might like it and if you do, you might find an entire genre you like.","March 6","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each of the 50+ weapons handles differently, each enemy type is distinctly different in how it behaves, and the way the systems interact with one another drives diverse tactical scenarios. Cryptark is a game design masterclass - there's just no filler content; nothing that exists solely to pad it out and make it seem bigger than it is.

The music and art style is compelling and the game as it is right now is very replayable.\n\nBasically the premise is you need to visit several derelict ships and blow up their cores without getting killed by the ship's defense systems (drones, turrets, nukes, alarm systems, other fun stuff). In each stage of 'campaign' mode you choose one ship out of several to heist, buy your loadout and devise a plan on attack. Each ship is procedurally generated and are like little dungeons. You can vary weapons and tactics depending on what you're up against, and how much challenge you like. You get income from completing the mission and bonuses for completing under certain conditions (depends on the ship).\n\n'Rogue Mode' is new as of this week (end of January) and I'm enjoying it because it's much simpler. No economy, just weapon and item pickups, same high difficulty, global unlocks (suits, etc) as you progress through the game. Basically this mode makes it more like Nuclear Throne, which is probably GOTY 2015 for me.\n\nIt's easier playing with the keyboard / mouse combo, but I enjoy the game more kicking it with a controller, much like their previous game, Apotheon. Speaking of which, I'm pretty sure controller input has improved (as of Jan 2016) over the last couple of months.\n\nWe'll likely see a few changes here and there, already there has been some changes to how the difficulty ramps up, as well as the overall game economy curve. So far the changes have resulted in less raging from my end.\n\nCryptark is easily worth the asking price. You're not just supporting a Canadian indie dev, you're getting a great game.","January 22","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just a mess of systems gone haywire en route to an ultimate goal which, admittedly I have yet to reach.\n\nSupply management is very interesting, tho there are several traps I've noticed.\n\nThe smartgun, while it seems like a very good idea, feels useless when there's an objective nearby. I thought it would be a good weapon to try and outsmart the defensive systems, but it's only "smart" in the same way DSP is. Bluntly hitting things randomly, more often than not, inefficiently. (So I guess it's smart /for a gun/ )\n\nThe chemical launcher I got... Well...

Similar to the first time I played FTL, my first attemps were short, but knowing it was hard let me get over it and try again.  With the unlocks and huge variety of weapons, I keep finding myself sitting down for "one more salvage" (one normally between 2-4).  I initially had fun without a deeper understanding of the game, but as I dig deeper with weapon combos and strategy, I just can't get enough!","January 30","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each of the 50+ weapons handles differently, each enemy type is distinctly different in how it behaves, and the way the systems interact with one another drives diverse tactical scenarios. Cryptark is a game design masterclass - there's just no filler content; nothing that exists solely to pad it out and make it seem bigger than it is. Oh, and it looks really nice too, with normal mapped pixel art.\n\nHighest Recommendation 10/10","January 24","true","61.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is basically a finished game which is knid of rare for early access. But it is very laggy and hard to control on laptop. As long as you play on desktop it is fine. Also fair warning it is a bit challenging so if you are a casual gamer maybe don't buy this game.","January 3","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You generally have 2 choices of ways to deal with a level: you can either try to go in guns blazing, mortars firing, lasers buzzing and rockets exploding, or you can play it slow and tactically. the first level or two, go ahead and go guns blazing. After that, you better make friends with the tab and shift keys fast. There's 5 ships in the game currently and the best is most defiently the salamander. It comes with hazard coating which protects you from fire and slime, important since 2 of your starting weapons are a flamethrower and a slime mortar, but it also comes with the all important melee saw which can be used as an offensive tool to kill or a defensive tool to knock enemys or bullets away. In general, make sure one of your weapons always has infinite ammo, be it from melee or from energy weapons, because you can run out easily in ships 4+ if you don't take enough ammo. As a general rule, explosives are awesome for taking out either juggernauts or ship systems. My favorite tactic with the explosives is nuke missiles to take out the systems since the explosion can damage systems even though some of them are shielded like the shield system. you can also use them to take out juggernauts, which you MIGHT have to do since juggies can go through ship walls, though it's balanced since they are huge targets and are SLOW. When your shields are down to no hull points, you can keep going, though you die in 1 hit, and speaking of, death sucks in this game. When you die, you lose your entire suit and an extra 100k on top of that. If you spend 350k+ on a ship and get screwed because you got lynched by juggernauts, you are out 450k. Until you are confident in your skills, ignore the "3 max hull" objective, because you will probably die.\n\nOnto bad things about it: on later levels, unless you have a decent computer, your FPS will drop somewhat and will likely get you hit or killed. I would like to see some kind of graphics selector since a lot of things going on like that is crazy and kills my computer. I've also experienced some bugs in game. Once my game crashed while starting a mission and i spawned in with no weapons when I loaded the save. Another time, it crashed and i had to go into task manager to close the process so I could restart it.\n\nIn general, if roguelikes are your thing, this is a great game to play, and if they aren't, try it anyways. You might like it and if you do, you might find an entire genre you like.","March 6","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I try the game once every month or so since I got it.\n\nAt first, game was unplayable on my Macbook Pro in osX.\nA few updates later, it got better. I reinstalled the game on Windows 10 Bootcamp. This combined with the updates made it really playable on an aging 750M. Furthermore, the low detail settings introdueced by the devs made it fluid to comfortably play in Asian high temperatures on my laptop.\nSo here goes for the past performance woes : as far as I am concerned thoses have been worked on and mostly solved thanks to the work of the developpers.\n\nTalking about the low detail mode, do not think it makes the game look ugly : I actually find it more easily readable when beginning the game with all the industrial moving parts in the levels !\n\nNot only did they work on performance but they added with each updates lots of details and grander details on an already pretty mature gameplay.\n\nLatest one introduced for example lots more variety in the floating objects, active or not (debris) you encounter throughout the levels.\n\nThe game is hard in its story mode, probably too hard for my comfort. A rogue, arcade mode has been implemented to play the game without the story, progress, permadeath of campaign mode (kinda - you have a budget and can fail a level to go to another one, it will cost you money to replace your gear, once all your budget is gone, you are fired by your shady employers ...).\nOf' course you have only one life in rogue mode but it's totally fair in these conditions somehow.\n\n\nGraphics are full of strong character and pretty gorgeous. Screenshots don't do justice ot how everything is animated and orchestrated.\n\n\nI expect the full release to be a hit. As it is now, you can totally grab it already to support the development of a superb arcade rogue-ish but with its very own identity both in terms of gameplay and design.\nThough my advise is always to wait for full release to fully enjoy a mostly finished product.\n\nLast thing, you need a joypad to play the game.\nHighly recommended for scifi shooters, arcade, rogue-ish with unlocks and strongly charactered fans.\n\n","May 6","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
