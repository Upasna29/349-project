You are the Earth's first Dinonaut and you recieve an urgent call telling you that a meteor is heading to Earth. You must go back home to save your planet.\n\nGameplay\nThrough my playthrough I have used a controller. The levels are well designed. However, I have run into a few bugs that ruined my experience. The bug I found was on the first boss fight where I would glitch into the boss and be stuck, or glitch under the map and be stuck.\nThe levels are challenging and fun and the music is amazing. After I beat the first boss, I saw a difficulty curve appear as levels get much harder to beat.\nThrough the game you can collect $$$ to buy customization items for your dinosaur. You will be able to play the game for hours upon hours. This game is one that will cause rage in certain levels. Throughout the game there are collectibles hidden throughout the map which you can find and they will be added to your room.\n\nConsider buying this/ not buying this if\nConsider buying this if:\n- you like the classic feel with videogames\n- you like 2D platformers\n- you like a challenge\n\nConsider not buying this if:\n- you do not like rage games\n- you hate dying (most likely you will die a lot)\n- you hate pixelated games or 2D platformers\n\nRating\nPros\n+ many hours of gameplay\n+ customization\n+ music is very well done\n+ gives an authentic classic feel\n+ difficult and a challenge\n+ many collectibles\n+ dino basketball\n\nCons\n- may glitch\n- may have random lag spikes ( it did for me at random moments within this game)\n- huge difficulty curve\n- may become slightly repetitive\n- only local co-op\n\nFinal Thoughts\nJumpJet Rex is an amazing game with a magnificent soundtrack and a perfect old-school feel. The huge difficulty curve is annoying and you sometimes will run into bumps. However, overall as a game I am impressed with JumpJet Rex and am happy to have played it.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 22, 2015","true","2.2"," 72 of 78 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","72","78","3","0"

This, however, is GREAT.  It's like Super Meat Boy met Flappy Bird and gave birth to a dinosaur with jetpacks on his feet.  "Eww, Flappy Bird! That game is soooo stooooopid!" You may or may not have just said. "That also came out in 2013!! Are you stuck in the past, grandma?!" Haha okay there buddy, but seriously, hear me out!\nIn my first dive in I found that the game was very easy to pick up; the controls were very responsive and so easy to grasp that within minutes I was literally flying through the levels like I was DINO-PETER PAN!  It feels like its at the right speed too - not too slow to make it feel clunky, and not too fast to make it overwhelming.\nThe art style is super cute - I just love my lil' Rex with his lil' cyborg eyepatch - did I mention you can dress up and customize Rex?  Yeah, you can DO THAT. And it's AWESOME. I may be just biased though because I'm a GIRL.  Who sometimes plays into GENDER STEREOTYPES.\nAaaanyways, the levels are quite diverse and I never knew what to expect going into each one, which is fun! I love mysteries! I mean it's not exactly Jump Jet Agatha Christie but y'know, it's cool.  In all seriousness though, the level design is tight. There's also no forced tutorial but rather a main hub where you can learn basic mechanics and manoeuvres either yourself or through training, which is a nice option.\nThis game, despite being so easy to pick up, is very punishing - something that it openly advertises, so that's probably what the devs were going for.  I found myself getting a little frustrated with the first boss battle after I died a ton trying to figure out how to beat it.  The problem with this one battle was that the pacing was so different from before - I'd been trained to just GO GO GO as fast as I could throughout the previous levels while in this battle I had to wait for the right time to attack - it was actually easier to stand still than to keep moving.  Despite this I've still really enjoyed JJR and heavily recommend it to anyone that is looking for a strong platforming game that you'll not only have a ton of fun playing but will also challenge you. Even a filthy casual like me enjoyed it! Support your the indies, guys! :)","February 9, 2015","true","1.1"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","34","40","10","1"

I'm stuck in the past, rarely do I find a platformer that I feel can stand up to the SNES era.\n\nJumpJet Rex though, took me totally by surprise. I didn't expect to fall so hard and fast for this game.\n\nI always look for specific things in a platformer, a formula for perfection if you might:\n\nDifficulty - Is the game challenging? Will it make me shout profanities but still make me eager to go back for more? Check. JumpJet Rex is no easy ride, though the difficulty curve put in place is sublime. Not too fast, not too slow, excellent pacing.\n\nControls - I can get really wound up about clunky controls in platformers. There is a certain "feel" that needs to be reached. I have no qualms about the controls for JJR, very reponsive, reactive and creative.\n\nReplayability - Will I feel like playing through the levels again? Will I get attached to the world the developers present to me? JJR hits this mark splendidly. Not only can you complete the levels, there are plenty of collectables in place. You are graded on each level out of 3 stars. Completion, not dying and time. You need a certain amount of stars to prgress onto further levels, so you will find yourself revisiting levels, and I wa absolutely glad to every time!\n\nAppearance - Is the game easy on the eyes? How is the level design? Seriously, JJR is one of the most beautiful modern platformers I have played. The graphics are fun, edgy and cute. You can also customise your little dino, LOADS of options available. You can buy customisation items from a store, with currency you earn IN-GAME, or find them hidden within levels.\n\nBoss Fights - Will the boss actually challenge me? Will I feel the rage build up as I am slaughtered over and over again and feel like a champion when I overcome them? JJR delivers this. The bosses require you to figure them out. There is zero hand-holding.\n\nMusic - Will the music match the theme of the game? Will the music egg me on as I play through? JJR again, passes with flying colours. I usually game with my own music, but for JJR I absolutely love the soundtrack, it gets the heart pumping! Beautiful.\n\nIn summary, I can't reccomend this game enough to anyone, epecially if you enjoy platforming! Seriously, it's a little dinosaur with jet-pack shoes. Buy it, you wont be dissapointed.\n\nYours sincerely, an absolute platforming snob.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glaedrlol/recommended/329460/","glaedrlol","Glaedr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glaedrlol/","38 products in account","Since this game has many reviews relating to how it is as a casual game, I would like to look at it from a speedrunner's perspective, since much of this game seems to revolve around that part. I've spent almost all of my time on this game speedrunning it rather than trying to go through and 100% the game, so I feel like this would help people looking for something fast to play.\n\nTo begin, this is basically platformer, except you get to fly around so there's no actual platforming involved. Much of the challenge comes from a few enemies and obstacles scattered around. The amount may vary from no enemies and only a couple thorny bushes to 50 lasers shooting at you at once. Each map is a course where you must go through rings to complete the level.\n\nThis game offers fairly simple movement in the form of flight that is nice for casual runs, but it can be very fun to utilize to its full potential in speedrunning. This is obviously subjective, but the movement is extremely fluid, making it so the only reason why a person would fail would be due to their own ability.\n\nOnce you move into the actual level design, that's when things get a bit murky. I don't want to talk badly about the levels since anything can be speedran if you put effort into it, but some are extremely difficult and require a great deal of time and patience to do at the speed of top runners. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to think about if you're just looking for a fun and easy game to run. This game focuses quite a bit on ILs, so getting top times on each level could take quite awhile. I would say there is massive variety in the levels so I would also let that be known.\n\nThis game offers a ton of things to collect in each level if anyone ever wanted to attempt to speedrun 100%, so that's a plus for dedicated people looking for some replay value. I wouldn't say it's to the point of obnoxiousness, but some of the levels are fairly difficult to 100% complete, which is where the speedrunning part becomes a lot more challenging to master.\n\nOverall, I think this is an excellent game with an active community and plenty of room to improve on. It has simple mechanics that take time to master and a hefty amount of content to explore, which is great for people looking for a lot of replay value.","September 21, 2015","true","77.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/329460/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","JumpJet Rex is a 2D retro platformer with NES-style pixel art graphics. You control Rex, a tyrannosaur astronaut whose job it is to save Earth from an incoming asteroid. The gameplay consists of navigating your way through a number of 2D levels – 40 to be exact – plus four boss stages.\n\nThe core gameplay is fairly simple – the central premise is that you have a pair of rocket boots, meaning you can jump an infinite amount of times in the air, boost yourself straight up at a high rate, boost yourself sideways at a high rate (which launches a mid-range projectile in the opposite direction), or do a butt stomp to deal damage to something below you. You also have a bicycle kick which deals damage in all directions around you.\n\nThere are a number of enemies. Some of them can be killed with some of your attacks, while others can be temporarily stunned. More interestingly, most projectiles can also be destroyed by your attacks, allowing you to defend yourself from them.\n\nThe bosses all have large numbers of hit points; three of them are fairly standard “large hit point gauge” bosses, though each of them has a way to be killed much more quickly. The final boss has two phases, and the first phase regenerates, making it easily the hardest boss in the game.\n\nThe primary goal is of the game is the three stars you get for completing each stage; you need a certain number of stars to unlock more stages, and getting the “proper” ending requires you to get almost all of the stars in the game. One star is awarded automatically for completing each stage; this is generally not a terribly difficult task, as there are checkpoints in the levels and most of the stages are pretty generous with them. A second star is awarded for completing a stage without dying, and a third star is awarded for completing a stage within a certain time limit. You don’t need to accomplish both optional tasks in one run to get all three stars, but on many of the stages, the time limits are tight enough that you cannot afford to die, or can only die once, to get the time. Because the stages are persistent after your death, there are times when dying and respawning closer to where you need to go can cut down on the time needed to beat a level, and a few levels require you to do so.\n\nThere are optional bonus levels and collectibles in almost every stage which unlock cosmetic improvements to Rex’s home base. In addition, each stage contains a large number of coins and gems which can be collected in order to purchase cosmetic items; collecting all the coins gives a coin bonus, and eventually, an achievement for doing it in every stage.\n\n\n\nOnly the very final stage in the game does not have checkpoints, and it is a borderline platform hell level, making it pretty annoying.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty tough as far as such games go; it took me about 7 hours and 40 minutes to 100% the game according to the in-game timer. It is nowhere near the difficulty level of, say, a game like Super Meat Boy, but it is still fairly tough. The real challenge mostly lies in the speed runs, though in a few levels, not dying is the more difficult challenge.\n\nBy and large, the levels are decent enough, but it is hard to shake the feeling that, for the first 3/4ths of the game, there isn’t much to denote your progress. The stages get gradually harder, but only the final nine stages really feel all that different from what came before. The game never gets too difficult (save for the final, checkpointless stage which is a borderline platform hell level, which is a bit frustrating) but apart from the final area there is little sense of progression.\n\nThe game mechanics and level designs are decent enough, but the stages aren’t terribly pretty and are pretty bare-bones functional, as is typical in such retro games.\n\nIn the end, I can’t really recommend this game, but not because it is bad. It is not bad. It is decent enough and I didn’t feel bored while playing it. What the game suffers from is being mediocre. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it is pretty much exactly enjoyable enough to keep the player from getting bored, never so good that you get actively excited about it. You just aren’t missing anything by never playing this game. And if you aren’t missing anything by playing a game, why give up eight hours of your life to do so?","May 7","false","9.8"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","9"

The game has an interesting 'speedrun' mode with the objective to achieve the fastest time possible. Though the game is fun playing casually, I found more enjoyment in beating people's times on the leaderboard.\n\nIf you are looking to play the game casually, it's a very fun platformer where you are speeding through levels as a T-Rex with booster shoes! It also has a nice soundtrack that matches the game's nice 16-bit graphics. But it IS a short game(2-3+ hrs) and depending on how loose your wallet is, $15 might be a steep price to pay. I recommend this game and if it ever receives goes on a discount it would definitely be worth it.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGreat but short platformer.

The game consist of racing against the clock while navigating through increasingly difficult levels while collecting the power rings that unlock the gate at the end of the level. All the while you’ll be dodging spikes, missiles, robots, and zombie like plants from a variety of settings such as space, ice, and jungle worlds. Upon completion of the level you will be awarded stars that are required to progress the game further and unlock the next batch of levels; you are awarded one star for simply completing the level, one star for completing the level without dying, and a third star for finishing the level within the given challenge time limit. Along the way you will be able to collect numerous coins that can be used to purchase adorable cosmetic items for your tiny dino hero.\n\nThe game boasts a gorgeous hand-drawn 16 bit retro art style that harkens back to the old days of the Sega Genesis. The game thrives on its fast paced race against the clock and one hit heart system that combine for at times, quite the punishing experience. The controls are fluid and responsive, whether you are jumping, dashing, or rolling, if you happen to die you won’t feel cheated because the controls were at fault, something that is crucial for a 2D platformer of this speed and difficulty. If you get frustrated easily or hate repetition then this is not the game for you, as you will quickly learn the ins and outs of each level as you repeatedly die over and over again. This game does not hold your hand and mistakes are not forgiven, the satisfaction of finally overcoming the challenge of racing the clock and completing the level without taking a single hit is a very rewarding feeling.\n\nAll in all the game offers a fun, fast paced, 2D platforming experience that that provides a high level of challenge as well as a high level of replayablity.","October 15, 2015","true","1.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Which you can use to buy skins. Nice!\n\nCons:\n\n- Engine: One main problem is its performance. I play it on an i7 quadcore with an ok gaming video card.\nIn a ridiculous resolution (1280x720). And the game lags in huge levels. I even got the feeling, that sometimes when I hit a button it just doesn't react at all. So there seems to be a technical problem in the core engine.\n- Speedrunning concept: The developers want you to speedrun the levels. There is a bonus if you finish within a narrow time limit. But you just don't see enough in a lot of levels with your small point of view. So sometimes, suddenly, out of nowwhere, an enemy appears or a big block goes straight towards you. And you don't feel like you had a lot of chances to avoid it, except for learning the level by hard. Wrong approach in my opinion.\n- Boss fights: The bosses mostly annoy me, they are hard but not in a good way. Hard to describe.\n- Full price is too expensive. I paid 5€ during sale which seems ok, but it is definitely not worth 15€.  Here you have better options (e.g. BattleBlock Theater).\n\nConclusion:\nIt's ok to play it in easy mode, casually, then you will have a lot of fun. But I wouldn't speedrun it or try to get every achievement.","August 7, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It was updated recently (showing that it's not yet abandoned) with the last set of levels and clear plans for the forth (and seemingly final) boss so has much of the game completely built therefore.  The new update also included one of the most crucial things required by all games, a.k.a. an extensive settings menu that (finally) allows players to escape full screen mode and alter sound within the game engine.  The settings themselves are rather basic, but that is passable in this case due to the basic nature of the game.  Despite being basic, this game WILL kick your bum time and time again if you are a casual player.  It is because of this that I recommend the game only to cautionary players who are aware of it's potential difficulty.  It is one game which is hard but in fair ways, so pros at games like Dark Souls may not be phased, but normal players can expect a challenging game with much to find and more awaiting for those patient enough to wait for each update.\n*****That said, THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE and therefore I advise extreme hesitation as you may not get your money's worth if the project fails.","March 30, 2015","true","33.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

Skip to Early Access section to avoid]: I beat the game in speedrun mode, took over two hours straight for me to do. I was behind in the race I was doing at first, but I quickly took a lead in the earlygame as I went through all the levels I knew beforehand in a flash, giving be this big star lead over my friend.  But when I finally did get to the home stretch, my friend took the lead and ended up getting to the asteroid before me. I managed to catch up within 10-20 minutes, and I actually found the path before him, but I gave up on the path as I assumed it was the wrong one... Then he ended up just telling me because we were both taking so long on the level.  We both took a snack break, pausing our games at the same time, and after we continued, I lost.  I kept going though, as I wanted to see how long it would take me to finish my run.  Yeah... I actually liked the experience, but the fact that a single mistake would cost me anywhere between fifteen seconds and nearly a minute really added up.  (Anyone else just kept jumping into spikes? I know I did. Alot.)  I'll be playing through the regular mode 100% before I modify this to be a full review.\n\nBefore we go to early access section, just remember this.  IF YOU GET THIS GAME, IT WILL BE TOUGH.\n\n[Below was in Early Access, before the first boss was moved and some modifications to levels were made.]\n\nJump! Dash! Jump! Dash! Die! Repeat until level is complete!\n\nYes, this is a 2D classic-style platformer with a lot of hidden references.  I'll warn you this, it gives you infinite jumps.  Now you may think that's overpowered, but remember, the obstacles get pretty hard, and your afterburners are your only way of dealing damage other than ramming your head into some of the enemies.  One hit and you die.\n\nThis game is EASILY speedrunner friendly, and unique.  Heck, they even let you test out the controls on the title screen!  I love it when games let me do that.  Gives me a convenient way to warm-up pre-run.\n\nYou can customize the T-Rex you play as. (Spoiler alert: Mine already has a Megaman helmet!)  From colors, heads/helmets, boots, heck even to your boots' trails, it's all customizable.  The shop mixes up every 15 minutes of playtime after you leave the Dinonaut Base, so be ready to rush to the store and check it out if you have 2000 coins or so already!  (This timer includes time used resetting the level, from what I can tell, only time spent in the shop seems to not count.)\n\nThe difficulty? Oh, yeah, it's quite unforgiving, but only if you want that no death star...  Otherwise you respawn at checkpoints... UNLESS you play on the harder mode--it even has rage quit in its name... Listen, that mode gives you 3 lives and no checkpoints for the ENTIRE game if I understand it correctly.  I've only played up to the first boss so far, though, so I don't know exactly how hard it'll get.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it gives you 3 singleplayer save files, so you atleast don't have to delete all progress files every time you restart the game.  Not sure if the files are seperate in Coop or not yet.  The controls are VERY accurate.  Once you input a control, it feels basically instant responses, atleast with the Xbox 360 Controller that I was using.  Oh yeah, did I mention?  It supports controllers directly!\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent, infact if the soundtrack doesn't come with the game, I'll probably go ahead and pick up the soundtrack if it's cheap enough.  It's not often that I actually listen to the game's music/sounds if I'm not streaming my run, excluding certain games of course...  But this game easily passes to a point where I'll probably barely ever not listen to it.  Infact, this is probably one of the first platformers to make it on that list of mine.\n\nYou can directly challenge the WR IL times if you wish, thus if you just want to try to hit a IL record, you can easily get ready to do so through that.  You also can challenge your PB--infact it does so on its own if you already have beaten the stage before apparently.  It took approximately 1.2 hours for me to get through the first set of levels and the first boss in total, if you include trying to get the 3 stars in most of the levels and the time spent shopping/adjusting to the controls. (Which I got in all of them except the boss!)\n\nI'll likely come back and update the review if possible after I have more gameplay.  But seriously, it's 20% off until the 30th, and you get a 2nd copy to gift to a friend for free if you get it during early access?  It's easily worth the price tag for how much you can do in the game.  See you when I update this review, and if I end up not updating it, in the next review I do!\n\n(Rating of the game that I consider as of reviewing: 10/10, as I can't see any flaws so far, aside from the fact that there's a few things not in the game just yet, but should be in the game soon considering full release is upcoming!)","March 27, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The first few levels aren't fantastic but they let you get to grips with the controls and prepare you for the faster paced, more dangerous levels to come.\nThe main focus of the game is to use Rex's foot mounted jets to stay off the ground and keep a solid momentum while jumping, flying and propelling forward through each level; collecting coins and jumping through rings along the way. Level design is very creative and although the levels are short the game encourages replaying them by offering rewards for no death runs as well as speederuns. Those are optional however so more casual players can still enjoy the game.\n\nJumpJet Rex isn't perfect, however. The soundtrack is quite good but a bit repetitive and the controls could be just a little tighter. There are upgrades to be unlocked as well but they're all entirely cosmetic. I think it would've been nice to be able to buy a few upgrades to jump higher or move faster.\n\nOverall I'd say it's worth the low price as the gameplay manages to be both unique and familiar at the same time, not to mention an absolute blast to play.","May 7","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It was decent fun, but it was kind of on the easy side. Didn't really stand out.\n\nGoing back and playing through in speedrun mode after I knew the levels kind of well, I got it, yeah. And going through and getting good times on individual levels by themselves, too, I got it. This is a great speedgame, but a relatively easy game on its own, for a platformer at least. It's like, a casual speedrunning game, or something. There's not a lot of competition in the leaderboards though, unfortunately.\n\nThe bosses all have a trick to them that basically trivializes them but fighting them any other way is tedious, I find them very weird. Sometimes it feels like my dash input was being dropped, or the dash cancel was being dropped. Not often, but I noticed it, felt weird when it happened.\n\nGame looks nice, probably not enough levels, only about 45 and only a few take more than a minute when speedrunning, ends up feeling really short. Not a fan of some of the grindy achievements, but they're optional and most of the achievements are good.\n\nIt's fun to play and optimize the levels and that's about all I could really ask, just wish there was a bit more of a challenge to it overall but ehh! Pretty good game, not one of my favorites ever or anything but I'm glad I played it.","September 9, 2015","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The length of levels are about on par with 'The End' in super meat boy being ~45 seconds, however some maps can be upwards to 2+ minutes long featuring a multitude of paths to take or being a long path filled to the brim with traps.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game are the Jump jet boots Rex wears. The boots allow him to jump anywhere in the air as much as he'd like, but if you wanna go fast, you can dash sideways, stomp down for faster falling speed, or boost upwards which is faster than spamming jump, but is initially much slower. Overall I love those boots, it's surprising how creative you can get with some obstacles and saving a lot of time on a nice chunk levels.\n\nThe goal of each level isn't necessarily just beating them either, Like Super Meat Boy there's a par time that they push you to complete under, in my case they seemed pretty fair with a few curve balls they throw in to catch you off guard and force you to think out the box. Then there's deathless runs, which can be absolutely brutal on the late levels that can be ~2 minute long runs of non-stop pain for your Dino. There's two other goals that aren't necessary for getting the ending, grabbing all coins, and finding all secret loot stashed in the levels, so if you're a completionist, expect some hunts for specific coins or treasure.\n\nAll in all that games pretty great, albeit a little short for my tastes. I'd definitely recommend it to fans of challenging platformers, there was a lot more fun than frustration and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\n\nAs of this review I've completed the game, 3 starred all missions, and collected all secret items so feel free to use that for a reference for the length of the game, although the game definitely has high replayability, and if you're crazy about getting those small times to earn nice spots on the leaderboards, then expect a lot more hours invested.","June 1, 2015","true","12.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

Great controls (played with Gamepad), great Hub and attention to detail.\n\nThe game(play) itself is a fast paced "platformer", in which you navigate through levels using your skills.\nEverything is in-the-air, without the need to ever touch the ground, so it is obviously not a "classical" platformer.\nControls consist of jumps, fast thrust up and down, a dash, and a spin. These skills have additional nuances to them, and are very responsive.\nFast respawns make time-hunting enjoyable.\nReally, nothing to complain.\n\nThe only things I didn’t like:\n* No dub, thus a little bit of text to read at the beginning - story wise. (obviously you can just skip the text.)\n* One of the early levels you can choose the order/direction you finish the level - I did it just once and left.

There aren’t as much levels in it (and they aren't as hard as in SMB) but the length of a stage is much longer than in SMB.\nYou are a T-rex in space (a dinonaut to be a precise) who has the task to plant a bomb on a meteorite aiming for the earth (to prevent the extinction of all dinosaurs).\nRex is equipped with a pair of boots which allow him to fly indefinitely (dash, rocket and unlimited jump). Of course you can’t just fly how you want. The levels are so designed that you have to carefully utilize your abilities to reach the end of a stage in one piece.\nIn each level are 3 stars to get: one for finishing the stage, another one for beating a certain time limit and a third one for reaching the finish line without dying. As you collect stars you unlock more stages.\n\nBesides coins you collect in the levels, which you can spend in shops to customize Rex from tip to toe (different heads, body- , jumpboots- and jet stream-colors), you can also find hidden items in each stage which are merely decorative (referring to the gaming society and pop culture) but still nice to have because they aren’t easy to find and give you a feeling of accomplishment.\n\nAdditionally to the normal levels are 4 boss levels. Those fights are entertaining and at the first sight very hard. But as soon as you look through the enemy and recognize their weakness you can finish a fight in a few seconds (which is also necessary to get the time star ;)).\n\nThe 8-bit graphics are nice to look at; the different themes of the stages are good conversed to the player. As you would’ve thought the music is 8-bit chiptune. There are some tracks that I really like and furthermore none of the soundtrack gets annoying as you might have thought. Certainly the music and the graphics are not for everyone but if you are fond of 8-bit music and graphics there is no reason against JumpJet Rex (regarding the art and music).\n\nI’d recommend the game to those who’d like the 8-bit style, a challenge, and have no problem with doing a level over and over again to fully complete it (For your info: it is not necessary to get ALL stars to finish the game, 2/3 are sufficient to complete the game).","August 11, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A wonderful 2D 8-Bit platformer that I absolutely recommend to anyone (although I would recommend waiting for the final release).  As an early access title, I feel that there are a lot of problems that, if fixed, will make the game a tad more enjoyable.\n\nGREAT STUFF ABOUT THE GAME\n8-Bit Graphics are beautiful and done very well\nMusic is excellent, nothing to complain about here\nWorld map is perfect, I like the concept\nIt's funPROBLEMS WITH THE GAME\nMy main issue is the controls. Being unable to assign buttons yourself and being a controler-less keyboard player, it's a real pain having to use the Alt key and Space key together (I'm on a Mac). I would like to be able to asign buttons myself.\nThe main character is pretty stiff to control. What annoys me the most is the "Y" button which is supposed to make the character fly, but the acceleration is slow and constantly jumping is faster. Same with the ground-pound, which has an acceleration too slow and letting the character drop down is as fast. Also, more precision is a little better.\nThe mouse should NOT be used at all in the game. It's a platformer, using a mouse is hellish in these cases.\nThe boss's life bar is often stuck behind him, making it sometimes invisible. The first boss fight (that's as much as I reached) takes a ton of time to beat.\nThe title screen confuses me. I prefer having a menu rather than controlling the character itself. Also, it is very confusing to understand what's going on. Finally, the character can go out of bounds.GLITCHES\nGetting killed by an enemy and immediately restarting the level, the music will no longer play until you get killed again and you don't restart.\nReaching the High Scores will result in having trouble quitting, since you need to use your MOUSE to click the exit button and resume to the title screen.\nOverall, great game, I can't wait to see how the finished product will look like.","February 26, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Seriously. Think old school 8-bit intense gameplay paired with speedrunning and avoiding life-ending obstacles. There's also boss fights like Mega Man and you gotta use your dino-jetpack to fight them.\n\nLevels? It's got a whole bunch. Each level has certain objectives (finish without dying, complete under a certain time frame, etc.) and you earn stars as you complete them. Earn enough stars, you unlock more levels and bosses and progress through the game. Don't fret though, you've got as many tries as you'd like to complete the levels, theres no "game over" waiting if you're not quick enough. But for real, be prepared to be frustrated on certain levels. Sometimes you'll repeatedly make the same mistake of boosting into a laser beam....and yeah, you'll get annoyed. But it's still fun!\n\nThe variety of level design keeps the game fresh as you play on and the cleverness of being a little dinosaur keeps it fun. If you collect enough coins while playing, you can buy aesthetic upgrades to change the appearance of your character and customize it to your liking.\n\nSo could I keep talking about the game? Sure. But ultimately you should really give it a shot and see how you like it. If you're at all interested in games that challenge your skills in a fun speed-run/platformer way then I think you'll like this game a lot. 8/10 (needs more dinosuars)\n\n*Updated: So the game has had a bunch of updates as its progressed. A new health system is in place so you can take a few hits before you're "dead". This makes the game not nearly as hard as it was before, but still challenging. Theres a bunch of new levels added and secrets to find and all that jazz.

I clocked almost 10hrs so far without any co-op or another difficulty and im still not finished.\nThe game really reminded me of Blues Brothers from the SNES sometimes. You have your basic abilities at your hand and need to get good with them to beat every level and get every star. You will rage a lot but mostly due to your own failure in timing or wrong technic in using the abilities you have at your command. I noticed that first hand as I progressed further into the game, at first some time based stars in the earlier levels were impossible to get for me but later on I just breezed through them as I mastered Rex movements more and more.\nThere will be challenge, but dont be afraid to take it. Play with a controller, warm up and then attempt the star you want to get. All stars are possible as far as I noticed, some require strategy but that is expected.\n\nI hope I get to play the co-op based modes (race and normal adventure).\n\nThe only negative I could think of might be story related. But a game like this doesnt need a lot of story, the old SNES games never had a lot of story and carried their weight purely on the mechanics as does JumpJet Rex.","August 9, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/329460/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","Speedrunning used to be a small genre within the gaming scene. You’d take a game, preferably one with action/platforming aspects, and simply attempt to beat it as quick as possible. Within the past five years, speedrunning has become a genre entirely of its own. While most speedrunning games still harken back to their platforming and action roots, they usually also feature a timer, a time to beat, and enough speed to make a cracked out Sonic drinking Red Bull get jealous. JumpJet Rex exemplifies speed. Paired with a colorful aesthetic and a bevy of extremely varied levels, you will be shaving seconds with pleasure in an attempt to see what comes next. Will JumpJet Rex speed it’s way into your heart, or crash and burn? Let’s take a closer look at JumpJet Rex.\n\nThe controls in this game feel extremely smooth. Most people haven’t played as a dinosaur in rocket-boots before, but let me tell you that it’s surprisingly much easier than it sounds. Hitting X will send Rex rocketing in the direction you are currently facing, with reckless abandon. This is the primary ability used to get through stages, along with your levitate ability which is activated with Y. Pressing A will allow an itty-bitty jump, and B will have Rex tuck his legs and butt-slam his way to the ground. You will need to chain all of these abilities effectively in order to avoid enemies, obstacles, and traps in an attempt to reach the end of the stage. Just reaching the end is enough to win a star, but each stage has two additional stars. One awarded for not dying. The other can be won by completing the course under the par time.\n\nThere are also three different game modes, so once you bumble your way through the story mode you can come back again and rage as you attempt to complete the entire game with only three lives. Finally in time attack mode, you can attempt to complete the entire game as quickly as possible and try to dominate the global scoreboard. Your efforts in game are always rewarded, usually with cosmetic upgrades but I can tell that even dinosaurs like to play dress-up. Currency is found in every level and, as with any good game, will usually lead you where you need to go. Level design is varied from arenas to sprawling mazes, and new mechanics (such as breakable blocks) are periodically introduced, which keeps things interesting for the player. As I stated before, the aesthetic is colorful and helps enhance the fun nature of the game. The music is good for the most part, though some tracks do slide into questionable listening material.\n\nThe sound FX get a bit repetitive after an extended period of play, as I’ve found with most speedrunners. The story is also pretty generic and serves basically only to get the game started. Some stages are quite confusing, and you are sure to never get three stars on your first try. That seems to really be about it. There aren’t a lot of negative points to JumpJet Rex, and while it could do with a bit of polish, I think what is offered currently is extremely solid if you’re into fast-paced platforming with a winning aesthetic and a ton of replayability. I’d like to thank TreeFortress Games for providing us with a review copy, and we look forward to seeing more releases of a similar caliber in the very near future.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 10/10\nFun Factor- 7/10\nDifficulty- 10/10\nReplayability- 8/10\nInnovation- 6/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nMusic- 6/10\nSound FX- 5/10\nStory/Lore- 4/10\nLevel Design- 7/10\n\nFinal Score: 69/100 for controls, difficulty, and level design.\n\nVerdict: If you enjoy shaving seconds off your time, Jumpjet Rex is a speedrunning treat.\nSummary: Speedrunning platformer with tons of customization, and a strict defiance of gravity.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-jumpjet-rex/\nVideo review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nv54dB25sk","May 2, 2015","true","4.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","1"

The controls are sharp, responsive, and leave everything up to the player after a very brief learning curve. The game becomes incredibly satisfying after you gain some mastery over the controls.

The graphics and art are absolutely charming and include just the right amount of retro, with some fantastic and appropriate music to match.\n\nIf you're a casual player, there's some satisfying exploration and a lot of satisfying customization, and the difficulty will not overwhelm you.\nIf you're a hardcore player, there are leaderboards and challenging secrets to collect.

Rex is a dinosaur trying to stop the evil from being so evil, a very straight forward and enjoyable theme much like the classics of Mario Megaman Donkey Kong and recent ones like Shovel Knight.\nBut this actually has very unique gameplay mechanics. You mostly move around by dashing, dropping height, and jet boosting across traps, bad guys and spikes.\nSomething you don't see at first too is that this game has the level of detail that makes it so unique and awesome to come back to. Like finding secret stages, secret exits, hidden coins, collectible items that come back to your Space HQ and decorate it, all with adorable and awesome design and art tune.\n\nThis game right now is still in development, and even chatting with the players to find possible new awesome content. Right now it has quite a lot of content tho. A shop with very iconic references for unique outfits like Megaman's helmet, Castle Crashers, Sub Zero's Mask. And the shop randomizes which items you have available so it's a fun thing to check .\n\nEach stage is quite unique and the soundtrack follows the exploration-adventure theme fantastically.\n\nEven has some Speed Running mechanics and a game mode in the future, as well a Rage Quit game mode that I would not try since I would not have a death wish but awesomely referencing Michael from RT "I believe".","February 6, 2015","true","30.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

JumpJet Rex is a retro action platformer where you play as the first dinosaur astronaut. Rex's casual space exploration becomes a call from his species to save them from an asteroid bearing down upon the planet. Will Rex be able to save the dinosaurs? Or will they go extinct? The answer depends on whether you can guide him and his jet boots skillfully enough to survive.\n\nFull Review Here: https://www.flayrah.com/6066/review-jumpjet-rex-pc","April 30, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zarfy/recommended/329460/","zarfy","Dinasaur King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zarfy/","337 products in account","This is a sort-of platformer where you play a dino floating around with rocket boots in space, with an ultimate goal of destroying the asteroid currently heading for Earth. There are about 40 regular levels and a few boss levels, with each regular level involving touching or shooting all the rings before you can proceed to the exit. Stars you collect unlock more levels, and you gain a star per level completed, as well as up to two additional stars for completing a level with no deaths and within a strict time limit. Besides stars there are a bunch more collectables, so there's plenty to do, and my first run through a seemingly short game took me about 6 hours. Collectables include getting 100% of the coins on a level, finding things to spruce up your dinonaut base, and unlocking pieces to customize your Rex with.\n\nAfter you're done with Adventure mode, there's Speedrun mode (for, well, speedrunning) and RageQuit Rex mode (complete the game with three lives, lose them all and it's all over.)\n\nOverall it's a very fun game. Movement feels nice and fluid. The soundtrack is really great, the background music gets stuck in your head and the sound effects feel good. Some of the artwork is really nice, particularly the boss designs and ending screens... but sadly the in-level graphics are a bit on the bland side. The level design is a little repetitive too, which you notice on your fourth time navigating a twisty spike-filled corridor. Somehow, though. the game still pulls through and manages to be really fun. I'd like to see online co-op and a level editor added in the future.\n\nI give it 7.5/10, WAY better than Radical Rex.","July 15, 2015","true","25.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Rex is a dinosaur trying to stop the evil from being so evil, a very straight forward and enjoyable theme much like the classics of Mario Megaman Donkey Kong and recent ones like Shovel Knight.\nBut this actually has very unique gameplay mechanics. You mostly move around by dashing, dropping height, and jet boosting across traps, bad guys and spikes.\nSomething you don't see at first too is that this game has the level of detail that makes it so unique and awesome to come back to. Like finding secret stages, secret exits, hidden coins, collectible items that come back to your Space HQ and decorate it, all with adorable and awesome design and art tune.\n\nThis game right now is still in development, and even chatting with the players to find possible new awesome content. Right now it has quite a lot of content tho. A shop with very iconic references for unique outfits like Megaman's helmet, Castle Crashers, Sub Zero's Mask. And the shop randomizes which items you have available so it's a fun thing to check .\n\nEach stage is quite unique and the soundtrack follows the exploration-adventure theme fantastically.\n\nEven has some Speed Running mechanics and a game mode in the future, as well a Rage Quit game mode that I would not try since I would not have a death wish but awesomely referencing Michael from RT "I believe".","February 6, 2015","true","30.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

If you really need a comparison with other title, it would be a merge between Super Meat Boy and Fenix Rage. It's medium-paced, which makes it moderately "hardcore". By moderately hardcore I mean the kind of hardcore everyone can play, even casual players ;) So even if you're a casual player, don't be afraid by the trailer or the images !\n\nIn term of gameplay, you have infinite jumps and dash to the sides, with various hazards to avoid. Each levels contains 3 stars to get, the first one is obtained by finishing the level, the second one by beating a time limit, and the third one by not dying more than a set number of times (for the first levels it's zero of course).\n\nLast but not least, the game has a heavy customization aspect. If like me, you like a good game in which you can over-customize your character in quadrillion of possible ways then this game is definitely for you. Each customizable piece of the rex has many parts available. The pieces are head/skin color/jetboots trail color/boots color. That really makes for a big variety.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\nCouldn't recommend it more. I hesitated for a long time, and I was awfully wrong ! Grab that credit card of yours and add this game to your cart right now (you even get a free extra copy to give to a friend if you buy it during Early Access).","February 3, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I never thought a game about a T-Rex in space with rockets strapped to his feet would be so addicting (mainly because I never thought about a T-Rex in space with rockets strapped to his feet). But it's quite a nice game. The controls are very tight, though the movement is by design not "stop on a dime" due to you know... flying. And rocket engine propelling. You need to know you're gonna stop and kind of plan your routes about 1/2 second in advance, and BOY is it addicting.\n\nThis game will be speedrunners' dreams I think. No glitches, just pure timing and trying again and again XD.\n\nOh, and it can get quite difficult too. Some levels had me cursing like crazy, but you don't want to stop. It's like a light, colourful, 2D Dark Souls Sen's Fortress where you die in 1 touch from anything and you can't attack but there are no enemies. Yes. That's basically it. At times difficult as hell, but so satisfying when you DO IT.\n\nDo I recommend it? I sure do. Especially for the price. It's only going to get better from here on out. And oh boy... THE MUSIC.

The first boss was fairly straightforward once I realized I could shoot lasers from my boots, but still quite a challenge to beat without dying.\n\nWhich brings up the most interesting aspect of this game: The DIY difficulty. Any level can be completed by simply hammering through it and dying endlessly (all items collected are saved), but you'll only get one star. The other two are for not dying, or doing it under a certain time. I really liked this because it gave me a reason for going back, but also didn't halt my progress when I encountered a particularly difficult (for me) level. It's also much better than the seemingly arbitrary stars given out in Angry Birds.\n\nAs far as the mechanics go, I can safely say this game plays great with a keyboard and mouse. The controls are tight, and when I die it was annoyance with myself for rushing and not being careful, never with the game itself for being unfair.\n\nDefinitely recommend to regular and casual players alike, but if Super Meatboy is more your thing, this game (thankfully imo) is not that level of difficulty.\n\nIf you'd like to see a video of me playing the first few levels and first boss, I've included it below. Fair Warning though: this video was done as a "Let's Play" mostly for my friends at work, so it contains commentary and all together too much swearing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-AWPNNpTHg","January 16, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There is no difficulty option; you're set on course with all the necessary tools at your discression to simply have fun with the game, or make it a competitive speed runner to climb the leaderboards against your friends.\n\nEach level has a prime directive which is to get to the goal at no matter the cost, however you're awarded extra stars for completing a level with out dying, or reaching the goal in record time; however, like any good retro-inspired platformer, you're rewarded in your efforts for exploring and collecting coins. Scattered throught out most, if not all levels, there's secret warpzones and costumes for you to collect and buy to decorate Rex in your own fashion.\n\nThe art is top notch, and each level is a vibrant landscape that you'll probably come back to multiple times again to beat your fastest time, and earn coins, and the music is excellent that - you'll probably get a few tunes stuck in your head in the same fashion Strike the Earth from Shovel Knight has become an instant classic much like the classic theme from Mario Brothers and other games.\n\nJumpJet Rex is a solid platformer that everyone should try regardless of the title of "early access" being plastered on it's store page. Support TreeFortress and their games, I'm thoroughly excited for what more this game will offer.","January 16, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

With intense platforming action, JJR keeps the palms sweaty every moment you play. You think having a bird flap between pipes was difficult? Try having a T-Rex with jump boots maneuver through a cavalcade of horrors that only get worse the more levels you play! Not only that, but once you think you're done with a level, you get a ranking system that tells you how inadequate you are as a person because you only just scraped by! So then you need to replay that level and do it better because you are adequate! And that's how you get hooked. Or at least that is what happened to me...\n\nShort review: JJR is an awesome, challenging game full of jumping, dashing and butt dropping!

When it was fully released, it went on sale, so I decided to pick it up. I was skeptical at first, but I didn't regret it at all.\n\nThe thing you'll be doing in the game is just getting to the exit of levels. To do so, you can jump an infinite amount of times with your jet boots, dash left or right, hold a button to fall faster, or hold a button to fly upwards faster than you could jump, although this is difficult to control. Projectiles shoot out of your jet boots each time you jump or dash. If you jump, they shoot downwards, and if you dash, they shoot out in the opposite direction you dashed. These can be used to attack enemies and bosses, which makes boss fights unique and interesting. Although, there are only four boss fights. There are 37 regular levels, not including the final level. To unlock the door that leads to the level exit, you need to go through rings scattered about the level. Sometimes this just means finding them once and moving on to the next one, other times it means all the rings are on the same screen and you need to go through the same ring up to three or four times; there's an amount of time that must pass before you can activate the ring again. The level design is overall pretty creative, and many levels have their own little quirks.\n\nIt isn't as simple as getting to the end of the level, however. Three stars are available to be earned, depending on how well you do in each level. You can earn a star simply by completing the level, another by completing it without dying, and another by completing it in a certain amount of time. Completing a level in the target time is usually the hardest thing to do. Other levels are unlocked by stars. You can't simply just complete levels or you wouldn't earn enough stars. However, unlocking other levels is fairly easy. You can earn a total of 123 stars (of which I have earned 109). If I didn't want to, I wouldn't even have to complete the last levels of the game, since I had already unlocked the final level. The amount stars required for unlocking levels is very low, so don't worry about having to unlock every single star; some of them are very difficult.\n\nScattered throughout some levels are hidden collectables. Each time you find one, it is shipped to Rex's space base. It's neat to see the walls become decorated with various different things, although they serve no function. Also scattered throughout levels are coins and giant rubies worth 1000 coins. Coins can be spent at shops to customize Rex's appearance. You can customize the color of Rex's boots, the color of fire or whatever it is that comes out of his boots, his body color, and even his head; there are heads that make him look like Rambo, a ninja turtle, and even Megaman (this is the one I use).\n\nSo now for the little things. The music is... lackluster. There are probably around 10 tracks, and none of them are memorable. They're simply mediocre at best, and if a glitch occurred that would have muted the music, I probably wouldn't have minded. Graphics are decent. I'm disappointed that yet another developer chose to go with the pixel-art route, however. I'd like to see more... wholesome graphics. Controller support is good; if you use a controller with Xinput, button prompts change. I have 9 hours in the game and I have 109 of 123 stars. I'm not going to try to get the others, as the're simply too hard. For what you pay for this game, that's a pretty decent value for your money.\n\nThere's not much else to say, really. It's a simple game that does what it does well. I highly reccomend it.","May 5, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Easy to play if you aren't worried about high score and has some interesting challenges if you want full stars on all levels. If you like super meat boy or similar games, this one will keep you entertained for a good few hours. Recommended to play with a controller though.","April 16","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a good "pick it up and play it for a few minutes" type of game. I don't see myself spending countless hours on it, but it's a fun distraction when I just want play something for a moment.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6GsxCtF5VBc","May 27","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
