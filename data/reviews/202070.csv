Everyone else will probably find the game too frustrating, even on the lower difficultly levels.\n\nLike the 1980s original, Choplifter HD puts you in control of a helicopter and tasks you with rescuing people and bringing them back to safety. Enemies dot the levels and they'll take shots at you; if your helicopter takes too many hits you'll blow up. Likewise, if you run out of fuel, you'll crash. Choplifter HD becomes a game of risk management; do you have enough fuel to make it to the next person who needs to be rescued, or should you turn back to refuel and repair first? The clock is ticking...\n\nAll of this is fine, and is keeping in the spirit of the original game. Where Choplifter HD veers off-course is in the difficulty: this game is tough as nails. The first two or three levels are easy enough, but the difficulty spikes severely from that point on. Levels are jam-packed with enemies that can take your health down in a flash and many of them re-spawn after a short time, meaning you have to deal with them over and over. Enemies with RPGs and EMP rifles that stand on rooftops are very hard to spot, and later on you'll have to avoid missiles fired from jets as well as incoming mortar fire. There are even tanks and AA cannons that can take you out in a couple of hits. It's almost impossible to avoid taking damage in Choplifter HD, so get used to restarting some levels multiple times before you finally conquer them.\n\nIf the campaign becomes too much to take, Choplifter HD also has a zombie mode: here, you fly back and forth across a besieged city, shooting zombies and rescuing people. It's fun for a while.\n\nOne other thing worth mentioning: the awful voice-acting. Throughout Choplifter HD, you'll be treated to poorly-written and voiced jokes and one-liners from your chopper's crew. None of the jokes are funny, and they're repeated over and over. Some of the dialog is surprisingly tasteless too. Turn your speakers off.\n\nIf you're one of those people who think that modern games have become too "casual", then Choplifter HD is for you.","November 27, 2013","true","7.0"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","0"

It's worth purchasing the Night Avenger dlc helicopter as some missions are quite difficult to get a perfect 5 stars.  The more stars you acquire the better helicopter upgrade you receive, you have to use non dlc helicopters to complete a mission before being able to use any powerful dlc helicopters you may have purchased.\n\nZombie! Zombie! Zombie! dlc level pack is worth buying also but not necessary to complete the game.\n\nYou can easily play this game off onboard Intel HD Graphics 3000 very well, the graphics are superb.\n\nBought in the Christmas 2013 steam sale with 75% off.","January 11, 2014","true","26.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The graphics are great but the learning curve is just too steep. Enough folks complained that the makers "dumbed it down enough that a 12 year old girl" could play it, to quote them. I still can't get past level three, and in frustration, after buying downloaded DLC helicopters to just see and enjoy this game, I threw my hands up in disgust. I bought it, I wanted to experience it, but this is another instance when the creators don't understand their audience. When selecting easy doesn't make a game easy, there is no sense in it. I am not trying to master some great adventure quest, I am trying to blow off some steam and relax. This game is beautiful, and captures the essence of the original very well, but is too hard for all but the serious gamer, and you will wind up frustrated and give up, just as I did.

It reproduces the tone, gameplay, and atmosphere of the original arcade classic in a very meaningful way, without introducing obscure "new" mechanics that detract from the theme or feel of the original. Mind you, the original was controller-breakingly difficult, and Choplifter HD is no different: the gameplay is simple yet exceptionally challenging. Since the graphics are simple and the gameplay is "old fashioned" , I can't recommend this to newer gamers; however if you are a retro junky or a fan of the original, then Choplifter HD is a Must Buy.","July 17, 2012","true","18.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/202070/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Choplifter HD is a spiritual successor of the original Choplift on Apple II. The mechanics are simiar, but updated. The chopper is in 2D space: it can go left, right, up and down. It can turn left, right, or face the player (out), and this is important as enemies do come from 3 directions (left, right, and out). And you can't hit the enemy if you're facing the wrong way. The game is presented in 3D with parallax and real scrolling to give the impression of 3D but the actual movesments are 2D.\n\nDifferent helicopters have different handling, such as firepower, speed, carrying capacity, fuel capacity, and so on. Armed helis have missiles and/or chain gun, and all helis need to rescue people (civilians or soldiers or even the occasional news crew).  As you play you will unlock better helos by achieving "stars" on the missions.\n\nEnemies have AAA gun sites, soldiers with AK, soldiers with RPG, SAM sites, technical (gun trucks), APCs, tanks, enemy heli, enemy jets, and just general terrain obstructions.\n\nYour objective is basically to rescue as many people that needs to be rescued as possible by flying there, kill enemies in your way, land next to the people (not ON them!) so they get on, then fly back to your base, drop them off, and repeat until either time runs out, or you rescued them all and/or other missions. It can get frantic, when you have enemies on all sides, missile lock on you, and so on.\n\nIn many ways this is a twin joystick shooter, as the left stick controls the chopper while the right stick controls the aim (laser sight pointing the chain gun).\n\nFuel is limited, and any use of "turbo" (speed boost) eats up fuel like crazy. And your helo won't fly without fuel. Rockets are limited in qty and reloaded only at base. Chaingun is infinite but there's a heat limit to prevent it from firing too much. Carrying capacity is limited  and the larger choppers don't fly as fast or move as nimbly as the smaller ones. On the other hand, they can often do everything in one trip rather than taking multiple trips.\n\nThere are various "campaigns" containing various missions, and each mission usually has a bonus objective as well as news crew to rescue (2 extra people!)\n\nDLC packs adds extra helos to play with (some are very powerful) and more missions.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun little game, worth successor to the name.","May 2, 2013","true","6.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

That fuel gauge drives me nuts half the time because I hate leaving any enemy placements without blowing them up, but if you try... you are gonna run outta gas. It's a madding balancing act of destroying enough to get to the men you need to rescue and still getting your chopper out in one piece. Half the time you feel like you are juggling too much as you deal with enemies on the ground and foreground while running on fumes and you chopper is taking damage as you wait for men to board.

This update adds some new variety of missions and a boatload of graphical and narratives additions, but the core game is rooted to the concept that made Choplifter an enduring favorite all those years ago... though whether you enjoy this may depend heavily on whether you actually are old enough to have cut your teeth on these types of games.  If you are this is definitely worth $10, and if not it's easily worth $5 to try it for awhile.\n\nMy 2 complaints: Some of the mid to late missions need knife-edged precision to beat which can be frustrating old-school style, and it's made worse by the fact that the DLC choppers (which effectively enable a God-mode ability) can only be used once you beat the mission in standard mode.  Secondly the narrative humor is usually groan-worthy at best and HORRIBLY IRRITATING at worst.","June 26, 2012","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daxx0r/recommended/202070/","daxx0r","daxx0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daxx0r/","154 products in account","Choplifter is a sidescrolling arcade game, in which you pilot a rescue helicopter which must save civillians in warzones while fending off enemy troops. Choplifter was an old favorite of mine when I grew up; I played it often on the Commodore. When I saw the remake, I just had to get it.\n\nThe game both succeeds and fails in a number of ways. It does a good job of replicating the gameplay of the original, and while they've added some more features, including multiple weapons, a speed boost, limited fuel and different chopper types, it's similar enough that the game feels very nostalgic.\n\nThere's also more enemy types, including AA guns and RPGs, and the various stages show off mediocre, but visually pleasing environments from cities to deserts and jungles. Furthermore, there's some mildly humorous comments from your co-pilot and the various people you pick up during the game.\n\nUnfortunately, you have to deal with aiming controls which often don't work properly (you can aim in an arc around your chopper, and if often doesn't recognize your mouse unless you're in a sweet spot), and AI which often spoils your fun. It's not uncommon to fly in to rescue a civilian who then promptly runs in under your chopper and kills himself, or takes forever to figure out how to board the helicopter. These issues aren't severe enough that you'll hate the game, but you will be annoyed by it occasionally.\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIf you're a fan of the original, it's worth taking a look. Even if this is your first encounter with it, it has the appeal of an addicting flash game - kind of entertaining, but very difficult to put down once you start playing. It probably doesn't have too much lasting appeal and it's still kind of broken, but if you wanna kill time, it does the job.\n\n","January 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a pretty good remake despite a few annoyances. While the graphical uplift is nice (there is some pretty cool action going on in the background), the voice acting in this game is awful. That also includes the writing as well. This comes as a HUGE dissappointment considering this is from the same company that made The Bard's Tale. The attempt at humor fails almost completely and also introduces an annoying reporter, "Scoop Sanderson" (LOL SEE WAT THEY DID THUR?). Thankfully you can mute ALL the voices completely.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is still a lot of fun, challenging and addicting, like the 30-year old original. Despite the lack of different choppers and gameplay modes and excruciating voice acting and lame humor , the game is a good buy at any discounted price.\n\nAlso, Duke Nukem has a cameo in this game. And zombies too.\n\n\n7/10\n","July 15, 2012","true","1.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Kill enemy soldiers, rescue hostages, refuel on to the next mission (probably bosses later in the game). If they had steam trading cards id give it a full thumbs up.","December 25, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I installed it, I discovered a really fun, really challenging game! It is a remake of the classic game Choplifter, using the Unreal engine. It has lots of Helecopters to unlock, and is all-around fun and comical. The graphics are actually pretty good, and it has that classic pc game challenge. Great game!","December 2, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The jets will make you stop playing the game because you have a limited reaction time to them. Otherwise this is a fun game that reminds me of some of the older games.\n\nEDIT: one other complaint I have is the Zombie dlc, I cannot tell you how fustrating it is to play through an entire mission only to get to the end of the mission and to have it crash. It doesn't happen all of the time so I was able to get through the campaign but it happened a lot and man was it annoying.","November 12, 2015","true","31.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A bit tricky on some missions but that just keeps you wanting to have another bash.

This game is for you. It is rather short and can be mastered fairly quickly, although the difficulty option can extend that.\n\nThis is very much like the old school Choplifter with a new coat of paint and FX visuals. But this is a great game because of those features. The price is just about right with the extra DLC being a worthwhile investment and help extend play time trying out all the chopper types.\n\nThe sounds are great, with a ton of funny banter between the pilots. The zombie missions are actually fun and you will find yourself backtracking so watch out for spawning enemies. Overall I really loved this game. I've enjoyed all of the STRIKE series (Sega genesis, Sega Saturn, PS1) and this makes a welcome addition if you enjopyed playing those games or older variations of Choplifter. This is a sound gaming investment for me as even 4 years later I still find time to fire it up occasionally to play.","March 19","true","65.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As good as this is with modern graphics and sound, nothing beats the original on a green/black screen with blips for sound... Thats just mho. Can't recreate a classic but this is a fun game lacking the original charm.","August 6, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
