There are three environments to  race through;  desert, ice and water.   As with  the other ford games, there's little to like about this game, with handling little improved and  although    the graphics are an improvement on  the 2004 and 2006 releases  (Ford Racing 3 and Ford Street Racing respectively), they are still sub standard to many other racing games released back in 2008 (for example Need for Speed Undercover, which looks amazing and plays brilliantly  even today) that said,  the recently released  Colin  McRae Rally    was released before any of these ford  games and is far superior to all three games and is only a pound  more expensive.\n\nMy advice, either leave it alone, or, if you are determined to buy it, wait till the sales.  with 50% off,  it'll be less than a cup of coffee.  :)\n","September 9, 2014","false","2.1"," 66 of 88 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","66","88","2","5"

Graphics are bad, sound effects are bad (it might be a good idea to turn up the music), car physics are a joke (though it does do simple damage), still the game is fun, and apparently it supports 2 player splitscreen operation.\n\nYou need to find the PCConfig/Sysconfig application in the "local files" to change the graphics settings; be sure to choose a 3:4 resolution or the image will appear distorted.\n\nGet this dirt cheap for a laugh, and you won't be disappointed.","November 18, 2014","true","1.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","15","18","3","2"

The game is obviously old so there will be no suprise that the textures look somewhat simular to that of GUN for the gamecube. I (like most people I have seen) haven't played too much of this yet, however, I am eager to try out that split screen local multiplayer. So few decent games on the pc have local multiplayer... shame.","November 19, 2014","true","0.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I loved these types of games on my Playstation, not only were they addicting but they were exciting and fun, This game was released 6 years ago so don't expect a triple A title, but a simle arcadey style racing game. Very fun. Great time-waster. And a great racing game.\n\n7/10\n\nSeven out of ten because you couldn't really play this game for hours on end without feeling like it's getting repetitive. Because it really is the same thing over and over again, there isn't much tracks, and there isn't much cars, or gamemodes. But a great game and I would recomend it to a friend.","December 16, 2014","true","1.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","2"

But, to be honest, this game shows no improvement but a really big downgrade.\n\nPROS:\n1. Variety Of Trucks And SUVS- This game has a lot of todays Ford off road trucks and SUV and even has a few selection of Range Rovers.\n2. Tracks- A lot of tracks to choose from, but not at the start.\n3.Career Mode- This mode is about doing events and unlocking tracks, vehicles, and game modes.\n\nCONS:\n1.Graphics- The graphics compare to the other ford games is awful looking.\n2. Barely any settings-  Audio settings and thats it\n3.AI is faster than you- I find the AI to be easy sometimes, (Ford Escape is the literally the most OP car in the game) But they will bump you constantly and literally make the damage mode impossible to win.\n\nI dont recommend this game, but I do recommend to give it a go. If its on sale for a dollar.","December 20, 2014","true","2.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I will say that map design for the most part was decent but that is kinda pointless if you basicly racing your own best score .\n\nHonestly it may be the most boring car game I ever played . I got it on sale and don't even think about buying it full price its not worth it .\n\nNote: If you want to change resolution you need to go to local content and find game Config .","October 21, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What so ever. Again, its a port from the Ps2 but would still expect the ability to change resolution.\n\nThe game does not give any intro of controlls or how the game works.\n\nThe graphics are fine for a game made in 2008, and the game mechanic and feel of the driving is relative smooth.\n\nThe carrer mode allows for a ton of races and since all seems to take around 2-10min to complete, you schould have hours of entertainment ahead of you, if this is the type of car game you want.\n\nWhen it comes to cars, its obv only Ford cars (Duh)\nThe game dont allow custom cars or upgradeable cars, you can only buy cars thats listed with speed, ac and handling with the money you get from winning.\n\nWho would I recomend this game for?\nFord lovers I guess, and people who like older car games. Dont expect action though. One hand controlling makes it really boring after a while.","June 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I didn't think that possible. You still can't change graphics, but at least they also removed the option to change the keymapping, and changing from mph to kph in the menu didn't affect the game - nor did turning off the music for that matter.","November 23, 2014","false","0.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","7","12","3","5"

And the game will look descent then and what's nice it runs smoothly on quite an aged machines. Has good variety of vehicles, so collecting them is a sort of separate pleasure to have.
