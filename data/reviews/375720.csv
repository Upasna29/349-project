While the premise is cute and inviting, the level design just kills this game for me.  Its clunky, confusing, and doesn't make a lick of sense.  It makes this game borderline unplayable.","June 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The intro, cutscenes, and dialogue make it look like the game was designed with young children in mind (which is strange that the first level refers to enemies as "badasses"); personally I found it insufferable, but thankfully it can be skipped.\n\nThe controls are clunky, the levels are bland/irritating due to control issues, the invincible enemies are slow-moving and only add to frustration as you wait for them to move to the right spot, and sometimes the level exits don't register. The Zooks don't have an immediate reaction upon reaching/collecting them (they star following, then float in random locations as if they're waiting to be jumped on again).\n\nThe general lack of clarity in how objects interact with each other makes the clunky platforming an even greater headache, and the bugged exits just make it even worse.","December 16, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
