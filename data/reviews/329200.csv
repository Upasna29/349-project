With Astray, it's simply the setting. That's it. But it's the way the game presents itself that's interesting and is very much worth taking a look at.\n\nAstray is a first person horror game with some light puzzles strewn about. Set in a museum for the supernatural, the game sets you off on a quest to find your missing uncle, who is the owner of the museum. The museum lobby is setup like a hub area, with a few doors leading to the different exhibits. There are 3 exhibits: Egypt, Atlantis, and Demonology. Demonology seems a little out of place compared to the other two, but it works. Each exhibit is modelled after what it's based on. Walking through the Egypt door, you are immediately thrust into what looks like an egyptian tomb. The walls are covered in hieroglyphics, scarabs, and the occasional torch. There's even a giant sphinx in one of the rooms, as well as a pyramid! The attention to detail here is top-notch.\n\nEach exhibit has it's own puzzles to solve, and while they can be very easy, some players may have a little trouble with some of them. I had a bit of trouble with a puzzle in the Atlantis exhibit, for example. The end goal of each exhibit is to make it to the end and obtain the Exhibit Key. Back in the lobby at the far end is a giant door with 3 locks. Each Exhibit Key you obtain opens one of the locks, and behind the door is, well...I'll let you figure that out yoursef :)\n\nThe game plays out similar to other games in the genre. You move with WASD, jump with the Spacebar, Crouch by holding L-Ctrl, etc. You even get a handy flashlight for the really dark areas. In the bottom left of the screen a battery gauge for your flashlight is displayed. Every so often in a few areas you can find a battery laying around to refill your flashlight's battery gauge. This is kind of pointless though, as the gauge recharges on it's own slowly over time. There was a certain point in the Demonology exhibit where my full battery gauge instantly went to empty. Probably a glitch, and it wasn't gamebreaking, but it was very noticeable at the point in which it happened.\n\nMy only issue with this game is it's length. It's very short. If you find the puzzles to be fairly easy, you can finish this game in a matter of a couple of hours, maybe less. It can easily be expanded upon though, by adding more exhibits from different cultures and backgrounds, like the Mayans or the Greeks....just to name a couple. Simply add a hallway or two with more doors leading to the additional exhibits, perhaps even changing the big locked door to be sort of checkpoint, where unlocking it reveals more exhibits to be explored.\n\nAll-in-all, I highly recommend this game, especially for the price. It offers a really unique experience and has a different take on the horror genre. It may not be the longest game, but for it's price and content it's more than worth it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=389970846\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 9, 2015","true","8.8"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","44","54","2","0"

There is obvious love for games like Amnesia all over this, so if you like games like that, than this would be a good pick. The game looks decent, with an original locale. Asylums, prisons, and crumbling castles have had their go...now for a museum! The puzzles are not that difficult which for this game I think is a good thing. While the monsters are something slightly borrowed from Amnesia, the game overall fills you with a kind of dread, and I like that. There's the occasional monster, but the whole game is filled with tension, wondering whats going to be in the next room. The story is told through.....you guessed it!....notes scattered around the museum and other areas. There are a few original ideas, but the ones that are borrowed from other games and lore are also good. This is a fun game with a lot of effort put into it, and I'm glad I played it.","November 6, 2015","true","10.1"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","26","30","2","1"

Setting it in a museum is a good start, and some of the areas have a very believable, real look to them. I'm always a fan of setting-based horror games and this one uses that well. It has some effective creepy atmosphere and sound, and some of the puzzles were fun to solve, if a little easy. And I don't say that to boast. I'm a terrible puzzle-solver in games who frequently needs a guide, but this one didn't stump me at all.\n\nBut, sadly, the shortcomings just kept it from working for me. The one monster, while creepy, was dumb and non-threatening, easy to escape or just glitch out entirely. An obvious setup for a chase scene had me just walking right in front of it with no reaction, as the detection radius seems to actually be very small. The moments where I was tense that I had almost been seen, I probably wasn't close at all. That along with some irritating physics puzzles that can glitch out and send boxes flying across the room, and a player character with a painfully small jump ended up eating up all the goodwill inspired by the positive aspects of the design. I don't like voting down games that I thought were original and creative, but the execution lacked too much for me to recommend this one. It might work for you if you're willing to overlook its flaws, but it didn't do it for me despite my love of all things horror.","October 3, 2015","false","4.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

So is it any good ? Short answer is "Yes it is".\nLet's get into the "why?"\n\n-Very good atmospheric sound, highlighting unusual events such as a door slamming with good directional placement.\n-The graphics are done well for a game of this price, never being to dodgy to break the feeling.\n-The UI is minimalist which in my opinion is ideal because it helps you get fully immersed into the actual game.\n-The plot is moved along by notes which you can find scattered across all of the exhibits, it pays to read these so you get the overall picture of what is going on in the scary old museum.\n-The puzzles are pretty straight forward from what i played never being to complicated and frustrating the player, the point of such a game is not to put your brain on overdrive with solving puzzles but to give you a rush of adrenaline.\n\nThe wrap this up i would like to point out that i do not play allot of horror games because well... I'm a bit sensitive to them :) so keep that in mind. I do not think that a hard-core player of horror games will be to scared but for a occasional player such as myself the game delivers the punch it sets out to.\nYou can not really ask more then the game provides at this price point, its a solid recommendation from me.\nIf you would like to get a better view on the game you can check out my first impressions video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47dM46dng-8&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK","February 3, 2015","true","1.1"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","24","32","5","0"

I'm not much of a "hardcore" puzzle solver, but the difficulty of this one is perfect for beginners.\n\nStory: You try to find out what happened to your uncle, who opened up a museum, and the backstory is revealed by notes scattered around in the museum. It's a combination of detective work and horror.\n\nGraphics: There's a lot I can describe about the graphics, as they captured the feel of a museum and theme. It's a combination of mystery and horror.\n-Inside the museum:- I love the theme of the museum they were going for. It gave more of a mystery atmosphere. However, other than the rooms and anubis statue, it could have had more going for it. It feels like it's just mostly offices and hallways.\n-Demonology room:- The demonology room was slightly bland, but I have to give props on the rune designs as they were gorgeous. Those gave more of a "mage" atmosphere than demonology. The walls and floors were mostly stone and bones, which was good, but there is more to demonology than just that.\n-Atlantis room:- Oh my god this room design was to die for! It felt like you were in an underwater temple! I loved the wall and floor designs on this. I wish there was more on this. I would enjoy just walking around and exploring more in this atmosphere!\n-Egypt room:- It seems like the same materials use from the demonology room. I do like the heiroglyphics, scarabs, and vases, but I feel there could be more. When I think of Egypt, usually sand comes to mind. I know they were going for a "scary" egyptian feel, but there are other ways to do that.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay has a sort of "Amnesia: Dark Descent" feel, but it's only because there are things to avoid and not to shine the light on. Don't worry, it's not as scary as that game. I promise. The game does have an item system, but it's just picking up items and placing them. There is no inventory. The only thing you should be concerned about is your flashlight in order just to see dark areas. It's more straightforward in most cases, which I have to say I like. I hate it when there are too many items in games and you either have to use them for weird reasons or do weird combinations.\n\nControls: The game is very, very vague on controls and customization. First off to point out, each time you start the game, the gamma option comes up and you have to adjust it, which is annoying. Second, not much of audio options, but I have to say if you have headphones, it will work automatically. For gameplay, while the game tells you about the flashlight and running, it does not tell you that you can throw items by right clicking(left clicking if you're left handed), which is very important to the dynamite part.\n\nOverall: Overall, Astray is a small game that deserves recongnition, and a good first game for puzzle/mystery beginners. It has a pretty good blend of mystery and horror. I find it's hard to find games that balance mystery and horror well, and this one nailed it. The story and puzzles kept me engaged and made me want to play the game until the end.And this game is worth the play in both story, graphics, and atmosphere.","February 26","true","8.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

It has good visuals and an eerie atmosphere, supported greatly by its soundtrack. Some reviewers mention that the visuals are dated... well, they're OK in my book.\n\nI got this game in a bundle, so I didn't pay full price.\n\nThis started off quite good. I'm a big fan of survival horror, and I have no trouble sneaking my way through corridors. But the "puzzle" in the Demonology maze was outright evil. The protagonist is supposed to find their way through a dark maze, avoiding a deadly creature that cannot be defeated, and when you make the mistake of pointing the flashlight at it - you've had it. Pining for the fjords.\n\nAfter several tries, I lost interest and watched a Youtube walkthrough. The puzzles up until that point were OK, and some nice ones should follow - ok, it's a bit short.\n\nI can forgive the grammatical flaws ("it's" instead of "its", and a few other typos) as well as the strange physics engine (wooden crates seem to be as light as cardboard boxes), but that creature puts the whole thing out of balance.\n\nIf you like Myst-type puzzles, this could be for you - if you like short games.\nHowever, you can NOT take your time figuring out the solution.\n\nUp to the first encounter with the monster, I enjoyed the game. As a whole, I regret to say I cannot recommend it at this point - most definitely not for 7 bucks.","May 26, 2015","false","1.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Well throw those worries away, because Astray is one of the best small-time Indie Horror games to come out on steam in awhile. It's well polished, with an interesting story, great atmosphere, unique enviroments,  decent puzzles, and a run-time of about 2-3 hours which makes it worthy of its asking price. Let me get into what i think are the pros and Cons of the game.\n\nThe Pros:\n\nPresentation: Despite this not being a triple A horror game, it still feels very polished and well done. I encountered no bugs or glitches the entire game. The graphics were really good.  the lighting is good, the ambient noises were effective with headphones,\n\nStory: An interesting story that progresses along well and takes a turn into Lovecraftian territory towards the second half. The notes you find pretty much tell the story, along with providing clues to solving environmental puzzles. Its to see the notes in a game to actually be useful for a change. The puzzles aren't to difficult, nor are they to easy, they seemed to be the right difficulty for this game.\n\nThe Setting: This takes place in a giant museum around 1909. You stroll along in different exhibit areas, where each one was totally different from the other, offering a good change of scenery. If this museum was real I would certain go check it out in person. (((MINOR SPOINLER --->> i don't want to spoil anything but later you go to explore other areas that lead you into depths that are pretty lovecraft-nightmare-like which were pretty freaky and cool.\n\nThe Cons:\n\n- The monsters you encounter are pretty average, and once one gets up close and kills you, the fear factor drops significantly.\n\n- There were some instances were sound was missing from certain enviromental interactions. I would move a box , or open a vent grate to no sound, it was kinda awkward.\n\nIn Conclusion, I def. recommend Astray. Its a well done first person horror game with light puzzles and a solid atmosphere, and for its asking price you cant go wrong. Oh, and for having been developed by only two people(as the end credits do suggest), i was thoroughly impressed, and can't wait to see what these guys do next.","February 23, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The easiest way to defeat the monsters, which by the way resembles the High Priest Imhotep (The Mummy), is to use only Method 1, which is to stay hidden somewhere and let the creatures pass you by, before going to the next room.\nDon't you dare confront this creatures because you cannot defeat them.  I found a crowbar in the game, which I thought was a weapon, but it is useless against them.  Don't focus your flashlight on them, once they spot you, you're Dead.  If they hear you and try to get close to them, you're Dead.  The best way to deal with them is to use Method 1.\nThe most exciting and the scariest part of the game is when you and the monster are inside the same dark room and the flashlight's batteries  run low.   Suddenly,  you hear its footsteps and the creepy sound it makes.  You know it is getting closer and closer.  There is no chance to escape because you can't see anything.  That was freaking scary.\nYour final opponent or the Big Boss, or shall I say, the Big Ball (literally it is a Giant Eyeball) can be defeated by using Method 1.\nThe game has potential, I give the developers that.  The setting is very eerie, which I thought at first was a mental institution, but it's not. The "No weapons only your wits" concept to defeat the monsters is a good idea in a survival horror game such as this.  I admit, it had its scary moments but it did not really give me a real satisfaction.  I bought it really cheap, so no real harm done in my wallet.  If you want cheap thrills, go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, just avoid it.","April 15, 2015","false","3.1"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","23","39","2","3"

The horror element is primarily the atmosphere, which I like, but the occasional sounds such as banging can be heard. When you first encounter an enemy, the game tells you not to shine your flashlight at enemies. Maybe because they want the next part to be in the dark, but I didn't shine it, I wasn't sure if I didn't want it to find me, or if I didnt want to find out what it was. The puzzles are also fun to figure out, altough one was your common pipe-rotating puzzle, and another one of the ones where you pointlessly press buttons until you get the get it right, the rest are very creative and fun.

There is technically only one enemy in the game, a slow-♥♥♥ skinny-♥♥♥ walking corpse that treads at less than 1mph until you startle it. Then it runs at you faster than the Usain Bolt.

Its story is full of holes, contradictions, and dropped threads. The level design is chaotic and lacks any sense of scale. Other than the odd hidden pressure plate (no spoilers) the puzzles are dull and uninspired and, except for the last one, serve only as a means to move from one level to the next and have nothing to do with the story.  The opening puzzle, which contains a multi-part solution, is the most thought out in the game, though it fostered the expectation that the puzzles would be challenging (they weren’t) and varying (they’re all basically variations on the same thing, other than the final one). The influence of games like Amnesia: The Dark Descent (mood and wandering monsters, not to mention the magic book puzzle), and especially the pseudo-parkour of Half Life II (all that box stacking). The final puzzle reminds me a lot of Metro Last Light (only without the excitement) and Oblivion realms from the Elder Scrolls games. There’s nothing especially original here, and much that is frankly and obviously derivative.\n\nThe world lacks any kind of human touch. The resources used (lamps, desks, bookcases, etc) are scattered about very sparsely. The result is barren, lifeless, echoing places that you run through looking for the next puzzle piece. You can't hide the lack of detail with fog all of the time! There are bad textures as well as missing textures. It is not conceivable that a mansion in 1909 would have modern galvanized steel air conditioning ductwork that looks like something out of, once again, Half Life II or any of a number of Deus Ex games. Don’t get me started on the water puzzles or the doors that mysteriously open (or close) triggered by things you do elsewhere. And hey, what about all those large crates in small rooms that could not possibly have gone through the doors--any of them?\n\nOn the brighter side, the music seemed appropriately chosen for mood-setting and atmosphere, though the atmosphere loops were highly repetitive.\n\nThat brings me to the ending, which consists of a final puzzle and a series of cutscenes. Here I threw up my hands. It was like cutting the Gordian knot. Important questions were tossed aside, quest objects were ignored, well trodden game mechanisms went out the window, entirely new and unexplained symbols appeared, and then suddenly it was over. I think I even saw a screenshot from Amnesia, but I can’t be sure. What a mess. Think of the worst head scratcher you’ve ever seen. This is much worse. Adding cowbell wouldn’t make it worse.\n\nFinally, the title. Really? I don’t mind so much that ignorant people have pointed out that it looks like “ashtray.” That’s the level of fan we’re dealing with, and that’s okay. I also don’t mind the people who have posted videos in which they prove that they don’t know what the word means by pronouncing it incorrectly--we live in a world in which ignorance is celebrated and correcting people is considered a microaggression--but what I do mind is that there is no discernible connection between the adverb “astray” (as in “Mary’s little lambs have wandered astray and she can’t find them”) and anything in the game whatsoever, on any level. Other than than the fact that I was let astray into buying this mess because it was inexpensive.\n\nMy recommendation is that you resist the temptation to be led astray into this game. It's just not worth the time.","November 8, 2015","false","5.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

The only other thing I consider to be a problem is that the early game puzzles and atmospere, are great, so much so that from the basement to the end game the puzzles feel very week if you could call them puzzles at all. The door to the last area you literaly open by stepping on 2 pressure pads, which at that point is just busy work rather than a puzzle, however the early game was so good I would have no problem reccomending this one.

Will probably finished it at a later date, I feel like I'm almost at the end, but here's my thoughts on it so far.\n\nLike I said, it looks really pretty, shiny and illuminating, and the atmosphere feels good time, silent and creepy, with most of the structures in the game feeling majestic and kind of awesome.\n\nThe puzzles are nice, with some of them physics based, and most of them aren't hard to finish, it's somewhat pretty much in your face, but your mind bends to make you think it's hard, but they are decent, not overly complicated, and overall nice.\n\nThe scary part of the game, is it's somewhat tense atmosphere, and the structure of the game that makes it scary, with a creature following you in a level from time to time, that actually doesn't jump at you, the game doesn't have ridiculous jump-scares, so that's good, and instead just leaves you with the game itself and the monster that's in certain sections of the game, which will surprise/scare you when you find him, and chases after you when you make the wrong move, which is being visible to him with the help of the lights.\n\nThere isn't much bad things to point out, aside from the monster that you have to be careful of, is modeled poorly with what seems like it has a low poly count.\n\nI'm more happy with the game's majestic beautiful looks and structures, and light-tense atmosphere, rather than the horror part of it, and in the end(ish) I had a good time in it playing through it, and for the price the it has, it's a decent purchase to make if it has you interested in it. It's not a bad game, but it's not a great one either. Go into the game thinking that it's a light-horror game, with nothing special going on with it, that has good looks and light-puzzles.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com]","February 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","12","22","3","0"

It was very scary at first, but after encoutering it over and over again, I learned pretty quickly how it behaves and could easily avoid it with zero deaths after a few maps.\n\nThe storyline is yet another "we found a mysterious artifact with evil powers" we all have played a thousand times before, one of them being Amnesia The Dark Descent, but what really ruined it for me was the huge lack of character development. In fact, there aren't any. The main goal is to find my uncle, right? I found one dead body near the end of the game, not knowing if it was him or someone else from the expedition, and the character I played as showed no emotions about it what so ever.\n\nI think this game puts too much faith in us as players, that we will take the role as the main character and react for him.\n\nThe ending was pretty weird and suddenly turned into a black screen with the credits printed on it. I hate when game developers don't put enough time with outros, and this game developer sure didn't.\n\nBut you did a good job with the puzzles and it was very scary for me. At least before I got used to the monster, but as I said earlier, it lacks in everything else. It doesn't offer much new to the table besides the puzzles and a few intresting level design ideas.\n\n--------------------\n\nGlad I bought this game during the summer sale because it took me less than 3 hours to complete it, even though I spent quite some time with some of the puzzles.\n\n4/10 - Okay\n\nNot recommended.","June 16, 2015","false","2.7"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","17","33","0","0"

Little did I know that what lay ahead was far more terrifying that what was outside... The effects and presentation of the opening level had me on the edge of my seat, anticipating what was to come and it surly doesn’t disappoint from there-on-out.\n\nI found the experience to be absolutely fantastic, from the interesting puzzles, to the more terrifying moments. The length may be considered short by some, but I feel due to the fantastic quality it is well justified by the price and doesn’t attempt to elongate the experience for the sake of bulking it out. The narrative itself is well implemented into the gameplay and the great visuals wrap it up nicely to a well-rounded and thoroughly enjoyable experience. While it does have some minor problems in the way of basic AI and a not-so-scary threat once you have seen it once, these are well countered within the gameplay that I honestly felt bad complaining about them, because there’s very little I could find wrong with this absolutely marvellous title!\n\nSummary:\n+ Fantastic visuals and effects for the most-part.\n+ Varied puzzles that are not overused.\n+ Well done horror and atmosphere.\n+ Perfect length that aids the puzzles and horror.\n+ Narrative and gameplay integration is great.\n- Once the “threat” is seen, it is no longer as scary.\n- AI is a little basic.\n\nVideo review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWro6eBsSPw","February 3, 2015","true","2.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"

You can run from the monsters in the game, by simply holding down shift you can escape from them, even when they have direct line of sight on you. Just keep running, and they'll eventually stop.

Of course since Astray starts with a "A", it was at the top of my list. Looking at this game before jumping into it, it reminds me of amnesia and garry's mod horror maps. And with people on the steam page recommending this game, i thought it was going to be good. Especially since its a $7 cheap game. So here i went, into the world of Astray.\n\nThis game is mainly focused around solving puzzles more than a actual horror game and had a few pointless puzzles that were not even needed in the game, causing the player to feel like their time was wasted and not well rewarded. The puzzles here were quite easy to complete but if you want a challenge, then this is like Amnesia's younger brother. Especially since the game feels like it was inspired heavily by Amnesia with similar puzzles. Besides the puzzles, this game is also a scary game with only one monster walking around trying to get you in this museum as you look for your missing uncle. You would think the main goal was to find your uncle since it says so in this games description, however this objective gets dropped by the end of the game which leaves you wondering what happened and why none of the story makes sense. Its not a bad game, but here is how i saw it.\n\nAs you venture on into the museum, you soon realize that the story line doesn't flow well with whats going on and you start to lose interest in what's happening. The story unfolds in notes being left by others where you have to piece together what's happening in order to follow along. But honestly you don't even need to look at the notes because of how dull the writing is and how it doesn't connect the player at all to this mysterious museum. The atmosphere is creepy but not in a good or bad way. The graphics are pretty to look at but nothing truly horrifying and many rooms felt like fillers with lack of details. but if it really wanted to be a horror game, the only jumpscares are just lights flickering, monster moaning like a smoker and your death scene which lasts only a sec or two followed by a falling object here and there. The scare factor was simply not there, or at least it was 30 minutes into the game till you realize the only horrifying thing are puzzles to complete.\n\nI should mention how awful it is to see a "Saving progress" icon at the bottom right of this game. Every time you got to a important area where there was about to be a jumpscare or just to keep the suspense up, your game pauses as its being saved randomly, making it a mood killer for anyone who wanted to feel terrified. Also the bugs in this game are troublesome. Even if i enjoyed spending 3 hours total on this game, the bugs made me restart my game 3x whenever my game glitched my mouse into moving my character on its own or when i glitched into the floor or out of the elevator. I would think by now that the developers would patch this up but it still has issues.\n\nBut do i hate it despite all of its flaws? No. Astray is a game that is easy on the eyes, easy on the wallet but has a few flaws in its design and storyline and overall fear factor. But i did enjoy playing through this game, despite how frustrated some things made me. To me this is a O.K. type of game where if you bought this right now or even on sale, its acceptable to play but don't expect greatness from it.","October 8, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The encounters with dangerous entities is minimal, and also very obvious. If you're looking for something with the same staying power as outlast or amnesia, you will be dissapointed.\n\nHonestly, the most I can say about this game is that it's boring.

After he disappears, you go to the abandoned museum to find some clues of where he might be.\nThe premise is as disposable as most ones are for indie horror game. However, in the second half of the game, the game turns into a lovecraftian horror, and I really appreciated that.\nThe two creators of the game were heavily influenced by Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and there are multiple similarities: most of the story is discovered through letters and diary notes, you can't fight the monsters and you have to complete fairly easy and straight-forward puzzles in order to advance. There are, however, some problems, the biggest one being the absence of a journal: there are a lot of notes scattered around the areas, and you can't keep track of them in any way. Also, unlike Amnesia, you can't pick up and throw most objects, and the physics are kind of wonky and unrealistic.\nThe graphics are really pretty for a game developed by only two people, and each area of the museum has nice details that differentiates one another. However, it does not look like a practical museum in real life, making you question some of the level design.\nBut how is the horror component of the game? Well, it is pretty good. There are no jumpscares and cheap scares, but ambient noises and a tense atmosphere that manages to keep you to the edge of your seat. But, like with most horror games, when you encounter the monster, you feel cheated: the design is pretty bland and not scary, and the music that plays while you are being chased doesn't make you feel as if you were in real danger, also because it is pretty easy to outrun the monsters.\nMy first run with the game was of 80 minutes, without encountering many problems with the puzzles and dying only once.\nOverall, this is a nice entry in the indie horror genre, by going back to the roots of Amnesia, rather than having Slenderman copies. While the museum, puzzles and absence of jumpscares are a breath of fresh air, the rest of the game doesn't bring anything new to the table. I recommend it to hardcore horror fans and newcomers to the genre.\n\nStory: 7.5\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 7.5\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 7\nReplayability: 4\n\nENJOYMENT: 7.5\nFRUSTRATION: 3.5-------------------------------\nLike on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nCheck my official website: {LINK REMOVED}http://nickygra.wix.com/enjoythegaming\nJoin my Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EnjoyTheGaming\n\nEnjoy & Subscribe!!","February 3, 2015","true","1.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"

I'm not really sure on the story, because frankly it wasn't riveting enough for me. Honestly, my character doesn't even have his speech bubbles, or thoughts that spread out on the screen. You get an easy first puzzle, then eventually find yourself going through the main musuem and from there... it's pretty darn straight forward and linear to boot. Oh you have ur choice of rooms, but hey... That's about it. The one thing you encounter (dont want to spoil it...) is pretty easy to avoid after you get over your intial scare? or giggles... which ever and then after that it's really just about finding keys and or what not and getting upset because there is no map feature, and your pretty sure you went this way already. The length was pretty darn short, if your really adapt at puzzles and THESE puzzles weren't big stumpers. I'd call this game more adventure, suspense, then horror really. The graphics were nice and it was smooth gameplay.\nThe Pros: Smooth Gameplay (if you have decent specs on your computer)\nNice graphics to look at. (Explore i guess... For what little there is to explore...)\nThe Cons: The story.

I.e the Atlantis exhibit of the museum.\n\nBut if you are searching for complex levels and somewhat challenging puzzles and actual horror like in Amnesia (a bit unfair maybe to compare to it, but everyone will compare the two) then you have the wrong address.\n\nThe level design is very basic, go through the exhibits in a pretty much straight line leaving very little room to exploration.\nSure there are some rooms in which you can go into but a large amount of them are either empty and useless or have batteries in them which are also useless.\nSometimes though you'll find a note that reveals the story, and besides the opening and ending cutscene that is all the story the game is willing to offer.\n\nGameplay is basically walking around the museum solving puzzles and avoiding the asthmatic monsters that lurk the hallways in a very predictable patterns.\nPuzzles themselves are very easy and considering that it takes place in a museum presumably aimed at kids, I would understand that.\n\nBut unless the game itself isn't advertised to the casual audience then the challenge should have been raised up.\nYou also have a flashlight to light you're surroundings with and batteries in the level to recharge them I suppose.\n\nI never found out how that worked,due to the game not telling me if I had any batteries available or if they when picked up would go straight into the flashlight recharging it instantly.\n\nThe horror element is reduced to a few cheap jump scares and only once the enemies of the game made me feel uneasy and then they just became a laughing stock.\n\nThe music is quite alright, relaxing at times and creepy also, but it's nothing spectacular.\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay you can check out my LP of the game down in the link below and subscribe for more LP's and first impression videos.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/y_YxgBXoPY0","February 3, 2015","false","3.0"," 9 of 32 people (28%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","28","9","32","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RA1ZO/recommended/329200/","RA1ZO","RAIZO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RA1ZO/","133 products in account",""Short but sweet" pretty much sums this game up.  For only $6.99 one wouldn't expect too much from a game and that's certainly what you get with Astray.  It only takes about 2 hrs to beat and it looks nice and plays well, though there is some 'glitching', namely in the form of clipping = a few times while randomly standing in place to read a note, or while simply walking through a room, I suddently dropped through the floor and died.  It's an autosave game and whenever you die you're pretty much right where you last left off, which is nice, so don't worry about the minor clipping issue.\n\nThere is no inventory in Astary and you only need to find little more than a half dozen keys/items to complete it.  Besides the clipping issue, the only other odd problem this game suffers from is a pointless use of batteries for your flashlight -it recharges when not in use and yet the developers thought it necessary to place some stray batteries throughout the game, which really doesn't make sense (were they trying to bank on the success of similar/non-inventory games like Outlast, wherein batteries are paramount to your success in surviving).\n\nAnyhoo, that and the clipping issue are about the only negatives I can come up with for this game.  The music/sound design works well with the pseudo-creepy museum the game largely takes place in and the handful of puzzles can easily be solved within minutes.  It's not exactly scary but it does have a 'Lovecraftian' theme to it, which is always good in my opinion. I would have preferred to pay only $4.99 for this, but still, it's nice to see more budget priced games like this on Steam.  Astray is worth a look if you have the money and a couple hours to kill.","March 20, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a microbudget indie game made by only two people, but unlike many such games on Steam it's actually very solidly made and professionally presented. It definitely comes across as a professionally made game, rather than (unlike many first-person horror games on Steam) a programming student project.\n\nThe game has fully rebindable keys, invert mouse, and decent graphics options, and as far as I've seen the game doesn't have any major bugs or other amateurish weirdness.\n\nIt's a fairly short game (I finished it in a little over 2 hours, and that was on a blind playthrough where I explored around quite a bit and had to take several minutes for some of the puzzles), but there are several different environments/levels and overall the game does feel like a "complete" game.\n\nGraphically, the game isn't triple-A quality but is still reasonably decent. Overall, I'd say the graphics are on par with the average games' graphics from 2010-2012.\n\nThe story is fairly simple and straightforward, on par with a Lovecraft short story. You play as a standard faceless silent protagonist, and there's no real voice acting in the game, with the story being revealed through readable notes scattered throughout the game (the notes are generally in obvious locations and you don't have to explore hidden areas to find them). Overall the game is more about the atmosphere rather than the plot.\n\nGamplay is a mixture of exploration, steath/evasion, and puzzle solving. The puzzles are decent and not too difficult; I never got stuck trying to figure out how to complete a puzzle, although there were a few times I did get stuck trying to progress because of other reasons (finding the switch for the hidden door in the Egyptian area is the example that most comes to mind).\n\nItem-hunting is minimum as the game doesn't really have an inventory or item system. The only items found in the environment are key items, notes that give snippets of the story, and batteries to instantly recharge your flashlight to 100% (the flashlight also slowly recharges when not in use, so you won't get stuck if you can't find a battery).\n\nLike Amnesia, the game has monsters you need to stealth around or run away from. The monsters patrol along a fixed route, have a visual detection range of about 20-30 feet, respond to noise (i.e. running fast) as well as if you shine the flashlight on them. There's only one monster type and graphically they don't look great up close, but are decent and unlike some other games are at least not Playstation 1 quality models. Their A.I. is quite simple, but functional.\n\nThe monsters actually appear fairly sparingly; there are only 9-10 of them in the entire game. They're mostly to create the possibility of a threat instead of serving as a constant, ever-present threat (the monsters are actually fairly scarce, but the fact they could be anywhere are what creates tension as you move through the environments). I actually appreciated this as this allows them to create tension without becoming obnoxious or frustrating.\n\nI did feel that the Museum of the Supernatural setting of the game was under-utilized. For the most part, the museum setting (with creepy exhibits etc) was only really majorly used in the first 1/4th of the game, Later areas (which comprised most of the game) were a more generic backstage office area, a dark basement, and an underground area.\n\n\nThe ending was rather abrupt, but if you read all the notes and take in mind the fact the game takes place just a few years prior to the outbreak of World War I, it may kind of make sense what the developers were trying to imply with the ending.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't say Astray was great, per-se, but it was a good, competently and solidly made, complete experience, especially when you consider the fact it was made by only two people on a minimum budget.  Overall, it's one of the rare first-person microbudget indie games on Steam that is a full legit game that actually does "deserve" to be sold on Steam for money, rather than being a glorified programming student project.","September 21, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't have "jumpscares" really, I'm sure the ONE time I jumped was just me freaking myself out. There is only 1 monster in the game (either that or there's multiple identical monsters) and he's rather slow moving when he doesn't notice you but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SURE CAN RUN when he wants to! One helpful machanic is that the monster breathes heavily, so you can know when he's close or that he's even in the room. However, this mechanic failed to scare the player when you were supposed to turn around a corner and then notice the monster chasing you, resulting in screaming and running down a corridor. But, I heard his breathing, peaked around a corner and noticed him standing right there. So, I just made a run for it, but there was no suprise. One last thing you should note, there isn't an inventory. If you pick up a crowbar, you'll just automatically use it on whatever you need it for once you get to it. Batteries don't go into stock, they just fill up your flashlight battery if you need some. If your torch is full and you pick up a battery then you are just wasting a battery. Lastly, when you pick up a note you can read it but then you put it back down again.\n\nThe game offers a good story and the puzzles range from easy to a real challenge. The story is that you plan to find out what you're uncle is doing at his job at a museum. Then what you find is much deeper...\n\nMind you this is only an indie horror game with two developers and it isn't Amnesia or Outlast (but it does have the Amnesia HAND mechanics!).

The game's strongest points are its atmosphere and setting - using a museum is a great idea that I haven't really seen done in a game like this before, and most of the areas are very pretty and eerie. It's really a fun experience just to go through and see what the developers built, and I wish there was a museum this size and scope in real life.\n\nThe story, however, is about as cookie-cutter-Cthullian as you can find. There's no variation whatsoever on the standard "lost artifact brings chaos" plot, and the character you play as is little more than a camera for you to pilot around - no personality whatsoever. I don't mean his/her personality was written badly, I mean they literally say nothing, think nothing, and have no motive for doing all this except that someone's playing a horror game. The first thing you do is solve a very deadly electrical puzzle, and I can't help but think there is no motivation for anyone to do that so early on, no matter how long the uncle's been missing. There are a few well-written moments that build a bit of suspense and even make you question whether something is real or not, but it passes without much impact. What irks me about it so much is that this game is set in a museum! One "based on unusual cultures, legends, and supernatural themes." There was so much opportunity to build a complex and dreadful mystery between different cultures, historical periods, and mythologies, and all that atmosphere was wasted on fetch quests instead of lore-building. Adding an experienced writer to the team could have done so much for this game.\n\nThe puzzles are very simplistic. I've seen others compare this to Myst, but I wouldn't even call it close. The hardest thing you'll do is an "A = weird symbol" alphabet puzzle. There are enemies of an Amnesia: The Dark Descent variety, but they are quite unthreatening after the first encounter. They won't attack unless you shine a light on them (a creative touch, but it backfired) or are within a foot or two of them. Be aware that this game probably will not give you more than two hours of gameplay at most as a result.\n\nAs a final note, several elements lead me to question if the devleopers have finished their work on it or not. In the beginning, you seem to be being chased, but it's never addressed again. Also, about midway through, a character in a painting vanishes when your back is turned and knockes over a display in the process. Creepy, but nothing happens in relation to it again. Not sure if I missed something or not.\n\nI know I've been hard on this, but in the end, the fact is I did enjoy it, and two hours of extremely well-built environments is not a bad use of $7. I hope the developers revisit this concept with a larger team and more time to invest, because it really could have been so much more. Just be aware that, if you're looking for a really scary experience or challenging puzzles, this game will probably disappoint. But as an intriguing exploration built by only two people, it's a worthy experience.","November 16, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only real bit that scared me was the recurring noise of a light that was, for some unexplainable reason, relatively unsettling to the point where I actually kind of jumped.\n\nThe enemy ai in this game seems dull. Sure they react when you run near them or shine your torch their way, but I was able to escape one by standing on top of a double box combo. It proceeded to run up to me, get stuck on the boxes, get confused, then turned around and walked away.\n\nBut the biggest thing that kept gnawing at me throughout the entire 107 minutes I spent in the game was the lack of anything. It felt like there were sizable chunks of the experience where I waited for something to happen, a startling noise, musical cues, a monster showing up out of nowhere, but no. Nothing.\n\nThere aren't even any musical bits letting you know you solved a puzzle. It's just *press button* "alright moving on".\n\nThe visuals are the thing that stands out the most for this game. Unreal engine was utilised pretty well for this venture.\n\nAll in all, the end sequence is probably the most exciting bit of the game. While there wasn't any music, there was plenty of different sounds and things going on to spice up the solitude.\n\n\nTL DR: Pretty on surface, shallow with the horror.

There's some cool set-pieces, but most of those you'll see in trailer videos on this page.\n\nWith that said though, it's a fun romp if you can purchase it on the cheap and have an hour or so to burn; if you enjoy the random horror titles that can be found all over Steam this one isn't too bad to add to the list. Also if you like things that delve into the Lovecraftian, you'll find a familiar atsmosphere here.

Every area is unique and well done.  The puzzles fit and are in general more challenging at least than find-key-unlock-door without being too frustrating.\n\nWhat also deserves a note was the fact they included a maze and actually made it fun to run through, hurriedly backtracking when you hear the heavy breathing of an enemy round the corner.\nThe enemies (there was only one type, barring the end boss), unfortunately didn't maintain their fear-inducing presence throughout.  Once you were killed by them once and saw them up close they just didn't evoke the same sense of dread.  Especially when later in the game you find them shambling about in a large, open, and brightly lit room.\n\nThere were some little oddities I encountered, like how running will make noise to attract enemies, but throwing chairs round the place is like throwing weighty balloons in terms of the noise they make.  Not to mention the occasional very obtuse puzzle and unnecessary invisible wall.  But these are minor grievances.

The positives are really good though. The game doesn't use music, relying entirely on ambient audio. And it does a good job of it, the sound design is top notch, whatever these two people do next is sure to be another great auditory experience!\n\nThe game is nice to look at to, textures don't look washed out and look like they fit the aesthetic of an early 20th century museum. My only complaint really is the framerate tends to drop when fire affects are visible. But it won't make the game unplayable.\n\nScare factor is certainly up there but nothing spectacular. It's just creepy, tense, mysterious. The monster that comes after you is...lacking, doesn't really make much sound and nothing about it carries the eldritch tones of the game. It's pretty much just a mummy.\n\nStory is good, mostly through notes if that's your thing. Writing is akin to old 1st person HP Lovecraft works. Ending is not that satisfactory as the game kinda tells you whats going to happen when you end it (play it to see what i mean). But overall, not bad.\n\nFor a short little game, it's pretty fun, certainly one of the better atmospheric horror games on steam.","January 23","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For instance the physics system often has abrupt and "violent" behaviour. Towards the end of the game my character also insisted on walking on his own in one particular direction (fix: pause + unpause).\nI think the game needed more polishing, for instance I think there is a distinct lack of environmental soundeffects. I.e. I can throw around rocks, boxes, ventilation grills and I never once heard a sound as a result. That really breaks the immersion.\nAstray is one of those games I think would have been better without an actual monster chasing after you and killing you. Those sections where you were more or less forced to interact with the monster felt not very frightening at first, and after that it just felt like a chore.\nI definitely preferred the first parts of the game, although I didn't care much for the demonology exhibit compared to the Egypt and Atlantis exhibits. I think the game after that needed more puzzles and the puzzles were generally too easy. For instance, I liked the idea of the puzzle in Atlantis where you had to equalize the pressure but I wish it had been made more challenging.","May 24","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was a frustrating game with no redeemable qualities.\nThere are no puzzles. You stack boxes all the time. Sometimes you look for a cog to open a door. You do a basic pipe turning mini game twice and that's as difficult as it gets.\nThere's a part with dynamite that took me 20 minutes and multiple deaths because the rocks, which bounce, kept pushing me through the floor or the dynamite would explode with nothing touching it.\nIt's not scary at all. At one point I was trapped in a room with a 'monster' and it didn't notice me, even though I made noise and the room was well lit. I was scared once in 5 hours.\nI also managed to bug the game so badly I had to restart and I put a couple of chairs in the wall. Also noticed were floating objects, obviously deleted objects, and objects merging into the wall.","May 21","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was initially drawn to this one because of its unique setting (a British museum of the occult back in 1909), feeling that the setting had a lot of potential to it for the makings of both a great adventure story and a creepy horror experience.\n\nSadly, while Astray does get a few things right, it also falls short in many ways.\n\nPROS:\n* Good graphics\n* Unique setting\n* Interesting Story\n* Thick atmosphere\n* Fun puzzles\n\nCONS:\n* Only one (mostly non-scary!) enemy\n* No real danger ever present\n* Very empty locations\n* Story begs more questions than it answers\n* Jarring contrast between the first and second half of the game\n\nWhile this game produces a good atmosphere and has some fun puzzles to explore and solve in the different themed areas of the Museum, beyond these themed locations much of the museum is empty and boring. The "creatures" you encounter are very slow and really of no major threat to you, and ultimately the only challenge in the game is getting through the somewhat-buggy boss fight at the end.\n\nThe game begs more questions than it answers, and while that's not a bad thing sometimes, in this case it kind of left me just scratching my head at the end and wondering what I just experienced.\n\nOn a scale of 0 to 10, where 5 is "average," this game gets a rating of:\n\n=========================\nMEH...... 4 / 10\n=========================","May 31","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
