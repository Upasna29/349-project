"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054824117/recommended/444240/","76561198054824117","sailsandbellows","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054824117/","472 products in account","For anyone who loved the Wii Play minigame "Tanks!", this game is its spiritual successor: from the art style and control scheme to the music, this game borrows many of the features that made "Tanks!" great and expands upon them.\n\nThis review is for those of you who've played "Tanks!" and have been looking for a good PC equivalent ever since (as I have).\n\nFor starters, there's powerups which have to be found during rounds and have a limited number of uses. I think this is an improvement over being stuck with just your main cannon and mines (like "Tanks!").\n\nThere's also a pretty powerful map editor and local/online multiplayer.\n\nI only have two small issues with Tankr:\n\nFirst, I'd reccomend playing with M&K over controller, as aiming the turret with the right stick feels a little out of control. I use a Steam Controller, and had a pretty tough time configuring the right pad to behave. I was able to get it dialed in decently, but it still seemed pretty angular feeling. I don't mind using M&K, but it'd be nice to have both options, especially if friends are over. That being said, it may work better with a physical analog stick.\n\nSecond, you're not able to play your created maps by yourself- they must be played in either online or local multiplayer. You're not able to test the maps either as far as I can tell.\n\nOverall, Tankr is a great game, and one I'd recommend to my friends.\n\nPros:\n-Very similar to Wii Play's "Tanks!"\n-Tons of levels, which ramp up in difficulty\n-Powerups\n-Map editor\n-Local and Online MP\n\nCons:\n-Controller aiming a little wonky\n-Can't test maps you create, or play them alone\n\n","June 6","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
