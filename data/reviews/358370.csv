Controls are perfect using the 360-Controller - firing with the right trigger is extremely satisfying! The levels however are a bit pale from a game design standpoint - you pretty much do the same all the time.\n\nNote: I've played using the Microsoft 360-Pad and the Saitek PS3200. For some reason, the controls using the MS-Pad are a bit stiff in that the Analog Stick doesn't seem to support diagonal movement. That means you can either move to the X- or Y-axis, but never both. The Saitek-Pad however works just fine and lets me do vertical movement. I don't know if this is a problem with my PC but I thought I'd share this with you.\n\nThe graphics are very smooth and nicely done.\n\nThe levels are cool - you get the typical icy/volcano-ey and deserty planets, but also a sort-of death-star-knockoff shaped like a giant dagger.\n\nThe music is cool, however they are only like 40-Second-loops, which was OK for when it came out. This isn't a bad thing -  as a kid I didn't even care about that. The music is still a lot more creative than the generic orchestral soundtracks you get in pretty much any AAA-game nowadays, and it has a nice variety. The "Moon Dagger" music is really awesome and together with the dark level design makes it really intense!\n\nGreat game. 10/10","June 1, 2015","true","3.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/358370/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Having played all games of the series: Terminal Velocity, Fury (cubed), and Hellbender, I still prefer this game to any other, due to its semi-freeform gameplay where you can follow the nav points, or just randomly fly around and shoot anything in your way. (In reality, the game wraps around seamlessly so you'll eventually get where you should be). The gameplay is simialr enough... It's basically you fly around a planet, make occasional forays into the tunnels which turn, rotate, spin, open-and-close, and otherwise make things difficult for you.\n\nFor its days, the 3D graphics were fast, and furious, and far less claustrophobic than Descent, which is restricted to tight tunnels. Other than that... you shoot ground installations, airborne targets, ground tanks, turrets, and occasional bosses.\n\nBeing an ancient DOS game, peripheral support was good for its day, horrible for modern peripherals.\n\nIf you get this in a bundle, enjoy. But I wouldn't pay $6.99 for this, even for nostalgia.","December 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I am more familiar with the re-coded Fury 3, which is what Microsoft released when they purchased the source code. The last title of the series was called "Hellbender". It's really simple. Fly to different plannets, blow up main targets with your lasers, rockets, and cannons and defeat a "guardian" at the end of the level then proceed to the next planet. The games seemed a bit short, with approximately 20 planets each game. But it's still a classic. It's good to know the old cheat codes still work with the steam version! I recommend a joystick if you can get it to work. Perhaps Fury3 and Hellbender will also be available on steam, too.","November 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/358370/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","Made in a time when flight sims and sci-fi action were THE genres. The game is pretty good, but it was the first in its series, and many of the obvious faults, such as the somewhat bland level design, were objectively improved upon in the later games Fury3 and, my personal favorite, Hellbender.\n\nApart from one crash, the only problem I encountered was an awkward control situation. This is emulated through DOSBox, which seems to have issues with input hardware detection. Worst case scenario is that the game ignores the analog control of joysticks and gamepads. Instead, it will recognize these motions as regular keyboard presses, and this is a pain for steering. Mouse controls sort of work, but take a lot of tweaking to get just right. I personally found the best option to be a gamepad, steering with the directional buttons and controlling thrust with the right analog stick.\n\nOther than that, this is a blast to play. Fun, fast, and quickly self-explanatory, it just feels good to shoot stuff, and it's entertaining enough for a bit of replay, too.","February 6","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
