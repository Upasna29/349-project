Basically, a Red Alert game like any other, maybe except for that last part.\n\nThere are three factions to choose from, the Allies, the Soviet Union, and the Empire of the Rising Sun. Don't ask. Okay, you just had to, fine. Einstein invented the time machine, erased Hitler from the timeline. Soviets got ballsy and started WWII instead of Nazi Germany which is now nonexistent. Then Allies kicked their asses twice, and at that point they invented a time machine of their own to kill Einstein. "Wait, that would mean there is Nazi Germany now and-" No, shut up and go defend your refinery from cryocopters.\n\nBehind the nonsense of a story, there is a jewel of RTS design, hands down. Every unit has a secondary attack, meaning more micro options. There are air, land and sea units (every building except barracks and war factory can be built on water), some can freely switch between two or even all three. Every faction is unique to play down to the way they build their bases, each has something different to offer depending on your preferences and they're overall balanced relative to each other. People might tell you that Allies are the best faction which is kind of true but there was a time when they said the same about Empire so whatever. Just play Soviets, they have bears.","November 24, 2015","true","9.6"," 271 of 282 people (96%) found this review helpful 141 people found this review funny","96","271","282","141","0"

The easy user interface combined with the fast action make me choose this game over Starcraft II on a nearly daily basis. The multiplayer is amazing, and the game is incredibly balanced. Unfortunately, the game does not have a massive online community. You end up running into the same people, time and time again.\n\nThe Bad:\nAs a fan of Red Alert 1 and 2, I found the campaign to be COMPLETELY destroyed by EA. Real actors, combined with cartoony stuff, and Tanya having blonde hair. It made me cringe. If you're looking to play the campaign, and not delve into the incredible tactics within the multiplayer... don't bother. This game is not for you.\n\n","December 21, 2013","true","283.5"," 194 of 225 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","194","225","0","4"

The campy FMV cutscenes filled with 'B' Actors are amusing, the units are varied and interesting and the game is fun to play. The difficulty curve is a little wonky mission to mission, where one mission will be frustratingly hard and the next too easy. It's not quite as good as Red Alert 1 or 2, but is still worth playing.","November 27, 2013","true","25.5"," 99 of 113 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","99","113","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/17480/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","Command and Conquer does it again with another great installment onto the Red Alert series. Although not as good as its predecessor C&C: RA3 continues to offer no need for builders and no worry of controlling population.\n\nGameplay:\nUnlike past Red Alerts I only played about one skirmish as I did not find the AI as enjoyable as the predecessors. This Red Alert offers some interesting new teams and resource harvesting concepts which seem different than before. Like in the past Red Alert games the Russians and Allies are pretty much the same basic strategy type, while the third team offers a fresh new tactics. Similar to past Red Alerts to expand bases (when playing as either Allies or Soviets) you can build Mobile Construction Vehicles. But, unlike past Red alerts they have also added the ability for Prospectors (allied ore miners) to deploy into Command Centers which allow you to expand to nearby areas mitigating large costs. The USSR can build “Sputnik” which can also deploy into a command center. Both of these units allow for cheaper base expansion. This is different for the Japanese whose buildings are built by transforming vehicles into buildings and thus are not limited to base parameters.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign took me about 21 hours to complete (that includes Allies, Russians, and Rising Sun missions). Interestingly the campaigns intertwine and in some instances you play the same missions but just as the opposing team, which I sort of liked. In the case of this game the missions are not exactly gripping, but that is the case with all strategy games. The campaign offers a great composition of actors which make you laugh, gasp, and reminisce in the old days when you first sat down and played Red Alert. Some of the missions are very quick and last no time at all while others can last a couple hours.\n\nResults:\nIf you are expecting something just like the second Red Alert then you will be disappointed. There is only one Yuri and his revenge was an epic adventure that could only be told once. If you are interested in playing a strategy game that brings Red Alert on a new adventure then this is a game worth checking out. With an amazing intro song to boot and epic campaign cut scenes that you won't forget. Red Alert 3 really takes Westwood’s dream into action: hot babes who flirt with you throughout your entire game and keep your spirits bolstered with cheesy lines.\n\nPros:\n+Great campaign with fun dialogue and amazing cut scenes.\n+New Empire of the Rising Sun team which brings all new tactics to the game\n+Campaign missions that don't just require you to continually build a base over and over again, but rather test you through a variety of scenarios.\n+Epic main menu music that just makes you want to jump right into the Russian campaign.\n+It has been 18 years and Tanya still hasn't aged over 30... a mystery? Or did someone use the chronosphere?\n\nCons:\n-Its not Red Alert 2 (that game already existed, if you want that game you may want to go find the disk from your shelf)\n-Some campaign missions can run rather long, while others last about 10 minutes. (Some missions took me up to three hours).\n-Poor movement AI can cause units to not exactly act how you want them too.","February 22, 2014","true","21.0"," 83 of 91 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","83","91","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/17480/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","TL:DR? See Conclusion\nNOTE: I have played this game extensively, but not on Steam.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 is a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game serving as the third installment of the popular Command & Conquer series.  It features a rebooted story and a brand new faction called 'The Empire of the Rising Sun'.  However, unlike its predecessors,  Electronic Arts who acquired Westwood Studios, the original developers of the game, produced Red Alert 3.  It is one of the last few remaining franchises who use live action cutscenes which the series is known for.\n\nPlayers once again take the role of the unknown commander who leads either the Allied Forces, the Soviet Army, or the newly resurrected Imperial Armed Forces to ultimate victory.\n\nRed Alert 3's story starts with the Soviet Union in complete collapse after the events of Red Alert 2.  In an effort to stop the USSR's defeat, surviving Soviet leaders use a time machine to go back in history and erase Albert Einstein in order to prevent him from developing Allied technology.  Upon returning to the Present day however, they discover that without Einstein, nuclear technology was  never developed.  With this turn of events, this meant that the US never bombed Japan and the Empire never surrendered during World War 2.  Now the Empire has risen once more and poses a new threat to both the Soviets and the Allies prompting the hilarious line by actor Peter Stormare as Dr. Gregor Zelinsky: “We now have...two mortal enemies?”\n\nPROS:+ Colorful visuals and very nice graphics with good use of Physx technology\n+ New 'Empire of the Rising Sun' faction is fun to play featuring highly advanced, extremely versatile, very expensive, and unhealthily suicidal units (ex. Tsunami Tank: “HA! Give us a good death”  Imperial Warrior:  “Death before defeat!” Shogun Battleship:  “Ramming speed!” Yari Sub:  “We're taking you with us!”\n+ Fun campaign for all 3 factions\n+ Hilarious, Hammy, Cheesy but overall good voice acting\n+ Humorous and entertaining Tutorial\n+ All units for all factions now have secondary abilities\n+ Co-op campaign\n+ Very nice Music and Sounds\n\nCONS:- The very colorful art-style that could cause headaches for some people\n- Some low polygon models, low resolution shadows, and poor textures can be seen here and there\n- Short campaign for each faction\n- Story is shallow and uses way to many cliche elements from the previous Red Alert 2\n- Occasional pathfinding problems\n- Balance issues with some of the units\n- Some outstanding bugs that was never fixed (for some reason, changing the graphics quality and  resolution at the same time MAY cause a crash)\n- Despite EA's vast resources and use of big name actors like Peter Stormare and George Takei, I can't help but feel that they were not able to live up to the standard of Westwood.\n- Broken multiplayer on Steam (No idea if it works in Origin)\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT RTS GAME.  Although it does not fully capture the magic of Red Alert 2, Red Alert 3 still delivers a great fast paced experience for RTS fans looking for a quick fix.  The campaign is fun with a story that is easy to follow but uses a lot of cliche plot elements.  The Soundtrack is excellent and the over-the-top, hammy, and cheesy voice acting are very entertaining.  Multiplayer is also fun if you're looking for a casual RTS experience since the AI does pose a challenge on higher difficulties.  In addition, new game mechanics such as the secondary abilities and the new faction spices up the action.\n\nNow we come on whether or not I recommend this game.  If you're in this for the single player experience, sure I can RECOMMEND this game easily.  If you're in this for the multiplayer experience, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game here on Steam because for some reason the Servers are broken so you're better off purchasing this in EA's Origin Platform.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The science is silly as always but the units, particularly the animal units will make your sense of logic die a little.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/17480/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 is a real-time strategy game and obviously the follow-up to Red Alert 2. While I absolutely loved Red Alert 2 I can't say the same for this title.\n\nFirst, there are some things Red Alert 3 does well. The storyline is as cheesy as it comes and that is what fans expect and love. It is also great that the game has actors like Tim Curry, George Takei and David Hasselhoff, who really seem to enjoy performing the B-movie-like storyline.\n\nHowever, Red Alert 3 has many problems compared to its predecessor. The units have a cartoonish look to them and look like child's toys. Many of them look so over the top that it is just ridiculous. Also, the weapon's effects and sounds don't convey any impact, further reinforcing that impression.\n\nThe gameplay itself comes off as very hectic because units cannot take any damage, no matter the unit type. Even the biggest tanks and ships give off the impression of being made of paper. They get destroyed within seconds leaving no room for actual micromanagement. The problem is that the game wants the player to micromanage since every unit has some sort of special ability. There is not much room to use them however and I would have preferred not having them at all except the toggled abilites. The units' AI is also pretty bad. If the enemy has a slightly longer range they will refrain from retaliating and just get destroyed. Anti-air weaponry is extremely underwhelming in this game. Often building turrets don't seem to make no sense at all. Even if you have a solid turret setup there is just not much use in defending since there are so many units that can destroy your base from huge distances. If the enemy uses aircraft they will still destroy your base because there is no defense that will keep them from destroying at least one target in every run.\n\nRed Alert 3 features a computer controlled partner in every campaign mission. This partner can be replaced by a human player and while I appreciate the idea of making the whole campaign able to be played coop it just doesn't work. The computer partner is highly unreliable in its performance. In some missions it will basically win the mission by itself with you struggling to keep up with the pace and in some missions it will be literally useless. During the last mission of the Rising Sun campaign my AI partner was actually unable to even defend its own base. When I didn't continually sent units there my partner would just be annihilated within a few minutes. All of this while I had my own problems, being hammered by airstrikes, superweapons and ground troops.\n\nThe campaign should come with a trigger warning (pun intended) because all missions are heavily built around triggers that you most of the time cannot see coming. However you need to be prepared for them because if you're not you have basically lost. There is no reaction time since the game is fast and units and buildings cannot withstand any damage. It's bad design if you can only win by being able to see into the future. If you have run your head into the wall a few times you will know the triggers and it basically becomes a minigame of avoiding those. One of the worst examples is from the Rising Sun campaign. At one point you will be confronted with a huge enemy fleet and have to hold out until your battleships arrive. When they arrive it is still not enough to destroy the enemie's base but you absolutely need to destroy all their shipyards. Why you ask? Because the AI will start producing an indefinite amount of aircraft carriers and since anti-air turrets are horribly weak you will lose.\n\nRed Alert 3 is not a horrible game but is has so many shortcomings compared to its predecessor that I cannot recommend it at all.\n\nP.S.: If you liked the Tanya from Red Alert 2 you will be severely disappointed.\n\nMore reviews here","September 12, 2014","false","23.8"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reliant39/recommended/17480/","Reliant39","Reliant39","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reliant39/","701 products in account","This is, to my mind, the best Command & Conquer game out there. Some complain about the blatant fanservice with respect to the use of well-edowed female actrices in the hammy videos, while others believe that Red Alert 3 has gone too far with respect to the silliness inherent in the series (i.e. the use of war bears by the Soviets and the mecha-inspired units in the army of the Empire of the Rising Sun). To me, all that stuff is simply silly fluff that shouldn't be taken seriously.\n\nWhat should be taken seriously is the gameplay. The game is a refined version of the Command & Conquer style of real-time strategy game: a simple economy (you build powerplants to power your structures and harvest ore to get money to buy more buildings and units) with an emphasis on the spectacle of battle. Units are fragile, so expect many of them to be destroyed more or less as soon  as you encounter enemy forces. Hard counters are used, which means that some units, for example, have no defences against air units, or are weak against certain types of infantry, and so forth. This means that reconaissance is as important if not more so as in other RTS games.\n\nRed Alert 3 is more micro-heavy than most of the other games in the series. Each and every unit has a toggable special ability (hotkey F), and use of these special abilities will prove essential in most battles. Combined with the speed at which units move and their fragile nature, this means that games can get very hectic, very fast. It's for this reason that I mostly avoid multiplayer: I know that I won't be good enough to compete anyway. Instead, I stick to singleplayer and it's loads of fun.\n\nThe game has three factions and each of them gets their own campaign, with each campaign consisting of nine missions each. The different factions are the Allies, the Soviets, and a new third faction especially developed for this game, namely the Empire of the Rising Sun (essentially Japan). The Allies emphasize their air power, while the Soviets field relatively sturdy ground troops and can spit out a lot of units. The Empire is a high-tech faction with specialized units (remember: F is your friend!) and probably the most difficult to play by newcomers. The leaders of each of these factions are played by well-known actors: Vincent Pryce, Tim Curry, and George Takei, respectively.\n\nI've put many hours into the disc version of the game before buying it anew on Steam and do not regret a single minute that I spent playing the game. The campaign is entertaining and can also be played fully in co-op mode. If you don't have any friends, an AI will take over. The AI sometimes really helps out during missions, but more often than not simply forms a distraction that the enemy AI will occupy itself with while you build your base and reinforce your army. If the campaign is not your cup of tea, you can always play skirmishes against the computer or go online (there is a replacement out there for GameSpy, so the online component does still work, thanks to the fans).","September 16, 2015","true","8.8"," 40 of 61 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","40","61","4","0"

Great addition to a great franchise.

Classic RTS game play with three completely different play styles for each give it a high replay value.

Great graphics, great performances all around and an engaging if not over the top plot with the feel of a big budget hollywood production.

I really hate that. Since the AI is always building stuff you can't save up money for things to build, and you are ALWAYS short of resources because of this. It is really frustrating! I was looking forward to having a full co-op campaign when I bought this game, but I was not ready for that design decision.\n\n\nOtherwise I've been surprised about how well this holds up as a sequel to RA2 and YR. And it is fun that we finally get a main campaign that focuses on the Sovjet side. Sure, previous games have always had the sovjet campaign aswell, but that was not the main story. And having such a great actor-rooster adds to the experience.\n\nThe amoun of bewbs (or cleavage) this game shows can be discussed. The twelve-year old inside my 25 year old body is happy, but the game would have been just as good (perhaps better) without it.\n\nSo how does the game feel then?\n\nBasically this game is a mixture of the previous C&C titles. You've got the familiar units, all though redesigned, from the RA-series with addition of new units. You've also got the micromanagment system from RA2, which was lacking in the Generals-series; waypoints and hold-fire and stuff like that. Then again, some controls and features from the Generals series have found its way in here. It is really odd to see units and gameplay first feeling like generals, but then also feeling like RA2. I'm not sure I'm all that fond of the mixture yet.\n\n\nI'm sure my view on this game will change as time goes by. And if I manage to get online I will add that experience to this review later on.\n\nWill I recommend this game for new players? Well if you have RA2/Yuri's Revenge and you somehow manage to play that online then stick with that game, because it is more fluent than this. At least in my humble opinion.\n\nIf you don't have anything else, I can surley see this as a viable option.

Case in point, in Yuri's Revenge, there was a building that ground up troops for resources all while using slave labor.\n\nMind you, this was also a game where you fight dinosaurs and hollywood stars were actually commandoes, but I can also say that with the combination of frank klepacki's unapologetically metal soundtrack combined with equal amounts ridiculous and awesome units and set pieces, RA 2 worked on a level that couldn't be replicated.\n\nThat being said, RA3 is in no way the game that anyone was looking for. See, what sets RA2 above other RTS games is the idea that a gamebreaker should be countered with a gamebreaker. Just remember the chronotroops and the psychich commandos, its a game with glorious power creep that encourages you to out-do your opponent.\n\nThat being said, not only did EA make a pathetic attempt to balance this game, nothing feels as crazy or nearly as fun.

Coupled with a good variety of traditional RTS mission styles, and you've got a really lengthy campaign for its genre, before even setting foot in MP (SP only review, no experience with matchmaking, connectivity, etc.)\n\nBut let's be honest though, you play this game to see Tim Curry yuck it up as a Soviet Premier, among other standouts like J.K.

Simmons just to name a few\n+ inclusion of offshore battlegrounds: almost every building can be built on water; this gives way to newer tactics\n+ finally, a 3rd faction we can choose from: the Empire of the Rising Sun is an instant favourite thanks to the unit variation (plus George Takei!)\n\n- ore fields were removed: we now have stationery ore mines that are nice but cutting of the enemy's' resources now is not as important or effective as it used to be\n- campaign could have been a little longer: while there are 9 missions with each side completing the first 4-5 does not take very long\n- the game desperately tries to show something new with the inclusion of the naval warfare: this is not necessarily a problem but throughout the campaign there's too much emphasis on it\n- mediocre coop integration: while playing all 27 levels with a friend is pretty cool, playing solo is pretty difficult at times due to the dumbed-down A.I. that is not always helpful\n\nTo summarise: for me the number 2 will be the essential Red Alert title but this one was also pretty neat back in 2008.

This truely is the sequel to red alert 2 with its querkyness and all. Although this game does not take itself very seriously it is massively fun to play for hours on end. Strategy is key in this game where you have many options of assault and you are able to take research and development in different areas to see what is effective. You will soon learn after playing the strengths and weaknesses of each faction and just how to play as each. This game decides to mix naval air and ground battles just as in red alert 2 but it is done better as you have the worry of being snuck up on by enemy fleets, or bombed by bombers.\n\nThis game is great and I enjoy it more than many of the other command and conquer games out there.

I was introduced to it on the Nintendo 64, with Tiberium Dawn(Or the original or those of you who don't know.) Red Alert 3 manages to nail the so cheesy it's good feel that the C&C series is renowned for. I love the live action cast, and there is great fun to be had in this game. The units are diverse as are the Factions, the Empire of the Rising Sun has units ranging from GIant Robots to Psychic School Girls, where the Soviets are more docile. Soviets are slow and powerful and the Allies are the most well balanced. Each vehicle has a special ability. This game feels like C&C and it is very fun, even if it isn't of Westwood stature. I highly recommend this game. My only irritation is the lack of buildings and new units. I'm looking forward to picking up Command & Conquer 3 and latter on Age of Empires III!

The Red Alert developers realized that trying to do "serious" FMV for these games usually ended up producing something nigh-unwatchable, like Command & Conquer 2.  So they decided to just turn the cheese knob until it broke off, and Red Alert 3 continues this tradition with pride.  It combines time travel and crazy inventions and Tim Curry to make a wonderful, fun mess of a storyline.  And the best part is that the actors are into it - they understand that the scenery here is meant to be eaten.\n\nBut look past the cheese (and cheesecake) and you'll find a fun, very playable RTS.  The three sides all play differently, with the Russians being the simple bruisers, the Empire having the coolest (but most difficult to use) units and the Allies having the most useful commander powers.\n\nPlus, the game has co-op.  The "single player" campaign is actually designed to be played by two people at once, each controlling a different commander.  Since co-op multiplayer is the best multiplayer, it was nice to see this finally come to the RTS genre.  And don't worry - if you don't have anyone to play with, there are nine different AI commanders to help you out, each of whom has their own play style and personality.  As the story progresses and you move to the next campaign, AI commanders that used to be your allies could become your enemies and vice-versa - an excellent touch.\n\nThe game is also beautiful, with some of the best water I've ever seen. Models are detailed, textures are rich and of good resolution and special effects are excellent.\n\nIn short, Red Alert 3 may have disappointed fans who were eagerly awaiting the next "real" Command & Conquer, but if you take it for what it is it's a blast.\n\nPlus hot chicks.","December 5, 2013","true","48.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This game does not have an enjoyable campaign, the units are basic and boring, and it is not fun thus defeating the purpose of it being classified as a "game".  The campaign is flat out dull and boring, the witty cutscenes that went hand in hand with good gameplay are no longer there, EA has seen fit to simply have bad acting encompass their bad game design just so they can say "look we remember what RA used to be too!"\n\nThe units are boring and made out of paper, the fun general powers from C&C Generals make a return but with None of the fun or innovation that the previous title put into it.  Factional units are cut and paste from each other with only some different looking models and alternate modes being the variation.  The units in general show the worst signs of AI that I have ever seen in ANY RTS title or game that I have played PERIOD.  They are extremely near-sighted; they always fail to return fire unless you give them a direct order and will just sit there getting blown away by everything.  Speaking of alternate unit modes, this game tries to do something different and fails utterly, the only thing that these abilities do is further complicate the most BASIC C&C formula and further hamper the gameplay and fun factor of the title.  Even when you have them built with attack at will rather then defensive they will consistently neglect to defend themselves even when the enemy unit is right on top of them, it is babysitting of the highest order and a huge failing of the “game” and its developers.  The “future” has shown that any C&C title past Generals or maybe the earlier 3D C&Cs have been a complete failure as fans continue to drop the titles in favor of something less driven by greed and fake innovation.\n\nDuring the campaign you can either have a coop human player, if you can keep connection with EA’s trash servers (another quality sign of EA) or you can be aided by the in game AI, which is semi competent enough however the kicker is that for an RTS game you and your coop player share ore resources, which is absolutely ridiculous and a really poorly thought-out mechanic.  On the subject of the campaign again I will clarify further that it is one of the most boring three faction story mode that I have ever played let alone failing to bring me any joy from playing it.  I have to push myself in order to go back to it and attempt to finish it that’s how I consider the story mode and the game in general, boring and a CHORE, no game should ever make the player feel that way!  I am very glad that I never got this game when it came out for the full price and even then $10 for a 2008 title I still feel ripped off and the price proves that EA will never stop being a money grubbing parasite. To add to this, Steam needs to change the description of this game since as of now the Gamespy servers have been shut down indefinitely so the online Coop and multiplayer are no longer a functioning entity of this title.\n\nThe music of C&C has always been memorable this is especially the case with the Red Alert series.  However in RA3 they have yet again gone away from being GOOD and simply moved to the most repetitious garbage that I have had to listen to repeated through the ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.  You will hear a single song for the entirety of each an every single mission within the campaign as well as the multi and skirmish section, not ONCE is the famous Red Alert song played at any point within the game short of the menu, that is yet more proof that there is no longer a Command and Conquer series of RTS games at all.  They have simply screwed up on the entire game, which amazingly enough extends to even the music score which is unbelievable.\n\nI am saddened that this title got such higher praises then I feel that it should have, as if the fans were so hopeful to the possibilities of the new EA Westwood titles that everyone seems to have given this game a pass regardless to how bad it truly is.  I feel sorry that the younger generations after me will never again know how good C&C titles used to be and that based on this, my last C&C title that I will buy, we will never see the good days again.","July 20, 2014","false","17.2"," 34 of 64 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","34","64","0","0"

Just happened that I repurchased this game off steam recently. I would say that this game is rather well developed in terms of PvP but still lacking in terms of storymode. Ai is still pretty much predictable and the trademark win by numbers is still prevalent in storymode. It is considerably more interesting for PvP. However, I would argue that PvP still lacked depth compared to other rts such as Starcraft 2. Still good for the price. A worthy investment if you have spare cash to throw in hope of finding a decent game.","July 6, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In Red Alert 3, there is a Soviet general with six stars per shoulder, dozens and dozens of medals and a coffee mug decorated with Soviet iconography. In one mission briefing he gravely warns that "Our enemies are thrusting deeply into Mother Russia's tender nether regions." It only gets better when the Soviet Hammer Tank exclaims "It's hammer time!" and moves to engage. The best thing about all this is that the actual gameplay follows suit, being both fast-paced and relaxing. Graphical style is very gonzo and bright and fits the subject matter perfectly, as does the gloriously nonsensical soundtrack.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakiebob/recommended/17480/","Jakiebob","Cybercacoarchubus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakiebob/","233 products in account","There are two things in particular that make this game: the humour, and the co-op. Truth be told, I haven't played through either of the previous Red Alert games, so I wouldn't know how this is as a sequel. However, on it's own, this game is very fun, especially if you play through it with a friend. Not a lot of RTS games offer co-op throughout their campaign, and it was very welcome as co-op is guaranteed to improve any game. The comedy of the game was also great. I'm not saying it's particularly hilarious, it's just that it's an RTS that doesn't take itself seriously, which again, not a lot of RTS games do. It does have it's moments though that are genuinely funny, especially from the live-action performances of Tim Curry, George Takei, and JK Simmons. The story is also appropriately absurd and great if you don't want to take yourself seriously.\n\nGameplay wise, there are much deeper RTS games to play besides this one. Again, don't dismiss it because of that, it's still fun, but if you are looking for a very strategic RTS, this isn't the one. Not to say the strategic element is completely lacking, the three factions all have their own play styles which can translate into having to alter your strategy depending on who you are playing as and who you are fighting. All three factions can also build on land, air, and water which also have their own strengths and weaknesses. Water is also prominently built into each map, so navies are actually quite useful, another thing that not a lot of other RTS games do. Like I said before though, the gameplay is good, just not great.\n\nGreat game if you like RTS games and want a loony experience with one of your friends.","May 22, 2012","true","55.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Die Kampagnen sind viel zu kurz und leider auch viel zu einfach. Dafür sind die Änderungen sowohl bei den Alliirten als auch bei den Sowjets super und mit den Japanern wurde eine komplett neue und ziemlich vielseitige Fraktion in das Spiel integriert. Der einzige wirklich ernste Kritikpunkt ist das schlechte Balancing, so ist die Heldin der Japaner beispielsweise viel zu stark. Die Filme sind dafür wieder ganz große Klasse auch wenn das meiste sehr vorhersehbar ist.\nEine (eigentlich) gute Fortsetzung, welche aber im Singleplayer ruhig etwas mehr bieten könnte (Länge und Schwierigkeit) und welche für den Multyplayer eine bessere Balance nötig hätte.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/recommended/17480/","welcomeaboardmate","BlackEagle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/","501 products in account","This game is going offline here pretty soon thanks to EA dropping support for the "less than 1%" of their playerbase across over 50 of their titles. Regardless, this is a RTS game that would still remain fantastic to play in singleplayer OR co-op with a friend, as everything does work with Hamachi and if you have a disc version, Gameranger works too. The game has an extensive list of tutorials that for the most part a seasoned C&C player can entirely ignore and figure the new stuff out themselves, but as far as features go, this game is the closest thing to a Westwood C&C styled game that has come out since their demise. No squad system, extreme countering-style units, extreme diversion amongst the factions (the fast-paced allies, the turtle-heavy soviets, and the...asians), diverse base construction (finally bringing walls back) and a ton of lighthearted and extremely amusing missions and dialogue from units and the campaign with rocking music featuring Tim Wynn, James Hannigan, and of course, Frank Klepacki from the westwood titles helping to soundtrack as well. That said, the campaign is absolutely fantastic by ANY standard - FMV cutscenes that add up to somewhere around an hour in length and use top notch actors such as J.K. Simmons and George Takei.\n\nAs far as how well this game can bring in new players to the series, it's extensive campaign and the fact that 1 of the 3 campaigns (Soviet one) is almost explicitly designed to ease players into the gameplay makes this a FANTASTIC entry point for newcomers. The tutorial itself consists of 6 amusing tutorials that really don't feel tedious despite totalling about an hour in length to explain the game mechanics, and are entirely skippable for anyone who's familiar with certain aspects of C&C or basic RTS controls to either see newer features or try to figure it out themselves. And for those not particularly happy with the soviet campaign style of easing players in, the allies campaign as well as empire campaign are notably more difficult right off the starting line and clearly designed with veteran players in mind. The campaign endings are lackluster so don't expect anything amazing, but the story throughout each campaign is rather intriguing. And yes, I keep going back to the campaign - that is really where the most work went into this game, clearly. The campaign at all points in time gives you an AI partner of a certain personality, each personality having a different playstyle. If you don't want an AI partner, it's possible to have a friend play with you instead in co-op, replacing the AI partner. The AI isn't particularly bad, however, and you are capable of issuing 4 basic commands (Strike area, strike target, plan (build up and launch) attack, don't attack) to your AI companion in an attempt to order them around like you would with another player.\n\nAs far as skirmish goes, it does provide a lot of replayability as once again, you can call in these AI personalities to fight with or against you. Likewise, in multiplayer which will be limited to LAN-based hosting services or just straight up REAL LAN if anyone still uses that, other players can join you and you can still add AI or remove them at will. The limit to 6 players at maximum, however, is upsetting, and the map editor for this game does not work with the steam version as far as I can tell, but there's already plenty of community maps worth downloading and playing.\n\nFor a $20 asking price, you are more than getting your money's worth. Compared with the considerably less westwood-like C&C 3 Tiberium Wars game asking $30, you are far better off getting this game and will undoubtably have more fun with it alone or with friends and it is by far the best entry into the C&C series as a whole for new players.","May 12, 2014","true","73.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Naval warfare is a rather big part of the game, but it doesn't feel tedious and it doesn't feel like you are missing anything on the more sea based maps. Additionally this game nails co-operative play better than any other RTS game I have played. The missions are very well structured for co-operative play. For example on one map your ally is expected to defend an island while you go out and attack the enemy, and on another your base is in the water while your allies base is on land, and you are expected to perform a naval assault while your ally does a land assault. The music in this game is also pretty great, but that is to be expected from a Red Alert title. The unit designs are neat, from armored bears to tranforming mecha. This is a game that doesn't take itself very seriously and probably turned out better for it.","August 8, 2011","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

You must build your base, then build up a force to attack the opposition. It is single player and Multiplayer, so you can play with friends and by your self! Sure, this game is only for windows from steam, but if you have a windows computer, this is worth it to buy. There is also a campaign which I recommend you play as you can play as the Soviets(Russia), The Allies(America) or the Rising sun(Japan). This game is a complete update from the red alert series.

No multiplayer\n2. Units have very low health and you cannot do much before they are destroyed\n3. Co-commander is mostly useless in single player campaign\n4. Skirmish is a slugfest\n5. SHARED ECONOMY IN SINGLEPLAYER. Your co-commander builds useless ♥♥♥♥ and sends them into sucidal charges.\n6. Lack of maps and skirmish customizability\n7. Graphics looks like a cartoon\n8. You cannot zoom out very much\n9. Campaigns are easy to finish and a short\n10. The Japanese campaign is a ♥♥♥♥ING CHORE\n11. Cheesy acting\n12. Support powers are overpowered\n13. No restriction of superweapons in skirmish\n\nGood:\n\n1. Hotkeys are easy to use and are very useful\n2. ALL units are well though out and balanced\n3. Good variety of gameplay and mechanics in each of the factions\n4. Graphics for this old of a game\n5. Special abilites are well though out and take skill and timing to properly exploit, not to mention thier usefulness\n6. Easy to play, but hard to master\n7. Pretty balanced between all the factions and their units, minus support powers\n8. Good variety in singleplayer campaign missions (different objectives, playstyles etc.)\n9. Many approaches to completing an objective or mission.\n10. Combining units, powers, and their special abilites are VERY cool to use and are effective\n\nOverall, I did not like this game as much as the second one, but it is still one of my favourite games.","June 24, 2015","true","38.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Published in 2008, by EA.\n\nThe story stared when Lieutant Cherdenko, General Krukov and Dr. Zelinsky from the Soviet travel through the time to the past to become alliance with Albert Einstein to make the Allies weakened and automatically make the Soviets is the winner in this war. But instead accidentally removed Einstein from the time and from this world. And they come back in the present. From what they have done is leading to have the third faction, the Empire of the Rising Sun, is going to dominate this world. The battle begins between the three great powers. This war called "The war of the three powers".\n\nPros:\n-Three factions have their own specific style.\n-Very balance between three factions.(The things like C&C3 will never happen like hordes of Mammoth Tanks, Zone Troopers and Juggernauts are overwheilming you and you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-e-d)\n-Different base building style.(Dem Japanese scatter their base around the map)\n-Co-op campaign that you can play with your friend. Only in this C&C.\n-Your beloved units from past games are here.(Kirov Reporting)\n-In skirmish you can choose commander for each facttions. Each commanders have their own playstyle(Bots only).\n\nCons:\n-Short Campaign playtime compared to other games.\n-In campaign your bot sometimes useless.\n-No 4v4 skirmish\n-Unfair tech tree levelling. Soviets only have a single super reactor/tech lab, advanced units availble for whole base in the map. Alied required hightended/max clearance for each MCVs/outposts to unlock advanced units(If your MCV is fully upgraded but if your outpost doesn't upgraded yet, production structures that outpost covered still not unlock advanced units). Empire is the worst, you need to upgrade EACH of the production structures to unlock advanced units.\n\nConclusion: It's a great game. Worth the money. If you want everything balance, this game is for you.\n\n","December 10, 2015","true","104.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This moreover combined with over the top cheesy dialogue and bad acting makes almost every moment of RA3 cringeworthy. while cheesy and bad acting is staple of the C&C series its used sparingly, the developers decided to take it a notch up and put it everywhere. pair this with bad taste (the japanese defending pearl harbour from the allies) one just cant help but question the idea behind the game.\n\nGameplay mechanics have been changed a bit, now instead of having harvesters going for ore, we have deposits where we can build refineries right beside it. our harvesters need only move a very short distance, which totally eliminates the old strategy of economic harassing. the game economics has moved towards something like dawn of war where its critinal to capture "strategic points" to ensure a large economy.\n\nthe factions are now full of "over the top units", allies have helis that shrink vehicles, soviets have cannons that shoot "cannonball men" (paratroopers) and the japs are full of stuff copied from animes (mechas and teenage girls). to some it might feel cartoonish but it can be a matter of tastes.\n\nthe biggest drawback to the game play i guess it the "forced" co-op and the wildly spiking difficulty levels of the single player campaign. you must play with a computer beside you, which sometimes the ally computer player totally decimates everything on the map leaving you to attack the enemy base with 5 tanks and win. other times it cant hold its own leaving you to baby it, which spoils the game.\n\nthe spiking difficulty is also another that spoils the whole experience, while i do understand that games use cheats to provide some degree of difficulty to the player. i found this to be used too often, even in medium the AI has almost unlimited resources and almost instant production capabilities. pair this with the uneven difficulty across the campaign, you'd quickly have certain missions where its near impossible to pass and those that are almost not impossibel to lose, right after each other.\n\nall in all, i felt that RA3 was cheap idea of generating some revenue. it has nothing about "gaming" to it and more on selling the brand which is RA. some might like the over the top stuff or the new revamped economics system, but i dont i heard that multiplayer is good but i have not tried it yet. for now considering what i have been through i give it a 4/10\n\n","February 1, 2014","false","4.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

Red Alert 2 was an excellent game and extremely polished.  Red Alert 3 has great cut scenes with good acting.  The graphics in-game are way below par and barely compare to many indie releases in the RTS genre.  The voice overs for units are childish and distract from the atmosphere.  The game-play is substandard.  This game is a joke and ruins everything.  As soon as an HD Steam remake of Red Alert 2 is available Red Alert 3 will not be touched again.  To sum it up ... Red Alert is nowhere near as good as ANY of it's pre-decessors (Command and Conquer, Red Alert, Red Alert 2, Command and Conquer Generals).

A really good Command and Conquer game, which is just an all round fun RTS with cool looking vehicles and weaponry.... and it's got NAVY...HELL YEAH...great addition.... It's also interesting to see how World War II would have changed with Russia being the oppressing force using Nikola Tesla's inventions with Tim Curry from Scary Movie II as the Russian Military Leader and it was great to see George Takei from Star Trek as the Empire of the Rising Sun leader....  Without Albert Einstein assisting the Western Forces, Russia became the supreme power of the world.... I give this game a 7.5/10\n\nIt loses points because the human units look really crappy and they run like they got something in their tail pipe and also the animal units really irritate me....

When the reviews came out, it was clear it wasn't the same experience as before, so I held off purchase. But when it came to sale for the low, low price of €3, I couldn't resist picking it up. It can't be a bad deal for that price, right?\n\nWrong. The inclusion of an Allied AI commander clearly supposed to carry the single player campaign in absence of a multiplayer buddy just doesn't work. It's frustrating to have a lot of your fun depend on a dead weight ally. Single player campaign play is frustrating, and only really worth it for the FMV cutscenes. The casting choices are great, including the awesome George Takei as the Japanese Emperor. But, on that subject, the faction of Japan just doesn't feel right in Red Alert, and tries to steal the spotlight from the established factions in a way that just doesn't work. Red Alert's campy plots and cutscenes thrived on its mock Cold War feeling.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, it's a fine game. Units are diverse, mechanics are solid enough. Undoubtedly the strength of the game is in multiplayer, which I haven't tried. But it just doesn't feel like it's a proper Red Alert game. Plainly put, I wasn't having fun with this, and rarely have I been so disappointed in a purchase.","June 18, 2015","false","14.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

They tried to simplify the game by giving the player less units to use but this only complicates things by giving them special abilities which if you don't use effectively you will get wasted (and if you're like me you'll keep for♥♥♥♥♥ing you have them) and to top it off you've also got other abilities you can use which yet again not using them will surely make you lose easy peasy\n\nThen you've also got to manage your own base, pile up a nice attack and defense force all while you make sure money is coming in and you aren't being bombarded by aircraft (which got a stupidly good power creep due to anti air becoming weaker than a flick on the nose) all this piled together is just not fun, or satisying when you do eventually win. I just felt like I had the worst micromanagement session ever. Sure the other C&C games have lots of micromanagement, but there it was fun because things felt balanced, you weren't under this constant stress of needing everything immediately but only being able to get one thing. It's just, I don't hate this game, but it's just not fun for me...\n\nOnly really good part was some of the new units are pretty fun to play around with, and although the game is a massive stress-out for me, I never felt like the game was unfair (except when the AI blatantly cheats bringing over aircraft faster than I can even lay out anti air defense...)\n\nIf you have RA1 or RA2, play them instead (HELL RA2 with 7 Brutal AI on a non-Free for all game is more fun...)","December 22, 2014","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I saw that the reviews were not so good, still I thought that the game couldn't be so bad, being a new version of such a great entertainer.\nI was completely disappointed. The only good things are the videos, all the atmosphere of C&C: Red Alert2 was lost. It's just an average RTS... Well, I think that it actually is below the average now. The units are futuristic, but in this way they lose the grip with reality... I mean: it was fun having anti infantry yaks and anti vehicle migs, it was fun having to build the airfields and everything. It was fun having to give support to the battlecruisers in order to avoid having them sinked by the submarines or the migs. All those units looked realistic in some way, even the crazy tesla coil. these new buildings and units look like they have no link with the real world. It's like they tried to make the game cooler and cooler, but they overdid it and it has no cool anymore.\nI'll go back to play the Red Alert 2, it's way more entertaining","January 19","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Units can be categorized into anti-infantry and anti-armor. Main battle tanks may be terrifyingly effective against armor yet at the same time they require five to six shots to kill some of the most cheapest infanty, which indeed is hard to grasp at first. As such, attacks emphasize on the cooperation of different units spamming only one type of unit would not bring you anywere. Micromanaging becomes vital through the concept of 'crushing levels' where infantry are subject to be crushed by incoming tanks while tanks are subject to be flattened by even bigger vehicles. Several secondary abilities and attack formations of the different factions also heavily rely on micromanaging.\n\nThe single player campaign is also incredibly entertaining. I loved the cutscenes shot in real person. The humorous plot is mildly funny and worth a laugh.\n\nGraphics:\nAbsolutely brilliant special effects with breathtakingly beautiful water. Personally I prefer the rather vibrant hue in RA3 instead of  other CNC games or Starcraft. Antialiasing options lags the computer more than smoothing out the edges, however the game does not suffer from antialiasing issues much even without AA turned on.\n\nAnnoying bugs:\nThe pathfinding system is a total mess.\nSometimes units would take a full round trip around the building it just came out of before heading anywhere else.\nUnits getting stuck on the road for no reason.\nHighly expensive naval fleet would randomly be stuck on the shoreline, becoming virtually worthless.\nUnits would line up and move single-filed, slowing each other down.\nNanocores of the Empire unable to deploy and stop en-route for no reason on certain maps\n\nEA:\nThe experience for the game would be much smoother if it wasn't published by EA. RA3 had great multiplayer potential as with the introduction of the competitive aspects to the game. However, the servers in charge of hosting RA3 online closed down and there has only been a community supported server ever since, and the popularty of the RA3 community has been ever plummeting since. You won't find as much players nowadays as compared to when the gamespy servers were still online, and as a result matchmaking is almost impossible due to the tiny amount of players still playing the game.\n\nOverall, the Red Alert 3 is a great game that could be great fun to play no matter by yourself or with others. However I certainly don't think that it is worth this price due to EA's unresponsible attitude towards this game. Buy it if you have some spare money to have fun with, but it is not on the must-have list.","May 27","true","98.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In RA3 all 3 factions are very well balanced indeed. And you cannot spam your way to victory with only one unit type.\n\nc) 'too much micro managment' - Basically translates as 'the game is too hard for me.'\n\nRA3 was the last good C&C game to come out of EA LA, highly recomended if you can live without multiplayer out of the box.","May 30","true","35.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The second one took a completely different approach, with individual units being rather personalized and potentially extremely powerful (even GIs were a menace at Elite veterancy) and allowing you to wreck enemy bases with just a handful of units in the right spots (I remember being able to dismantle most bases in campaign mode with only 3 Legionnaires).

While I’m glad that the feel, atmosphere, and gameplay of RA3 remains true to the series, the gameplay feels exceptionally old. I can only suggest this game for people that enjoy VERY frantic, micromanagement heavy RTS’s – where your attention is constantly and absolutely split between no less than four different points of interest. A combination of wrist-tiring unit micromanagement along with trial and error is the only way to make progress in the campaign. That is very frustrating and exhausting, causing me to uninstall the game after playing only half of the game. The developers should have focused on FUN rather than sheer volume of “crap going on at the same time”.","July 14, 2012","false","19.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Choose the correct nation for different difficulty (solo) or coop is critical to win the battle.\nEach unit has its own skill as well as its strength and weaknesses. Grouping complimentary units is essential to win as an assault or a defend. The age of bring 5 apocalypse tanks or Prism Tank and Mirage Tank combination  to wipe out enemy base is gone. :(\nAnother big change is that it is harder to attack miner. Ore refinery can only be built near ore mine and you can easily build towers near it to defend. Ore collectors can also drive on water (or building offshore ore refinery), which makes the tricks of cutting enemies economy harder to do.\nWith all these new features comparing to RA1 and RA2, RA3 requires more strategies and more skills, adding tons of fun to this game.\n\nBut in term of the value of game / EA tries to express: 0/10\nI have to give this game a thumb down. Just like all the other EA's war related games, EA never gave up the opportunity to insult Russia/China/Japan... and keep brainwash/blind us to treat them as a threat (i know this is just a game, but this is not the first time that EA did this) So seriously, why does EA keep treating us like 12 year-old kids?","May 25","false","37.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The main reason being the different way in which each one builds, which makes the japanese really annoying if you dont like double building every building you create.\n\nIf you get on the japanese force while its building its over, 100% of the time because everything they build rolls out as a little easily destroyable unit that you are supposed to then direct where to go and finish building.\n\nThe main drawback to this game for me though is the superweapons. So super that all you really need is to build them first and you win. Dont need to uncover the fog of war even, can just nuke the enemy every game 10min into it and then roll in with a handful of choppers or tanks to mop up. If not for the superweapons i probably would have kept playing the game with a buddy and would be giving this a recommend.\n\nI just cant bring myself to recommend a game with such an overpowered mechanic, though i did like many of the C&C games in the past, this one felt like they just skipped the balancing phase all together.","November 11, 2014","false","84.1"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","1"

Even if you don't care about the campaign, you're still going to put up with goofy units and their stupid voices and cartoonic gameplay experience. Red Alert 3 might as well be a game for children, it is so silly. For the hard of hearing or those who disable the obnoxous sounds that come with, you'll find no comfort in the more-of-the-same style of gameplay.

The story line is hilarious and on par with the satisfaction of the gameplay.\n\nThis game reminds me of Dune 2000. You can tell some of the gameplay was modelled after Dune since they've not even bothered to change voice commands like `Training... Unit ready` or `Enemy unit detected`. Many of the structure units like power plants and MCVs take a liking to Dune as well. Not that that is a bad thing since Dune was an awesome game.\n\nI saw some negative reviews owing to the game not being available in multiplayer.

If you enjoyed Red Alert 2, you will probably like this as well, because really it feels like Red Alert 2 in 3D.  A few game mechanics from RA2 are gone (for the worse), and the campaigns are pretty short. Many of the individual units aren't very useful.\n\nBUT:  This game has coop.  Coop makes a mediocre game pretty fun, and RA3 is no exception.  Playing through the 3 campaigns with a friend is entertaining (each player controls their own faction).  Coop RTS is an excellent idea and I'm dissapointed it isn't more common.

Comparing the three installments of this game the first one was the least over the top. It still had some seriousness from the original C&C, but had the basis for ‘over-the-top-ness’ with the idea of Soviet Union expanding into all of Europe. Oh, and there was time travel as well. The second RA didn’t disappoint and took a leap forward in ‘over-the-top-ness’ with Soviets assaulting the US and game being generally more colorful and cheerful. Now it is the other way around with Soviets eliminating key figure from the past instead of Allies as in RA 1 and events taking yet another direction with Empire of the Rising Sun coming out as a united threat.\n\nThe game is colorful, silly, over the top and most importantly much fun. This time the big new thing is a co-commander who can be a real person over the Internet or AI controlled. This is an interesting concept with sort of built in multiplayer, but I’m really glad they made the option of AI co-commander, helping me not deal with social interactions. On rare occasions AI glitched and never left its base, so all offensive had to be done by me. At least I didn’t have to worry about defenses. Overall having a co-commanders is very beneficial as they supply almost constant attacks on the enemy thus softening them up for my big armada, which is quickly reduced to almost nothing, because unit balance is made very well I think. In most cases you can’t storm in with dozens of Apocalypse tanks and win the level. Almost always you have to think about anti-air units since the enemy AI most often will use air units for defenses and offenses as well.\n\nThe best part from RA 2 is back – unit experience. There is nothing more satisfying than one or two units maintaining the pressure on the enemy or holding off what is thrown at you only because you previously cared and repaired them each time units were near death and now they have highest possible rank and therefore added defense and firepower. For me that was the best idea Westwood had for RA 2 and it is present in RA 3 as well\n\nOverall I think it made a great transition from 2D to 3D and I loved the game just like the previous ones.","December 4, 2014","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall having a co-commanders is very beneficial as they supply almost constant attacks on the enemy thus softening them up for my big armada, which is quickly reduced to almost nothing, because unit balance is made very well I think. In most cases you can’t storm in with dozens of Apocalypse tanks and win the level. Almost always you have to think about anti-air units since the enemy AI most often will use air units for defenses and offenses as well.\n\nThe best part from RA 2 is back – unit experience. There is nothing more satisfying than one or two units maintaining the pressure on the enemy or holding off what is thrown at you only because you previously cared and repaired them each time units were near death and now they have highest possible rank and therefore added defense and firepower. For me that was the best idea Westwood had for RA 2 and it is present in RA 3 as well\n\nOverall I think it made a great transition from 2D to 3D and I loved the game just like the previous ones.","December 4, 2014","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are pretty good for a 6 year old game and the environments all look colourful and lively, it's not overly complicated to learn but there are many different ways to win a battle.

I don't recommend this game to people who want to play online... EA customer service is as bad as a toilet with pipes leading all the way back in front of your face. If you get the picture... EA games are fun, but they treat their customers like crap. I regret purchasing this and not the Uprising version, with more maps and campaign levels, I only bought this game to play matches with people again, but EA made, which says it all. If you are on a laptop with a bad graphics card, you can be able to run the game at Medium Low Settings but still 1600x900. I don't recommend this game at all, since EA turned the servers off or something so we can't go online, but I recommend the Uprising versrion, as it has more maps and more vehicles, soldiers, etc. I would give this game a 7/10, why? Well, because EA have took away our ability to play with others online. Red Alert 3 Upising mentions that you cannot play online, but this game says you can,  but gives us less content, so this proves EA is a scam... Please EA stop going for the money and give your customers the satisfaction they paid for! I did recommend this game on my review, but only the Uprising did I refer it to, not this version.

It is a solid strategy game, and all around is decent. Not great, not terrible. The one thing that really ruins this game for me is the huge gap between the balance of units. Let me break it down for you..\n\nThere are three kinds of strategy games. The ones where the unit releationships are very simple, and it follows a rock paper scissors type format, like in Age of Mythology. Normal units beat heros, heros beats myth units, myth units beats soldiers. Then there games like Warcraft III, where (In my own opinion) the balancing is perfect, and no one unit is too overpowered or underpowered. All units are useful to the end of the game. It retains the balance of Age of Mythology but has a large unit variety. Then their are games like Red Alert.\n\nThis games unit relationships are so unbalanced its ridiculus. The infantry that you start out with are completely obsolete and worthless by the time you get your first tank; which are in turn rendered useless by the top tier units. The top tier units not only render all other units worthless (besides using them as meatshields), they also render all forms of base defense useless. Now this isn't too bad, but I am kind of a wuss when it comes to the RTS genre. I like to make a prosperous, centralized and totally self-sustaining city. Then I bully my weaker neighbors and sit back, and let everyone else fight before I start attacking my enemies in earnest. So when the enemy trains a whole crap ton of unstoppable Zepplins that fly over my city and destroy it in two seconds with me being able to do literally NOTHING, it's a little frustrating. I once destroyed the enemies entire base with a single top tier unit. And they are so powerful, that if you spam enough of them, their is absolutly nothing you can do. If a fleet of Kirov Airships or a army of King Oni storm your base, you have no options whatsoever, unless you also spam King Oni or Kirov Airships. So basically late game warfare has no varity- spam one or two units and blow up eachother with armies of mechs. Which might sound pretty sweet, but I would prefer a little more variety and strategy in the game.\n\nThen their is the good in the game. Which is blowing the crap out of eachother with armies of mechs. I like strategy and stuff, but I have games like Hearts of Iron or Victoria for that. Sometimes, you just want to spam some gigantic death tanks and fight to the death!\n\nGraphically, the game is nothing to sneeze at, at least when set on the highest settings. I like the music, although they could have added in a few more tracks. The painfully cheesetastic cutscenes are, well, I love em. I mean, they are part of the Command and Conquer experience. You can't have one of these game without those live action cutscenes. They are like forage bushs in Age of Empires.\n\nAll in all, Command and Conquer Red Alert 3 is a good game and is certianly worth twenty dollers.","August 8, 2014","true","156.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No. Is this game as memorable Red Alert 2? No. Yet when this game goes on sale for $5, then it becomes very much a worthwhile purchase. To clearify - the game's story isn't bad, I personally find it to be fairly solid (although nowhere near as good as RA2) the campaign is has a decent length. The gameplay although fairly familair to veterans of the C&C franchise is a bit slower than that of the previous titles. In this game resources are gathered from a resource node - in eariler titles the way of gathering resources was to build refineries around a resource field. This change both slows the game while simultaniously makes the need for early expansion greater. But what this system allowed for is the advanced naval system. The system allows for a base to be built on either land or water - an interesting and surprisingly functional mechanic. But before I conclude, the biggest issue with the game is (this may or may not be resolved after this review is posted) that the multiplayer is not functional. When the game first launched it featured a co-op mode for the campaign (can be played singleplayer without a problem) but due to gamespy shutting down, there is no way to play multiplayer with anyone (LAN may be the exception but I have never tested it) Ultimately for $5 on sale, this is not a bad game to grab otherwise - I'd recommend either waiting or getting RA2.","August 5, 2014","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With that I will say it is still quite a challange to play these campaigns so that was fun, and I also like how EA tried to keep it to the old roots of cutscenes by live actors, but Tanya....ugh..  The story is not something to take seriously with these games, but it is something I wish they took more thought into it because there is alot of holes that just fustrate me not make me laugh.\n\nThe multiplayer at this point is slim to dead sadly and they haven't patch any balances, the Allies are so over powered it is insane how good they have it with the freeze and commander choices that just makes it a breeze for them. So I do wish they did cont forth dispite the much hate in the past for it or let some other company work on the series atleast. Its not a bad game but I would wait for a really cheap deal, if your a red alert fan and see a steam deal for the campaign, you can pick it up for a good 7 to 8 hour challange in total for each faction.

Fans of the franchise will be pleased to hear that it plays very much like Red Alert 2; skirmish mode is back, as well as online which are both incredibly addictive. Building a massive army and tipping the enemy over like a pawn is one of the most satisfying feelings in gaming.

It is a solid strategy game, and all around is decent. Not great, not terrible. The one thing that really ruins this game for me is the huge gap between the balance of units. Let me break it down for you..\n\nThere are three kinds of strategy games. The ones where the unit releationships are very simple, and it follows a rock paper scissors type format, like in Age of Mythology. Normal units beat heros, heros beats myth units, myth units beats soldiers. Then there games like Warcraft III, where (In my own opinion) the balancing is perfect, and no one unit is too overpowered or underpowered. All units are useful to the end of the game. It retains the balance of Age of Mythology but has a large unit variety. Then their are games like Red Alert.\n\nThis games unit relationships are so unbalanced its ridiculus. The infantry that you start out with are completely obsolete and worthless by the time you get your first tank; which are in turn rendered useless by the top tier units. The top tier units not only render all other units worthless (besides using them as meatshields), they also render all forms of base defense useless. Now this isn't too bad, but I am kind of a wuss when it comes to the RTS genre. I like to make a prosperous, centralized and totally self-sustaining city. Then I bully my weaker neighbors and sit back, and let everyone else fight before I start attacking my enemies in earnest. So when the enemy trains a whole crap ton of unstoppable Zepplins that fly over my city and destroy it in two seconds with me being able to do literally NOTHING, it's a little frustrating. I once destroyed the enemies entire base with a single top tier unit. And they are so powerful, that if you spam enough of them, their is absolutly nothing you can do. If a fleet of Kirov Airships or a army of King Oni storm your base, you have no options whatsoever, unless you also spam King Oni or Kirov Airships. So basically late game warfare has no varity- spam one or two units and blow up eachother with armies of mechs. Which might sound pretty sweet, but I would prefer a little more variety and strategy in the game.\n\nThen their is the good in the game. Which is blowing the crap out of eachother with armies of mechs. I like strategy and stuff, but I have games like Hearts of Iron or Victoria for that. Sometimes, you just want to spam some gigantic death tanks and fight to the death!\n\nGraphically, the game is nothing to sneeze at, at least when set on the highest settings. I like the music, although they could have added in a few more tracks. The painfully cheesetastic cutscenes are, well, I love em. I mean, they are part of the Command and Conquer experience. You can't have one of these game without those live action cutscenes. They are like forage bushs in Age of Empires.\n\nAll in all, Command and Conquer Red Alert 3 is a good game and is certianly worth twenty dollers.","August 8, 2014","true","156.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The three armies are all very different and unique, each with there own gimmicks and units that are both visually appealing and easy to tell apart on the battlefield. The graphics are pretty good for a 6 year old game and the environments all look colourful and lively, it's not overly complicated to learn but there are many different ways to win a battle.  My main 2 complaints are the lack of online servers and the fact you can drain the land completely of reasources in longer matches and have to resort to fighting with what units you have left already built. other then that, good game","August 29, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't recommend this game to people who want to play online... EA customer service is as bad as a toilet with pipes leading all the way back in front of your face. If you get the picture... EA games are fun, but they treat their customers like crap. I regret purchasing this and not the Uprising version, with more maps and campaign levels, I only bought this game to play matches with people again, but EA made, which says it all. If you are on a laptop with a bad graphics card, you can be able to run the game at Medium Low Settings but still 1600x900. I don't recommend this game at all, since EA turned the servers off or something so we can't go online, but I recommend the Uprising versrion, as it has more maps and more vehicles, soldiers, etc. I would give this game a 7/10, why? Well, because EA have took away our ability to play with others online. Red Alert 3 Upising mentions that you cannot play online, but this game says you can,  but gives us less content, so this proves EA is a scam... Please EA stop going for the money and give your customers the satisfaction they paid for! I did recommend this game on my review, but only the Uprising did I refer it to, not this version. Shame on you EA! I hope you go bankrupt and stop selling/creating games!

It is a solid strategy game, and all around is decent. Not great, not terrible. The one thing that really ruins this game for me is the huge gap between the balance of units. Let me break it down for you..\n\nThere are three kinds of strategy games. The ones where the unit releationships are very simple, and it follows a rock paper scissors type format, like in Age of Mythology. Normal units beat heros, heros beats myth units, myth units beats soldiers. Then there games like Warcraft III, where (In my own opinion) the balancing is perfect, and no one unit is too overpowered or underpowered. All units are useful to the end of the game. It retains the balance of Age of Mythology but has a large unit variety. Then their are games like Red Alert.\n\nThis games unit relationships are so unbalanced its ridiculus. The infantry that you start out with are completely obsolete and worthless by the time you get your first tank; which are in turn rendered useless by the top tier units. The top tier units not only render all other units worthless (besides using them as meatshields), they also render all forms of base defense useless. Now this isn't too bad, but I am kind of a wuss when it comes to the RTS genre. I like to make a prosperous, centralized and totally self-sustaining city. Then I bully my weaker neighbors and sit back, and let everyone else fight before I start attacking my enemies in earnest. So when the enemy trains a whole crap ton of unstoppable Zepplins that fly over my city and destroy it in two seconds with me being able to do literally NOTHING, it's a little frustrating. I once destroyed the enemies entire base with a single top tier unit. And they are so powerful, that if you spam enough of them, their is absolutly nothing you can do. If a fleet of Kirov Airships or a army of King Oni storm your base, you have no options whatsoever, unless you also spam King Oni or Kirov Airships. So basically late game warfare has no varity- spam one or two units and blow up eachother with armies of mechs. Which might sound pretty sweet, but I would prefer a little more variety and strategy in the game.\n\nThen their is the good in the game. Which is blowing the crap out of eachother with armies of mechs. I like strategy and stuff, but I have games like Hearts of Iron or Victoria for that. Sometimes, you just want to spam some gigantic death tanks and fight to the death!\n\nGraphically, the game is nothing to sneeze at, at least when set on the highest settings. I like the music, although they could have added in a few more tracks. The painfully cheesetastic cutscenes are, well, I love em. I mean, they are part of the Command and Conquer experience. You can't have one of these game without those live action cutscenes. They are like forage bushs in Age of Empires.\n\nAll in all, Command and Conquer Red Alert 3 is a good game and is certianly worth twenty dollers.","August 8, 2014","true","156.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No. Is this game as memorable Red Alert 2? No. Yet when this game goes on sale for $5, then it becomes very much a worthwhile purchase. To clearify - the game's story isn't bad, I personally find it to be fairly solid (although nowhere near as good as RA2) the campaign is has a decent length. The gameplay although fairly familair to veterans of the C&C franchise is a bit slower than that of the previous titles. In this game resources are gathered from a resource node - in eariler titles the way of gathering resources was to build refineries around a resource field. This change both slows the game while simultaniously makes the need for early expansion greater. But what this system allowed for is the advanced naval system. The system allows for a base to be built on either land or water - an interesting and surprisingly functional mechanic. But before I conclude, the biggest issue with the game is (this may or may not be resolved after this review is posted) that the multiplayer is not functional. When the game first launched it featured a co-op mode for the campaign (can be played singleplayer without a problem) but due to gamespy shutting down, there is no way to play multiplayer with anyone (LAN may be the exception but I have never tested it) Ultimately for $5 on sale, this is not a bad game to grab otherwise - I'd recommend either waiting or getting RA2.","August 5, 2014","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Red alert 1 was my first computer game. And it was very important for me. I never truly care about any other Command and Conquer game. Red alert was the only thing for me.  Gameplay and controlling was easy. Game storyline was very good and cutscenes was an awesome red alert classic.\nWhen we come to Red Alert 3 lots of people dissapointed. Because they think the game lost its old soul. But in my opinion they were wrong. All i see was improvement of old games without losing its soul. Better commanding. Better cutscenes.(With lots of beauties from mother russia, england and japan :)  ) Very nice new units and improvements to the old units from previous games. Balanced and fun increased nations to play with increased numbers. This game still rocks! Too bad that gamespy is down and we cannot play it multiplayer. :(","August 6, 2014","true","58.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I throughly enjoyed the campaign story, as I have been waiting for the sequel since RA2:Yuri's Revenge, its multiplayer proved to be a bit weak and unbalanced in the begining. As any modern RTS games do, they did make several patches after the release to balance the game, but by that time too many players already left and it was too late. It's sad because it had so much potential, but only half of it bloomed. I do recommend this game just for the single player campaign(especially if you were a fan of RA2), but if you're looking to play online, I suggest going to some other RTS game unless you got a lan-party.\n\nMy score: 7/10","February 23, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Setting rally points for your units is unnessiarly difficult, there are NO shift commands, so you have to micro your units incessivly, and even when you do your infantry get flanted (literly) by enemy vechicals. Everything but the gameplay here is amazing, which is such a shame. If you can get a friend and are looking for a dumb, casual Co-Op expierence, pick it up on sale.

Although I throughly enjoyed the campaign story, as I have been waiting for the sequel since RA2:Yuri's Revenge, its multiplayer proved to be a bit weak and unbalanced in the begining. As any modern RTS games do, they did make several patches after the release to balance the game, but by that time too many players already left and it was too late. It's sad because it had so much potential, but only half of it bloomed. I do recommend this game just for the single player campaign(especially if you were a fan of RA2), but if you're looking to play online, I suggest going to some other RTS game unless you got a lan-party.\n\nMy score: 7/10","February 23, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It really makes you feel that you are fighting a war. The music also adatps to your current situation. When you are in middle of fight a rock plays, when you do nothing major it's pop-song and when you are loosing the fight, a sad song plays.\n\nIt has a 3 factions, Allies (Americans), Soviets (Russians), Empire of the Rising Sun (Japan). Although they all have their powerfull cards, I would say that it's easiest to win with Soviets. Japs have amazing ships and strong infantry, but they require so much electricity. The amount of reactors you need to build is stupid. And once your power is down the defence turrets switch off and things get very ugly.\n\nAllies have really good variety of airplanes and good laser based defence. The chronoshephe is also useful tech.\nAlthough the tanks are rather weak and infantry is pathetic.\n\nOn the other hand Soviets have all around good tanks, strong defence, decent ships and planes. And those ridiculous Air-ships. (Forgot thier name) They are slow but overpowered as ♥♥♥♥. Once the enemy builds a handful of them (8, 16) and you don't have an uber air defence then it's GAME OVER.\n\nThis game could be even better then C&C Generals Zero:Hour because of the naval units however it has two mayor flaws.\n1st: Is the grid. The grid is just a nuisance. It does nothing but takes away the fun and freedom to build the way you want. Some people say that grid helps them to place their buildings properly. Well if you can't place your buildings without a help then you must have a serious handicap.\n2nd: Is the fact that you are reliant on exhaustible resources. Mining is the only way to make money in this game. And once the ore mines run out you can't build/train anymore. You can still mine but only tiny amouts which is enough just to keep yourself alive but not for fighting. Whereas in Generals you can build Black Markets or train hackers to accumulate cash. In addition it proves to be lot more effective than mining.","June 26, 2014","true","66.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game have a pretty funny story and not very serious at all. As an Age of Empire 2 lover I also want a change of pace and fight with something like tanks and laser cannon rather than bows and swords. And better yet, fight by commanding an army of robot! The unit types in this game counter each other to the point that a lowly infantry can withstand a blow from the main gun of a tsunami tank (but not its tread of course). The King Oni shoots laser beam from its eyes are vulnerable to infantry (yes, infantry) without its secondary ability. King Oni can finish off buildings and armored vehicles and blow them up to oblivion, but gaze that scary glowing eye of yours at a Conscript, for example, and congrat comgrades, experience how lame you can be.\nIt pretty much like rock paper scissor. In short : the unit strengths and weaknesses are enhanced, and heavily amplified. Get the right units and you will raze their base to the ground, get the wrong ones, and totaloo, your base will be razed to the ground, oh and your pride as a RTS strategist, too, if you have any.\nThe pace of battles is very fast for me, the outcome of combat is decided pretty quickly, and you better put your godlike microskillz to use, else, screw micro managing, just right click your way to victory.\nThe differences of three forces: Allies, USSR, and Japan Empire are very diversified. The Allies has Air superiority, the Japan Empire, of course, master of the sea. Finally the USSR prefers to fight on land (yes, LAND WARFARE) basically if you confront them head on, and they are not hindered by your navy or air force, then you are dead my friend; the Red army will mow you down, they loves using brute force.\nThere are lots of tatics and tricks that can be used, thanks to the special ability of some units.\nJoking aside, to be honest, I bumped onto this game when it was on sale and it was the best bargain I can get with just $5.","June 25, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With that I will say it is still quite a challange to play these campaigns so that was fun, and I also like how EA tried to keep it to the old roots of cutscenes by live actors, but Tanya....ugh..  The story is not something to take seriously with these games, but it is something I wish they took more thought into it because there is alot of holes that just fustrate me not make me laugh.\n\nThe multiplayer at this point is slim to dead sadly and they haven't patch any balances, the Allies are so over powered it is insane how good they have it with the freeze and commander choices that just makes it a breeze for them. So I do wish they did cont forth dispite the much hate in the past for it or let some other company work on the series atleast. Its not a bad game but I would wait for a really cheap deal, if your a red alert fan and see a steam deal for the campaign, you can pick it up for a good 7 to 8 hour challange in total for each faction.  Otherwise its not really that good or bad","June 30, 2014","false","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have no respect for any of the actors and as a result I'm lost in a story with no coherent reason to progress, or even exist. However, the game mechanics, the controls and the actual graphics all work very well together in perfect blend of RTS perfection. Fans of the franchise will be pleased to hear that it plays very much like Red Alert 2; skirmish mode is back, as well as online which are both incredibly addictive. Building a massive army and tipping the enemy over like a pawn is one of the most satisfying feelings in gaming. Apart from the live action garbage, and a few minor bugs I've encountered, this is a perfect gaming experience. 7 / 10","July 15, 2012","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However many people who are the fans of previous titles may dislike the changes of EA for this one, but for those who are new to the series, like myself, there should be no problems at all.\n\nBasicaly its a strategy game designed for co-op play for 3 different campaigns (and lots of skirmish gameplay ofc.) but can be just as enjoyable on singleplayer with computer as your co-commander. On interesting note all cutscenes are performed by real time actors which is quite unusual for games and there are alot of humorous elements in the game showing that it shouldn't always be taken seriously (I laughed my ♥♥♥ off soviet "leech tank") graphics are brilliant as well for the game of it's time. Therefore fully recommending this game to all strategy fans.","January 1, 2014","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reawakening a nostalgia in me from the original Red Alert games - I throughly enjoyed my time with this game which actually looks very good.  The macromangement is there with each of the unique factions having their own flavours and feels - each seemingly in a state of adequate "balanced-imbalance" that kept it interesting.  As easy as playing through most of the campaign - the fact that they included an option for Coop the campaign mode with your friends was a very nice touch.\n\nFor competitive RTS enthusiasts the deeper level of micro and meta gaming is there for those wanting to polish up their APM and skills and sink their teeth into the multiplayer.  Starting from the collision of units as you nimble side step a falling enemy zepplin with your infantry or position your formation in such a way for their special abilities to get the maximum effectiveness.  The difference between being able to play this game and being a master-class player would be at least a few hundred hours.\n\nNot to say the game doesn't have it's few drawbacks - more times than pure chance units would bug out on the map - whether they got stuck inside of terrain or refuse to function like you are instructing them to - due to pathing errors etc.  The cutscenes themselves have their cheesy charm and the actresses are beautiful but some of the over-the-top acting on cheap sets might turn some people off from it inbetween missions.\n\nI would recommend this title inspite of those issues.","February 6, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reawakening a nostalgia in me from the original Red Alert games - I throughly enjoyed my time with this game which actually looks very good.  The macromangement is there with each of the unique factions having their own flavours and feels - each seemingly in a state of adequate "balanced-imbalance" that kept it interesting.  As easy as playing through most of the campaign - the fact that they included an option for Coop the campaign mode with your friends was a very nice touch.\n\nFor competitive RTS enthusiasts the deeper level of micro and meta gaming is there for those wanting to polish up their APM and skills and sink their teeth into the multiplayer.  Starting from the collision of units as you nimble side step a falling enemy zepplin with your infantry or position your formation in such a way for their special abilities to get the maximum effectiveness.  The difference between being able to play this game and being a master-class player would be at least a few hundred hours.\n\nNot to say the game doesn't have it's few drawbacks - more times than pure chance units would bug out on the map - whether they got stuck inside of terrain or refuse to function like you are instructing them to - due to pathing errors etc.  The cutscenes themselves have their cheesy charm and the actresses are beautiful but some of the over-the-top acting on cheap sets might turn some people off from it inbetween missions.\n\nI would recommend this title inspite of those issues.","February 6, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed Red Alert 2, you will probably like this as well, because really it feels like Red Alert 2 in 3D.  A few game mechanics from RA2 are gone (for the worse), and the campaigns are pretty short. Many of the individual units aren't very useful.\n\nBUT:  This game has coop.  Coop makes a mediocre game pretty fun, and RA3 is no exception.  Playing through the 3 campaigns with a friend is entertaining (each player controls their own faction).  Coop RTS is an excellent idea and I'm dissapointed it isn't more common.  If you have a friend, both of you should buy RA3 and play coop.","January 22, 2012","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Besides the issue of co-op the only thing left is the use of sex to sell. All commandos are women, this wouldn't be bad but they are just dressed like sex objects.

The mood of the game is enjoyably goofy and nowhere is this more evident than the completely gratuitous sexy women who practically cavort for your pleasure.  The game mechanics are no less entertaining with loads of odd military units like attack dolphins, armored blimps, and football talking troopers.  Unfortunately the units aren't quite so devastatingly useful as RA2 offered, -it's a rare thing when a single, properly managed unit can land the blows to win a game, and more's the pity.  Furthermore the superpowers are a little more niggly to obtain and less brutally satisfying.\n\nThe game plays out much more methodically than RA2 or C&C3 did so that you will have to spend more attention on individual unit tactics rather than massed forces.  This makes the game less friendly to "turtle" game tactics but grants a feeling of earned superiority when you finagle the most out of your limited resources.\n\nLots of fun, in short.  :)","March 7, 2011","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reawakening a nostalgia in me from the original Red Alert games - I throughly enjoyed my time with this game which actually looks very good.  The macromangement is there with each of the unique factions having their own flavours and feels - each seemingly in a state of adequate "balanced-imbalance" that kept it interesting.  As easy as playing through most of the campaign - the fact that they included an option for Coop the campaign mode with your friends was a very nice touch.\n\nFor competitive RTS enthusiasts the deeper level of micro and meta gaming is there for those wanting to polish up their APM and skills and sink their teeth into the multiplayer.  Starting from the collision of units as you nimble side step a falling enemy zepplin with your infantry or position your formation in such a way for their special abilities to get the maximum effectiveness.  The difference between being able to play this game and being a master-class player would be at least a few hundred hours.\n\nNot to say the game doesn't have it's few drawbacks - more times than pure chance units would bug out on the map - whether they got stuck inside of terrain or refuse to function like you are instructing them to - due to pathing errors etc.  The cutscenes themselves have their cheesy charm and the actresses are beautiful but some of the over-the-top acting on cheap sets might turn some people off from it inbetween missions.\n\nI would recommend this title inspite of those issues.","February 6, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So try to ignore the reviews made by "Veterans" who are nostalgic of the old games and try to install this if you want to play multiplayer. if you're a newcomer into the series i highly reccomend C&C Red alert 3 to be the game you start with since it clears things up.","January 25","true","112.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Red Alert 3 has a few things that satisfy me:\n\nEmpire of the Rising Sun is pretty great; not as stupidly broken as GLA is considered in Generals, also has by far the most interesting units as well as the deployable buildings giving you a flexibility Allies and the Soviets do not have. They also have Gundam-like robots shooting lasers out of their eyes; seriously, that is a valid selling point of this.\n\nThe presence of secondary abilities could have went really wrong pretty easily, their implementation was spot-on in a way that it's pretty balanced and useful. Some units depend on their secondary, particularly Empire of the Rising Sun's which occupy dual roles (Sea/Sky Wings, Striker/Chopper VXs).\n\nFactions in themselves area pretty balanced to the point where it's really depending on your playstyle what faction works the best for you. In my case Empire of the Rising Sun fits me because of usefulness of dual-role units and flexibility of building placement; nothing throws your opponent more off-course than hard rushing by placing Defender turrets right outside of his base's exit.\n\nCampaign-wise you'll have a lot of fun and engaging time. I finished all campaigns in nearly 12 hours, but I played the game since when it got released in 2009, so you'll definitely spend upwards of 14 hours. Most difficult mission you'll encounter will be Empire's last mission.\n\nThe cutscenes using actual actors are another thing which worked for games like Act of War, C&C 3, Red Alert 3 and even C&C 4 (even if that game turned out to be garbage), sadly lost and really miss them.\n\nSkirmish, like in any RTS game is on-point and fighting against hard AI is a doable battle, not visibly cheating like how Command and Conquer 3's AI.\n\nI haven't had a shot at multiplayer yet, since I currently don't have anyone to play against, but expect it to be just like any C&C game.","January 18","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However many people who are the fans of previous titles may dislike the changes of EA for this one, but for those who are new to the series, like myself, there should be no problems at all.\n\nBasicaly its a strategy game designed for co-op play for 3 different campaigns (and lots of skirmish gameplay ofc.) but can be just as enjoyable on singleplayer with computer as your co-commander. On interesting note all cutscenes are performed by real time actors which is quite unusual for games and there are alot of humorous elements in the game showing that it shouldn't always be taken seriously (I laughed my ♥♥♥ off soviet "leech tank") graphics are brilliant as well for the game of it's time.

Lmao.\n\nCons:\n-Mediocre Graphics, not nearly as fancy as the videos.\n-Pretty dull story mode\n-The acting in the videos isn't too great, but what can you expect, right?\n-Costs alot when it comes to money (and time haha)... but it's worth it, in my true opinion.\n\nAll in all, when comparing the factors I look for in a game, the pros heavily outweigh the cons the way I see it. Again, this is only my opinion, so if you can immerse yourself in another World War 2 story-mode game, then good for you man, I'm glad you enjoy it.\n\n9/10 Better than minecraft on all fronts.\n\nEdit: Also, I adore the light humor sprinkled across this game, especially the Tutorial.

It was the very first Red Alert that got me hooked up on computer games. Since my childhood days, the series has changed a lot and adapted new ways presenting itself. Red Alert 3 has adapted a cartoonish look, but still holding onto the important things that made the series so good. It's not perfect, but it's fun and you can share that fun with a friend. The new co-op installment is an amazing idea brought alive. Every campaign may now be played with a friend of your choosing. Red Alert 3 as a game might not revolutionize the RTS genre, but it is worth your attention especially when not coupled with a full price tag of a new game.\n\nIn conclusion, it's not perfect but it is enjoyable, and that ultimately is what games are about. Definitely looking forward to Red Alert 4.","November 3, 2011","true","219.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
