Would you rather stand with your brothers in arms on the frontlines, directly taking the fight to the enemy? Would you prefer to sit back and support with sniper fire or perhaps manning an Abrahms tank? or maybe you'd like to take a team around and attempt a finnicky yet rewarding amphibious stealth attack? All are viable and all will help bring your team one step closer to victory, best of all, it will be you who had ultimately changed the tide of the battle.\n\nYou can easily tailor your equipment to the situation and there are many, many methods of taking care of your enemies, from rifles, grenades, pistols, MGs, mounted MGs, snipers, tanks, jeeps, C4s, impact grenades as well as a number of shotguns, smgs, rocket launchers, more rifles, body armours, silenced weapons and even apc turrets, if you get bored of one weapon, there will be a number of potential candidates to take its place.\n\nThe game does have a ranking system which releates to the in-game radio you can use to call in support from your base of operations, the higher your rank, the better support you can request, so long as you have RP to do it - a tradable resource on multiplayer servers that players obtain by capturing bases, spotting important targets such as enemy tanks and destroying opposing communications - you can request down reinforcements to help finish capturing a point, you could bombard a heavily fortified enemy position or maybe you just need that little extra edge of a friendly tank storming the opponents down.\n\nThats the general gameplay, so how are the controls? In short, very good for what it is.\nThe controls are very smooth and responsive, there is a slight slide in the game, probably to help emphasise that your soldier is quite heavy and can't just change on a whim, you can go prone and crouch which both increase your general accuracy by a significant amount, you can jump up smaller buildings, climb ladders and hop over fences to your hearts content, but that doens't mean you shouldn't be staying behind cover the second you spot the enemy force.\n\nRWR is a fine top down shooter, I love the art style, sound effects are crisp and war torn and the game itself is just great fun to play, with friends especially, I remember this one game I was playing with two amigos, we had been at this fight agaisnt the Greycollars for 2 and a half hours, It got to the point where we had to use a tactical mindset, one of us stays behind with a squad to defend the base under attack whilst the other two attempted to push the base to relieve some pressure, I love games that put you in a particular mindset, one where you really think about your next moves and RWR does that surprisingly well.\n\nModulaatio Games, I hope your game does well, in summary, Running With Rifles feels refreshing, new and most importantly, enjoyable and fun. If you're at all intrested, I'd happily recommend it, worth it's price, replayable and quite something else.","April 2, 2015","true","24.3"," 208 of 219 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","208","219","9","5"

More to the point, I've described this to friends as a combination between Cannon Fodder, General Chaos, and War Hawk.  On top of that, the game really gives a sense that you're a tiny soldier in a big war.  You won't be able to Rambo your way to victory, but instead will need to work with your team (even if they're just AI) to achieve objectives.  Speaking of the AI, it's really good and constantly being improved.  I believe the developer even had an interview somewhere about developing the AI.  It reacts to situations dynamically and can do almost everything the player can.\n\nAll of this comes together in a really fun way.  If you like pick up and play shooters but long for something a little more dynamic/deep then this is the game for you.  I find myself just enjoying watching the AI soldiers fight and it's satisfying knowing I'm a part of a larger battle.  There's really nothing else like this out there.\n\nEdit (as of June10/2014): A player experessed some concern that RWR isn't very similar to Cannon Fodder, so I want to make a note here about my comparisons to other games.  Read on.\n\nCannon Fodder: Cannon Fodder's movement feels "floaty" to me (in an arcady good way), and the mouse aiming, while less precise than RWR's, is similar.\n\nWar Hawk: Mostly because RWR is a fairly large-scale multiplayer game, but also because even in singleplayer, as I've mentioned in my review, RWR makes you feel like part of a team. That's something I felt quite strongly in War Hawk as well.\n\nGeneral Chaos: Probably the least warranted comparison, but hey, obviously I like General Chaos and wanted to make some connections.  General Chaos has been described by some as an RTS, and certainly it has tactical elements.  You control where your soldiers move and then just hold down one button to shoot (which you absolutely do NOT do in RWR) but in commando mode you control one character directly.  Again, the movement is similar and there is cover.  The battlefield is isometric, so not quite the same perspective, but close.\n\nNet War: I sincerely doubt many people played Net War, but basically it was one of the first online only shooters.  It was overhead, had team based modes and there were vehicles.  Pretty similar actually, but RWR is better.","March 13, 2014","true","114.8"," 177 of 190 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","177","190","0","17"

You are one man in a giant battle and you must work together, unified under one banner to claim victory. This makes every encounter deadly and tactical. You must hide for cover and flank your enemy. No heroes here, just those who lived and those who died. You don't feel like an uber bad ♥♥♥ when you spawn. Your just a lowly soldier. However to help you, an array of weaponry and devices. From grenades, to mortar strikes. However you cannot use any of these things at first. Starting at the rank of Private you only have access to basic equipment. You must prove yourself in battle. This is easier said then done. While the single player campaign can be enjoyed without penalties. In multiplayer, death makes you lose EXP which hinders progress towards unlocking more weapons and tactics. Without decent players to back you up. This will happen often. Which leads to constant running back and dying. Rinse repeat. While this makes RWR intense and makes you think on your feet. A random bullet is still just about enough to kill you. Players are what make and break this game. So with a group of friends this game can be ridiculous fun. On your own?

Animations are fluid and satisfying as well.    Gameplay  8  With a unique style of gameplay being offered, running with rifles sets itself apart from other games by providing a top-down war experience. You live, you die, you come back as someone else and continue the fight. A constant game of tug-of-war across multiple HUGE connected maps with hundreds of units and three armies at war. Prepare to die a lot, and love every minute of it. There are still however some drawbacks with the AI, and some minor frustrations with combat here and there. But they are still being fleshed out, and as of right now it's wonderful.    Story  N/A  No story to be found here, so far.    Multiplayer  8.5  An absolute blast with friends. Easy to pick up a game and go. Rank up together, command your own squads, and take back the territories. Watch each other be mowed down by enemy gunfire, or get tactical and flank the enemy together on a stealth mission. Play it how you will, you'll enjoy it either way.    Replayability  7.5  Worth coming back to over and over. The game could use some more diversity to keep gameplay from getting dull in the long run, but overall you'll find yourself wanting to play this one with friends every chance you get.    Overall  7.9/10  I've been playing Running with Rifles since it was first announced and released, and my they have come a long way. Years since it began they've added several new huge maps, dozens of new weapons and gameplay elements, vehicles, and a third army to fight for. If you don't pick this one up now, keep your eye on it. It's going very, very good places.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster\n\nEDIT: Some typos fixed.","October 20, 2014","true","12.4"," 189 of 226 people (84%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","84","189","226","17","11"

This game is dangerously addictive as you play to conquer a military theater of war.\n\nIn the game, you can play as three factions, the Greenbelts (Americans), the Greycollars (Germans) and the Brownpants (Russians) as common foot soldier. Now, you are not just a regular everyday action hero like in most of the big games. Here, you are as weak and as expendable as the AI you fight with and against, another regular joe, another number.\n\nIn this game, a single shot (unless you are wearing a vest) will kill you. Sure, you can keep on going with your soldier with his randomly generated name, ranging from standard names to the occassonal name such as 'Pigfat', and run with a massive streak or keep him alive for the whole mission or campaign even. It is certainly possible, but it will be difficult as it is as it is almost certain that your guy will eventully die, there is almost a certain inevitability about it. But luckily for you, you can respawn straight off the bat with another soldier with a new name.\n\nFor an indie game, RWR is actually very deep in tactics and how you play. The AI, whilst not godlike, is actually rather smart. They will keep their heads down if surpressed, move in to blow up your valuable tanks with rockets, swarm you if alone and will flank if given the oppitunity. Coupled with the fact that you are just as weak as they are, tactics are a must.\n\nIn the game, you quite literally run with rifles to different objectives in order to capture, but there is nothing to stop you from getting a sniper rifle, silenced pistol and some C4 and proceed to blow up a radio tower on the otherside of the map. There is nothing to stop you from hanging back and defending a freshly conquered site, the game offers a great freedom on how to play. You can get a squad that increases in size as you level up and lead the charge (which will probably get you killed) or go and be a lone wolf and do your own thing.\n\nAnd the details and additions to deepen the gameplay are obvious and very useful. Players of a certain rank will be able to call in support in the form of artillery strikes, airborne reforcements, dropping of cover and even deploying ground vehicles. Armories allow you to buy weapons, equipment and other useful pieces of equipment. Stashes allow you to place your valulable weapons and gear, and bonus items are scattered around, such as rare weapons or items to increase your currency count.\n\nAll in all, Running With Rifles is one of the best indie games I have played, it is hillarously fun and exciting, as well as being dangerously addictive!\n\nMy only real area of critism is the final missions of the campaign, which are the only missions that I have not enjoyed. The first involves being the only guy present and having to infiltrate an town filled with a horde of enemies. It was painfully frustrating, even in a large group. The second was just as bad, where you have to storm a castle and an arena in order to fight the only 'real' boss of the game, an tank armed with a weapon akin to the artillery strikes. A lot of it was just charging in and trying to fire a few rockets off, or trying to sneak through the defenses to get your hands on a mortar to try and kill it with that. Utterly horrible and I hope they are at the very least reworked to make your time easier, or replaced all together.\n\nI would like to see quite a few things in the game for the future, such as:\n\n- More vehicles: Sure, you have a few vehicles, jeeps, rubber boats, transport trucks, IFV/APCs, tanks and on some maps a patrol boat. But it is still left up to the infantry. I like that the infantry has a solid chance against vehicles, but I would like to see more. A light tank? An artillery vehicle? Perhaps even aircraft, that would offer a whole realm of possibilities.\n- Additional gamemodes: Whilst the campaign and multiplayer is fun, a few additional modes wouldnt hurt. Currently, the only two modes are the regular capture-the-bases missions and a handful of King-of-the-Hill style missions. A few new game modes such as a capture-the-flag, assault, or sabatage gametype would be interesting.\n- New maps/additional campaigns: If I recall correctly, modding is a thing the developers are interested in. Mods or not, a would like to see some new maps in the future or perhaps a brand new second campaign to keep things fresh.\n- Global War: This is asking for a bit much here, but if multiple theaters/campaigns are introduced along with other features, you could have an  (online) global war between the Greens, Greys, Browns and any other factions that get added (Redcoats for Brits? Bluehats for French? Whiterobes for Japanese?) and fight over the world, trying to secure each map, ultimately leading to a final battle if one side conquers most of if not all the world. (Hopefully not something horrible like the current final missions)\n\nAll in all, a brillant game worth your money. 9 out of 10 easily, only damaged by the horrible final missions that need to be addressed.","March 10, 2015","true","33.1"," 112 of 122 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","112","122","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ermilalex/recommended/270150/","Ermilalex","Ermilalex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ermilalex/","270 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has been out there for about 2 years or more, only available at Desura (where it has already got a bit of a fanbase), but now it has finally found its way to Steam. It provides players with a really unique experience by making them seemingly insignificant - in "RUNNING WITH RIFLES" you are not "the chosen one", you are just a soldier, just like the hundreds of others around you. If you think that titles like Call of Duty or Battlefield can give off the similar kind of feelings - you are horribly mistaking; in Battlefield you fight maximum of 32 enemies at a time, while in RWR there can be hundreds of them! Therefore, yes, you will be totally unable to turn the tide of a fight – nobody can defeat 200 hostiles on his own. However, don't think that player's actions don't matter at all: you can take charge of a squad, and then you'll possibly become a real threat, that you enemies won't be able to simply ignore. Your squadron will still not be able to destroy the enemy forces completely, but it will deal significant damage by blowing up their vehicles, radars and other tactical points, capturing their fortifications and slowly depleting their reinforcements.\n\nIn the single-player campaign, as well as most of the multi-player battles, the majority of both players' and opponents' teams consists of AI-controlled soldiers. Bots can do everything players can - form squads, drive cars and tanks, take cover, use knives, grenades and sniper rifles. It's worthy of note that AI is really decent, not as good as a real person, obviously, but much better than in most other games, even singleplayer ones, and especially indie-titles. It will try to flank you, use every advantage it can - trenches, artillery, vehicles. It acts pretty much like an RTS AI, which makes it smart and quite challenging to deal with.\n\nBut what makes the game for me - it's its community. Online players are very friendly, people often cooperate to achieve certain goals; more experienced players always help the newbies to fit in; low-ranked players are often OK with doing a little bit of roleplaying and executing higher-ranked ones' orders. Even the devs can be found online chatting with the community!\nSo, if you are looking for something new in Action genre, if you are tired of "standard" shooters and always-angry players constantly yelling at each other, you should totally try "RUNNING WITH RIFLES".\n\nAn update? Indeed! More so, a post-release one.\nSo, what has changed in this game over the course of months? Not much, to be fair. The community has grown a fair bit, but most of the people are still nice to each other; the AI got even smarter than it was previously; the very few issues that there were with the game crashing to desktop seem to have been resolved; the user interface has been partially reworked, and now it's somewhat more intuitive and less confusing for the new players... so, to sum up, the game process hasn't changed much since this review was originally written, which was over a year ago. Instead of adding new features, overcomplicating the game and breaking it with every update, the dev focused on tweaking and fixing, which, in my opinion, worked out perfectly. All the small problems that this game had have been fixed, and nearly all aspects of it have been improved in one way or the other. If you considered "RUNNING WITH RIFLES" interesting, but didn't want to buy an unfinished game, now it might be the time to do it; most likely, it has only become better since the last time you checked.\n\nP.S. My apologies for my bad English, which is not that bad, but still no way near perfect. It became somewhat better since the review was originally written, and yet I'm still kind of dissatisfied with the quality of the review... so, feel free to point at my mistakes if I wrote something stupid. ;)","March 14, 2014","true","14.5"," 107 of 119 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","107","119","0","4"

Troopers under fire take cover before shooting back, they can tell where gunfire comes from with extreme accuracy, and low ranking solders group together under a superior officer freely. If pushed, the A.I. can even call in Artillery strikes almost as well as a human player.\n\nAny mass infantry charge without some sort of support, even from something as small as a Humvee, is going to result in hundreds of deaths.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grumbitorium/recommended/270150/","grumbitorium","Hephaestus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grumbitorium/","147 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRunning With Rifles is a game in which you start out as a simple grunt in an army filled with hundreds of people. It's a simple looking game that can run even on my toaster. You start out as a Private in either the Greenebelts (BOOO) Graycollars (BOO YOU STINK ASWELL) or the Brownpants (YEEEEEEEEEAH!) Depending on what faction you choose when creating a new campaign, you'll be sent to one of the vast, diverse maps. Soon, if you're doing what you should be, you should get into a huge, bloody firefight trying to capture a sector, watching your comrades fall before you, and maybe even dying yourself. But don't worry, death isn't permanent. There's a lot I can say about this game, but to keep it simple I'll just list what I like, dislike, and want in the future.\n\nWhat I like:\n\n- The ranking system. Start out as a private, kill enemies and capture objectives to get XP, rank up. When you become a corporal you get a mobile radio that allows you to call in mortar salvos, which can be useful if you need to unwedge some pesky Graycollars.\n- The radio. You expend RP (resource points, which you get from trading in weapons and collectables) to call in support, such as mortar salvos, reinforcements, and eventually as you rank up even more, artillery salvos and tanks.\n- The weapons. Weapons are taken from real life (M16, AK47, LAWs, etc.) and add to the immersion of the game\n-Firefights. The firefights you get into in this game are amazing. Watching as a bridge that had nothing but Jersey barriers and abandoned cars turn into a battleground with blood spilled everywhere, corpses strewn about and wrecks of cars is just, ohhh it's so amazing.\n- Day-to-night cycle. It's not always daytime in a battle. I dunno if this happens or not, but it'd be interesting to see both sides pull back during night to recuperate and resume fighting the next day.\n-The maps. Maps are all varied, some big, entrenched sections of land, some small coastal cities, some tiny peaceful isles caught in the middle of a bloody war. My favorite has to be Black Gold Estuary\n- The graphics. Nice and simple, not too demanding. Hope they never change.\n\nRWR is a pretty great game, but there's still some things that I don't like.\n- The AI is a bit wonky while driving. Sometimes if you hop in a car with them driving they may turn back and not go to the objective, but other than that they're fine.\n- Lack of naval assault/ land assault vehicles. You get APCs that have an autocannon turret, a tank, and sometimes a Humvee, but most of the time you'll get jeeps. For naval assaults you get a rubber boat which doesn't offer much protection, and on Black Gold Estuary you get a badass patrol boat that is armored and armed to the teeth. More on these next.\n- The Squad AI is pretty bad in my opinion. If I tell them to move to a position, they should seek out the nearest cover, because most of the time I'm behind sandbags and my squad is hovering around behind me getting picked off by Graycollars.\n- 3-faction maps. ♥♥♥♥ those, they're fun the first time playing them but after awhile they get stale, boring, and frustatingly hard. Especially Power Junction. The smallest map in the entire campaign is a King of The Hill map, that's fine. But three ♥♥♥♥ing factions? On the smallest map going for one point? No, it's just too hard to enjoy.\n\nSo there's not that much wrong with the game besides wonky acting AI, and the lack of boats. There's some other things I'd like to see in the future of this game.\n\nWhat'd I'd like to see:\n- Halftracks. A mix between a tank, a troop transport, and an APC.\n- Higgins boats/ AAVs (Assault Amphibious Vehicles) , just to give landing forces a bit more protection.\n- More banter between the soldiers, it'd add to immersion.\n- Limited ammo as a toggleable feature. You don't have unlimited ammo for your rifles, and when you run out you either scavenge for weapons or you go back to the armory to resupply. I think it'd make the mobile armory more importance.\n\nOverrall a 9/10, fun game.","December 18, 2014","true","78.9"," 81 of 87 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","81","87","10","4"

And dont get me wrong, I love this game, it is by far the game I play the most, but it is also by far the most frustrating game I play as well. The greatest strength this game has is the coop game play mode, but in its current state, you WILL NOT have a play session without desyncing, lagging, and teleporting, and as such I cant really suggest anyone play it, unless you are ok with constant desync issues. Teleporting from behind cover just at the right momment to die. Trying to climb a ladder only to teleport meters away like you were never on the ladder, driving a vehicle and the controls are extremely delayed, bumping into a tree and getting desynced, trying to drop deployable cover, then for some reason you automatically drop the next cover in your inventory, when you only meant to drop one, the list goes on and on. My ping is only ever around 50 to 70, and only ever fluxuates up or down at max ten points, a very normal flux for anybody. and yet, the server is only ever sending me out 8 to 10 max and im only ever sending out 1 or less. Constant server crashes is a norm. So, despite my thumbs up, I cant honestly recomend this game unless you want to play single player, or you are ok with constant lag. something must be done if the game is ever to grow like it should. This game should be winning awards, this game should be at the top of everyones list, but yet it isnt, and the desync issues are the reason why.","May 2","true","214.0"," 86 of 97 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","86","97","9","5"

Often times I will read through the reviews before I buy the game. This is for those of you like myself! This game is undoubtedly challenging, if you want to go on a rampage and rush right at the enemy and expect to come out the other side alive, this may not be for you. However! This game will grown on you! You will constantly be raging at the sheer incompetance of your soldier as you send him running to his death. If you can live with dieing fifty times before you get the hang of the game, then this is undoubtedly the game for you. The sheer chaos and mayhame of trying to stay alive and hold on to you position as a half dozen guys are trying to flank and kill you is somewhere between rage inducing and abstractly tactical.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the game you will soon find yout self promoted through the ranks, each rank unlocks additional gear and weapons. Soon a small fire team will be following you around, this allows you to focus on more tactical decisions. Where should I put up this sandbag? How am I going to tkae that hill with the MG on top? This is a sandbox warfare game, do you want to fight where the fighting is heaviest? Would you rather sneak around behind enemy line and sabotage communications and fuel depots?\n\nIn conclusion, this game is stunningly simple, breathtakingly audacious and yet deviously difficult to master.\n\n5 of 5 Recomended to everyone and when you feel you have a hang of it stop by the multiplayer servers, there is a nice community for this game.\n\nP.S.

I am recommending this game because I feel that it does an amazing job capturing "war". WIth this game I've experienced war at it's fullest.\n\nWeapons here have a kill chance rather than taking off hp. It is possible to survive a full-auto M16 blast to the face, and then kill opponent with one shot. Such is war.\n\nI started as a Private, with a firefight lifespan of 15 to 30 seconds. In my first death ever, I was run over by our own tank because I didn't get out of it's way fast enough. By now the game says I've played ~67 hours, and died 1086 times total, which means I die on average every 3.7 minutes. What do these 3.7 minutes consist of?\n\nRunning to the combat zone and getting shot right away.\n\nRunning to the combat zone with your squad, getting pinned by sniper fire, leaving your squad to flank the enemy from the right and throwing him a fragmentation grenade.\n\nRunning to the combat zone with your squad and straight into an enemy APC, which proceeds to mow you down in a matter of seconds\n\nRunning to the combat zone, hearing APC from the distance and dual rocketing it into oblivion, before it even does anything.\n\nGetting thrown out of your own boat and knifed by enemy commandos.\n\nThrowing out an enemy driver and hijacking an enemy tank.\n\nSneaking into enemy base, hiding behind trees from big patrols and killing small patrols with silenced MP5, then destroying radar jammer, and finally calling airstrike on everyone inside.\n\nHaving an airstrike called on you, and be the only survivor from your squad, as everything around you goes up in fireworks.\n\nDoing drive-by in a jeep, going ~100 kp/h as your squaddies obliterate everyone on the sides, while you run over slow ones.\n\nRunning over to assist a wounded soldier, as enemy tank rolls into view and obliterates both of you.\n\nShielding machinegunner with riot shield while he reloads, holding back the advancing enemy until support arrives.\n\nBlocking off passages for enemy vehicles with sandbags and car wrecks.\n\nMining the road and exploding charges with enemy tank right above them. Most satisfactory.\n\nLying wounded, watching your positions get overrun with enemy hordes, and then calling an airstrike on yourself and them. Because you were dead anyway.\n\nThe list goes on forever.\n\nUPDATE:\n90% of the negative reviews on this game are written by people who have not bothered to even learn to play the game.\n\nExperience grind.\nOne of the biggest problems people currently identify is the that you need to level up in order to level up faster.\n- Well, here is the easiest way to level up without having to "git good" - use shield. When you are wearing shield, you soak up 1 exp for every kill made by friendlies close to you. That means, if you are shielding a general, who calls heavy artillery strike on 30 people - you just got 30 exp in 30 seconds, doing nothing.\n- Second easiest way is to heal people. you get ~16 exp per heal.\n- A little harder, but the most profitable and best way to level up is to be in the capture zone when an area is captured. You get lots of RP and ~50 or something exp.\n\n"Servers are empty" claims.\nMost of the players of this game are in North America.

The sand permeated the air to the point where it felt like you were eating a meal with every breath.  Our enemy was waiting for us, all around us, hiding in plain sight.  I got the distinct feeling that we were already operating at a disadvantage.  The uniforms we wore made us targets, but determining the difference between a civilian and the enemy we sought to route out left us second-guessing our every move.  They had the benefit of blending in with their surroundings, we didn't.  "I'd like to shoot whoever it was that thought it was a good idea for us to wear uniforms right now sarge!" complained the private.  Normally I'd tell the private to shut his trap, but I couldn't help but nod in agreement.  He was right and the last thing this squad needs is a drop in morale right before an inevitable fight.  Fratricide is a thing out here, and nobody wants to be shot in the back simply to save face of rank.\n\nI moved my hand to make the "GO" signal, in complete silence the squad moved out.  Quick and quiet, rifles up, we made our way through what may have once been a decent market.  The next things I remember were the screams, the smell of carbon and burning corpses, and the pain.  The private I agreed with kept one hand on my shoulder and the other pointing behind us to cover my movement, the rest of the squad forgot their training and paid the price for it.  The private and I moved through, dropping enemy targets like bad habits and burnt out cigarettes.  We found a spot that would provide some temporary cover and gave'em hell.\n\nJust as our ammo count was dropping to "fix bayonets" levels, we heard that all too familiar prop-beating that only one vehicle on the planet makes.  By the sound of it, there were three inbound, our reinforcements dropped in under a hail of gunfire.  Ma-deuce was mowing the lawn tonight, and our enemy couldn't help but play the part of the grass.  Four of the eight who dropped in landed right behind us, they were a welcome sight bearing the gifts of ammo resupplies and fresh intel on the enemy as seen from above.  We were about to be surrounded, but that didn't matter, we now had ammo for days and the reinforcements to come back hard with a vengeance, and that's just what we did...\n\n\n10/10 would slaughter the Grey Collars again.","February 1, 2015","true","8.1"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","88","53","60","40","1"

Reminescent of something like Infantry Online (although with much snappier controls) RWR pits you and the army you belong to (out of three available choices) in battle against hundreds of AI opponents or a few dozen other dudes thrown into the mix.\n\nStarting with the good parts the game features relatively good controls, a handful of nicely detailed, varied and sizable maps for you to fight in and a handful of weapons plus equipment that all have strenghts, weaknesses and important uses. Combat in general is frantic thanks to a damage system that gives every single bullet a chance to kill you and firefights with big groups of enemies and allies on screen are exciting to watch and participate in; your soldier being able to gain experience and thus access to more equipment and options like managing other soldiers or calling for artillery/air support both a nice incentive to keep playing.\n\nOnto the bad though... RWR biggest's failing is that it ain't great at anything it sets out to do and actually frustrating if you are playing either online without friends or single player against bots. The crux of this issue is both in the AI and how much control you have over the battle- the first because AI is simply not reliable enough to effectively fight or go after objectives and the latter because no matter how well you fight, you simply won't have enough to turn the tide in your favor.\n\nYou see, how many kills you get is actually not that important in RWR. What's important is having warm bodies occupying the different cap zones that let you get control of areas... and this is simply impossible for the AI to do with alarming regularity. Infantry combat against AI is so messy, mostly thanks to a spawn system that makes soldiers pop up out of thin air in the surrounding area to the battle, that long frontlines are impossible to establish and more often than not you will be fighting enemies coming from at least 3 sides; something that on more than one occassion can hold reinforcements up indefinitely unless you go take a look and in the process risk either dying or losing your original position. This, of course, means you have to start over with your effort to attack.\n\nVehicle combat too is flat out terrible with AI. This is especially true before you get the ability to control some squadmates to ride shotgun with you since combat vehicles require multiple users to operate, more often than not a driver plus a gunner. What will happen is that a lot of the time vehicles like tanks just sit back at the base, unused, and when you do take them to the battle chances are you will be woefully ineffective as non-squad AI will refuse to ride with you and do critical stuff like man the gun. It doesn't get much better when you get AI squadmates either since even if they DO man the positions and you CAN direct them to drive or attack certain things, their driving will be wobbly and erratic while their gunnery will pick odd targets in the general area you pointed at (it's not unusual for a tank to take a shot at a single enemy soldier when there's an enemy tank right in your face.) All these problems are exacerbated when you have a vehicle crew made up of pure AI, in which case the vehicle will do things like constantly go forward and reverse, endlessly bumping against walls and other obstacles while the bots make hiiiilaaaarious quips about how the vehicle must be broken.\n\nSo, if the AI is not much use, then surely you can put on your big boy pants and get things done, right? You can git gud, as a lot of the community will tell you, and win the day, right? Well... sort of. The dirty secret of RWR is that when the playerbase tells you to get good, they are in reality telling you to go grind your face off. Experience for your soldier is paramount: It lets you do everything from using more than the standard rifle, shotgun and machinegun to wearing a bulletproof vest and commanding squaddies. Without experience you are simply a chump with a gun and a lot of the more varied side objectives that the game pretends to have are simply out of reach. Commandering a tank and actually being able to drive and fire at the same? Not without a squaddie and couple hours under your belt, boy. Using C4 to destroy objectives, a lot of them otherwise tedious to take down or straight up undestroyable without you killing yourself thanks to the explosive radius of other weaponry? That would be 1000 xp points, please. Wanna sneak around? Not without grinding so you can use this silenced submachinegun you won't. Want to survive more than one bullet? Might as well let your medals stop it for you cause you ain't gonna get a bullet proof vest unless you go and capture like 10 bases and kill 500 guys, John Doe!\n\nThe grind in the game is just harsh. With the default settings, and that of the official multiplayer servers, it takes literally hours of gameplay for you to unlock gear that in other games would be pretty damn basic. Not only that, but in multiplayer progress is NOT shared between servers other than the official ones; so if you don't like or can't connect to those, and by the way the server browser doesn't show you server pings for some ungodly reason, you will be forced to meander about with the prospect of losing hours of progress if any server you like up and disappears. Then again, even with human players taking objectives is STILL kind of a crapshoot so maybe you are the lucky one if you can't play.\n\nAnything else? Yes. The game's tutorial is barebones and disjointed; items on the ground can be hard do discern and even harder to pick up without you stopping and messing with your inventory Weapons between factions are not nearly as varied as you might initially believe. The manual is poorly labeled ingame and actually located on the game's wiki so chances are you might miss it. Vehicle handling is sometimes oddly wobbly like you are controlling an inflatable and shooting/tossing grenades around corners or at something like rooftop enemies and objectives is fiddly, to say the least. There's also a lot of odd idiosyncrasies here and there, like the fact that your soldier will automatically rise from cover to shoot but not to throw grenades and almost every soldier has a med-pack despite them only being useful for downed people wearing bulletproof vests. Something extra to keep in mind is that a sizable portion of the game's community has a colossal boner for keeping some imaginary tacticool status quo, so not showing enough reverence for the game in forum posts or posting a negative review, like this one, will make a pack of hounds emerge from their hidey holes and either offer sarcastic advice or downvote your review into oblivion (check review usefulness scores if you don't believe me.)\n\nFor all the negatives though, RWR IS fun. There's still a long way to go for the game and pretty much 90% of the issues with it can be avoided if you play with a group of 3+ coordinated friends, since that will not only let you avoid a lot of the issues with AI but also give you the power needed to progress through the maps efficiently. The modding scene is also fairly alive, although for the moment mostly with simple soldier reskins/remodels, and the developers have promised to keep working hard on the title for at least a little bit longer so we might yet to see some improvements. As I mentioned in the introduction though, and at the moment, I consider 15 bucks per copy as a bit steep considering the limited value of the title. With some more work or maybe a sale that would put the game at 8 bucks a pop or so, RWR would be a solid recommendation.","April 15, 2015","false","14.8"," 164 of 238 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","164","238","7","20"

There is never a dull moment when playing either with your friends and foes in campaign and multiplayer. Playing with just the A.I. is fun AND informative as they will teach you a thing or two about trying to be a war hero (im constantly reminded each time I play).\n\nModulaatio Games have such a good eye for detail and a good set of ears for the community as well.

At first glance it may look like any other top-down shooter with endless swarms of enemies, but after experiencing a few deaths, you quickly realize that this game requires tactics and teamwork. Once your player dies, you will re-spawn as another grunt on the battlefield with tons of AI units fighting around you, and an itchy beard.\n\nMy first impressions when opening the game was that it felt reminiscent of an old console / PC classic, Army Men, but it quickly became a game where I was forced to find cover and provide suppression for the rest of my squad to advance. Instead of specific objective points, you must maintain control of certain areas of the map by fighting your way to it and defending it, which makes for an excellent gameplay dynamic that encourages you to focus on holding certain areas. Without making use of tactics, it is very easy to fall into a stalemate with both sides making no advancement whatsoever.\n\nThe AI in Running with Rifles is impressive to say the least, which pushes you to make use of tactics such as retreating when overpowered, taking cover whenever possible, and if you’re not careful, the enemy AI will create a fierce counter-attack.\n\nDuring your time playing, you can expect to use a wide range of weapons and equipment from the game’s Armory System, and drivable vehicles such as jeeps, Tanks & APCs. Most of these items are unlocked while leveling up in the game’s ranking system.\n\nMultiplayer wise there are a number of servers with upwards of 64 Players. The only issues I’ve had so far with the game is when playing in a match where all teams are in a stalemate, it can get a bit tiring. Perhaps this could be remedied either with a time counter, or some sort of more in-depth Morale system for the AI. The other issue with the game is the hit detection being a bit off on a few occasion.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of top-down shooters with a nice tactical approach, this game is worth checking out, one that has a responsive controls, smooth and great looking cartoon-y graphics, and a game that will give you that quick war fix you need from time to time. Running with Rifles also supports modding, which adds more justification of its price tag of $14.99 which provides a massive backlog of content to go through, hence longevit","April 5, 2015","true","14.8"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","42","47","2","0"

The brutal simplicity of slowly climbing the ranks combined with an effortless respawn system and an extremely clever and engaging AI.  It all works seamlessly in huge maps with battles that shift from small unit actions and probing attacks to raging armored assaults and desperate human wave charges.\n\nAs you play, you'll slowly evolve from a raw recruit to a seasoned officer, able to command other soldiers, commandeer combat vehicles and call in all sorts of tactical support and combat aids.  From armored reconnaissance in forested ridgelines to meeting engagements in confusing trench systems to nighttime covert operations out of rubber boats, you can do it all.\n\nIn a nutshell, this game is a small scale tactical paradise that feels like an endless World War.  Never fear, it's light hearted and there's lots of amusing little touches here and there that keep it engaging without feeling like too much of a cartoon.  Very highly recommended for originality, innovation, perfect Co-Op (both PvE and PvP), a fantastic AI and endless replayability.

This is not the sort of game where you can enter a battle with a gameplan. You have to stay with your team and work together to overthrow the massive opposing armies and slowly conquer the battlefield. 'Going rambo' is about as feasible as it would be in real life--you die right away--and this is done intentionally. The whole point of the game is that "The war goes on without you" and it really makes for an innovative and amazing experience in doing so.\n\nThe game features singleplayer and multiplayer, and I find multiplayer to be where this game really shines. You can communicate with other players to devise tactics to capture key points on the map, sneak behind enemy lines with a few friends to destroy enemy communications, or just lead the assault on the main front. All of this can be done on singleplayer too, and it's still enjoyable mind you, but multiplayer is definitely the strong suite of this game.\n\nMost modern games involving guns make you the most important person, but this game takes a step in the opposite direction and forces you to work with your team. Your player has no 'health bar' and the chance you will die from a bullet is based on percent. For instance, a sniper rifle bullet may have a 90% chance to kill you, whilst a submachine gun bullet might only have a 70% chance. This may sound a bit quirky at first, but it really does it's job in keeping you with your team and makes you be very cautious in any situation. You may be sneaking behind enemy lines and a random AI unit spots you and kills you in one bullet, while this may be frustrating, you can't help but think to yourself, "maybe I should've stuck with my team, I should've seen this coming." You may not be the most powerful when alone, but once you reach a certain rank you can control a "squad" of AI units which can give you the extra manpower to take an objective by yourself.\n\nThe feeling you get knowing that you mean almost nothing in a match is a new experience, and also a very interesting one. It's awesome to be able to go to the bathroom and not have to pause because you know the battle will be going on without you, so I say this game is certainly worth picking up for a humble $15.\n\nThe Bad\nBut like all games, there are a few downsides you might want to consider: The game features plenty of maps and weapons to keep you occupied for potentially hundreds of hours. You might sink 2 hours into a skirmish game and not capture a single area. In my own experience, this has both a postive and negative effect. On the postive, this can feel awesome. You go to bed after an hour of playing in an online match, only to wake up the next day to find players are still on the same map and you can pick up right where you left off! On the flip side though, this can be frustrating in single-player skirmish modes, because too long of a standstill and you may be inclined to just quit and start a different map. Multiplayer doesn't really have that problem, as players can often collaborate and coordinate to try and win and get the next map rotation.\n\nIn addition, the game devs have implemented rare weapons, which is a great idea, except for the fact that no one ever wants to use them because they are, for all extensive purposes, extremely difficult to find and dependant on RNG, which makes them feel utterly useless because once you die holding one, you're probably not getting it back. More weapon varities that can be easily obtained would be an amazing, and debatebly a neccessary update.\n\nAlso, the title is aptly named. You will be doing a lot of running. There are vehicles on each map, and you have the ability to call in your own as well, but they can be unusable by some newer players, as with the ranking system, any other player who is a higher rank than you can kick you out of the driver's seat or any other seat. The level up system is another thing that could use some tweaking because it is very harsh to new players, forcing you to use one gun until you slowly level up to unlock more.\n\nThe Verdict\nThe devs have really put time and dedication into their game. A lot of the updates just before the full release really polished up the game and showed a lot more attention-to-detail. Put a good gameplay style and great production value together and you end up getting an awesome game.\n\nThis game is definitely worth a try if it looks intriguing at all to you. If you're still having a hard time deciding if it's worth the purchase, try downloading the free demo off of the developer's site. It only has one map but it really allows you to get a feel for the flow of battle and how the game works.\n\nOverall this game is truly a fresh experience. The issues that it faces are trivial and shouldn't deter you from purchasing it. I hope this game gets more recognition because it really is fun, and most people don't even know it exists. PLEASE spread the word about this game!\n\n\n:)","October 18, 2014","true","65.5"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","38","41","0","9"

It’s dangerous!\nRunning With Rifles is a top-down, tactical shooter developed by Modulatio Games. In RWR you play as a soldier for one of the game’s three factions: Greenbelts (America), Brownpants (Russia) and the Greycollars (Germany). Most of the game’s maps see all three factions fighting each other though some of the small maps are just one on one battles.\n\nThe game’s cartoon-esque graphics are fantastic and fit really well with the game itself. They give the game the feeling that you’re playing with little toys in a sandbox. The UI is minimal, it’s big enough for you to see it and there’s all the information you need but it stays out of your way so that you can see everything on screen and effectively aim at enemies. What you see on screen also isn’t the limit of your view, if you stand still and aim off screen your view will move out slightly so you can see further (though your soldier probably won’t be on screen).\n\nWhat makes RWR so special is the fact that you play as a regular soldier. Sure, once you’ve ranked up you become a little more important, you’ll even have your own squad, but you die a lot and when you die you become a new soldier (though you keep your XP). You’re going to die a lot. Even if you’re really good at the game there’ll be time where there’s a sniper on a roof you didn’t see or a tank that somehow managed to creep up on you. Dying without the ability to put up a fight in this game can be frustrating but it’s made up for by the awesome, intense firefights or the moments where you’re behind enemy lines, picking them off one by one without them figuring out where you are.\n\nWeapons, vehicles and other equipment, while not the main focus of the game, have enough variation to remain interesting. Each faction has their own weapons and while you can unlock the weapons of the other factions by selling the weapon you want five times (enemy soldiers drop their weapons and equipment when they die) you’re going to spend most of your time using your own faction’s weapons, bought with RP (Resource Points) providing you’re a high enough rank for certain equipment. As you’d expect the factions have an assault rifle, sniper rifle, LMG etc. as well as silenced pistols and small submachine guns. Equipment ranges from frag grenades to ghillie suits as well as less exciting things such as deployable cover. Other than some small boats for specific maps, the vehicles in RWR are land vehicles. These range from common jeeps to armoured transport vehicles and tanks as well as a few others. What vehicles you’ll find (and what quantity you’ll find them in) depends on the size and location of the map. For example a small island map will have far less tanks than a large landlocked map will have.\n\nWeapons and equipment aren’t the only thing to spend your faction’s resource points on. Above a certain rank you’ll be given a radio to use and, again depending on your rank, you’ll be able to make certain requests. Low ranking soldiers can call in small airstrikes and paratroopers while those who are higher ranking can call in more advanced support units such as tank units. While I didn’t find support units overly helpful (paratroopers are usually killed while they parachute in if there are any enemies around) I did find the airstrikes particularly useful for situations where I was pinned down by enemy forces who were a safe distance away.\n\nGoing back to basics, the game has a campaign mode as well as a quick match mode, both of which are available for multiplayer. For singleplayer, both modes allow you to fully customise the difficulty as well as choose what rank you start at, something that’s particularly good if you want to play a campaign as another faction but don’t want to start with the most basic equipment again. The campaign sees you fight on several different maps (some of which only feature one enemy faction depending on the map’s size) and once you take complete control of a map you’ll have to move on to another one by driving to an extraction point that will take you to the next location. The one thing that bothered me about this portion of the game is that, at least from the Greenbelt campaign (I haven’t played the others yet), the maps split off and some maps are only connected to one other map. What this means is that you have to backtrack through a map you already control which gets rather tedious, especially if you accidentally extract to the wrong zone. It’s not a huge issue but it certainly bothered me.\n\nLastly, I’ll briefly talk about controls/gunplay. There’s not much that’s noteworthy about controls since they’re very good but there is one part of the game’s controls/gunplay which manages to be a great feature and a not so great feature at the same time. You see, in RWR you have two reticles. One large one which is shows where you’re pointing with your mouse and one tiny one which shows where your bullet will actually go when you fire. The reason you have the second one is because the maps aren’t flat and there’s also lots of cover so you need to know if you’re actually going to hit. In theory, having both reticles is fantastic. The problem with this is, the second reticle is so small (it’s also a very faint white) that it’s rather difficult to see and I died a fair few times because I was straining to see the little reticle and an enemy came up and took advantage of my distraction.\n\nVerdict\nRunning with Rifles is a truly awesome tactical shooter that's great for singleplayer and multiplayer despite its minor issues. Whether you’re looking for quick skirmishes or long battles, RWR has a hell of a lot to offer players.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","April 4","true","13.3"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","45","54","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boncottled/recommended/270150/","boncottled","Boncottled","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boncottled/","160 products in account","TL;DR - it's an incredibly fun game where you're one little dude fighting in large battles. The game lets you play pretty much any way you want, whether it be taking part in the intense frontline action, or sneaking behind the enemy and taking them out with silenced weapons. Very fun, highly recommended if you like the idea! Oh and there's multiplayer.\n\nIn RUNNING WITH RIFLES (RWR) you get dropped into the middle of a brutal and bloody war between the Greenbelts (USA), the Graycollars (Germany), and the Brownpants (Russia). You play as one soldier in an army of hundreds as you slaughter dozens of enemy soldiers, die a lot, get reincarnated each time as another soldier, and rise gradually through the ranks, battling it out across some unknown country trying to completely dominate the enemy. RWR is super fun, and the developers are friendly and dedicated to the game.\n\nThere is a campaign mode, where you go from one map to the next, completely capturing each one as you go,  before facing 2 Final Missions, in which you mop up the remainders of the enemy forces.  There are about 10 maps (which are all very well designed) to wage war across in the campaign. You can also play any of these maps as a single quick battle, although there's no guarantee that it will be over quickly. Each map can take anywhere from 20 minutes to over 5 hours  (cough moorland trenches cough)  with the frontline moving back and forth with each attack and counter-attack.\n\nIn multiplayer, you can play PvE or PvPvE, with a huge number of people (up to 64 I believe). Playing online is super fun because you can actually use proper teamwork with other players, to annihilate the enemy soldiers on the front lines or to stealthily capture a base behind the enemy lines.\n\nWhen you start playing, the basics are obvious: run with your rifle and click in the direction of enemies to shoot at them. But it's not actually that simple, because the game is fairly realistic when it comes to dying. One bullet is enough to drop you where you stand, leaving you wondering where the bullet even came from. Running straight towards the enemy holding down the left mouse button will get you killed over and over with no reward. You have to use cover, utilise mortar and artillery strikes, call in airborne reinforcements, move with your allies, set up machine gun installations, and use tanks or other vehicles to break through enemy lines.\n\nThere are lots of different weapons and items that you can use, including shotguns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, riot shields, and flares. There is something for pretty much every playstyle. Need to get behind the enemy and destroy a comms tower? Get in a camouflage suit, take a silenced sniper rifle and pistol, some C4, and you're good to go.\n\nThe game lets you change quite a few game options before you start a singleplayer game, such as friendly/enemy accuracy, starting XP and RP, etc. This basically determines the difficulty. On higher difficulties, the game is very tough, and this is when battles become hour-long stalemates, the streets and fields quickly turning into blood-soaked killing grounds, until you successfully create an advantage by changing up your tactics.\n\nOverall, if you like the idea of being an individual taking part in a large-scale war, you should definitely put this game on your wishlist. Keep in mind that you will die a lot, and it can be kind of frustrating at times, but it's always entertaining. It's also obvious that a lot of love was put into the game. Overall, just really good. Highly recommended!","October 19, 2015","true","113.1"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","35","40","8","0"

Even though this game is great, it feels as though it is an early access title as it lacks depth in several aspects, especially multiplayer, which makes the game much less replayable. After you beat the campaign for the first time, there isn't much else to do.\n\nPros:\n- Good balance for weapons between the three factions\n- Good map design and balance\n- Gameplay is all-around wonderful, and giant battles between factions are intense and fun\n- Unique and beautiful art style\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer community is empty exept for a few popular Co-op servers\n- Lack of depth in PvP compared to Co-op / Singleplayer. (My idea to fix this would be to have a mode similar to Galactic Conquest in the orginal Star Wars battlefront, where factions fight for a map, then the winning faction votes on what map to attack next, basically like a multiplayer campaign.)\n- Damage system is annoying at times, with only a certain percent chance to kill with each shot, making fights much more luck based than skill. A good way to fix this would be to have the next shot have a higher percent change to kill, increasing each time to reduce the amount of times where you shoot someone 2,000 times and then they kill you in one shot.\n\nIn conclusion, Running with Rifles is a unique, fun game, but has several problems that take away from its enjoyability. This is still one of my favorite games that I have been playing since long before it was on Steam, and is a contender for my Game of the Year for 2015, despite its many problems.","July 3, 2015","true","75.2"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","30","32","3","0"

This is no arcade game. There are no bullet sponges, one hit and you're out of it. No automatic reloading, You'll have to keep an eye on your ammo or risk running dry right when they begin an attack. The AI is not a bunch of clueless morons. They are smart little buggers, down to making a feint retreat to draw your forces into an ambush.\n\nThe maps differ very well, for example you could die in a hail of bullets in a snowed in forrest. Die in a hail of bullets in a large city. Die in a hail of bullets on a beach... Yes, you will die a lot.\nThe weapons... You have riot shields, which work well unless they put down suppresing fire and send a squad to flank you. (The AI is not stupid), rifles and sub machine guns, which work well in any situation except the one you are in, machine guns, where unless you are set up behind a rock, well... Rocket launchers, which are as usefull killing vehicles as they are sending a well dug in enemy flying. And deployable weapons... Mines, check, mounted machine guns, check, mortars, check. Supports? Artillery, armored vehicles, airborne troops, and good ol' fashioned mass infantry charges. Don't take my word for it though, download the demo and check it out. If you like it, the game is worth supporting.\n","November 9, 2014","true","16.1"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","28","29","5","1"

I kept dying, over and over and over again. I couldn't get past Private, and I had no idea why.\n\nI revisited it sometime later, and released my mistake. I had been attempting to lone-wolf it, much like something from Battlefield.\n\nThat's what makes the game interesting. If you're not with a good amount of people, you *will* die within seconds. Rather it be a stray grenade, or the enemy swarming you, you're doom is all but ensured if you go out on your own.\n\nOn a note about the enemy and allies, the AI is interesting. Sometimes it's amazing, and can complete an entire map on their own, without you doing anything. Other times, they refuse to do anything, and will walk around, or be near blind. The AI isn't bad, but it can be annoying at times.\n\nAnother thing I don't like, is how the objectives are placed along the map. They're often times placed in very odd, and useless locations. It would be fine, if the AI didn't use the objective locations to prioritize their attacks. Sure, they'll go to other places, but the main fighting force will go to the objective.\n\nOverall, the map is good enough for a buy. Playing for extended periods can get boring, mainly due to the lack of progression you'll come across in certain bases. You can easily be fighting over the same area, getting control and losing control of it, for ten to twenty minutes, or even more.","June 2, 2015","true","37.8"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","34","40","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/optionalzero/recommended/270150/","optionalzero","Opt_0™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/optionalzero/","138 products in account","I absolutely recommend this game. 15$ is a freaking steal!!! Take all the FPS's your've played and combine it with isometric view and AI numbers of all RTS's you've played now mix in any sense of love for minimalistic looking games and sprinkle all childhood memories of playing with little green army men! It's close, but still not a complete idea of RWR. FAR MORE  REAL TIME TACTICS and STRATEGY than you would expect from something that AT FIRST just looks like a top-down shooter, it's not.\n\nIt's a TACTICAL top-down shooter.\nCertainly not some one-time-fun, few hours of casual retro throw-back art style game play you'll forget about a week later: IF you've done your research and know what you may be looking for.\n[I always encourage all Gamers to also be smart consumers for ANY game, large and small alike.]\n\nIf you are looking for some truly tactical potentially long rounds of hours and hours of warfare fun then RWR is for you. Alone, with friends, against them, against massive AI numbers, with massive AI numbers, even in Persistant Online Co-op Battles! It's all fun.\nYou are not the hero, you are simply one of many. You will die often and so will they. You are a single soldier in a huge battle!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usUSHfQerpE&index=7&list=PLWzVnh9-QBKSTnMO1kjTA5bpvrWe6BYRd\n\nWhile on the field, after some time is spent being an FNG, you will find a surpising variety of Support Calls to bring you everything you need from some sandbags all the way up to a Tank, from Mortar Fire to Heavy Artillary Bombardment. And when you find youself alone just call in some ParaTroopers!  At times you will find the need to remove the enemy Radar Tower or AA position to make sure your teams support is available. And yes, this can be done with Silenced weapons and actually sneaking behind enemy lines. YES! Sneaking works, and WELL!!!\n\nFight across Large maps, with great AI numbers, and in some Online Co-op Invasion games with 30-40+ players! Things change when you play with more people. And the higher your forces numbers get with live players the enemy will send more troops to the field insuring that the battles will only get more epic. Yet have no fear, you can play in just about anyway you want when it comes to any online play. And with persistant servers it is possible to have an online profile so you can easily drop in and out of games with no worry about losing your rank. And rank is what will open up more Support Calls and Higher AI Squad Numbers. Yet make no mistake, earning this stuff will not make you a better player if you don't understand the fundimentals of intense firefights like you'll find in RWR. There is no real "camping" here in a battle, those are actual defensive postions players are holding. When it comes down to it in RWR Co-op your best resources are YOUR tactical skills, situational awareness and ability to effectively work with others in a large scale group faced with a highly dynamic situation.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFq_O-Rpalw&list=PLWzVnh9-QBKSTnMO1kjTA5bpvrWe6BYRd&index=9\nThis game is perfect for playing casually or sitting down for some long intense hours of gameplay. Drop into Online Invasion for some massive co-op play, but you don't have to finsih your map. It all gets saved on persistant servers. Before too long you'll find yourself sneaking behind enemy lines and hitting side objectives with C4 like a Stealth Ops Pro. Or out on the field helping the frontline move from street to street call in Artillary to wipe an area clear, and lead the rush to the new ground. Grab a tank and help the spearhead of the attack as you blast your way through battle, but don't get too far ahead! You're going to need all the team support you can get! No vehicle is invincable in RWR. They can have a substantial effect on flow, but only when used well with troop support. A few roof top RPGs can lay waste to any armored...anything.\n\nI can go on and on with many little details, but I suggest you try the demo if you are still uncertain. Let me say it is often not what people expect at first site, it's more!. And this game ONLY GETS BETTER WITH MORE PLAYERS! There is plenty of AI for everyone to fight! Often in the Co-op Online  there is so much heavy battle people seek each other out for assistance and to provide it. You'll really come to appreciate Cover Fire and Defensive Positions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRDiFQnBIlk&list=PLWzVnh9-QBKSTnMO1kjTA5bpvrWe6BYRd&index=8\nAt this point if you are still unsure let me say: It is NOT just some run-and-gun twin stick style shooter. There is also a demo, give it a try! Nothing like a hands on feel to get aquainted.\n\nThere is as much, if not more, warfare tactics and need for them in this game than you will find in most modern AAA games with 12v12 battles. If it is a point of price comparison: I'm certain most of us have spent more than 10$ on games that have far less to offer than RWR. It is not some chincy side-scroller retro wannabe fun. This is intense warfare! And the AI.... oh the AI! They will surprise you.\n\nIf you would like me to provide more in-depth details here on Steam about the gameplay mechanics of RWR, you can find more information in my Steam Guide. Many pictures, details and further info on actual game-play mechanics.\n*It also contains links to many other RWR Resources.\n\nFor me RWR is a "Staple game". I always come back to play some. Over the years on Steam and PC gaming there are very few games I so happily come back to for some great epic warfare. I know many of my fellow gamers also have games on their lists they rarely return to once completed, but with the intensity and emergent behaviors of the massive AI numbers it's hard to not return to PvP,or Co-op Invasion Online. You don't come for the motivation of perks, unlocks, achievements, scores, watching a little xp bar move up and sparkle at the end of a match. You'll play for THE GAMEPLAY, for the truly organic tactics and strategy; for the Warfare.\n\nYou don't play RWR to beat the game or maps. You play it for the gameplay itself and the epic ongoing battles. Your team will need you. You return because your battle buddies need you.\n\nAn Informative Graph of basic on-field data regarding RWR gameplay.\n\n15$: You'll get your money's worth.\n\n[NOTE: RWR is the first Early Access game I ever bought into, orginally on Desura, and I have never regretted it! I have 100's of hours under my belt earned in Single Player, LAN and Online Co-op before released Steam, and as of this posting I have near 300+hrs here which is entirely from playing in dedicated online co-op servers. So, I've "tested it" well. And still love it! I will always return as a video game warfare palette cleanser, a staple game, a pure game.]","March 18, 2014","true","599.7"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","5"

You can run in guns blazing or sneak behind enemy lines and snipe and die horribly every time, usually to someone throwing an impact grenade at you or just losing yourself in all the chaos of a battle. I've yet to actually play with other people, but I can imagine how fun this would be to co-op with friends.\n\nWhile a repetive nature limits my personal play time, the game has no real lacking in quality.

Running with Rifles in my opinion can easily rival battlefield, if not better.  Single-player is great, the campaigns are pretty difficult.  I'm still on the first campaign and it's been 5 hours lol.  The battles are very rewarding, that feeling after an hour struggle to capture a point is very satisfying.\n\nOne thing that might be awkward at first, but maybe not for some, is the aiming system.  When moving your cursor to aim, it kind of "pulls" on your screen.  This system is pretty neat because it lets you see farther and kill enemies that are further away and different weapons have different pull ranges.  I'm still trying to adjust to this, but it's really not too bad.\nThe movement keys are pretty simple, WASD to move and mouse to shoot, which I like.\n\nAt first this game may seem simple, which it is, you can just hop in and start killing enemies, but this game has WAYY much more depth than that.  There is a huge selection of weaponry, you can create defenses such as building crates and putting a turret behind them, calling in airstrikes or supply drops, driving convoy trucks to move your soldiers across the battle zone, defending a captured area, and much more.\n\nI know the "early access" tag will give you doubts, I know that feeling just look at some of my "early access" games.  But this Running with rifles is pretty much completed and can be enjoyed to the fullest experience.  I've read on their forums that this game is due to be released in about two months (assuming no delays), so they're pretty much just polishing this game from this point.  You pretty much have the full game now, but just be aware it can be subjected to change and other stuff.\n\nI can seriously go on for a while about how great this game is, but I'm going to end it here.  If you have a slight interest in buying this game, buy it, you will not be disappointed.  Any fan of shooters will definitely appreciate this game, hell you might even be addicted to it just like I am now :D","November 28, 2014","true","135.4"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","6"

Eduardo del Mango","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Capt_Eduardo_del_Mango/","350 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRunning With Rifles is the sequel to Cannon Fodder I've been waiting for for decades. The combat is instantly fun and intuitive, the levels are beautifully made, the scale is appropriately epic with hundreds of little army men scurrying about, and the whole experience is thoroughly immersive - it almost feels like being in the middle of a well made, large scale, top-down Arma mission.\n\n(A demo is available at http://www.modulaatio.com/runningwithrifles/?page_id=22 .)\n\nThe strategic command AI is a little vague - it seems to set a target and all the unit AIs just mob it, where a sense of greater direction might be nice. On the other hand the unit AI's tactical responses to situations seems extremely good - it uses cover in a very smart, organic way (it seeks out and moves between cover in a way that respects any potential/changing threats around it), and responds to threats very effectively (it never gets overwhelmed by targets and ignores obvious dangers - once it notices an additional threat it'll try and react to both it and its original target). The chaotic higher-level strategic AI may make you feel like you're in a 64p Ro2 pub server or something, but the very effective low-level tactical AI does such a good job responding ad-hoc to its changing circumstances that engagements and fire-fights feel convincing.\n\nIt's occasionally a little difficult to get a sense of and accommodate for terrain changes - you'll still sometimes find yourself shooting in to small hills you didn't know you were there, having difficulty visualising exactly where your LOS is blocked, or struggling to easily identify whether a terrain feature is concave or convex, but various improvements (the introduction of isolines, a shadow effect onwards from the point your LOS is blocked at, and a general flattening out of small but noticeable terrain features in maps) have made these manageable. The aesthetic and visual design is generally very appealing.\n\nVehicle AI is currently woeful and there are occasional glitches, but the game already feels extremely solid (both in operation and features) and very much like a playable product rather than a half-way there pre-production model. Multiplayer works very well with seemingly effective netcode.\n\nThe gunplay/tactical AI provide RWR with never-ending fleeting, tense, organic skirmishes. The core combat gameplay is just so much fun that RWR's open-world battlefields seem like they could offer endless fun. Also, moddable!","April 4, 2014","true","59.0"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","2"

Its a simple, yet fun open world topdown shooter chaulked full of interesting gameplay elements blended beautifully blended together"\n\nRunning with Rifels is a fresh take of an open world war game. It uses common corntrolls from modern FPS and 3rd person shooters and pairs it nicely with a reto top down perspective. The cartoony graphics are well made and bring a good feel to the overal game experience; you almost don't feel bad for spraying hate into loads of green, tan, or gray soldiers... albiet they are most likely doing that to you, which brings me to the AI. The AI in this game make thier BF4 and COD counter parts look like glorified boy scouts. As a infantry man inthe US Army, I was pleasantly shoucked at the level of ISD (individual Soldier Dicipline) seen on AI combatans. They hung to cover, bounded, and complimented good fields of fire when in groups. When I first started playing I found myself constantly catching bullets to the face by AI behind good cover. In modern shooters tough AI isn't to bad for seasoned gamers, but because of RWR's simple graphics you now have a couple hundred of these killing machines ready to rain on your parade. Very seldom will you feel like a one man army, which is a nice change of pace to most games out today, and you will have to constantly rely on friendly AI or other players if you wish to make an I'mpact on the enemy.\n\nWith all this said, there isn't anything negative that comes to mind with this game. I would love to see more elements included such as Airbourne units and even more advanced tactics used by the enemy; yet its only an early access game. With it still being in development I can only immagine the content to be added will make this an Indi sleeper Hit and provide an enhanced experience to an already great game.","January 1, 2015","true","11.9"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","4"

When I first saw this game I thought it would be a campy fun little game that was just a little distraction for a bit, I soon learnt I was wrong. When I first got this game my friend and I decided to get on a multiplayer server for a bit of fun, and after a four hour session of large scale warfare and small spec-ops raids I can say that if you want an awesome war game that brings you into the action, this is the game. There's just something special about running with twenty or so of your fellow compatriots to the enemy's ground and not knowing whether you're about to face total annihilation, completely destroy your enemy or get caught in a vicious deadlock where ten feet is a gain. Not to forget that none of this would be possible without smart friends and enemies. The A.I. is so good, it reacts to suppersion, it understands whether it is out numbered and should fall back, it knows when just rushing a target will just over power them, and it uses cover in some of the best ways I've seen an A.I. do. My only gripe with the A.I. is it at sometimes does not prioritize the dangerous target and ends up being gunned down, this is a small nit-pick though. This game is so great, it's odd how it manages to be easily picked up and played and at the the same time is actually a pretty hardcore experience that is incredible enganging.

I'd say its a top-down battlefield 2 like grindfest tug-o-war massacre. It's also a slow paced tactical side. Run and gun wont keep you alive in this game. Instead of being a straight forward shooter, things like your position and the area you can give cover to can help the team a lot. Or using calldown at the right time and place , using vehicles effictively, not nading your team or driving over them all help to win..\n\nThe only downside I can think of that for a starter it's rough as you slowly unlock some perks after hours of playing. Then again it also gives you some sense of progression.\n\nIt's simple, but fun. While not for everyone I almost got 80h on it already and thats more entertainment than many AAA titles have given me.

I've been bouncing from game to game for a while now without being able to find anything that really catches my interests.  I never expected a game like this to win me over!  It works on so many levels.\n\nThere currently are not many online servers to choose from, but this is for the best.  The game works better, pvp or co-op, if you have a large number of people, so having fewer servers means that the population on each server will be higher.  Some servers are pvp and some are pve.  I prefer co-op over pvp in any game, but the pvp in this game can be more fun than what  tf2 has to offer!\n\nThe idea of the game is very simple;  you and your team of bots and players combined must take each portion of the battlefield by having more than a certain percent of your team in that region.  There are some side objectives that help you to earn exp and "RP."  Some maps are based off of a king of the hill style conflict as well.\n\nThe weapons are set up well.  The base weapons all have a roll to fill, and you can find rare weapon drops that are a lot of fun to play with.  It can take a little while to work your way into the better weapons, but it feels like you are actually working your way up the ranks of an army!\n\nThe AI is F**KING AWESOME!  They have their moments, sure, but its so cool to be in a shoot-out with a few good bots.  The AI will hide at the bottom of a wall where you can't shoot them without exposing yourself to the rest of the army.  The AI will try to flank you around a building if it knows you are there.  The bots will use nades, rockets, tanks, APCs, anything in the game, the bots can handle -- even if they do get a little turned around when driving lol\n\nFinally, the devs.  They seem so into the game, the players and the community.  Fast to respond to the forums, and fast to make improvements.\n\nI fully support this game.  It may have its quirks, but there is nothing game changing. Everything the game tries to do, it does well.

It doesn't matter if you prefer to be a lone wolf, outflanking and ambushing the enemy or if you like to coordinate with your squadmates to break through that choke point, you'll have plenty of opportunities to do both. When I first saw it on Desura I thought the abstract art style would hinder me get really immersed into the actual game, but the opposite is true. Soon you'll find those green and grey figures beeing more of a loyal comrade or a more hated enemy than any of those high fidelity player models in other games could ever be. It's that little bit of graphic left out, that gets filled by your head automatically as you play, that really helps getting you unto the battlefield, screaming and laughing as you kill and die.\n\nRNR is a multiplayer game at heart, but it also offers a solid singleplayer experience with the AI creating a fluid flowing battlefield for you to conquer, explore and die in.

It has the feel of an actual front line fight where cover, high ground, suppressive fire and reinforcements all play a huge role.  Starting as a Private you will not have access to any special weapons or even a radio to call in fire missions or reinforcements, but with skill and experience you can still have a big influence on the battle.  Level up a bit and you can have a major impact on the battle.  It is very rewarding to be able to break an hour long stalemate by attacking in force from an unexpected direction, calling in waves of paratrooper reinforcements at a critical time to hold recently captured territory, calling in massive bombardments on huge troop formations, throwing the driver out of a tank that has been dominating the field and knifing him, destroying a communication tower behind enemy lines that prevents AI counterattacks and allows your front line to finally move forward etc.\n\nIn the beginning it can feel like all you do is die, but if the battle has turned into a stalemate, that just means it's time to put your commander hat on and try something different.  Sometimes sneaking to the back of the base and placing a single sandbag can make all the difference.  Now you've drawn attention away from the front.  Every person that comes to attack you is one less reinforcement headed to the well defended front line.  The enemy front line weakens, then breaks as your guys come swarming in to mop up: game over and a very satisfying victory.","April 14, 2015","true","122.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

It is severely undervalued and overlooked probably because of its simple appearance.\n\nIt is one of a kind game that gives very high level of satisfaction on the level of triple A game titles. The gameplay is very immersive and suitable for all types of players, and of all ages. The gameplay is not as linear as it is in big title shooter games, and truly gives you a freedom of choice in terms of approach. You will have fun regardless if you have only 15 mins of play time or all day at your disposal, I promise you this.\n\nNow, other reviews bring attention to the lack of pvp player base, claiming that the game is "dead". Well, this may be true if you are coming straight from typical pvp environment. However, playing in co-op (which is always active) with and against large number of bots in large-scale maps, will overcome any notion of pvp in your mind if there is still any of that left after playing in co-op. In other words, the game was designed that way, so that co-op outweighs pure pvp for practical reasons, so you won't even think of it.\n\nIn conclusion: RWR is going to be in my list of top 5-10 most satisfying games I've ever played. And it is certainly worthy of your attention. I would recommend it twice if I could!","April 10","true","280.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Graphics are a bonus. However, this game has a pretty unique graphic style, which I admire, since it's different than what you'd find in a lot of games. The environmental graphics compliment the style rather nicely. The vehicle graphics also suited the style, as well as the way the water was implemented and used. Not the best graphics in the world, but I'd give this area a 9/10 for creativity, uniqueness, and consistency.\n\n2) Animation:  While the animations aren't flawless, they aren't in any way bad. The animations are fairly smooth, and many of them flow together rather nicely. The animations for vaulting are what I consider the weak link here. There are occasions where the model of the infantry grab the inside of the wall they're vaulting over, near the top. Whether it's an oversight or a graphical error, I'm not sure, but just thought I'd point it out. Overall, a solid 7/10, as there is plenty of room for improvement in this area. Like I said, it doesn't mean the animations are bad, but they could be better.\n\n3) Combat:  The combat is very realistic, as it doesn't take much to kill or be killed. A few bullets is all it takes to kill someone. Aiming accurately is, however, quite challenging, since you have to know what you are doing to get a good shot. Recoil has a huge impact on aiming, just as it would in reality. The longer you fire, the bigger the recoil. Reloading is all done manually, since there is no automatic reloading like most games. This forces you to check your magazine constantly to see if you have enough ammo loaded or if you need to reload. There are vests to absorb the impact from bullets, only the amount that they protect you from depends on the quality of the vest. I'd give this a solid 9/10 for realism, and the uniqueness of the reloading system.\n\nTo summarize it up, this game is creative and unique, creating a sandbox feel all the way through. The use of the combat system makes every shot count, as well as deadly. The graphics aren't the best in the world, but they work with the style, and are well made. Multiplayer is a very fun experience (from what I hear), and is recommended for anyone who enjoyed playing the main game. I give this game an overall rating of 8.4/10, due to graphical style, creativity, combat realism, and uniqueness.","October 28, 2014","true","51.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Germany? I'm not good at guns, please forgive me.\n\nA good campaign will take you at least a few hours, and you might even lose. It's not some onesided murderfest where Joe McCool slides in on his military quad and blows everyone up, this is war. Watch in horror as enemy and friend alike get slaughtered before your very eyes with nothing you can do to stop it. It reminds me of Red Orchestra 2, which is a bad thing. Have you ever gotten PTSD that reminded you of that other time you got PTSD? I should also probably mention the level up system. They have one. Most of the ultra powerful commander abilities are locked away for a little bit to prevent that new commander I had in Battlefield 2 from ruining the entire game.\n\nI give Running With Rifles 9 review points out of 10.

Your commander gives you a signal, a command to move out and take the next base. You move out, your squadmates surrounding you, a feeling of dread growing. Suddenly, the man beside you collapses, and you hear the terrifying sound of a sniper. You dive for cover, and in the brush around you, more soldiers poke their rifles, preparing to fire. It's over. Your squad is dead, and you're surrounded. Bullets strike the boulders you're taking cover behind, the sound of gunfire everywhere. Deciding to take a risk, you poke your head out, preparing to fire.\n\nBoom, dead. Rinse and repeat. Over and over.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRunning with Rifles is a ♥♥♥♥ing blast. It's slow paced and tactical, requiring quick reflexes and thinking. You can choose how to do things - Do you want to command 20 soldiers to charge a base, or do you want to sneak around with a silenced pistol and take out some high-valued commanders? Do you snipe encoming soldiers, or blow up radio towers to disrupt communications?\n\nThere are lots of things to do, and the battles are intense. It's also a very long game, battles often lasting up to an hour, sometimes more. Despite the drawn-out battles, it doesn't really start to feel boring - You always have a goal to work towards, and if you find fighting on the front lines growing boring, you can grab a silenced pistol and sneak behind lines to take out valuable targets and blow stuff up, only to come back and find your assistance has allowed your men to push forward and take the zone.\n\nThe game also has a very robust multiplayer system. Holy crap, multiplayer is fun. There's co-op, competitive, etc. This game is jam-packed with replayability.

I had attempted to call for reinforcements but my bloody radio was jammed. In the middle I hid with my trusty M16 picking off lone stragglers attemping to take me on even though I had all of the cover to myself. It wasn't long after that I was getting assaulted by around 20 people on each side, I knew the end was near but I couldn't just give up without a fight. The Greencollars needed this trench as the battle was going on against the waves of Greypant infantry forcing themselves upon the airport. The rest of my Batallion was holding at the airport while I was taking all of the enemies on at the Center trench. Back towards the battlefield the 2 forces fighting for the middle trench were just sending waves upon waves of infantry and taking each other out, but when the time had come that the Greypants were assaulting me, I turned around and picked of 2 of them who weren't smart enough to stay behind cover. I reloaded and threw one of my impact grenades and got a lucky kill and forced them out of cover. I clicked and clicked and took out more of them, before I knew it they were all dead and the Russians had came in for a fight, luckily I had 3 brave souls who came into the fight and held the trench with me. Body after body the Russians carelessly came in trying to kill us, but it wasnt' long before a nade came in and killed 2 of my lads, it was me and Corporal Reid holding the trench from hordes of enemies, when the time had come Reid got killed by a sniper, I was by myself all again.

I believe that this is the future of RPG/FPS games. Multiplayer is very fun as well as singleplayer, with a lot to do both strategic wise and objective wise. I've started a few campaigns and I must say all of them have been totally unique - some have very long and bloody battles, which are hard to win, while other games, the battles have been quick, but brutal. The game offers a good variety of large maps and weapons, a good ranking system and (in my opinion) a very good AI to play against.\n\nI'm very pleased to see that this game actually made it through the Steam Early Access, and not be one of those money-sucking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games and developers who just want money, and never actually release the full game.\n\nPros:\n\n- Awesome strategic options on the battlefield\n- Pretty graphics (I quite enjoy cartoon-like graphics)\n- A very solid AI\n- Unique battles for every mission or game\n- Easy to learn\n- Large maps with lots to do\n- Good amount of maps\n- Hard working developers, who are not greedy\n\nCons:\n\n-Joining your friend who's in a game (This really needs to improve)\n- Server hosting - port forwarding - very easy, but I can't port forward my router\n\nAll in all, I think this game is brilliant and certainly is worth the money. IF they just fix the connectivity issues and server hosting issues, then I believe it will be perfect!

However its supported and ready for servers and the devs have a server of their own up known as SAS.\n\nIts a fast paced action game from a top down camera angel using your mouse to pan around in a limited space, like a field of view. Climb obstacles drives vehicles, and plan attacks properly or expect a quick punishment as it should be. Bullets effect your character randomly so that means some might drop you dead like a headshot should or others you may survive from giving you just a few seconds to escape. Don't camp the ai to long or expect to be ambushed, unless thats what you intended! Play how you want in a battle field capture and move manor, but set in  a open world where your welcome to travel around. So much to be said like the end battles with the more powerful ai before winning over a zone.

The battle can be fought on multiple levels, with climbable buildings adding another dimension to the game.

It's even fun playing single player with hundreds of AI soldiers. The AI is one of best ones I have seen in any game; they create their own strategies and try to outflank your team instead of just running and gunning. You have your own rank in both singleplayer and for each multiplayer server there is, and progressing higher allows you to carry better equipment, use airstrikes and reinforcements, and have a bigger squad. The devs both are very open minded and always listen to what the community has to say about the game and very friendly (even giving me a key after Desura didn't give me one).\n\nOverall, it's one of the best indie games and top-down shooters out there and it's a definite must-have.","March 14, 2014","true","10.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I've seen this game grow and evolve wonderfully in the last 3 years. Back then proning was recently implemented, the game had 3 weapons besides the knife and the grenades (M240, MP5SD and G36), no multiplayer and it was still one of the most entertaining games I've ever played.\n\nWhat we got in our hands here right now is a wonderful online or single-player top-down military shooter, encompassing a wide arsenal of weapons and vehicles, even some naval combat. Where the game *really* shines, though, is the urban combat. You can climb on top of any roof, take cover behind any wall, command your squad members to take any position, drive anywhere, cover any angle. As you progress through the game you gain XP, calculated using your kills and deaths and you gain ranks. With higher ranks you have access to a wider arsenal, become able to command more squad members and call in fire support, ranging from a simple mortar round to a full on artillery barrage or paratroopers. You can even ask the Command to drop a bloody tank.\n\nWith each player and his/her squad members, you witness gorgeous battles containing hundreds of soldiers, millions of rounds and dozens of vehicles and this happens on a huge map with many fronts.\n\nBuy this ♥♥♥♥ing game. It's the best 10$ you'll ever spend.\nYou can find me in-game mostly on the SAS UK server under the name of "Bishop".","September 5, 2014","true","51.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Large battles in the cityscape, with squads of soldiers following or leading. The feeling of being a small part in an army, and how to distict oneself from the common soldier. Choose weaponry and scavenge from the battlefield to repurpose oneself. Absolute carnage and tactical play in a deceptively just chaotic battlefield. Freedom to undertake self-created objectives to aid the frontlines. Death ever-present staring at you in the face, waiting for you to dash in front of that suppresive fire.This was not just an arcade game; this was a gem I needed to get.\n\nSo I did.\n\nThe great variety of maps and options are an integral part of the fun. Choose to start as a lowly private or a colonel. Create a skirmish between 150 guys to a warzone with over a thousand. Have the option to throw in a third side in the conflict.\n\nThe game is pretty balanced, too. Grenades are aplenty in this game, but don't feel overpowered. Machine guns are appropriately less accurate than the common assault rifle. AI isn't too bad, either, and are fun to play with. Vehicles make great support in fighting, but can't one-man-army its way into enemy lines without expecting to blow up first.\n\nOne of the best games I've ever bought on the Steam store.

WE'RE LIKE BEST FRIENDS, LITERALLY. I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG BUT IT'S TRUE. B^) So I am changing my review to 'positive' so that all people, no matter the orientation of the live eel in their butt, will have access to TRUTH and quality opinions of a subjective nature. I'm sorry, America. Kirk out.\n\nEverybody is saying how Fun this game is, but is it really? To get to the truth I will tackle popular assumptions with logic and reason.\n\n\n"It's like a top-down Battlefield™."\n\nThis argument looks promising at first but unfortunately there isn't enough jetrape and amateur map design in this game for it to be anywhere near the level of AAA, professionally designed Fun found in Battlefield™. Besides, if this were anything like Battlefield™ then it would have a convoluted interface and launch from your web browser.\n\nRWR's not looking so Fun now, is it?\n\nIt gets worse...\n\n\n\n"The AI is impressive."\n\nOver-compensating for something, RWR devs? If making a reasonable Artificial Intelligence to complement the solo and multiplayer gamemodes is so important, then how come no other developers do it?\n\nIf this game is as good as its reputation then why are they only asking for $10? Arma 3 launched with just one jet and it's a completely Fun game for $60. Something is amiss.\n\n\n\n"It's a unique shooter."\n\nRunning with Rifles definitely stands out from the competition due to its lack of modern conventions which are necessary for a Fun game.\n\nFeatures that would make this game more Fun are: regenerating health, corridor maps, grenade spam, overpowered endgame unlocks, a progressive increase in feelings of hopelessness with every update that removes the good while introducing bad design - just to name a few.\n\n\n\n"The developers are quick to respond to questions and show a sincere concern for customer satisfaction."\n\nIt all makes sense now why so many Fun features aren't included to begin with. The developers are too busy interacting with the paying community and developing the game toward their satisfaction.\n\nDo the developers even really care about Fun? If so then why the utter silence on Oculus Rift support?\n\n\n\n"It's easy to make most user mods with just a free voxel program and text editor."\n\nThis might sound exciting at first, but notice the implications. Why would a Fun game need mod support?\n\nWhat the developers here are really asking for is some sort of industry-wide anarchy. If just anybody can decide what is Fun then there is no more objective standard for what constitutes Fun. Your neighbor could one day decide that 'killing you' is Fun. This isn't a game anymore.\n\n\n\nWhat we end up with here is a lot of truth but a significant lack of Fun. If I was developing this game I would've made it more feature-rich with a pretentious, politically motivated story, total player freedom from balanced gameplay, a liberal use of personal amibition to prove how wrong my family is about my lifestyle, and plenty of broken promises with half-♥♥♥♥♥ implementation of staple features.\n\nDon't buy this if you're looking for a Fun game. :-\","March 16, 2014","true","180.5"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","16","25","7","27"

Friendly AI will hop into a tank, crash it repeatedly into the side of a house, run 3 friendlies over, and then abandon the tank in enemy territory. This means a LOT, because vehicles are overpowered. Once you can control a tank or APC, you can almost roll up a whole map by yourself if you have infantry support. Likewise, when an enemy tank or APC shows up, they mow down every friendly in sight and undo all your hard work. YOUR hard work, because if an enemy checkpoint has been taken over it is almost certain that you are the one who did it.\n\nEven if I set up an objective I captured by myself so that the friendly AI can defend it, they still screw it up. One time I had machine-gun emplacements set up so that the AI could hold off the enemy. The friendly AI used them - as cover. They hid behind the machine guns, which were pointed in the right direction, and shot over them using rifles.\n\nThe Friendly commander, who sets objectives for the AI, picks the worst possible places to attack where you're forced to fight two opposing armies at the same time. This is meaningful, because all of the friendly troops that aren't directly under your control run off to where the Friendly AI commander sends them, leaving you with no support at all.\n\nThe enemy spawning is too frequent and too close to the action. As people have mentioned before, you can sit on top of a house with a sniper rifle and take out 150 enemy soldiers by yourself with a K/D ratio of 20, and it won't make a lick of difference because your allies can't or won't take ground, and killing all those men doesn't buy you enough time to take an objective yourself. And taking objectives is the only thing that matters in RwR.\n\nIt is a good looking game. The individual skirmishes, when you're not worrying about winning a level and just shooting it out with the enemy, are fun. I sank quite a few hours into it (don't look at my time on here - it's not accurate).\n\nBut ultimately I binned the game because it just doesn't go anywhere. It's a pointless grind.","August 30, 2015","false","0.6"," 54 of 97 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","54","97","3","0"

Your objective is to capture enemy points by defeating and maintaining a strong military presence over strategic areas of your world map. Your army contains hundreds of little army guys ready to eliminate the opposing force. You can supply yourself by calling in air raids, artillery, extra squad mates, and vehicles, using points you earn through base captures and kills. Already a highly frenetic game, with text bubbles popping up from fellow soldiers, snipers taking aim, and a massive incursion heading towards a freshly captured base, you're going to have your hands full.\n\nExperience:\n\nSurrounded by fellow men-at-arms, I feel strength. A passion for justice burns through my veins as I begin making my way to the target reticle on my screen. As I storm over a small wall and begin to engage enemy forces, I soon realize that reloading is a fairly important thing to do. Also, crouching. Going prone isn't a bad idea either. Hell, maybe even picking up a different weapon for giggles! Wait, no pause?! WTF! Okay, I got this, I'll just go check the controls real quick! But nay, I am struck down in a hail of grenades and gunfire.\n\nRound 2: Friendly tank is storming the road and heading to engage enemy forces in a nearby outpost. I pop a shot into the tank to alert them that I would like to help. That's a lie. I pop a shot into the tank because I don't know what the hell I'm doing. Regardless, I climb into the gunners seat and begin to rain sweet revenge upon those Gray ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. 5 kills, then 9, then... um, my driver decides he would rather stop and smoke a doobie. Communist prick. I ditch the tank to find myself balls deep in enemy territory. Having mastered the "C" key at this point, I make my way to the nearest building and begin crouching and reloading as if I'm twerking with an automatic weapon. The enemy flanks, descends upon my position, and causes me to compromise my "bombastic twerking" and retreat. I die yet again in a hail of bullets, and I am content.\n\nReview:\n\nI enjoy this game immensely. The action is frenetic and fast-paced, the maps are very much open to whatever tactic you deem intelligent. The enemy A.I. is pretty responsive and will deliver a swift kick to your ♥♥♥♥ fairly easily if you're not paying attention. The sound is pretty on pace with what I would expect out of such a game. I actually thought they did a great job with variation between the weapon sounds. The graphics are very much of the arcade style, but with a more mature flavor. There will be blood. Controls are easy to use after you've acclimated yourself to what does what. I do understand that this game is still in development, and I understand the developer will be adding more features and taking feedback as they move forward. I would rate this game an 8 out of 10. I would recommend this game to any and all. Very pleased to support this product and can't wait to see it finished.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nI'm sure a controls tutorial has been brought up, but I personally think it would be helpful. A sort of Boot Camp, if you will. I enjoy the detail of the map, and the lack of clutter with the overall interface. I would enjoy having the option to have a transparent mini version of the map available on screen. Placement can be modified by the user. Again, great product and very happy I was able to support you guys in any way.","March 20, 2014","true","23.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

And quickly catch a stray bullet to the face.\n\nWell done you've had your first death in Running with Rifles, there's a reason they teach you not to run with scissors and rifles are no exception. But thankfully at the start death is not really a detriment, with the push of a button you're spawned back to the nearest spawn point and can run off to get killed again but hopefully you'll take some with you and learn to use the environment as cover.\n\nAs you kill, be killed, and rank up you'll get access to new toys and get the ability to command your own AI squad, starting with your own little private who follows you around and tries their best to help you as they go through the same process as you did. You won't get the same private sadly, once he dies you just nick another one from some other AI's squad. Eventually you'll be able to lead the charge and take over enemy positions with you and your squad, along with generous helpings of parabourne troops and mortar strikes.\n\nI'm a bit dissappointed that is awesome game hasn't had any promotions on the Steam page, it was only by chance did I see it in the early access page. This is a definitely fun game to play and the more people we get on the multiplayer servers the better.","August 10, 2014","true","48.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scorpionsVise/recommended/270150/","scorpionsVise","Laika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scorpionsVise/","238 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR Buy it.\n\nFor those who want to read, continue to read.\nHonestly, this is one of the VERY few early access games you would want to buy, and would be worth your money (and as the devs have stated, it's been in 'early access' for ~2+ years). For being early access though, there's a lot of content to be had, and nothing feels really 'early' about it.\n\nCore gameplay seems simple at first, but when you delve into it, things can get complicated. Cover is a neccessary thing, and you can't just run into a battle willy nilly hoping to get some kills; you will die quickly and very hard. Strategy is a key in this game, somewhat like Arma, but not as hardcore as you would get to strategize in Arma. Listening to your team mates and knowing your surroundings is something to keep in mind too, you may be mowing down the enemy on one front, but one swift flank from the side will bring you crashing down.\n\nTeamwork is a factor as well, and if a team doesn't communicate or plan, let's just say they won't be the one having a dinner party. In fact, it's more helpful if the team takes a step back, looks at the map, and plans what front they should be attacking, or if they should divide their team in half, or abandon one front for a charge on another that would be more helpful. There's an overall objective indicator that you COULD follow, but from playing in Invasion mode, it works out better (if your team is good at listening to each other and strategizing) if you ignore the main objective indicator, and figure out what will bring you an easier victory than what the game says to do.\n\nAll the weapons are pretty good to use, there's specifics on the RWR handbook for their technical info, but you should be able to figure out what'll work best for you just from trial and error. Some situations though might be better for, say, a grenade launcher to launch over an enemy wall and tear down their defenses. Or it might just be safer in a situation to sit bnack from afar with a sniper rifle, and pick off enemies in cover one by one.\n\nThe vehicles are fun to use, and it's always satisfying to blow up a ton of enemies that are all bunched together with a tank. The physics for driving are a little wonky though, and could be better implemented; I find it difficult sometimes to control a jeep as I'm doing 85 through a warzone, and just end up crashing into a wall.\n\nYou can utilize tactical aid (or whatever the game wants to call it, I just call it that because it's similar to World in Conflict's tactical aid) once you level up and get a radio. It's incredibly useful when there's a ton of enemies charging at you, or defending, and you just simply call in some mortar or artillery support, and they all just die at once. You can even call in a tank if you want, which could be great if a map doesn't have a spawn for a tank (Haven't tried doing so myself, it might just deny you doing that if it doesn't have a spawn, I'm not sure)\n\nYou can earn better weapons through leveling up, which is done by just simply killing enemies, completing objectives, etc. Some weapons are only usable temporarily, and you can only use them up until you die, in which case you'll have to buy another one (Not true for any other mode besides Invasion I think, in which ALL the weapons are unlocked all the time). These weapons are unlocked through picking up briefcases dropped from enemies on the battlefield. Speaking of which, you also have to make 'money', aka RP, in order to call in tactical aids or buy equipment or weapons. This can be done in the same fashion as XP, except for killing. The best way to make RP, though, is from picking up blue items dropped from enemies. They range from Gameboy spoofs to beer bottles, and once delivered to your team's armory, you'll earn the RP stated the item would give you.\n\nHowever, bringing RP up brings in a small problem I have: it's kinda hard to obtain RP in my opinion, at least if you want to be using tactical aids or non-permanent weapons. Tactical aids can cost a LOT of RP, and for some it can be hard to pick up blue items dropped by enemies. Such as me, for example; I play as a sniper a lot, and of course I'm shooting from afar, but most of my comrades get to the items first before I can, so I lose out. I've not really used any tactical aid beyond a simple mortar shot, because it's simply not cost effective. What's worse is that the better equipment you have on you, the more RP you lose upon respawning. If I'm using, say, a grenade launcher, I lose 18 RP every time I respawn. With how often you can die in this game, those numbers really start to add up. They oughta make an easier way to make RP in Invasion, or at least cheapen the tactical aids. That's just my little problem, however, and it might not be a problem for you, especially if you don't play Invasion, I don't know if it's as much of an issue in any other modes.\n\nAnother issue is that once you unlock all the permanent weapons from the armory, there isn't much at the moment to be unlocked as you progress further. The only thing I've noticed is that my maximum squad size capacity goes up, and that's not all that helpful if the squad AI are dumbs as rocks. They might have planned for more in the future in rewards for leveling up, but for now all that's to be had in later levels is the ability to have more squad mates and kick lower ranks than you out of a vehicle.\n\nThe last issue I can think of is, it might just be specific to one server, but there are major desync issues going on. This may, and most likely IS not happening on other servers, but I've only played on one so I can't say for sure. The server might just not be able to handle the player load, or the AI load. However, once you have to resync, the game can really screw you over. I've had times where my character would just have a mind of it's own, running into a wall of enemies that'll just spray me down, or running into the other direction, having to waste my time running back. At one point the game even straight up teleported me into a grenade, getting me killed! Did  I mention the desync teleports you sometimes too? I can be on one side of a wall for a second, the next I can be on the other side despite there being no possible way to do so near me.\n\nWith all these positives and negatives listed, I want to finally say, once again, the game is worth it. You might not have any of the problems that I've had, but even if you do, the game is great fun and I haven't had this much fun in a long while. The community is great too, friendly, not full of idiots,, it could even be compared to the awesome community of Natural Selection 2. The developers are really interactive with the community as well, posting in the Steam forums, their own forums, listening to critiques or things players think could be improved or changed. Running With Rifles might seem like a simple war game at first, but it is so much more than that. There have been many times where I'd load it up, thinking I'd play for an hour or two, but before I know it, 5 hours have already passed. The game has been out for a long while, and it could possibly be close to getting out of early access, but the future for Running With Rifles is a bright one if all of this continues. And for $10. it is a gigantic steal.","March 16, 2014","true","26.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I was looking for a new game to play with my group and found my way back here. What a gem! Even as an early access, I find it extremely enjoyable and multiplayer makes it even better. On my first play, I looked at the clock and 4 hours had gone by...\n\nAt first glance, it may look like a pretty straight forward arcade game but that lasts only until you try to take your first/second objective. The AI is not  simply defeated, you must work together with friends and be prepared to die. Alot. However, death in this game doesn't signify a broken game, it adds to the feeling that you are just a cog in this grinder. Your actions have an effect on the battle but you cannot win as a lone solider.\n\nThe ONLY three negatives I found, and they're more improvement suggestions:\n\n1. Vehicle have multiple slots to occupy, I usually take the gunner position and have an AI lackey drive. You control him by right clicking a waypoint onto the screen. Great. Now, if this F*$^er could just find his way around the only rock in the field to get there, that would be great. I see what they tried, and its almost there but it needs review to beef up the AI driver's capability/skill to avoid getting stuck on environmental objects as well as other vehicles. I would allow some understanding if it were a tight fit but the only rock on the screen? Come on now.\n\n2. As it stands now, you have to setup port forwarding to host a game.\n\n3. When you die, only the basics of your loadout are saved. That being said, I believe I see the creative decision that was made here in that the extras that you purchase into the loadout are "special items" and the opportunity exists to exploit this by purchasing, running to your friend and getting shot and repeating to get special items without cost. What is a pain is that when I play a difficult match, I purchase a mortar and get tagged before I reach to contested area. I get it. Difficulty. It's the only time in the game where I went "FU&*!!!!" instead of thinking "I was flanked and murked, awesome!" It possible I'm just doing it wrong.\n\nPROS:\n\n- AI will maneuver on you. In force. I love it.\n- Immersion into a large scale conflict.\n- Simplicity of controls\n- A few weapons, the pro is that they are each part of a strategy and not cookie-cutter weapons with no, or minute, difference.\n- The AI squad: simple control, it grows with rank, and helps ALOT. I would like to see a GUI that allows me to select some loadouts or particular classes of individuals in the squad. So if, for my first squadmate, I need a machine gunner instead of a rifleman to compliment my current playstyle/strategy, i simply pull up the menu and viola. Maybe use a request system where the GUI detects what AI are in range and my selection creates a "vacancy" that will be filled when you get within range of that particualr type of unit?\n- Support Assets: These make a HUGE difference in conflicts. You can call in mortars on the radio and its possible to gain the initiative. If you don't seize the window of initiative however, the AI will return, in force, and the struggle continues. Love it.\n- Vehicle health: Vehicles are not invincible but can change the tide of battle. When done with caution, you can mow down loads of enemy. If you drive into a hornets nest.... good luck. Its a solid balance of firepower and vehicle health.\n\n\n9/10","March 12, 2015","true","18.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

One hour later the map was evenly split we were pushing them back. A counter attack put us on the back foot again, 2 hours of intense firefight would follow before a victor would emerge. To put a long story short. running with rifles is a top down shooter game which captures the essence of war and forces you to think tactically. It is not a game that ends fast but time will fly literally as you are engrossed in a all out war. Running with rifles doesn't have a story mode but instead has RPG elements such as leveling up which unlocks different weapons, radio calls to HQ and increases your squad size which you can control. You level up by killing and capturing bases and you level down by dying, simple. Single player is good for learning the ropes but online multiplayer is where this game shines, with up to 60 human players plus AI the battles are never dull, i've also found the online community very friendly and competitive. The online modes are PvP PvE PvPvE. There are currently 3 factions in the game Greenbelts, Greycollars and Brownpants and you can find all three factions fighting each other in one map. The graphics leave something to be desired but the style suits the game and is polished nicely. The sounds are probably the only major issue I have with the game as they become repetitive and it would be nice to hear some voices e.g. soldiers yelling out.\n\nIf you're not sure i would recommend trying the demo first to see if it appeals to you.\n\n8/10\n\nWarning: You Will Die","November 11, 2014","true","22.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This time I picked an early access indie game called Running With Rifles and believe me I didn’t think , the time I chose it for a review that this game will be that good and so fun playing.\n\nLet’s first start by explaining you what this game is all about. In RWR you join the game as a simple soldier…ohhh yes you heard me well as a simple soldier….no hero, no veteran soldier or something like that…you are just another soldier sent to serve his country and the simple goal of this game is to win the battle and follow the commands of your superior officers. RWR is a tactical shooter game with open-world elements and that is not it. The game offers so many stuff with a lot more to come and imagine that the game is still an Early Access title.\n\nBut first things first, let me tell you what I loved about the game. I loved so match the fact that the game features an open-world aspect. Even as a simple soldier you can discover an entire map via campaign or multiplayer giving you the opportunity to find new ways to win your opponent and kill enemy soldiers. Also, the game features hundreds of locations to explore from towns to trenches and snowy valleys all available for the player to fight his way to victory! Another thing I loved about the game is that it includes dozens of different weapons to choose from cover items vehicles you can use from tanks to all kinds of killing machines that will help you reach your goal! Also, I think it is really important to mention that the graphics look really beautiful as well, the sound and the music is really great and it sure helps the title be more appealing to the player. Furthermore, it should really be mentioned that in the game you don’t stay forever a soldier.\n\n\nAs you play, you will have the chance to be promoted to higher ranks and gain higher command to soldiers and equipment and this is a feature of the game that it is really one of my favorite. Also, something that I haven’t mention earlier is that you can use your environment and surrounding to your advantage...from great covers to hide you and your squad to abandoned buildings and other things that make the game even more fun to play. Finally, there are even more features to come in this game from boss battles to more maps and achievements.\n\n\nThe game is really amazing and it is worth checking out for sure, I loved the freedom that this game gives the player and the fact that you begin as just a soldier and you can achieve higher ranks and do so many things. One last advice: it is really easy to die in this game so don’t underestimate the AI. Hope you will have as much fun playing the game as I did.\n\n\nVerdict:\n8/10\n\nhttp://www.grabthegames.com/review-running-with-rifles.html","November 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It might sound awesome to drive intoo enemies while shooting like crazy, but you just get instantly killed in the car by a couple of shots from even the weakest of weapons.\n\nThe populated servers often have experienced people helping the new players so that is a good thing!\n\nSadly though, i noticed that after three hours cut up intoo two game sessions i quickly got bored. It felt like i did the exact same thing i was doing three hours earlier in the game. I had no motivation to keep playing since the system to get higher ranking equipment + guns felt really weird and felt like it took too long to even get anything interesting at all. To be frank this feels like a free web browser game, it's perfect to burn time with but not something you want to play for longer sessions.\n\nLong story short:Prepare yourself for some really repetetive gameplay but if you can see past that, you will definitely experience some crazy fun battles!\n\nIt's a shame to say it since i wanted this game to be good but i sadly can't recommend it.

This game answers it greatly! It has some very good gameplay, a variety of vehicles that you can use and drive, including sentry towers like TOW and MG on tripods. Also real time elements, like building covers, and towers. Maps are quite big, and weel made, that one while you are fighting in town, and than in the forests or deserts. There are also pretty good RPG elements. You have a backpack, whoch you can manage just like you want, in real time, even in the middle of a gun fight! You can also store stolen weapons in Storage, or buy one with RP points, gained by doing objectives, bringing rare items to Armory (thing like Gamegirls, cigarrets, lighters, etc) and buy new items from Armory too. There is a lot of weapons, but almost all of them are dropped from enemies, but are very rare. Few of the weapons are in the Armory, but it takes some time until you can afford them. You need to be a certain Level with gained XPs, and than buy them for RP points, eachtime you die (unless you store them, of course), however, after you die, you will loose some RP pints, like 5 or so, and for like 40 you can buy one of those weapons, so be carefull! The only thing i hate in this game, are servers and your rank. There is only like 1 server, but however with +-50 players online every time, and a lot of points. But your rank only stays on THAT server, not on any elses. Anyway, i would recomend this game to anyone who like shooters, RPGs, GTA style games for vehicles, and strategies.

Why? Because it's as imple as it seems, but a trailer or a gameplay video are unable to show you full immersiviness and depth of combat simulation. Running with Rifles have a very deep cover-based combat system mended with really great "presistance feeling", achievable trough really great balance between player and NPCs. While playing this game  you should always keep in mind, that even if you're smarter than scripted NPC, even if you can shoot more accurate due to better understanding of recoil mechanisms, still you are equal to those NPCs fighting for you and against you, and next bullet, fired randomly from an NPC's rifle in a firefight 300-500m away from you, will remind you about that. Even if you know that campaign are only 8-missions-long (at the moment of creating this review), you shouldn't be afraid of that. Running with Rifles offers you a great replayability via adding absolutely intensive firefight, coupled with great variety of tactical solutions to execute. Haven't i mentioned that this game and it' developers are looking high towards community integration? Yeah, they does. Mods are already implemented, developers are providing community with an SDK-tools, etc. And as the time goes on, those features will only expand, as well as new-ones will be implemeted. Same goes for mod-support: more API are on the way to community mod-makers. You wanna deep cover-based tactic actions without those casual console-like mart-covers making you invincible? Try this game. Wanna relax after long day in your comfortable chair, playing some madness-creating messy shooter without any need to get into details?

Remember when you were a kid and set up those huge battle scenes with the little plastic army men? Well those battles aren't just limited to your imagination anymore.\n\n\nPROS:\nVariety of maps with different landscapes, sizes, and objectives which flow together to form one giant world map.\nAI is phenominal. The AI runs the battle, issuing orders, calling for reinforcements and artillery strikes.\nBattles are large and intense consisting of ground troops, transport vehicles, boats, tanks and APCs\nTroops utilize military tactics well. (Using cover, flanking, using grenades)\nLarge variety of weapons to choose from that are well balanced between all 3 factions.\nThe freedom to follow the AI battle, or take a squad of men to take your own objectives, or do stealth missions to support your team.\nAbility to run squad of troops with intuitive command system\nCONS:\nNo real tutorial. The game just plops you in the world without telling you about all the amazing features it has.\nThe top down view which extends in all directions can take a while to get used to. Can be difficult to see elevation.\nThe uniform colors of the 3 factions can be difficult to discern at times. Particularly brown and grey.\nNo health system. Instead each bullet has a certain percentage of chance to kill which varies by weapon.\nThe battles in this game will suck you in, frustrate you as you come against fierce combatants and give you sheer joy when you finally come out the other side. The ebb and flow of battle is really captured as you can lose ground as quickly as you gained it. The health system is a bit bizarre and can lead to some frustrating moments where you clearly should have killed a guy with several rounds and he tags you instead. Overall, its pretty fair though.\n\n\nI highly recommend you read the  Manual [runningwithrifles.gamepedia.com] which is located on the wiki before you hop on.","January 12","true","68.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I've played several beta and "early access" games, and most of them are more like alpha quality. Running With Rifles is better than a lot of released games. The controls are tight (though, I suggest changing the default key bindings), the graphics are great, the game runs smoothly, and gameplay is incredibly fun. The AI can be a bit derpy sometimes (especially with vehicles), but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. It is so much fun mowing down dozens of enemy soldiers as you frantically try to capture a map area. And the heartbreak when you lose a hard fought spot is intense.\n\nPick this one up.

By far, Running With Rifles is the best one. It’s the only game out of the group that I actually played for fun afterwards, which I don’t really do often.\n\nIt’s a top-down shooter blended with some RPG elements, a large map, and hundreds of other soldiers. The game places you in control of a single soldier, not any better or worse than any of the other soldiers (well, this depends on rank, which is earned through XP). You’re then tasked with taking over all of the other points on the map (in the form of trenches, camps, and bases), while simultaneously defending your own from the opposing team.\n\nAlthough the gameplay concept seems simple, it’s actually rather addicting. There’s so many other soldiers that it’s kinda hard to find yourself alone on the map (unless if you take the long route to the enemy base, which I did several times). I only played in singleplayer, so I’ve yet to experience the multiplayer aspect of the game, which I’m assuming would be a blast, especially with friends.\n\nThe leveling system comes into play when you try to select a weapon at the armory. You’ll only have access to a select amount of weapons and, as you gain XP for killing other soldiers, you’ll unlock these other weapons. I’m still working towards getting enough to get a sniper (of which the name escapes me).\n\nHighly recommended game, and considering that it’s still in early access, there’s got to be a lot more coming. Can’t wait to see where the game goes in the future.","May 8, 2014","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game does a really good job of creating an authentic war.  The first time you charge into battle and see 50+ troops shooting at you and your team is amazing.\nGameplay:\nBattles can last a really long time and you can't just charge in there and be "rambo". You will die. Even if aren't going "rambo" you will still die. a lot. No seriously. You die. A lot. Although you can't save your character after beating the campaign and there isn't a lot of levels each level is thoughout and unique with its own sightlines and points of conflict. There are only a handfull of guns to chose from in campaign (limited to the green faction) but when playing a quick game you can choose your faction which allows you to deploy with a lot more guns instead of having to find them. Shooting is great and the line of sight feature works well and is realistic. Although the game doesn't have a tutorial and might take some figuring out at first, it is fairly simple and easy to play.\nProgression:\nAs you start your character you are just a measly little private excited and anxious to join the battle. Each kill will grant you XP. Each death will take it away (don't worry. Its not a lot). As you earn XP you rank up. After 2 ranks or so you unlock the ability to control a squad. Squads are just AI that follow you around and allow you to give them orders such as: Squad move here, Squad shoot here. Etc. You can change their "mode" by pressing the "home" key. The modes are: Assualt, Stealth, Destroy, and default. I'm not completely sure what they do exactly but their purpose is pretty obvious. Each rank after you unlock a squad will allow you to have one more member (up to 10). Ranking up also allows access to new guns and equipment, including the radio. The radio allows you to call in airstrikes, reinforcements, vehicles etc... To call these in you use RP. Rp is a point system not unlike Xp. Rp is used to spawn in with more powerfull weapons. (stronger the weapon the more Rp it costs). You gain RP by capturing bases, supporting teammates, finding enemy structures (radio towers, fuel tanks. etc..).\nMultiplayer:\nThere is infinite replayability in multiplayer. Creating servers is easy. Joining servers is easy. And playing with friends is a blast.\nAI (artifical intelligence):\nThe AI is really well programmed and can do almost anything the player will do. Altough their two flaws would have to be driving vehicles and attacking bases. There have been plenty of times where my troops would almost have captured a base but one of ours get captured first and all the troops just forget what they were doing, die, and forget about the other base. This can happen repeatedly making some bases a real pain in the butt to capture.\n\nOverall this game is amazing and one of the best Top down shooters out there. And it is still early access so there is a lot more content and fixes to come.\n\n9.5/10","May 26, 2014","true","20.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In that sense it took pre-existing gameplay mechanics, made it more fluid, gave it better AI (and a hell of a lot more of them! - note that the driver AI is currently terrible, but most of the time players "pull rank" and take the driver's seat anyways), and added an online co-op/versus experience with support for so many players that it'll blow your mind.\n\nThere's a pretty good assortment of maps already and with modding i'm sure there will be even more. That brings me into the last point, currently the modding support isn't very well documented but looking at the files you can see that it's great the type of stuff you can do, from modifying ranks, textures, weapons, models, maps, and even HUD elements (by changing the textures) over the default there's really a lot of options open to you.","March 17, 2014","true","57.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

AI is smart and interesting to play with, it reacts well to both your actions and actions of your AI buddies; if it is too easy or too difficult for you to play — you can totally tailor AI settings to suit your needs. The game is designed with modding abilities in mind, so it won't get boring — lots of weapons, custom textures, maps and who knows what is to be expected after the end of beta-testing (which is after 2nd of April, according to game's news).\n\nI totally recommend this game.

I've put around 8 hours into it in only 2 days!\n\nIt takes the form of 2-3 armies battling each other on one of the many maps available from a semi-top down perspective. You control one person and you will probably die a lot, such is the way of battle! When you die you respawn at the nearest spawn (or the one you choose) and run back into the fray again.\n\nYou can choose to play the campaign or a one off mission with many tweakable options to choose from. All this of course can be done by yourself or with your friends in co-op and there is also player versus player battles to do too.\n\nGenerally you start as a private with a limited arsenal, as you rank up you unlock the ability to equip more weapons and to call in various radio commands. These could be airstrikes, tank drops and reinforcements but they cost RP which you must earn by capturing areas of the map or by doing other various things.\n\nThe game is very close to completion and even now could be considered a finished product. The developer has even stated that he would continue work on the game after it is released so it's most certainly a worthwhile investement.","October 20, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

At first this game may look like your casual shooter, but once you hop in and actually play the game, be prepared to be frustrated by deaths after deaths, desperately try to stay alive while praying that the next bullet that hits you won't kill you (or at least gets absorbed by the vest you're wearing, if you have enough RP to afford it).\n\nI personally am still trying to beat the very last battle of the campaign set to the default Hard difficulty, and I have to admit, even after multiple failures, I still find it fun to try winning it anyway. I can't really explain why, unfortunately, but it doesn't detract from the fact that at least it's fun for me.\n\nThe multiplayer servers might be kinda empty as of now, but I believe that's just because RWR is still relatively unknown to the gaming world. I think it's just a matter of time (and maybe effort to promote the game) before RWR has a big community of players and crowded multiplayer games.\n\nAll in all, RWR is quite the unique experience compared to other shooter games, and I enjoyed the hours I put into this game.

It's amazing. You know those times when instead of being a leader moving all your units around to defeat your enemy, and your tired of being the hero that can kill a whole army and absorb every bullet comming your way? This game is not a like that . Take a break from Command and Conquer or Battlefield and try this game in which your just another solidier fighting in another war. Your not special in anyway ( Except that your human). When was the last time you've played a game like that? Dont answer that.\n\nSo to start off there is a good amount of weapons on each side depending on which faction you are. There are 3 factions, Green,  Grey, and Brown. They are kinda based off of each faction, U.S, Germany, and Russia. Each faction has their own set of weapons. Now another great thing about this game is that there are many different ways to play it. It's kinda a open world game and you can have your own rules. You can sneak behind enemy lines, and sabatoge their weapons and arsenal helping your own team, you can guard one of your bases, or even go on the front lines, do what ever you want. Personally I do all three. Each campaign map has it's own secrets and challenges. On most I go on the front lines, helping my team fight it's way to victory. When I see that my faction is gaining enough momentom, I go stealth and try to blow up some of the enemies supplies. It's a good feeling when it's dark and your in the enemies base just stealth killing everyone and no one is aware of it.","October 14, 2014","true","24.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Think of what Battlefield would be like if viewed top-down. That's basically what it is.\n\nYou get to command a squad (which gets bigger as you level-up) to wipe out the enemy and conquer areas of the map. Once conquered you get access to all their vehicles and weapons - and new spawn points. The armory allows you to outfit your character exactly how you like to play. The vehicles are quite cool as well and the AI is not stupid.\n\nThere seems to be a lot to learn - which must be done via trial and error since the tutorial is pretty weak. Saying that, I think I picked up most of the basics fairly quickly. Once I had sorted out the controls (crouch and prone are for some weird reason not set as toggle keys by default) I got on quite well and won a few matches/missions.\n\nThe multiplayer is fun. You can play the campaign together co-op or against others and it has a variety of different game modes and it also includes dedicated server support.\n\nJimbo Rating: 7/10","May 11, 2015","true","11.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The beach was heavily defended, but every direction besides it was even more defended. The beach was our best option.\n\nWe got in our truck, various trucks moving in, including a mobile supply truck and reinforcements truck. Moving in, we walked onto the beachhead to die. Around a hundred of us died on that beach within the first five minutes, us all having no other option but to scrabble forward, as strong as we could possibly be in that sort of situation.\n\nBy the time we reached the cliff, we had lost hundreds more. We charged, throwing everything we could at them from every angle. A special operations team had managed to pierce the mansion's defenses, took down their radio communications and called in paratroopers. A few of them died before they hit the floor, but they had crippled the defense. The hundred or so of us charged in, furious at the beachhead.\n\nWhen the government actually got to the beachhead, it was a horrific sight. They found no captives, but only the gutted,  dead, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in corpses of what could be called the enemy. Hundreds of us didn't come home, and many families ended up with no mother or father to hold them tight, and tell them that everything would be okay.\n\nI was one of the lucky ones, but I'm saddened to say that though. I am warred constantly by the thoughts that maybe someone else deserved to live instead of me. I wasn't ever important, besides my mother, father and grandfather. The dead had wives, children. They should have lived, I should have died in their place.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roboticspirits/recommended/270150/","roboticspirits","Ghojo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roboticspirits/","45 products in account","I CANNOT recommend to buy this game at its current state.\n\nWhy? I wanted a fun, tactical teamwork-based shooter with a high replayability (as it was advertised). Well it's kinda fun, but also mediocre and very quickly repetitive grind-fest with bugs and poor design-choices. Which is sad, because it really has a lot of potential.\n\n\nSo what is wrong about it? First, the game is pretty much dead. It isn't completly empty, but there is basically just one server with more than 4 people playing. PVP is non-existing.\nAt least this one server has usually around 20 people playing, but since it's co-op you don't really notice it much (because of all the bots running around).\n\nSecond, it lags a lot. This game got MASSIVE desynching problems, making it often completely unplayable. You run for cover or trying to shoot the enemy...desynch...and then you find yourself dead. It's just frustrating.\nThe dev says "the netcode is very sensitive for ping fluctuations", so basically if you are not at NASA headquarters, you are screwed.\n\n\nNow to the gameplay itself.\nIn the first few hours, it's really fun. You run around shooting enemy soldiers, figuring out the weapons and trying to do a bit of crazy teamwork. Which mostly fails miserably, but it's still very fun to blow up ♥♥♥♥ together. :D\n\nHowever after you played for a few hours, you have seen it all and the game just becomes repetitive and tedious. Basically all you do is grinding through endlessly respawning enemies while trying to capture positions on the map. Nothing really strategic is going on there and it's really just not fun to be stuck at some positions for an hour before you can move on to the next.\n\n\nThen the controls, they are alright but also buggy.\nTo prone does often not work, so you push the button a few times. Usually you are killed by then already. You want to climb a ladder and you're usually getting pushed back for no reason until you manage to get up. The non-rotatable view and that everything is so small doesn't help either.\nAlso running and throwing a grenade doesn't work, you have to stand still. The AI however somehow is able to do that.\n\n\nVehicles are another point. The controls are VERY choppy, it's just not fun to steer them. Shooting stuff with the tank together however is really fun :D\nAlthough the fun doesn't last long usually, because the enemy is quick to blow it up. Using them from the distance only helps a little, but due to the short very view range it's not always an option.\nSo far they seem to be more a fun gimmick, as they aren't really game changing tactical elements, due to the massive amound of enemy respawns.\nBoats are pretty much useless and rarely ever used it seems, except for safely grinding enemies.\n\n\nWhich brings me to team-work. Man this game could be so awesome about this. You quickly gather a few people, hop onto a boat or jeep, drive around and flank the enemy, opening a second front. Or you call in an airstrike, clearing the path for your team to storm the base.\nIn theory this sounds great, but since so few people are actually playing this game, there isn't much tactical stuff going on actually. Everyone just rushes to the front trying to shoot as many enemies as possible, that's it. And since the enemy respawns so quickly, airstrikes don't really do much difference to a match.\nI imagine if there would be actually PVP, this would be much different. Sadly there is none.\n\n\nSpawning. Oh man, do I hate this. You re-spawn at certain points or at the spawn truck, which is a cool idea but it isn't really well though out. The spawn truck only works when there are no enemies nearby. And too often the enemies rush your position (because they spawn so numerous) or some idiot drives the spawn truck into the enemy base.. -___-\nThen you get spawned somewhere else, which is close if you are lucky, or across the other side of the map so you have to run for a LONGGGG time.\n\n\nThe maps, some are really cool but some are just badly designed, especially the last map. It just takes foreeeeever to walk around and advance. Generally you will spend a lot of tim running around.\n\n\nThen the point I hate the most. The RP's (resource points?), it's like an ingame currency that allows you to buy weapons etc. and order airstrikes, reinforcements or such.\nThis is just such a bad design choice, it really breaks the game on so many levels. You gain RP's by destroying enemy buildings or special vehicles, or spotting them and by objectives (I think moving into a zone). So if you don't play rushing through the map and you want to play more support / stealth / tactical style, you don't gain any.\n\nFurthermore you lose RP's every time you are killed, and since you are killed often, your RP's are quickly gone. I literally killed hundreds of enemies, have ranked up quite fast and are still running around with zero RP's.\nI never got so far to actually be able to buy "the cool stuff", or call in heavier things like a tank or artillery. When I am so good at killing enemies and I am not rewarded for it, that just makes me feel bad.\n\n\nSo yeah, hopefully the promised patch in June will fix all these things, because this game could be really awesome. I also hope some new vehicles and game mechanics come in, and the tactical elements to be reworked.\nIf not, then don't waste your money. Right now it feels more like a beta with only a few people actually playing it. $5 or maybe $8 is ok if you like to pay for a few hours of fun grinding, but 15 is too much.\n\nI kinda regret giving my money for it. I should have gone eating ice-cream with a nice girl instead, at least I would have some nice memories from that.","May 12, 2015","false","16.7"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","26","48","2","1"

Strategy is key to this game. If you enjoy the games like Call Of Duty, and other shooters like that, this MAY not be the game for you. There are only 3 factions The GreenBelts, The BrownPants, and The GrayCollars. The AI is very smart they will attempt to flank you, attack in very large numbers, even play defense if you try to sneak attack one of there off bases. There is only one flaw to the AI that I see and its there pathfinding when in a vehicle. The only thing annoying about the AI is they will only attack the Main Objective and never go after Side Objectives. Enough about the AI let me tell you about the leveling up system. Your rank depends upon your Experience. To gain Experience you must either kill enemies (higher ranking kills means more XP), or Take Objectives or Bases, You lose XP by Getting Killed. The Higher Your rank the more things you can acquire (Artillery Strikes, Paratroopers, and even Vehicular Transport). Overall Great Game.

The title implies you can run around with a rifle like an arcade shooter. It's actually quite different! RWR (Running With Rifles) will give you the feeling that you really are a tiny soldier in a big war. You aren't rambo, but rather a team player (even with your AI brethren). The game is very tactical in that with your teammates, you need to figure out and flush out enemy soldiers to achieve objectives together. I was very pleasantly surprised when I found the level of depth of the game itself. Cover matters. Your stance matters. Position matters. Teamwork matters. The game is stupidly addictive, with me only planning on playing for about 20 minutes or so, ended up being 2 hours. I can only recommend that you pick it up, because it's well worth it. I was impressed with the AI, as it is actually rather smart and knows how to counter your movements and tactics. If anything, I'm psyched that the developer says the AI isn't finished yet, and more is going to be planned!\n\nIf you're a thinker, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.","April 4, 2014","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combat is fast-paced and surprisingly convincing, save the moments when a soldier leaps from the roof of a building to join a firefight on the street below. Badass, yes. Realistic, no.\n\nGranted, realism isn't exactly the aim of this game. What it does try to do - present an entertaining, varied, well-balanced shooter experience - it does surprisingly well, and arguably better than the blockbuster franchises in the same genre.\n\nThere is one caveat I have to those considering purchasing this game: I highly recommend having a mouse with mappable buttons, as there are a number of actions that you will repeat constantly - crouching or going prone to utilize cover or take advantage of a firing position - that if triggered from the mouse will make your overall experience more enjoyable.\n\nI rate this game 23 hamsters and 8 plungers, which is pretty arbitrary but hey the game is really damn fun.","September 23, 2014","true","24.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On its face its almost like something you'd play on your cell phone while you wait for your plane to board....but once you sit down and play for awhile, you see that there are layers of fun and complexity that are not present in your average top down shooter. The maps are large, varied, and colorful. The battles can be tweaked to allow from small engagements to utter insanity.

The bots are smart but not good at driving into small areas.\nMost soldiers are bots but don't underestimate them if you face too many of them, it's like the soldiers are grunts from Titanfall but even better, they can kill you as well.\n\nPros:\n-Realism on guns.\n-Smart bots.\n-Cooperation needed\n-Can run at a potato computer\n-Big maps on different weather\n-Military vehicles and boats. BOATS.\n-Can save RP points for weapons.\n-Has Stash to put your own things.\n-Hate losing RP?

I will definitely be looking out for future works of Modulaatio Games\n\nAs for the game itself I thought it was really entertaining. The animations; the ragdoll; the cover, everything felt right. I think it would be really cool to make a stick rpg based off of the engine of this game actually (but that's off topic). This is one of those steam games that you always have installed because you never know when the mood will hit any it's time for some RwR shenanigans.\n\nThe name generator was a pretty fun feature that could have gone a little further too. While playing for the North Americans (Greenbelts), There were times I would find a soldier of a friends or my own name and I would accompany them or play them as safely as I could. Just a neat way to find myself getting deeper into this game.\n\nMap wise, the game works terrifically. The earliest and best memory I have of the game was the battle for the Great Bridge in Old Fort Creek. Typically there is a point of time in every fight that you are at a standstill and I felt like it was a WWI situation where the only real progress happened when either team recieved support from an apc.\n\nAnyway, I'd love to see this team again,\nSkål -N","March 30, 2015","true","55.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you don't stand behind cover while the enemy fires at you, you will die. This can result in awesome moments where you are the last survivor, waiting for back up as you kill several enemies who far outnumber you.\n\nThe only downside I have is the lack of players in the multiplayer.

I will play this game forevermore, as one of their songs says. Literally, I will play this game forever. It yields much, much potential.

It's that good, and the store page doesn't even represent the game that good. When you look at the pictures, they don't depict it in it's best light. You will see this when you try the game, and you can do it before buying, thanks to the demo.

Why? You might ask, well, who wouldn't want to charge into battle, bullets flying everywhere, explosions shaking the screen, screams filling the air. Who wouldn't want to take part in a sandbox war game with hundreds of troops, fighting each other with technology of war. Tanks firing shells at passing jeeps, artillery blowing apart an enemy convoy, squads of troops charging an enemy compund, firing their rifles. This game never gets old. Never. But wait, it doesn't stop there. Hop onto the workshop and change your game into more. Want to hold back hordes of zombies in a post-apocalyptic world? you can do that. Want to defend the shores of Normady as the German during WW2? you can do that. Want to fight as the aliens from Xcom? you can do that. This game is amazing.

The gameplay is good, the graphics are clean, and the controls well thought out.\n\nFirst of all the gameplay and AI are something that you will see in the reviews of this game a lot as they really are special and unique. The game is top down at an angle so 3D elements are visible creating an interesting tactical view allowing the player to analyze situations and choose where to move and what to do. Secondly, the cover mechanic in the game is well planned out and doesn't allow players to play like the "heroes" they normally play as in call of duty because they will die. Accuracy is another thing as it adds another tactical layer to gaming as shooting while running is very ineffective when compared to crouching giving the positioning of the player (crouching, standing, or prone) great importance. In RWR, there is no hitpoint system, instead there is a chance for each bullet to kill depending on the weapon (although one could consider the vests which absorb a few "kill bullets" as hitpoints) meaning that everything needs to be tactical with the risks understood. Based upon all of that, objectives are given out by the commander AI and a set distribution of AI are sent there to try and capture zones. The player can get a set amount of AI in their squad if they have a high enough rank and can control and set movement objectives for these AI in order to help push the objective or take down buildings that reduce the enemies capabilites. The stealth mechanic is really fun and it feels really rewarding once you finally run away and detonate the C4 to destroy an objective.\nMoreover, the AI in the game have amazing discipline. They find cover, dive a away from grenades, and will punish you for making bad decisions. It is great as they fight in a tactical way that players should learn from.\nAlso, the gameplay works well in multiplayer, where players can either work together in co-op versus the AI in dominance mode, or to fight against each other in a vs mode. I had a great time where I joined a squad and took down buildings behind enemy lines.\nVehicles are another part of the game, that when used properly can turn the tide of battle. Vehicles are powerful but can be shredded apart easily by well coordinated attacks making teamwork even more important in the game.\nAll in all, the gameplay really makes the player feel as if they are but just a cog in the machine of war. It makes the player realize the mistake they made that caused them to die. It makes them realize they are someone who can die with some power to make decisions but in the end only enough to make a difference if done right. But even then, at times a player can win through using skill, reflexes, and fast decisions in even the toughest of situations.\n\nSecondly, the graphics in the game are fun and voxel based, along with the weapons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/danico24/recommended/270150/","danico24","Royal Canadian Mounted Police","http://steamcommunity.com/id/danico24/","96 products in account","RWR is one of the best indie games i have EVER played. It's also a very mod friendly game, with anyone being able to anything they want with RWR. Well, it's obviously a military game at first glance. You play as three different military factions: The Greenbelts (America), The Graycollars (Germany), and the Brownpants (Russia). But instead of being like most other military shooters such as Call Of Duty of Battlefield, you are not a big action hero soldier sent to the front lines to kill everything that moves, you are a generic low lying foot soldier who is just as expendable and worthless as all your enemies and friends. Every time you die, depending on what faction you are part of, you spawn with a new name that is generated from the bank of first and last names corresponding to said faction. If you are mod savvy, you might know that you can edit this. Because you only take one to two hits to die when not wearing a vest, tactics are a must and can be very rewarding when you plan something out and carry it out correctly. Bases consist of 4 things. #1: The Armory; The armory is a place where you use your currency (RP/Resource Points) you earn throughout the game to purchase new weapons, gadgets, and equipment. You can also sell rare items and weapons scattered throughout the map that you find for some quick cash. You can also deliver enemy weapons to your armory to stock your armory with enemy stuff. This is useful is you want to have some enemy loot that you would otherwise have to go and get from the battle area. Also, some weapons have exp locks. These can't be used until you have a certain amount of exp. You can, however, take the weapons and store them in your backpack for later use.  #2: The Vehicles; the vehicles are an essential part of your advancement to the next objective and can be used as extra firepower against hordes of enemies. #3: The Enemy Objectives; When you capture a base you might notice a large radio tower in the middle of the base. These radio towers are enemy objectives and can be destroyed for quick cash a bit of exp. Specifically, radio towers also block radio calls. This prevents you from calling in reinforcements, armored support, artillery and so on. #4: The Stash; the stash is where you can store extra items to come back to later, but don't let the enemy recapture the base, or the enemy get hold of your powerful stuff! There is ranking system in the game, starting you out as private and ranking you up to higher ranks with more abilities. Higher ranks can use there money to call in artillery, extra troops, deployable cover, and so on. You can earn exp and rank up by killing enemies, as previously mentonied, destroying radio towers, doing side objectives and capturing bases. You might notice the general occasionally saying things like "capture that graycollars supply truck to the southwest!". Those are side objectives. Side objectives are things like capturing vehicles and delivering them to the armory for quick cash and exp. There is far too much to this game to talk about in one review, so here is my final verdict:\n\n\n10/10!\nSo far no bugs have been found by me (wow!).\nAn incredible little gem that should get more attention than it already has.

Its like Cannon Fodder mixed with Planetside or the Battlefront series. It even has a Sunderer/spawn truck. The gameplay is great, and the AI is a surprisingly challenging opponent, and not really all that much in a "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!" way. Or at least I didn't get nearly as enraged at RWR as I do when playing Planetside or Battlefront.\n\nIt can take a bit to "grind" up the ranks (and the grind is unique to each server), but even the basic assault rifle is a competent weapon, and the first promotion unlocks what has become my favorite weapon in the game (and I've used quite a few in singleplayer), the SAW! You need to be prone or behind cover to fire it, but man that thing has firepower, you will massacre groups caught in the open and it also seems to do a very good job of pinning the AI. I'd blast away at them and they'd stay behind cover, I'd start reloading and they'd vault their cover to try to charge, I finish reload and open fire and they scramble to get back into cover. Its really awesome that suppression seems to work. At one point me and someone with a sniper rifle were holed up in a tower, fighting off waves of AI. I'd pop up and start spraying bullet across the whole group, causing the enemy to stop firing so much and the other guy would pop up and blow a few of their head's off. Then we'd duck back down before they found their courage/brains and started firing at us, hoping to hit while we're exposed.\n\n\n\nThe AI is really good too, which is good since the only two major servers I saw were co-op against AI factions. They seem pretty clever and will actively try to flank (and cover is really important) or flush people out with grenades. It seems you can also sneak up on them if you crouch/prone and don't shoot until you're close.\n\nNow for the bad part. While playing online on one server I experienced some significant server-side lag/desync issues. Part of this was because there was 25-30 players, and part of it was because we were trying to grind our way into a final enemy base down pretty much a killing field and the place was thick with AI mooks. Worst thing is, every time we'd start to make some progress, the other AI faction (there are 3 teams in the game) would assault the territory we were attacking front, killing our momentum. I'm unsure how much of that lag/desync issue was the server itself or the game code.","March 15, 2014","true","44.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In fact, he cried like a newborn girl when he received the letter, the sole piece of paper that every man dreaded. He was drafted, without ever given a chance to truly say goodbye to his loved ones. Edwin pushed his feelings far behind his mind; he had much more pressing matters at hand. "1 minute!" shouted Benny Adams, his tough-as-nails Sergeant. How could I get out of this one? Edwin asked himself. Was he ready for his first battle, ready for his first kill? Whether it was his body quivering uncontrollably, or the vibration from the squad's armored vehicle, he was unsure. He glanced quickly from side to side, gazing at his comrades' petrified faces. His hands gripped tightly at his rifle. His lungs rose and fell rapidly, sucking in as much air as possible. "Oi, Private Edwin!" called Corporal Douglas Smith, his cocky, dauntless comrade. "I think we have a traitor in our midst." Edwin stared at him, puzzled. "See," continued Smith, who sat on the left side of the vehicle. "Brownpants!" Smith bursted out laughing, but Edwin detected a faint shakiness in his voice. He checked his weapon for the umpteenth time. "Brownpants, 12-o'clock!" shouted Sgt. Adams, whose voice was immediately seceded by a barrage of bullets, which splattered against the heavy vehicle. Douglas burst into another laugh as the rain of bullets continued to wreak havoc on the armor. "OMG! Rocket!" the Sergeant screamed. The rocket exploded on the left side of the vehicle, and suddenly, the Corporal's pestering laugh ceased forever. Light flooded through the new hole in their previously armored vehicle. Edwin, alongside his Sergeant and the rest of the squad (minus Douglas), jumped out, screaming as they unleashed their weapons. All of Edwin's fears, all his sadness, disappeared as he prepared to slaughter the Brownpants. His teeth grinded together, his hands tightly clenched his weapon, his eyes gazed forward. He stood up, screaming as he trained his weapon towards the enemy squad. There were nine of them, all looking at him...\n\nSFC. Quincy Brooks was a good soldier. he had 4 men under his command, and was leading his squad to flank the Brownpants at the beach. This plan will work, this plan has to work, he assured himself. He and his men hid behind the shelter of a large rock. He peeked ahead, spotting a large Brownpants infantry squad. His men made ready, and double-checked their ammunition. Suddenly, Brooks gave the order, and they charged forward, screaming like mad men. The Brownpants hesitated and positioned themselves to defend, giving the fellow Greenbelts the perfect opportunity to strike from the front. A barrage of grenades and bullets mowed the infantry squad down. Only one enemy soldier remained, who cowered into the sandbags. He spoke something quickly, and sounded like, "This is Brown 2-1." Probably trying to call for reinforcements Brooks mused to himself. He aimed his rifle and popped the guy twice in the chest and once on the head. Everyone jumped with joy and fired their guns in the air. "We did a bang-up job now, didn't we, Cap?" said Corporal Jenkins, Brooks best soldier in his squad. "Wait... Everyone shut up!" Quincy shouted. A certain hum was in the distance, and suddenly, it grew loud. The roars were followed by the distinct whistle of falling bombs. SFC Quincy Brooks knew exactly what that Brownpants had called...\n\nSFC Jonathan Kingsley was a good soldier...\n\n12/10 Would make awsome soldier death stories again.","December 29, 2015","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

There is a fair selection of weapons and i didnt feel like airstrike got too much of a role in game, that meaning it could not be spammed like hell. Its unaccurate, too, so yeah theres that.\n\nI just wonder why you cant change weapons while prone, or shoot bazookas from prone-stance?

It's a hardcore tactical shooter at heart, so cover, positioning, and awareness are vitally important. Also you're going to die. A lot. This is not a forgiving game, which is what makes it so satisfying when you enfilade an enemy position and take out half a dozen soldiers in a few seconds. And then the same thing will happen to you later. It's the circle of life Running With Rifles.\n\nBe aware that the tutorial is butts and there's effectively zero documentation in the game. You will need to go to the wiki to learn most of how the game works. And the wiki is kind of butts too, so you know... good luck. It's worth it, though. My friends and I are having a ton of fun playing a co-op campaign together. Persistent leveling and progress across ten to twenty hours of campaign is a lot of bang for the buck, and that's just one playthrough of one mode.\n\nIn summary, if you like hardcore tactical shooters, you'll probably like this game. Buy this ♥♥♥♥. Play it with friends. Accidentally blow yourself up with badly-thrown grenades.

Even playing alone it is easy to waste away hours trying to move through a map and eventually win. Although the biggest feature of this game is the ability to have three factions fighting for dominance on the same map. This mechanic makes for an extremely fun game even if you've been blown up by grenades, mowed down by LMGs, taken out by snipers or even run over by a friendly driving a tank. The only possible downside is the current state of the multiplayer servers, which is only a small footnote that can be fixed with relative ease before the game is out of alpha.","June 25, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

These battles are massive and can see up to 800 AI units participating. You should expect to die.  A lot . To win on a map requires excessive amounts of teamwork between yourself and your teammates from co-ordinating attacks on enemy bases to attacking valuable enemy assets.\n\nLuckily, the AI is pretty competent at doing so and should not be underestimated. You will find yourself flanked by the enemy AI and urged to run from cover due to enemy grenades. You will need to keep your head down most of the time, too. The AI's accuracy is not to be trifled with. To beat the AI, you'll need to help your team by providing resources, particularly men and firepower.\n\nThe remarkable thing about this game is that dying isn't annoying as you would expect it to. You will get used to dying quickly and instead will be eager to jump right back into a fight. The fight will always be going on, whether you are there or not. You can choose where to go. It is an open-world, albeit a very dangerous one.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop there. The game, even while it is still being developed and will be seeing new features, sees modding present already. Creating your own faction is relatively simple. I can play a map and war between 5 different powers thanks to some simple modding and content provided by the modding community.","March 21, 2014","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mapthecap/recommended/270150/","mapthecap","Mapu Tofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mapthecap/","28 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEarly Access Review:\n\nRunning with Rifles is a game I truly enjoyed, this is game is $10 well spent.\n\nFor those who enjoy tactical shooters, team-based shooters and FPS games, this is definitely for you.\n\nRWR at first doesn't seem to be a game that take itself seriously, when you see it, you'll probably think this is a casual shooter that you just run and gun and everything along your path just dies, but as you play the game more, you'll realize how complex(yet easy to pick up) the mechanics of this game is.\n\nRWR is very straight forward, you spawn in a very big open map, where you can go anywhere at anytime at your own will, in the middle of a huge war, and I mean HUGE, i'm talking about hundreds of soldiers, both friendlies and hostiles shooting and slinging bombs at each other. You're this soldier who has to fight for your faction, but you're just any other soldier, you're not a hero, you're not Rambo, or John Matrix or Master Chief, or James Ramirez, you're cannon fodder. You're not expendable, you're disposable. The game gives you the feeling of a regular soldier in the middle of the battlefield. Being a hero and a lonewolf is possible, and it does reward  you greatly, but teamwork as a squad and as an army is the key to victory.\n\nControls are simple, if you're familiar with the usual WASD FPS or action games, it's very similar. Combat though is very team-based and tactical focused, you can make your team go for gold while you cover their attack, or as your team covers you, You alone can attack from behind to flush down the enemies as your team cover fires. The AI of the game is pretty smart, both in strategy and in combat. The cover system of the game is very nicely done as well. This is those games that you can't just go guns a blazing and come back alive(well you can, but definitely expect to die a lot).\n\nOther than the straight-up battles of the war, you can also form a small squad(or go lone wolf, your choice) to do some covert missions, spot enemy vehicles, crates and even do sabotage missions of your own which greatly rewards you.\n\nThere is a simple RPG mechanic in the game as well where you gain XP as you kill enemy troops and do missions which ranks you up to gain more troops in your squad and vehicle rights, this also features an inventory system which you can pick up gear and  weapons to help you in your war, other than that, you also unlock special weapons as you progress,\n\nBeing a top-down shooter, they've actually done a pretty good job with the camera view as well, instead of the usual "you face where you point" kind of camera, they made the crosshair/pointer your point of view. The camera moves where you position your crosshair as it gives you vulnerabilty behind. It's fair in multiplayer as you can do sneaky stealth attacks from behind when an enemy is facing the other way and vice versa.\n\nRunning with Rifles also has a unique visual charm compared to it's peers of the genre. Other than the usual realistic graphics that's been a genre standard, RWR stands besides the offbeats, such as Armed and Dangerous, Battlefield Heroes, Hogs of War and such. RWR offers a bit cartoony, subtle cell-shaded graphics. The speech bubbles also adds to the charm, especially when your squad complains who farted in the APC. This lessens the grim and scary feeling of war, but the battle prolongs and the bodies pile up, blood trails are left behind, you realize and remember that you are in a war.\n\nMultiplayer is also included in the game, you can connect to a public server and play with random people or make a private game out of your campaign, and a friend can join in. The good thing about this is your progress carries over as long as you and your buddies log in to the same server. The max capacity for a server is 40.\n\nMaybe the only downside I can see as of the moment in this game is the lack of sounds. I'd like to hear more war-ish and battlefield-ish sounds, you know? battle trumpets, troops shouting at each other.\n\nOverall, Running with Rifles is a very good game. With it's almost-to-realistic war mechanics yet cartoony visual style or the very engaging and fun gameplay or the vast battlefields that you'll explore. Running with Rifles is a game that deserve a spot besides the A-listers of the war genre, and for $10 at that.","June 8, 2014","true","42.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Np42/recommended/270150/","Np42","chef supreme!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Np42/","126 products in account","You'll start a battle as one person, and end as a different one.\nNot just literally - you'll end up dying so many times that you'll forget the name of the soldier you started with - but also physically, in the real world, as well.\nI'm writing this right now after completing the Battle of Keepsake Bay.  I've seen other reviews and comments from different people who described how long it took them - the most I've seen so far was 7 hours.  Seven hours.  It took me three and a half, personally, but my God.  This is just an amazing game.  It was so frustrating, yet so rewarding when I won.\nBasically, each map is the same idea.  You start off playing as your respective faction, and you need to conquer the map.  Each landmark you need to capture is highlighted on the map, and typically, your faction has a specific order to follow in terms of capturing them.  But it's not as simple as kill all the enemies, take the landmark, and move on.  No, the AI is ridiculously intelligent - and they never stop respawning.  But neither does your side - and they're just as smart.  The result?  A well-built stalemate generator.  A few maps were easy to beat, but a couple - like the one I listed above - were nightmares.  Run out to the front, take cover, and just spray bullets downrange, clipping as many enemies as possible, while at the same time, avoiding their bullets.  One side captures the landmark.  Their counter-attack overwhelms you, and they take it back.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.  This can literally go on for hours - you need to use some real strategy and command your squad to get anything done.  Respawn.  Repeat.  It's insane, but amazing at the same time.  And once the battle is over, and you've won: it shows.  Blood covering every street, bodies all over the place, burnt out APC's and cars, craters from explosions.\n\nAside from the extremely addicting gameplay, this game is quite good in other respects.  The art style is really damn charming: the quirky graphics, combined with gameplay, remind me of the old Army Men games made by 3DO.  The sound work is fantastic - I'd like to see, in the future, maybe some music during the actual gameplay?  The title/menu music gets stuck in your head, but I like it.  Everything from explosions, to bullets whizzing by, even to people climbing fences - it sounds great all around.  The RPG elements are subtle, but they really make the game so much better - and addicting.  I like the system of trading items or weapons you find for points - which you buy more weapons with.  Big selection in terms of guns.  It's easy to rank up once you get a hang of the game, but the perks make you feel like you're actually accomplishing something - bigger squad size, the ability to take over friendly vehicles and command them, and calling in support make you want to try and rank up.\n\nI think the biggest upshot to this game is how well it was done for an early-access indie game.  I have never seen anything like it - I only bought it recently, but apparently the developers kept it updated frequently over the course of a couple of years, always keeping players in the loop, and now, they've just hit full release.  That, coupled with the fact that it's got a demo to go along with it - that's what really hooked me in.  I played 15 minutes of the demo, and bought it immediately.  And I have no regrets.\n\nGreat work.  This game is a solid ten in my book.","April 5, 2015","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Doesn't happen, never happens. This has to be one of the most satisfying war game experiences I've ever played and the fact that it's a quite simple top down shooter makes it all the more satisfying. The replayability of it is huge with three factions and what are rather expansive maps. In the campaign mode the maps are linked and the free form nature of it means I know I'll be coming back to it time and time again. One of those games that when you're looking at your game library unsure of what you want to be playing, you'll always just say "What the hell" and jump into RWR.\n\nI've only had a little time in multiplayer though it was also just as satisfying. I don't normally bother with the review process but I think this crowd is on to a winner, as it stands right now the game is practically perfect. The back and forth, the grinding battles for city blocks culminating in an immensely satisfying experience when you finally take the win or cede a hard fought loss gives me good feels all over.\n\n10/10 Feels","March 26, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some reviews and discussions about this game may degrade this fact or state that I am false but I have seen a pattern in the bad reviews. They all say the game is too hard, too easy to die in  and the AI is unfair. There first point is just ... foolish. Dark souls, demon souls and the other are supposed to be hard but people love that game and this game is designed to make you just 1 out of 100s of generic soldiers on the battle field fighting, protecting and destroying objectives. Yes the game is challenging(just look at the difficulty options, less hard and hard) but that is why there is cover to protect you from dieing and the intelligent AI on your side to either be meat shields and protectors. The third point, AI is unfair, if find hard to believe because I haven't found anything unfair about the AI! Plus, you can edit the AI settings, their accuracy, how many of them there are. You can make it to where you're the unfair one!\nPositive things about the game are the wide variety of weapons, intellegent AI, great maps that range in size, amazing community and developers that respond to player suggestions and questions.

The game itself for £11 or £7 as i write this review, is more than worth the asking price as in return you are getting a fun, strategic shooter that combines elements from nintendo games such as cannon fodder along side the scales of battles from the Total War franchise. The devs are highly active on the community pages and the game is never left 'dead' at any given time with updates being worked on throughout the weeks. I have had nothing but fun playing this game online, coop and single player, each providing a different experience each time with a ton of replayability. I encourage you to try it for yourself with the free demo provided on the RWR website and buy the game in the future as it deserves more publicity than the mainstream **** that is clogging the store at the moment.\n\nPros - Huge Ai battles, like seriously huge.\n3 individual armies with unique weapons/looks\nMultiple ways of playing\nCoop/online with bots\nWide range of weapons and vehicles\nRadio supports such as paratroopers, mortar strikes, artillery and vehicle drops\nSmall miniboss' with unique loot/weapons\nmassive maps all unique\nDifferent Game modes\nDeployable and static emplacements to build fortifications\nHelpful Ai\n\nCons (not really the correct term) -\nYou will die alot due to Ai, but hey it's a war\nSome Ai vehicle drivers can get stuck and frustrate you\nNot all Ai will charge enemy positions meaning you will need to do alot of work in order to win\nSome missions can be hard especiall by yourself (end mission for greycollars) PLAY WITH FRIENDS!\n\nApart from those minor, and i mean minor, 'cons' this game is great and i look forward to the next updates to see what will be added next, especially as the devs are open to ideas from the fans!\n\n","November 26, 2014","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Np42/recommended/270150/","Np42","chef supreme!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Np42/","126 products in account","You'll start a battle as one person, and end as a different one.\nNot just literally - you'll end up dying so many times that you'll forget the name of the soldier you started with - but also physically, in the real world, as well.\nI'm writing this right now after completing the Battle of Keepsake Bay.  I've seen other reviews and comments from different people who described how long it took them - the most I've seen so far was 7 hours.  Seven hours.  It took me three and a half, personally, but my God.  This is just an amazing game.  It was so frustrating, yet so rewarding when I won.\nBasically, each map is the same idea.  You start off playing as your respective faction, and you need to conquer the map.  Each landmark you need to capture is highlighted on the map, and typically, your faction has a specific order to follow in terms of capturing them.  But it's not as simple as kill all the enemies, take the landmark, and move on.  No, the AI is ridiculously intelligent - and they never stop respawning.  But neither does your side - and they're just as smart.  The result?  A well-built stalemate generator.  A few maps were easy to beat, but a couple - like the one I listed above - were nightmares.  Run out to the front, take cover, and just spray bullets downrange, clipping as many enemies as possible, while at the same time, avoiding their bullets.  One side captures the landmark.  Their counter-attack overwhelms you, and they take it back.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.  This can literally go on for hours - you need to use some real strategy and command your squad to get anything done.  Respawn.  Repeat.  It's insane, but amazing at the same time.  And once the battle is over, and you've won: it shows.  Blood covering every street, bodies all over the place, burnt out APC's and cars, craters from explosions.\n\nAside from the extremely addicting gameplay, this game is quite good in other respects.  The art style is really damn charming: the quirky graphics, combined with gameplay, remind me of the old Army Men games made by 3DO.  The sound work is fantastic - I'd like to see, in the future, maybe some music during the actual gameplay?  The title/menu music gets stuck in your head, but I like it.  Everything from explosions, to bullets whizzing by, even to people climbing fences - it sounds great all around.  The RPG elements are subtle, but they really make the game so much better - and addicting.  I like the system of trading items or weapons you find for points - which you buy more weapons with.  Big selection in terms of guns.  It's easy to rank up once you get a hang of the game, but the perks make you feel like you're actually accomplishing something - bigger squad size, the ability to take over friendly vehicles and command them, and calling in support make you want to try and rank up.\n\nI think the biggest upshot to this game is how well it was done for an early-access indie game.  I have never seen anything like it - I only bought it recently, but apparently the developers kept it updated frequently over the course of a couple of years, always keeping players in the loop, and now, they've just hit full release.  That, coupled with the fact that it's got a demo to go along with it - that's what really hooked me in.  I played 15 minutes of the demo, and bought it immediately.  And I have no regrets.\n\nGreat work.  This game is a solid ten in my book.","April 5, 2015","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a ton of potential and replayability as the 3 different factions ( based on the Toy Army Men ) You can play as Green, Grey and Tan/ Brown. They all have different weapons, vehicles, equipment and starting locations on the map. There is even a level system or rank system with the higher level you are you can command a certain number of allied soldiers. You can also use a radio and call in reinforcements, mortar strikes, paratroopers and even tank support. This game is also very hard and realistic 1 or 2 shots will bring you down so the final verdict is.....\n\n8/10 because of sometimes the AI will randomly decide to run your ♥♥♥ over if your in his way, If you thought COD: World at War was good at spamming grenades the enemies are really good at it.","April 11, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many shooter games put you in the role of the action hero; able to take and deal out a seemingly infinite amount of bullets. RWR, however, forces you to become a soldier just like all others, with a fragile body and imperfect aim. With this seemingly meaningless soldier, however, you can have tremendous impact. Sneaking into enemy bases, calling airstrikes, you name it; one man can have an impact. Whether RWR is a social commentary on the shooter's depiction of a player, or simply an extremely difficult shooter, this game is money well spent.","March 21, 2015","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mapthecap/recommended/270150/","mapthecap","Mapu Tofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mapthecap/","28 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEarly Access Review:\n\nRunning with Rifles is a game I truly enjoyed, this is game is $10 well spent.\n\nFor those who enjoy tactical shooters, team-based shooters and FPS games, this is definitely for you.\n\nRWR at first doesn't seem to be a game that take itself seriously, when you see it, you'll probably think this is a casual shooter that you just run and gun and everything along your path just dies, but as you play the game more, you'll realize how complex(yet easy to pick up) the mechanics of this game is.\n\nRWR is very straight forward, you spawn in a very big open map, where you can go anywhere at anytime at your own will, in the middle of a huge war, and I mean HUGE, i'm talking about hundreds of soldiers, both friendlies and hostiles shooting and slinging bombs at each other. You're this soldier who has to fight for your faction, but you're just any other soldier, you're not a hero, you're not Rambo, or John Matrix or Master Chief, or James Ramirez, you're cannon fodder. You're not expendable, you're disposable. The game gives you the feeling of a regular soldier in the middle of the battlefield. Being a hero and a lonewolf is possible, and it does reward  you greatly, but teamwork as a squad and as an army is the key to victory.\n\nControls are simple, if you're familiar with the usual WASD FPS or action games, it's very similar. Combat though is very team-based and tactical focused, you can make your team go for gold while you cover their attack, or as your team covers you, You alone can attack from behind to flush down the enemies as your team cover fires. The AI of the game is pretty smart, both in strategy and in combat. The cover system of the game is very nicely done as well. This is those games that you can't just go guns a blazing and come back alive(well you can, but definitely expect to die a lot).\n\nOther than the straight-up battles of the war, you can also form a small squad(or go lone wolf, your choice) to do some covert missions, spot enemy vehicles, crates and even do sabotage missions of your own which greatly rewards you.\n\nThere is a simple RPG mechanic in the game as well where you gain XP as you kill enemy troops and do missions which ranks you up to gain more troops in your squad and vehicle rights, this also features an inventory system which you can pick up gear and  weapons to help you in your war, other than that, you also unlock special weapons as you progress,\n\nBeing a top-down shooter, they've actually done a pretty good job with the camera view as well, instead of the usual "you face where you point" kind of camera, they made the crosshair/pointer your point of view. The camera moves where you position your crosshair as it gives you vulnerabilty behind. It's fair in multiplayer as you can do sneaky stealth attacks from behind when an enemy is facing the other way and vice versa.\n\nRunning with Rifles also has a unique visual charm compared to it's peers of the genre. Other than the usual realistic graphics that's been a genre standard, RWR stands besides the offbeats, such as Armed and Dangerous, Battlefield Heroes, Hogs of War and such. RWR offers a bit cartoony, subtle cell-shaded graphics. The speech bubbles also adds to the charm, especially when your squad complains who farted in the APC. This lessens the grim and scary feeling of war, but the battle prolongs and the bodies pile up, blood trails are left behind, you realize and remember that you are in a war.\n\nMultiplayer is also included in the game, you can connect to a public server and play with random people or make a private game out of your campaign, and a friend can join in. The good thing about this is your progress carries over as long as you and your buddies log in to the same server. The max capacity for a server is 40.\n\nMaybe the only downside I can see as of the moment in this game is the lack of sounds. I'd like to hear more war-ish and battlefield-ish sounds, you know? battle trumpets, troops shouting at each other.\n\nOverall, Running with Rifles is a very good game. With it's almost-to-realistic war mechanics yet cartoony visual style or the very engaging and fun gameplay or the vast battlefields that you'll explore. Running with Rifles is a game that deserve a spot besides the A-listers of the war genre, and for $10 at that.","June 8, 2014","true","42.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Was very pleased to see it's seen continued development and a Steam release.\n\nThe game's a fairly casual, top down shooter, with relatively hardcore mechanics. Think of it as Arma Lite. Bullets are deadly, explosive and vehicles are deadlier. Tactics and coordination are a must in order to advance. Squad mechanics work well, and the AI is competent and deadly, indeed. There's a wide variety of weapons and vehicles to utilise, including rifles, LMGs, shotguns, explosives and APCs, as well as a handfull of fun gamemodes, as well as mod support.\n\nI hope the multiplayer community grows further, as I feel this game could really shine as a nice pick-up and play squad based shooter.\n\nGraphics and sound are good, whilst 'basic'. The style is reminiscent of good old green army men toys. Particle effects like explosions and muzzle flair are nice, and punch up the 'toy' style.\n\nOverall if you want a fun top-down to jump into every once in a while, but still enjoy some of the depth you'd get from it's bigger cousins, this game is a must.","June 11, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Assault Rifles are good all rounders, Snipers are good, but the top down perspective makes them awkward to handle nad Shotguns are often too situational for effective use on a majority of occasions.\n\nGood selection Weapons, Aks, G36Cs, M16s are available to their respective factions and stealing them from opponents grants them for your faction (but only temporarily for some reason)\n\nGreat choices of gameplay: Do you want to be a lone wolf? Grab a Sniper Rifle and some C4 and cause soem behind the lines enemy havoc! Or maybe get a tactical squad of troops and outflank adn annihilate your opponents with superior tactics and firepower, And if you want to participate in mass attacks as a part of the cogs of your faction! Theres a role for any one and any skill level.\n\nGreat Variety of maps, from Holiday resorts to intense Middle Eastern Urban Combat, a Harsh Winter Trench Combat.\n\nA slew of mods are already present for the games, Halo? (If you really want that,... just kidding ;)) XCOM? sure! there is a strong mod support for this game and for its 10 pound value, it gives a metric ton of replay value on top of the content available.\n\nNegatives:\nAi for Driving and Swimming is dumb, like really dumb, they have already poked fun at the poor driving with some dialogue between troops but they need to patch this, I have been run over mid Rocket Aiming by incompetent drivers after incompetent driver and swimming Ai are easier to shoot than Fish In a barrel, In fact fish in a barrel would have a better survival rate than one of these troopers swimming!\n\nEndgame missions feel unbalanced, the Base assault/defense mission is perhaps a bit too much of a difficulty spike, but is still doable, but the Stealth Mission where you take out Radio Towers is really lack luster, the stealth feels finicky at this moment and could benefit from some form of back up or stealth gadgets such as Radar or Smoke grenades.\n\nFactions lack distinct styles\nTheire are\nGrey Collars: German forces\nGreen Belts: America\nBrownpants: Russia (poor Russia, a pun for defecation :P)\nAside from a slight model change they play identically, the only distinct change is the American Jeep as a wider fire range for passengers, but less Cover for their passengers. I think there needs to be a mroe distinct change, for example perhaps Germany should have the hmore Accurate Weapons, the Russians the Most damaging and America the Highest Fire Rate?\n\nidk, perhaps that would imbalance the game too much.\nAlso the maps seem to vary in style and gameplay, but the environments themself are not distinct aside From the Winter outfits in FridgeValley, there is not much change between maps like Black Gold Estuary or Rattlesnake Crescent.\n\n\nBut those are only minor and easily fixable flaws of a solid and completely brilliant game!\n8.5/10\n\n9/10 after AI fixes\n\nits only 10 Pounds yet its worth nearly every penny,if you find yourself in a good need for an Interesting Over the top Military Top down shooter (must be a huge market there! :P)\n\nThen you would have to be nuts to not get Running With Rifles (You'd also have to be nuts to start Running with rifles, if you catch my drift, please don't take that out of context)","June 15, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a solid campaign with a big overview map and a last boss map. You can play these maps over and over and try different routes and tactics.\n\nI've played mostly Coop so I can't speak for the PVP part, which I don't like. Against the NPC and AI, the game is like a single player experience except you can have friends help you out and push. PVP is a different story because you can't hide in grass and if you see your enemy, they most likely see you.\n\nThere's 2 combat vehicles for all teams which is an APC and a tank. You can have a HMMW flown in which is not part of the team's assets.\n\nThe game uses RP points as currency for buying weapons and assets which is a solid balanced currency. Most enemies drop RP worthy loot upon death and you recover these items and sell them. Gaining RP is also fairly easy, just stay in a capture zone and kill enemies.\n\nOne thing to note about the combat is that there is no health system in the game. Each gun has a probability to hit at a certain range and if it goes past 100%, the target dies. In order to prevent death, units can wear body armor which gives 2 chances of surviving a hit and a third which puts the unit down for a medic.\n\nPros and cons:\n+ 32 player servers where each player can have a maximum of ten AI squad mates which allows for 320 units of in game units for a team + the stationary AI units that defend points.\n+ Large variety of weapons and balance.\n+ Large maps with close quarters.\n+ Lengthy battles (one map can last 4 hours).\n+ Cartoon style.\n+ Good performance with 32 players.\n\n- Unlimited tickets for teams (Yes, this is a con, after killing 300 waves of enemies that can't be halted it gets tedious).\n- No smoke grenades or deployable smoke screen.\n- APCs and Tanks looses health from grenades.\n- Somewhat rage inducing.\n\nThe game looks cheesy but it's very fun and very serious.","December 28, 2015","true","81.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orangutangster/recommended/270150/","orangutangster","Orangutangster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orangutangster/","120 products in account","RUNNING WITH RIFLES. An addictive and fun game that will have you playing for hours. Personally, I think this game is definitely worth the $14.99.\nThe game is not very demanding of one's PC. I believe it would only get mildly laggy if there were a number of explosions in one area. Also, the download size isn't large.\nThis game has a lot of cool features. RwR offers a "level up" system in which you soar through the ranks (Private, Private First Class, Corporal, etc.). In order to be promoted, you must earn a certain amount of XP from killing hostiles and from completing other tasks. Also, you can form your own squad out of soldiers who are around you. Your squad size will increase as you are promoted.  When you start a new campaign, be prepared to sit in front of your computer for hours on end (most likely for just two). I have only completed one campaign... It took me over two hours.\nOn the other hand, the AI can be a tad bit annoying. For example, an AI (on your team) may stand still in front of your moving vehicle. They won't move (most of the time). This will cause you to lose points. Also, quite a few of your fellow soldiers may stick around your base/spawn and never leave. Other than these minor issues, the game is quite perfect.\nAfter the first 30 seconds of the game, I knew I made the right choice in buying this game. Though some may find it pricey, I find that the content of the game is well worth the price. I recommend this game to all people who like shooters.\n\n","June 27, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game itself for £11 or £7 as i write this review, is more than worth the asking price as in return you are getting a fun, strategic shooter that combines elements from nintendo games such as cannon fodder along side the scales of battles from the Total War franchise. The devs are highly active on the community pages and the game is never left 'dead' at any given time with updates being worked on throughout the weeks. I have had nothing but fun playing this game online, coop and single player, each providing a different experience each time with a ton of replayability. I encourage you to try it for yourself with the free demo provided on the RWR website and buy the game in the future as it deserves more publicity than the mainstream **** that is clogging the store at the moment.\n\nPros - Huge Ai battles, like seriously huge.\n3 individual armies with unique weapons/looks\nMultiple ways of playing\nCoop/online with bots\nWide range of weapons and vehicles\nRadio supports such as paratroopers, mortar strikes, artillery and vehicle drops\nSmall miniboss' with unique loot/weapons\nmassive maps all unique\nDifferent Game modes\nDeployable and static emplacements to build fortifications\nHelpful Ai\n\nCons (not really the correct term) -\nYou will die alot due to Ai, but hey it's a war\nSome Ai vehicle drivers can get stuck and frustrate you\nNot all Ai will charge enemy positions meaning you will need to do alot of work in order to win\nSome missions can be hard especiall by yourself (end mission for greycollars) PLAY WITH FRIENDS!\n\nApart from those minor, and i mean minor, 'cons' this game is great and i look forward to the next updates to see what will be added next, especially as the devs are open to ideas from the fans!\n\n","November 26, 2014","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ted Bundy, he said in a voice choked with blood and agony "press space to continue"\n\nThis is a fantastic little game. To sum it up briefly, you play one of the expendable extras in a huge battle scene. The difficulty is quite hard to manage at first, and I'm not necessarily sold on the whole top-down camera angle, but if you persist, you'll find a cover system that is intuitive and easy to use and a hugely enjoyable combat system. As you play, you acquire experience which translates into promotions to higher ranks which allow you to control larger and larger squads as well as unlocking new weapons, equipment and support calls. This is an excellent way of gradually introducing new game concepts to new players. It's quite rewarding to finally make it to the point where you have a large squad following you as you, well armed and armored, sweep through huge mobs of enemies.\n\nThat said, a few things stop this game from reaching its true potential. You don't get to keep your rank across campaigns or different servers, making the effort of progression feel somewhat futile. I wouldn't object to resetting rank as an option in campaigns and servers because you can rank up very fast if you're doing well, but it would be nice to have a rank, and unlocks that you could carry across multiple singleplayer games, for one's own enjoyment. It strikes me that this game is meant for patient players who value a sense of delayed gratification, and I think most who fit into that category would appreciate some sense of tangible reward for their efforts outside of just the match they're in.\n\nIt would also be nice if the game would adopt the steam workshop as many wonderful mods for this game exist but can be hard to track down.\n\nTLDR 4/5\nPros\n-solid gameplay\n-good sense of humor\n-devs still seem to update\n\nCons\n-loss of rank/equipment progress at end of campaigns and switching servers\n-potentially aggravating for people with little patience","October 23, 2015","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/recoush/recommended/270150/","recoush","Bowman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/recoush/","167 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDefinitely worth $15 but I got lucky and got it for $10 from a sale.\n\nThe game is incredibly entertaining and deep regardless of its apparant simplicity of UI and graphics. The graphics are a sort of smoothed / voxel shaded look that reminds me a tad of borderlands and a certain Wolfire Worlds tech demo I saw a while ago. They look very nice from my point of view and I like what the artists have done.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, many of the other reviewers here seem to be comparing it to battlefield and I can't help but agree with them- at least to some extent. The game is a sort of isometric warzone where you control one soldier and can gain rank by killing enemy soldiers and doing special objectives (like capturing an enemy supply truck, which has other effects other than just exp). As you gain rank you gain access to more weapons: unlike other games though these weapons arent necessarily just upgrades- they all fill some form of role and if you want to do everything you won't be able to find one weapon that satisfies all criteria. However, you also gain the ability to lead around some of your fellow AI soldiers into battle in a squad for every 1000 exp (up to a maximum of 10). With the combination of extra weapons available to your character and extra soldiers available to lead you can become quite the force on the battlefield, even when a normal battle can have anywhere from 100 to 800 soldiers active. While 800 soldiers may sound like a lot, and it certainly is, the maps are still fairly large- with what I figure was 2-300 soldiers there were battles all across of anywhere from 20-40 troops during the campaign, which at 7 hours in I have yet to finish (though that is partially my own fault, as I believe I failed to help my allies a few too many times and we got completely pushed back from about 6 points across the map- essentially right back to our base).\n\nAnother nice thing is that, even though the game is isometric, your view of the world has both positives and negatives. To allow your to make use of varying ranges on weapons there is a sort of "camera tug" that follows your crosshairs instead of just centering your view on your character. The benefit is being able to see far ahead, like you would normally be able to if it was first-person, while the downside is the possibility of being flanked far more easily because you can't see your character at all anymore if you are using some longer-ranged weaponry. Shorter ranged weapons still have some slight downsides in that all weapons have ranges greater than you can normally see when you are centered on your character, and so if you get flanked you won't necessarily see that you have been until you are already being shot at.\n\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable and I am having a lot of fun. Here are some overall pointers for those of you who just want some quick info :\n+ Well-done UI that aims for ease of use and readability while being unobtrusive\n+ Decently replayable as no battle will be the same, especially in multiplayer\n+ Graphics are also well done and I personally really enjoy the aesthetic\n+ Lots of options (tactically)- the maps are all very open and large\n+ With 10 soldiers following you at the higher ranks you can definitely change how the battle plays out\n+ You can change the battle even being a lone soldier if you are a good shot\n\n\n- Driving AI could use some work it seems but is otherwise solid\n- Early Access at the time of this review, current state is easily release-worthy though (minus the driving AI, of course)\n- There honestly isn't much I dislike about this game, easily worth the money","December 27, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Multiplayer is active and fun. Is realistic in it's own way.  It does have a slight learning curve at first but once you get the general idea of what you are doing it is really fun. You can command an AI controlled squad once you reach the rank of Corporal (1000 XP) You lose xp upon death and gain xp upon kills.  You gain RP to purchase and use options in your radio (Not available until the rank of Corporal)  Vehicles include, tanks, APC, troop transports, jeeps, dune buggy with a mounted machine gun,  spawn vehicles, and armory vehicles . You fight for territory on large maps over objectives.  Armory includes anything from C4, Rockets, MachineGuns, Rifles, Mortors, Turrets , Riot Shields , Grenades (Flash Bangs, Hand Grenade, Impact Grenades) , body armor (EOD Suits, Bullet proof vests) .  The AI is very smart so playing alone in single player and co-op is fun if you're are not into PVP . The radio: Call  reinforcements , artillery,  Sandbags for cover (Also in the Armory) ,  vehicles.  I'm sure there are more things I prolly left out but this is the basics of it. If you buy, you more than likely will enjoy it.  The only thing is , the ladders on buildings can be a bit buggy sometimes other than that, everything rocks. The graphics are very enjoyable too.\n\nPros- No voice chat\nExtremely fun\nActive Multiplayer\nLots of Weapons\nLots of Vehicles\nLarge Maps.\nAll Factions can fight on single map.\nTaking cover and firing system is great.\nRealistic.\nA toaster can run this.\nFriendly Community.\n\nCons- No voice chat\nbuggy ladders (sometimes)\nTutorial doesn't help much.","February 14","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of the few games i've ever playyed that has made the thought "war is hell" pop up in my head legitimatly. A fight can take 5 minutes, or a hour or two, and a whole map can take 30 minutes, or almost a whole day, i dont know how long a campaign could take, because at time of writing i have yet to complete one. On the same day of writing this, we had spent a solid two hours on the last base, attempting to capture it, always being just barely pushed out by their APC, until we stole it, (fun fact, if you go to a enemy vehicle and hit space or whatever you have entering a vehicle binded to, you will rip who ever was in the seat out, that took me a bit to learn.) then we easily broke the stalemate.                                        [9/10] Would reccomend, like a 2D battlefield / planetside, AI is on par with human players, battles take time, requires teamwork, Rambo's die fast as they run into the hail of bullets, stealth and sabotage are funtional and rewarding.","February 17","true","56.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd say get a group of friends together to play it and have some fun on a private server. Combat is just what you'd expect, though much more punishing. You'll be dead quite often but it isn't frustratingly so. Infantry AI is smart, looking for cover when under fire and behaving to expectations, you can even pin them down with constant fire and they appear to not want to move.\n\nBehind line missions are cool, getting a camo suit and a silenced sub-machinegun and sneaking some C4 on an enemy radio tower is nice.

The game has a solid campaign with a big overview map and a last boss map. You can play these maps over and over and try different routes and tactics.\n\nI've played mostly Coop so I can't speak for the PVP part, which I don't like. Against the NPC and AI, the game is like a single player experience except you can have friends help you out and push. PVP is a different story because you can't hide in grass and if you see your enemy, they most likely see you.\n\nThere's 2 combat vehicles for all teams which is an APC and a tank. You can have a HMMW flown in which is not part of the team's assets.\n\nThe game uses RP points as currency for buying weapons and assets which is a solid balanced currency. Most enemies drop RP worthy loot upon death and you recover these items and sell them. Gaining RP is also fairly easy, just stay in a capture zone and kill enemies.\n\nOne thing to note about the combat is that there is no health system in the game. Each gun has a probability to hit at a certain range and if it goes past 100%, the target dies. In order to prevent death, units can wear body armor which gives 2 chances of surviving a hit and a third which puts the unit down for a medic.\n\nPros and cons:\n+ 32 player servers where each player can have a maximum of ten AI squad mates which allows for 320 units of in game units for a team + the stationary AI units that defend points.\n+ Large variety of weapons and balance.\n+ Large maps with close quarters.\n+ Lengthy battles (one map can last 4 hours).\n+ Cartoon style.\n+ Good performance with 32 players.\n\n- Unlimited tickets for teams (Yes, this is a con, after killing 300 waves of enemies that can't be halted it gets tedious).\n- No smoke grenades or deployable smoke screen.\n- APCs and Tanks looses health from grenades.\n- Somewhat rage inducing.\n\nThe game looks cheesy but it's very fun and very serious.","December 28, 2015","true","81.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The advertisement blurb does it justice. A top down shooter might not seem like something with deep combat, but the beauty of it is just that. No 'health', getting shot means death. However - the way this works is very interesting compared to other games of this. It means there is a CHANCE to be killed, and the chance varies between weapons / ranges. In this case, let's look at a shotgun. Close range one pellet is almost gaurenteed to kill you, long range you'll see a bloodsplat and nothing else. It's beyond comprehension at first but is forgiving as well as I suppose comparatively realistic. Although this may sound like you won't be dying a lot, believe me, you will die.\nAdd on the new steam workshop, and you've got a heck of a time!","May 12","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Textures seem to be alright, although they won't really make any difference in game play.\n\nThe game play itself can get very intense. Every death matters greatly and playing single player on a harder difficulties makes that aspect of the game even more enjoyable. As for multiplayer, one can spend hours just playing a single match and still be as engaged as when they started. Granted, this game will not give you any easy wins so don't go in expecting to gain something big every single playtime. You won't need to worry about the AI as they are superb and are the real backbone of the entire game.\n\nOverall this game is great if you are open minded to different game genres, it has great replay value, and for the price it it's a steal. That being said, if you aren't willing to spend hours on end for one single match (which is still really fun btw) then this might not be the game for you.\n\nP.S: If you do get the game, make sure to find a friend who is willing to get it as well.","May 18","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most top-down shooters are "run-n-gun" and "spray-n-pray" but RWR is WAY MORE.  The use of cover and stealth is VERY important.  Also, the multiplayer functionality is amazing.  There are a few "flaws" here and there, but, once you understand the game dynamics, those "flaws" quickly vanish.  The BIGGEST downfall is the often-ness of death.  Transitioning from games where death is uncommon or rare, into RWR, where death is always 45 sec.s around the corner, can get frustrating.  But, it is part of the learning curve of the game.  Once that hurdle is cleared, RWR will give you hrs....days....MONTHS of enjoyment.","May 23","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The advertisement blurb does it justice. A top down shooter might not seem like something with deep combat, but the beauty of it is just that. No 'health', getting shot means death. However - the way this works is very interesting compared to other games of this. It means there is a CHANCE to be killed, and the chance varies between weapons / ranges. In this case, let's look at a shotgun. Close range one pellet is almost gaurenteed to kill you, long range you'll see a bloodsplat and nothing else. It's beyond comprehension at first but is forgiving as well as I suppose comparatively realistic. Although this may sound like you won't be dying a lot, believe me, you will die.\nAdd on the new steam workshop, and you've got a heck of a time!","May 12","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can either choose to use tactics, or just go guns blazing. There is a vast array of weaponry and gear to use, and lots of vehicles to choose from. I personally really like the radio calls. You can call mortar and artillery support, you can call for airborne reinforcements, and so much more. The battles are very balanced, for me at least.\n\nProblems: There aren't any problems I've ran into.

If you struggle (or are unwilling) to adapt to challenges then this will only annoy you.\n\nRWR is an amazingly simple and intuitive concept masterfully executed. You are just another soldier on a battlefield filled with soldiers and you will die as easily as any other soldier\n\nWhere most games today simply reward you for progression RWR punishes you for making mistakes. You will die often and maybe even become frustrated. But you will soon figure out what a mistake is and realize that you can avoid making those mistakes if you focus.\n\nIf you're patient and carefully execute sound plans then you will be rewarded with a sense of satisfaction that very few games are capable of providing. You are just one guy on a massive battlefield and can very easily have little effect on the world around you.\n\nAfter playing a while, when my mind started to tire, I had a tendency to start rushing or not to consider my actions properly; those were the times that the enemy pushed forward and if I was lucky, I would only be stranded on the wrong side of enemy lines.\n\nIt makes me feel human and fragile. It made me feel many things: good and bad but all of it positive. Most AAA titles I see are like candy: tasty but expensive and shallow.

Your mission is to take over enemy territory until you are the only faction with territory left on the map. Pretty straight-forward, but it's easier said than done. If you're playing with vanilla settings (the way it should be), you'll find that going rambo like in all those other games won't work. At all. Working with all the other soldiers in the army is absolutely necessary if you want to succeed. You'll start as a grunt; not much more than cannon fodder. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and start killing off more than 2 troops a life, you'll gain ranks and soon, you can command your own squadron. When you get here, you won't need to follow the commander's orders that much; instead you think you could do more damage by leading a strike squad to that isolated base over there. From an expendable troop to a valuable leader - that's where the beauty of this game lies. Another important piece of this game lies in the RP (Resource Points) system. Using resource points, you can change your equipment as well as call down support from HQ in the form of artillery, paratroopers, etc. Getting RP requires you to gather information on enemy vehicles, capture territory, and safely delivering that chewing gum you found back to base. But the most important thing to remember about RWR is that it's all about tactics. If you and the enemy are locked in a stalemate, maybe you should try flanking them while they're preoccupied with your allies. If you've got a silenced weapon, put that to use by sneaking into the enemy base unaware. For an kinda silly game, RWR is perhaps one of the best war simulations to have ever been created.","November 10, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

RWR is a top-down tactical shooter with incredibly high AI populations and a one-of-many mentality that keeps you moving from cover to cover, instead of blazing through running and gunning. The maps are expansive, well populated, and pretty. Everything in this game is largely polished, keeping in mind that it IS still in beta.\n\nMost importantly, the developers keep an incredibly close dialogue with us Beta players through the forums and server play. As a player suggesting changes, it feels like the devs are really listening!

This game is for anyone who has had that want/need to find a game where you are NOT the hero or more important character in the game. You are literally placed on the same level with the obviously really stupid AI soldiers that you happen to fight with. You will have to work and do things that actually contribute to the battle in order to gain any XP and the XP rewarded is not given freely. I like the fact that after 2 hours of fighting I am only ranked a Corporal or a Sargeant. You will be given the option to preform behind enemy line missions of assasinating/knifing(for more XP) enemy officers(who actually looks different then the grunts that he happens to be leading in a flank or a big push up the middle. You could also go and destroy enemy structures like fuel, water, raid stashes, etc etc. Or you can jump into the grinder and die many times as you assault the enemy's line probing for a weakness or hole. Also vehicles feel overpowered(mowing down infantry foolish enough to leave themselves exposed for a second or two and can be destroy with 2 or 3 rockets(depending on where you hit them). This game will take a few hours to get down the whole line of sight, cover, terran and which weapons/faction suits your playstyle that makes it feel like a different battle every time I have played. (3 different battles on the same map felt different as the starting postitions are seem random and the bots don't act the same every battle.)","August 28, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After RWR left Early Access I played a game in which none of these newcomers wanted to actually complete maps, just sit around and farm rare weapons, like it was the point of the game.\n\nIf you just play the game normally, you get plenty of rare items, there is no reason to do something as boring as farm items. What made it worse was the hijacking of crucial vehicles to do their farming. It's bad enough they didn't want to complete the map, but they prevented others from completing the map.\n\nIf item farming is your thing, go right ahead. But the community here has gotten nasty.\n\n**********************************************************\nTraded in a porn mag for weapons & grenades. 9/10\n\n\n\nOn a more serious and thorough note, this game has quite a bit of potential. Right now, it's somewhat prone to lag and desync errors, and the NYC server is unstable and probably in desperate need of a reboot, but the game itself is quite challenging and entertaining... even more so when pvp. And the fact that aimbots count for nothing is rather endearing. No matter how well you "aim," your soldier may not be as accurate as you are, and your weapon may have more spray and recoil than you'd like.\n\nUltimately, this game will teach you some core basics that any actual soldier knows very well: (1) Cover is King, (2) Flank the enemy if you want to eliminate him fast and with minimal casualties, (3) Sometimes the only way to proceed is with heavy weapons support [i.e. tanks or artillery].\n\nThere is a lot of potential for expansion. I'd love to see air support added (not just paratroopers, maybe smart bomb strikes that are always on-target and arrive quickly). I think the AA guns are a cool mechanic, but it would be awesome if they were a deployable that could shoot down enemy reinforcements, perhaps like a mortar you could hop in one and shoot down planes via a special interface.\n\nAnd I know they have the mines and tank traps disabled by default, but perhaps they could be deployables via some sort of engineering tool that could also fix tanks and other vehicles. The inclusion of an engineer tool would drastically change the dynamic of the game. You would actually see damaged vehicles retreat instead of the kamikaze charges they make when the vehicle reaches <20%.\n\nLastly, I think they could borrow and modify an idea from Battlefield. I feel like it'd be neat if a high ranking player, perhaps at least a Captain or Master Sergeant, could request a Supply Drop. It would parachute in and work like an Armory, but only for a certain amount of exchanges, and you can only buy at it, not sell. Or maybe you have to pay for everything inside it upon requisitioning it, and then it works like a public mini-stash. And it would be very, very destroyable, so you wouldn't want to do it in combat. The only reason I mention this is that on some maps, you have a severe tactical disadvantage of having no nearby armories. It gets to the point where I regularly stash equipment in my stash because there's a better chance of a stash being nearby a crucial point. A supply drop mechanic would alleviate this and reduce the frustration of some players who are stuck without AT weapons and the enemy is just going to town with a tank or two.\n\nThe game is still in Early Access, and I expect great things from it. Even if nothing more is added, it's a great game with balance and it forces you to react and think on your feet. Innovative strategies are rewarded and thinking outside the box can win the day. Give it a shot. I'd say two gamers in three will enjoy this game.","December 19, 2014","false","84.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Here's what happens throughout the game. You spawn on a map, a very large map. You are a grunt in an army of hundreds of other grunts. You are not some super soldier able to waltz through and take on the entire enemy army. You are simply a lowly soldier following orders. At least at first. Killing enemies gets you xp which will rank you up as you play. This xp is persistent throughout the campaign. Getting ranked up allows you to attach 1 more ally to your own squad up to a max of 10 (at the moment). Once you reach a certain rank, you get a radio that you can use to call in paratrooper support, artillery, vehicles, etc. The higher your rank, the more available calls you have.  You use the game "currency" to "buy" these calls: RP or Resource Points. Resource points are obtained by capturing objective locations or completing side objectives or picking up and selling both gear and rare item drops from fallen enemies at the friendly armory on the map. Theat typical way you complete a mission is by capturing all areas on the map. Once that is done, extraction points open up to neighboring maps (you can see them in the top right of the current-map screen by pressing tab). The campaign as of right now is essentially to take control of all of these maps.\n\nAlso, death is inevitable. When you die, you can either press space to spawn at the nearest spaw point or bring up the map to click on a spawn point manually (little yellow dots). Dying will remove a small amount of xp and rp. Also...your soldier gets a new name every time you respawn (not the same as your username in multiplayer) really adding to the feel that your just one disposable soldier among hundreds.\n\n------------\n\nThat being said, I THOROUGHLY enjoy this game. Here's why:\n\n-PICK UP AND PLAY: The game's save system is quick and easy, and loading a save brings you literally right back to the moment you press "save and quit". The gameplay is simple and addictive.\n\n-DEEP GAMEPLY: Just because it's simple doesn't mean it isn't deep. This game is highly tactical and gets you thinking about how you will approach the objective both immediate and in the larger strategy being given to you by the commander who issues orders for the army, marking the next capture location on the map and the direction from which you will be assaulting. The depth of tactical choices to be made is compounded by your quite apparent mortality. You die very easily. Technically you have "1" health, but a more accurate way to put it is that each weapon has a certain kill percentage. In other words, each bullet that travels out of your gun has a certain percentage to be a lethal bullet. If that hits you, you're immediately dead. This can be temporarily circumvented by purchasing vests at an armory, but nevertheless you die very easily. Tactics are of utmost importance. The simple run and gun method does not work in this game. Again, this is because you are simply one among hundreds just like you.\n\n- HUGE MAPS: This may seem trivial, but I find the maps to be extremely good. There is constant fighting in different critical locations across the map, and you aren't "forced" to go to the location that the commander AI has marked on your map (though the majority of your forces will go there). You most definitely don't feel constricted to a single tactic in any given skirmish on the map.\n\n- CHARM COMIN' OUT THE EARS: This game's style is simply fantastic. The soldiers are made of little voxels and the overall feel of the game comes across as somewhat cartoony, but still has a kind of gritty and realistic feel while your playing. I think this is because the shapes are simple and so seem a bit cartoony, but the color palettes and lighting are very realistic. Not only that, but the battlefield changes as you play. Blood will start to stain the ground more where prolonged fights have taken place. Explosions leave grungy textures behind. Car wreckages from exploded vehicles begin to populate the field. It's really awesome to be on a map for a long time and see it change as you play.\n\n- ABOVE AVERAGE AI: I don't say this in a sweeping statement, but when it comes to fights they are fairly competent. With maps so large and with tactics being so necessary to success, the enemy really puts up a fantastic fight. It is definitely not an easy task to successfully conquer an entire map, especially in 3-way battles. They have their flaws, but overall the AI has a lot going for it so far.\n\n-BEST POTENTIAL FOR MULTIPLAYER I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE: The player base is simply not there yet (though there is usually one pretty populated server going most of the time with around 20-40 players in it [pvp still with a couple hundred AI as well]), but man if it ever does get there...wow. Having that large of a scale of "mini-war" (seems like everything gives a neat 'tiny' feel in the game) with the amount of available tactics to each human player would be simply beyond fun. Basically imagine an RTS without base building and one person is controlling each unit manually and with no boring simple right clicking (i.e. - keyboard and mouse moving and shooting). I have played a touch of multiplayer (currently bad internet :() and it was pretty fantastic! Anyway, it has amazing potential.\n\n-VERY MOD FRIENDLY: It doesn't have Steam Workshop support yet, but mods are already coming out. Some really neat ones, too. Someone has a mod that replaces some gun models with Warhammer 40k bolters. There's also someone working on a zombie survival mod as well. Maps can also be created by the community! The game is going to heavily support mods. Any game that does that always adds so much time to its lifespan and the community almost always ends up improving the game.\n\n-DEVS ARE SUPER FRIENDLY, SUPER ACTIVE, AND CONTINUOUSLY REPLY TO MOST COMMUNITY POSTS: 'Nuff said.\n------------\n\nHere are some negatives:\n\n- AI DRIVING/SOMETIMES PATHING: The AI simply cannot drive vehicles well at all. You don't want to be a passenger when the AI is driving. Their pathing is generally igood, but they don't handle ladders well. This can create a problem on limiting tactics on certain areas of certain maps, but this is VERY VERY VERY few and far between. Regardless, the AI can still be a bit wonky with ladders.\n\n- CAN NOT DIRECTLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF BATTLE: When the AI commander marks a new capture objective, the majority of your allies will assault that location and you can't change it. So if you think capturing a certain other location would serve better strategic purpose, it will be a lot more difficult to capture that location as the vast majority of your forces will be going where the AI commander marked. You can make it easier, but it will be very, very expensive through spending a LOT of RP on paratrooper reinforcement squads of 8 or 4.  This isn't ALL bad as I have personally made some strategic decisions with regards to capture order that was against the order of the AI commander and successfully pulled them off tactically speaking, and my decision, though difficult and costly, did actually help my team out greatly as it put us in a better position.\n\n- CAN NOT PLAY AS OTHER FACTIONS IN CAMPAIGN MODE RIGHT NOW: Fortunately this will be added...I think in the next patch (o.96) even..\n\n-MULTIPLAYER PLAYER-BASE NOT VERY LARGE: D:\n\n------CLOSING------\n\nI close with the mention of a small multiplayer player-base because the only way for it to grow is if someone like you, Mr. Reader, buys the game and plays it! The more buys, the more multiplayer, the more absolute amazingness! :D\n\nSolid 9/10","May 31, 2014","true","20.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have to be quick and careful there is NO HEALTH BAR, instead every bullet has a chance of killing you this forces you to use cover where and when possible as well as crouching as well as going prone to make you a smaller target.\n\nThe objective of the game is to capture all the bases on the map (usually) usually however each team will be attacking a particular base instead of troops mindlessly walking into each others base, however that is not to say that you and a team of troops can't go behind enemy lines and capture one of their bases with less guards, or better yet go to those bases with explosives and take out important structures for logistical support such as mortar ammunition and oil depots. Stealth is a legitamate method of playing this game as there is a fairly solid stealth system in place where you need to creep around without being seen, there are silenced weapons to make your job easier, nothing feels more rewarding then sneaking into an enemy base undetected, placing C4 on their radio tower, fuel deposits and mortar ammunition and blowing it all sky high and getting out undetected.\n\nThe most important thing I like about this game is that no matter what you're doing it always feels fun, whether your leading the charge on foot or in a tank against a hotly contested base or assembling a crack team of players and going behind enemy lines to sabotage their operations it always feels like your doing something and that you're contributing to the team. The AI can also be very smart able to perform flanking manovers in fast moving vehicles severely limiting your operations or in fire-fights the AI is very careful to surround you then attack making it a challenge to face up against them. That said the AI can also be a bit stupid, but its a fault that is probably going to be fixed and is easily overlooked.\n\nsummary:\n\nPros:\n*Neat faction system with large free for all battles\n*Competent AI at times\n*You always feel like you're somehow contributing to victory whether your playing Commando or the front-line hero\n*Lots of mod support\n*Leading a squad of up to ten men is fun!\n*one hit kill system makes every fight a heart-racing challenge.\n\nCons:\n*promotion system is a pain if you play on a lot of servers, as of now Ranks, Resource points and XP do not transfer server to server.\n*Allied AI can be stupid with vehicles at times or brilliant, like real players.\n*Some bugs, but as of writing this it is early access, what did you expect?\n\nverdict:\n9/10 - Are you still reading this?

Big maps, hundreds of troops on the battlefield. The variety of weapons and accessories are increasing with almost every uptade. Tanks, deployable machine guns, mortar strikes, paratroopers, everything that you need in a war game. The single player mode is fun, but the multiplayer is the best, especially with friends.","June 22, 2014","true","80.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It rewards cautious players who stick to cover, advance slowly and plan ahead. I think that the co-op multiplayer experience is the high point of this title, and the pvp is fun - good luck finding a server with anyone playing, though. Co-op servers are always populated, in my experience.\n\nYou'll level up, earn a larger squad to control, unlock better weapons and body armor, etc, as you kill more and more enemies.\n\nThe depth of this game sort of reveals itself the longer you play and the more skilled you become - and the more skilled players you play with - setting up cover deployments, weapon deployments (more on this further on....) moving the frontline up with other players, calling airstrikes, reenforcements, relocating armory/communication/respawn trucks... it's all really good, co-op fun. The gunplay and sounds are very satisfying, and each weapon has its pros and cons. There is no super weapon... maybe the P90. My favourite assault rifle is the Famas.\n\nThis game has a ton of potential, and I realize it's a small time, independent affair, but there are a few negatives. (I'm aware that this game is being patched, but still, I review this as it stands today.)\n\nCover deployment and weapon deployment (stationary MGs, miniguns, TOW launchers) seem to deploy in a random orientation and with minds of their own. There is no option to rotate cover or deployable weapons, they are placed down in the orientation that you are handed. If the MG you spent your hard earned resource points on is facing the opposite direction that you'd like - well, tough ♥♥♥♥. It's frustrating. Sometimes you will deploy a cover item and it will inexplicably roll onto you and kill you. Or deploy in a manner completely opposite the preview.  Sometimes it won't show up at all. Sometimes it will take ten times longer to deploy than it should and that ends up getting you killed. You will get good at timing the enemies approach vs placing a cover block. If you do get good at this, you can easily hide behind your sandbags and take out 30 enemy soldiers without breaking a sweat.  Out of cover, you'll be dead in one or two shots.\n\nDoes it seem like I am talking about cover too much? Maybe so, but it's the most important life extending aspect of the game, right after body armor. And maybe riding in a tank.\n\nAnyways, it's not without its flaws as a game, the graphics are basic and leave a lot to be desired, but overall, I have enjoyed this title FAR more than many other higher priced games that I've played this year. It's incredibly addictive and incredibly fun.\n\nGet ready to rage quit as you try ten times to respawn and collect your rare blue weapons and items that you lost upon death only to die over and over in a suicidal attempt to save dat lewt.\n\nLoves it.","August 20, 2015","true","45.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You really do get to feel like a grunt on the front lines. Elements like elevation, light of sight, and cover are key to survival in this top-down shooter. As you progress through the open-world campaign, you'll gain experience and military rank, affording you access to better equiptment and weapons. At first, you'll be a lowly private, relying on your own skill and a bit of luck to keep you alive. However, as you rise through the ranks, you'll be able to command other troops and call in air-drops. Death comes with an xp penalty too. Though you'll likely die a lot, this makes each new respawn feel important as running and gunning wont get you far in RWR. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys war games. You can literally go whereever you want on huge maps and approach each objective your way. It really does provide the feeling of fighting in an army.\n\n10/10 Excellent open-world top-down tactical shooter!","August 3, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
