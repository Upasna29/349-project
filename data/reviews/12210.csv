And Rockstar is aware of these issues but won't produce a patch. Otherwise GTA IV is awesome.\n\nTo get the game to run if you are on Windows 8.1 (and maybe lower) you need to download and install the latest Games For Windows Live.  Yes GFWL is cancer but it is required. Just Google it and hope the download link is still up. (It is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you need this considering GFWL is DEAD and no longer supported.)\n\nThen if you have a video card above 2 gigs you need to do two things to ensure it runs properly. GTA IV assumes you do not meet the requirements and limits your graphics settings. To get around this make a file in the GTA IV install folder called "commandline.txt" without the qoutes. Then put "-nomemrestrict -norestrictions" without the qoutes inside of the file and save. Then goto your Steam launch settings for the game and put those two settngs in there like the you did the file.\n\nYou are welcome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/recommended/12210/","mendozacheers","Mendozacheers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/","4519 products in account","This is the successor of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and the sixth installment in the series (not counting the portable and mobile releases). GTA is one of the most successful western video game franchises and it is most known for it's intense violence, drugs and nudity. Not to an extreme level though, as the series objective is to stay relatively realistic and to depict true criminal situations. e.g. gangs, mobs, drug dealing etc.\n\nAll Grand Theft Auto games are set in fictional cities that try to replicate real American ones. They are also set in different time periods and do not bind together story-wise, but some characters and/or events are being referenced from time to time. Unlike Vice City and San Andreas, GTAIV is set in modern times in Liberty City. Which is the same setting as the older title GTA3 is set in, which might explain the choice of GTAIV's name.\n\nLiberty City is a replica / parody of New York, with famous land marks such as The Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building. As well as very well replicated areas of Brooklyn, Manhattan and New Jersey. You play as the illegal (?) immigrant Niko Bellic, which has recently arrived from "the old country" (Eastern Europe) via boat. You therefore are immediately orchestrated to break the law, it is expected of you. Probably because you play a GTA game... I mean, of course you are going to break the law!\n\nTo be expected, this game has very much improved graphics, physics and story compared to San Andreas (which was a kick-♥♥♥ GTA, I might add), and the game was very much ahead of it's time when it came out. It quickly became very successful on both Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. When it ended up on PC, 9 months down the line, the port itself was rather hideous. This game could completely tank a high-end PC on medium settings, making it unavailable for the majority of the player-base. Even today, this game is very demanding, but nothing a modern computer can't handle.\n\nWhat is it about? As if you didn't know already.... Steal a car, drive over a couple of pedestrians, pull out your SMG and mow down a few cops to get some heat, race on the highway while causing havok all over the place, see the cars crumble when you (or the cops) smash into them, end it all with an insane stunt, setting fire to everything and everyone and make a big BOOM. Probably dragging you down in the process, die and respawn in the hospital where you can just repeat everything all over.\n\nThere's this satisfaction about just being a complete outlaw in a peaceful city, that no other game can really deliver. GTAIV is no different, although the lack of airplanes is a minus and should not have been left out. 9/11 be damned, I want to fly a ♥♥♥♥ing jet. Other than that, this game is phenomenal - it's not just the gameplay, but the story, the humor and the amount of details put into the game. This game will make your hours disappear, and your violence-o-meter to rise sky high.\n\nPick this game up if you want free roaming, open-world, non-stop action, car crashing extravaganza set in a realistic world and with a good story.\n\nNote: This game currently requires SecuROM, Games for Windows Live and Rockstar Games Social Club. So 3 extrenal DRM's in addition to Steam.","November 9, 2013","true","59.9"," 586 of 752 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","586","752","0","28"

Why?\nThe procedure is the usual, we download and we get a serial key. Fine. Start the game and first thing we have to do is login with a Rockstar Social Club. Which I still believe has no reason to exist, but since this is their game I can live with it... Until their own launcher doesn't let me log in many random times for unknown reasons. Luckily it's necessary for online games only so I skip that passage as I'm not interested. Fine let's play! NO. Now you have to face Games for Windows Live, a dead platform badly working which You need TO MANUALLY UPDATE FIRST, because NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF DOING IT WHEN THE PLATFORM DIED, then it pretends your login and your serial code. OK, I'm almost running out of patience here but many games on steam require further registration with another platform (uPlay, Origin...), so ok. Then it's mayhem. I've read about A WHOLE LOT of people with this same issue: I've bought a 4-pack so I've registered all my serials on my account and all my friends' except for one which isn't recognized. There's NO WAY to get a solution for this (and I'm NOT even considering the trick where you're supposed to buy Episodes from liberty city to use its serial as GTA IV serial because I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BUY MORE TO USE WHAT I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR). Steam isn't responsible and claims it's rockstar or microsoft issue, Microsoft doesn't even have a number to call as GFWL is dead, Rockstar doesn't care and I've only read of just one user that came out of this by threatening Rockstar of SUING THEM and after a VEEERY long time he got a new serial.\nAfter all these troubles IF we're lucky we can get to the game... Or maybe not. Obviously On modern systems there HAS to be issues as The game allows to change your graphic Details ONLY IF it detects enough VRAM.Too bad that it doesn't recognize anything at all. Luckily A couple of command strings SHOULD be enough to bypass that problem. Let's press the "Play" button... Loading...Loading...Loading... REALLY?!?!? Luckily seems like another command strings solve that problem as well, but it's really ridiculous considering all the money they got they didn't support nor fixed any of these problems.\n\nGTA IV (as a Game)\n\nAnyways, after a good dose of patience and luck, once inside the game it gives some satisfaction. I've played the whole franchise since the first GTA (except for london) so I've seen the evolution of the games and I have to say this chapter is a huge leap forward.\nThe gameplay is basically the same, third person action, you can do almost anything you want but if you want to follow the story and the missions it can be summarized as Running, shooting, stealing cars and drive away. In this chapter the gameplay introduces the cover systems which kind of helps in difficult situations and shootings. What makes the game particular is the really big map, a lively city with so many things to do, which means huge replayability. Liberty City is split in various "islands" connected with bridges... Closed at the beginning, as usual and there are the usual stores, spray'n'go, weapons and so on. Besides that there are also reastaurants, fast food, clothes shops and similar, among with the new leisure activities, such as bowling, strip clubs, cabaret and whatever, used mainly to maintain your reputation with friends and girlfriends. Yes, you can choose to date girls, and go out with friends which will call you anytime on your ingame mobile to invite you somewhere, and wether you accept or not it will influence the "level of friendship", which is kind of important as once you reach the top level they can help you out with their own abilities (call a cab, car bombs, weapons and more). Important or not it can be kind of annoying as girlfriends will always look at your clothes which you must change often and choose carefully according to their taste, and friends will often call to invite you... quite often... At any time... even while you're on mission or already out with someone else...\nAnyways, Looks like Rockstar did a really good job with the story as well, which was to be expected, but now they've taken everything to the next level with their new graphic engine with good direction skills and by taking good shots. You also have to make a choice towards the end and this will lead to two very different endings. And they're both quite bitter if I may say but I really liked the story anyways.\nThe new engine does its job and shows the beauties of liberty city. Of course sometimes there are the usual glitches where some map elements are loaded later, or maybe sometimes the game will show on the road only massive copies of your own car but besides that everything is ok.\nThere are few new things I really liked, such as buildings in the city... Meaning you can get inside various buildings, so this time you don't have a city made of impenetrable cubes. Of course most of them are accessible during missions but it gave a nice variation to the gameplay and locations. There's a TON of radio stations, and I love all of them, just like in the previous games, of course. And last thing is something I kind of liked and hated at the same time: the "police wanted system". Once you get the police attention you have to get out of an area of interest whose limits are determined by nearby units that have you onsight. Which is good... And hard to do at the same time as it's quite hard to shake off the units behind AND avoid the large quantity of units incoming ahead of you, which means they will keep you busy with long pursuit sessions before you can shake them off... Especially if you get the attention of choppers.\nOne last thing that really took me some time to get used to is car physics... I mean, it's kind of hard and odd to drive them. Honestly, I don't care too much if it's more realistic than the older games or GTA V, but I can say all the cars are hard to handle, they don't steer enough, Handbrake makes you totally lose control, but after some hours of game I kind of got used to it... Not without some difficulty anyways. ---PROs--- GAMEPLAY. It's GTA, one generation ahead of the trilogy. Many additions and improvements to the game giving you lots of activities to do besides the main campaign.\nLIBERTY CITY. A very big city with lots of places, activities, people around, doing things, everything is really lively in that place. And everythin is built with lot of dedication and care for details. Even rides in Trains have a panoramic cinematic, or rides in taxis with lots of dialogues with the driver.\nSTORY. Story is never to be underestimated in any GTA chapter and this here makes no exception.\n---CONs--- SERIAL ACTIVATION. The biggest flaw with this game is the high chance to fail registering your own Legit Serial Key AND the total lack of assistence. Not to mention the fact that you need to update your Games For Windows Live manually and the Rockstar Social Club randomly doesn't let you log in. THIS is the reason I downvoted this product.\nCOMPATIBILITY ISSUES. It has some issues with modern hardware and modern OS and there's no official patch for this. Luckily there's always the steam community that helped me run GTA IV on my Laptop with Win 10 x64 and a Integrated nVidia GPU.\nCARS. Maybe it's me but I never got used to the car physics, they're quite hard to handle as they never steer enough and you can lose control too easily with handbrake.","May 2","false","34.9"," 79 of 86 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","79","86","3","11"

As with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you have your very own customizable radio station to play your own music while exploring Liberty City.\n\n● The Video Editor. Unfortunately not many developers provide their players with a tool such as the Video Editor, this tool allows you have seemingly endless opportunities for creating videos and screenshots.\n\n● No Weapon Use Restrictions. Unlike its successor Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't restrict the use of your weapons while inside your safehouses or whether you're in a store. Hence, allowing you to shoot anything and everything inside your home as you desire or use it as refuge from the police.\n\n●  Forward Thinking Online Modification Ideology. Regardless of your view on Games for Windows Live, the online aspect of Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't ban users for using modifications but instead segregates those who have modified game files unlike its successor, Grand Theft Auto V. Whenever you would like to rejoin regular sessions, simply remove the modfied files, replace the original ones or reinstall the game.\n\nAspects of Grand Theft Auto IV Worth Criticizing\n● Optimization. Regardless of your hardware specifications or how much you've spent on it, you're going to experience 30 frames per second frame drops while driving at high speeds.\n\n\nDeplorable Digital Rights Management Restrictions\n● Rockstar Social Club. Without signing into the Rockstar Social Club you can't play online or track your statistics on the Social Club. If you want to remove it, simply remove the paul.dll.\n\n● Games for Windows Live. Without a Live account or offline local account you can't save your single player progress. You can easily get around this disgrace by installing a modified version of the xlive.dll. I've linked it below if you would like a purely offline uninterrupted experience.\n\n● SecuROM. This revolting abomination limits your installations of Grand Theft Auto IV to 15. If you frequently change your PC or replace most of your PCs parts, your access to Grand Theft Auto IV will be terminated. Those who pirate this product don't have to worry about limited installations.\n\nSome consumers don't care about their rights for the products they purchase but most of these services treat consumers worse than pirates. Dispite of the stomach-churning digital rights managment restrictions, I recommend Grand Theft Auto IV if the price is right.\n\n| Grand Theft Auto IV Liveless[gtaforums.com] |","September 1, 2015","true","318.5"," 52 of 61 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","52","61","7","4"

The series cheered (and criticized) for glorifying violence has taken an unexpected turn: it's gone legit. Oh sure, you'll still blow up cop cars, run down innocent civilians, bang hookers, assist drug dealers and lowlifes and do many, many other bad deeds, but at a cost to main character Niko Bellic's very soul. GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama. Every facet of Rockstar's new masterpiece is worthy of applause.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519883275\n\nYou play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern European attempting to escape his past and the horrors of the Bosnian war. He arrives in Liberty City to experience the American dream, only to discover his cousin, Roman, may have fibbed a bit in his tales of success. Starting from nothing, Niko makes a living as a killer and enforcer, a bad-♥♥♥ foreigner who appears to have no morals. The longer we stay with Niko, the more we see that there is a broken human being inside, one who would give anything to escape the person he once was.\n\nDon't worry, GTA's famed over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humor are intact, but there is a new level of sophistication in the characters and the game world that raises the story above the norm. As Niko becomes mired in the death throes of American organized crime, he begins to become more self-aware. Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic.\n\nWatch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just one moment in a day full of incidents.\n\nFor the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique.\n\nPast GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.\n\nThere are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals.","December 13, 2015","true","87.6"," 64 of 82 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","64","82","9","6"

The CD Key is incorrect in the steam version so you need to go to games for windows and trade the cd key for a valid one. In my case the games for windows live doesn't give a correct CD key so i cannot start the game.\n\nthe PC version is terribly non optimized, random slowdowns, physics glitches. Geforce Experience suggests low textures even in a i7 and a GTX 660 Ti; while Sleeping Dogs run beautifully with everything in maximum and HD texture pack, Saints Row 3 runs with eveything in maximum and both games looks better and runs smoother than GTA.\n\n\nRockstar could solve the CD Key problems (look at the Steam forum and in the Rockstar knowledge base, they know there is a problem) and remove the Games for Windows Live DRM.\n\nThe game itself is a great sandbox game. Play it in the PS3 or in the Xbox 360 cause it's broken in PC\n\nUPDATE: After Steam changed my serial number and the proper version of GFWL I managed to get the game running. Still not recommending due the bugs and the effort needed to put it running.","December 9, 2013","false","1.9"," 615 of 969 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","615","969","0","33"

While at times I had no issue reaching ~55fps, generally in less intense areas like cutscenes or near trh beach, the game stuttered all over the place in more detailed areas like Roman's house at the very start. This is pretty terrible.\n\nNow, I hear tell that GTA IV is probably a prime example of the worst PC port from a console game in existence, maybe besides Saints Row 2. I'm inclined to believe that.\nEven after tweaking settings and telling the program that yes, I did have a lot of memory and a good graphics card, and feel free to use it all instead of constraining yourself, the stuttering did not go away.\n\nNow, all this would be irritating, but playable. The game's certainly still playable, though the stuttering affects enjoyment. The storyline is pretty good, albeit darker and grittier than previous and future GTA installments.\n\nThe best thing ever:\n\nWith the demise of Games for Windows Live, it is now nearly impossible to save your game. You must jump through hoops in order to get it to save offline, which means the online community is totally dead. Coupled with the fact that it uses FOUR methods of DRM:\n\n- Steam (on its own, not an issue)\n- Social Club (notoriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥)\n- Games for Windows Live (♥♥♥♥♥♥ on release, dead now and unusable)\n- the much maligned SecuROM, well known and unstable.\n\nYou're gonna have a bad time.\nFour DRM systems all running at once, coupled with poor optimisation and a shoddy PC port, as well as serious issues with saving the game (it asks you to sign into GFWL, which doesn't exist anymore - you have to use third party tools to even get the game able to save progress) means that I would absolutely not recommend this once great game.

We both have a good taste in automobiles. We both have cousins. We both have bad taste clothing. And anytime we find a girl, they usually end up being spies for the authorites. I will admit that I didn't immigrate from Albania or wherever he's from. But still, you can see the resemblance. The story was very immersive. That's about it. You play as a Slavic dude and shoot people. That's it.

I will also say, that the multiplayer for GTA IV is way better than GTA V. I don't want insurance, or the ability to have my own house. I can get that in real life.

I've put quite some hours in it and it probably still was worth its money - especially because I bought it during a sale - but I still felt really disappointed by it, having played SA a LOT when I was younger, and it was so good and omg iv is here let's play that and relive the good old SA days! Nope.\nWhat IV did wrong was going too realistic, especially on the graphics, they are really grayed out and boring, the sunny days feel more like a cloudy day, a lot of fun aspect was taken out, such as taxi, firefighter and ambulance missions, and one thing more:\nThe performance. It's hard to talk about because PCs vary wildly, but all in all, I have a decent enough pc - can't run everything on high but switching to low makes every game playable. Except this. Everything as low as can be, but still about 10 fps.\nTo conclude this review, it's a decent enough game if you want to have SOME fun, and don't care too much about raging at the lag, the realism, and... the GFWL. I could have recommended instead of not-recommended, but I feel like I said more negative than positive things about the game so I decided to go for not-recommending instead.","November 27, 2013","false","320.9"," 47 of 67 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","47","67","0","2"

With the pc version there are just way too many bugs and issues with the game that make it unplayable. Here are just a few that I can name off the top of my head.\n\n1) When I started playing I could not access the phone Roman gives you on the second mission, which resulted in me having to restart the game and try the mission several times just to get the phone to pop up.\n\n2) Also on the second mission the car that has the loan sharks that is supposed to pull up after Roman calls you doesnt show up half the time, which again resulted in me restarting the game/ mission.\n\n3) The map itself would just randomly dissapear and Niko would be walking/ driving on air. I figured out this was because of the game not being able to keep up and load everything. This was partly due to my computer, which should not be a problem at all considering I have an Asus Republic of gamers laptop with a intel core i7 and NVIDIA Geforce GTX 765. I have been able to play every other game I have without map rendering issues at all.\n\n4) Missions wouldn't activate when I walked into the marker.\n\n5) Crashes. The game would crash on me randomly without any warning or anything and I could never figure out what it was that caused it to crash.\n\nAgain if you really want to play this game I recommend getting it for a console because this really is a good game, it just sucks for the pc. You can try it if you have one bad ♥♥♥ pc or desktop, but I wouldn't. Hopefully this helped you make your decision.\n\n","October 24, 2014","false","10.0"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","39","54","0","1"

Nico is then recruited by other powerful figures in the Liberty City underworld and quickly begins accumulating power.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV is a fun game to play, but differs from San Andreas in the way it looks and feels, making it a little weird to get used to if you have played the previous games in the series. The voice acting is pretty good, the story is interesting, especially with the Downloadable Content such as; The Ballad of Gay Tony. Though showing it's age, Grand Theft Auto IV is still fun and worth playing if you are a fan of the series.","January 1","true","0.2"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","27","36","2","6"

The game itself also filled with present day pop-culture, political satires and parodies you could laugh to yourself while listening to the radio or watching the TV show and the ingame internet.\nThe story line itself is comparable to 5 stars quality movie, as the player gets involved with the story of modern day balkan immigrant Niko Bellic as he travels to Liberty City seeking refuge from Serbia and his past. Throughout the way, the player feels sympathy and passion for Niko as he goes through love, hate, revenge, and all the modern emotions in real life with GTA IV. Liberty City of course based on New York, there are some familiar landmarks where epic shootouts take place in the game. The game is worthwhile just for the storyline and all the interesting characters alone that are involved with Niko's criminal activities in Liberty City.\n\nGTA IV has great story, and one becomes rather fascinated with all the characters towards the middle part of this experience.

Not to mention that parachutes, airplanes, customization garages, tanks, tattoos, haircuts were removed, all for the sake of realism.\n\nI could have overlooked all the previously mentioned issues if it wasn't for the most infuriating feature in this game, the driving.\n\nYou had a better chance at surviving an attack from a grizzly bear while tied in a burlap sack than you had of not sliding into a wall during a high speed chase, cars wobbled more than the double-chins of a portly patron at the all-you-can-eat buffet, road friction would convince you the pavement was made of teflon. Supporters will fanatically defend the new driving mechanics, but I saw it as taking the Auto out of Grand Theft Auto, whenever I needed to get anywhere I'd call a cab.\n\nSeems Rockstar realized their mistakes and reverted these issues on GTA V.\n\nI played this game a lot, and will probably continue to do so thus this may make me a hypocrite, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to a GTA fan who loved the GTA 3 series.\n\nP.S. Keep in mind GFWL is kicking the bucket in 2014, and Rockstar hasn't issued any statements regarding updates (which many other developers in the same situation have addressed and resolved), GFWL is latched like a parasite to this game, especially the multiplayer.","November 26, 2013","false","100.7"," 87 of 145 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","87","145","0","0"

There are hundreds of well thought-out and diverse missions to complete, though let's be honest- nobody really cares about them that much. The real magic with GTA happens when you explore the city and get side-tracked by something small that quickly escalates into a 4-star police chase with dozens of casualties. I can't help myself, and I don't know anybody who can!\n\nThe gameplay is clunky and the graphics are blocky, though the sheer scale and ambition of this game more than compensates. The PC version is a fairly lousy port. You have some additional graphics options but it isn't well optimised and you have to log in to 3 THINGS before you can play the game! (Steam, Rockstar Social and Windows Live). At its launch it was also horribly buggy and I lost many a save from stupid game crashes and corruptions. Most of that is now sorted out, so there's probably not been a better time to play this game whilst waiting for the far-superior 5th instalment to be released.\n\nNo other series can come close to matching what the GTA series pulls off. Although controversial, the game has a sense of humour and is surprisingly likeable for a game that wants you to kill lots of innocent people. Perhaps it's because the game can be played so peacefully. You can slowly drive about while listening to the hundreds of music tracks on offer, playing occasional games of pool or bowling. You can go get drunk in a bar and stumble about (probably the best use of the free-form animation system, EVER) or you can go and watch a comedy act. It's a living, breathing city where death and destruction are only ever seconds away.","December 7, 2013","true","83.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

When it first came out, I was sorely disappointed. The amount of "realism" in the game is a stark contrast to the more zany antics of the GTAIII series. GTA to me,  was always in a gray line between wacky environments and clever humor intergrated with a serious story. It worked perfectly. While the humor and memorable characters are there, the gameplay itself comes off dull, sluggish, and boring. Many of the features, while interesting at first, eventually start to feel like chores.\n\n\nWhen the PC port eventually did see a release months later in 2008, it was a complete mess. It was the prime example of a rushed non-optimized console game ported over to the PC. While many of the optimization problems have been fixed, there are still many others that do exist to this day.\n\nModding is another issue. It's severely limited compared to the GTAIII series. Most of this has to do with GFWL (see below), as Microsoft has complete control over almost everything because of the GFWL system.\n\nAnother issue, and rather the biggest problem, is the DRM love triangle that's been plaguing this game since day one. If you buy it, you have to install GFWL and Rockstar Backstage pass. GFWL was the nail in the coffin for many potential games that came out in the past 7 years  Compared to Steam (even during its hectic years of 2003-06), GFWL service was probably one of the worse and buggiest software clients i have ever installed forcibly on my computer. Thankfully, GFWL is rumored to being shutdown by July 2014, so the possibility of Rockstar bringing the full experience over to Steam is there, be it in a dim light. However the death of GWFL is like the birth of Chinese democracy, or the release of Half Life 2: Episode 3. where the reaction isn't one of cheer and hype, but rather a jester of "about god damn time".  The bad news however is that the multiplayer or any online required feature is apparently skewed until further notice as GFWL is cutting down the various services.","December 31, 2013","false","19.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","4"

If you screw up a mission, you gotta start all the way from the beginning - after going back to the mission startpoint or reloading.\n\nFor a game that took $100,000,000.00 to make, couldn't they add features that nearly every other game has? The missions also aren't that interesting and the driving is much more sluggish than what most vehicles in games are like. It also tries way too hard to be realistic and dramatic.\n\nBut, like Bully was to GTA4, this game is the game to play while we wait for 5-- oh wait, it's been out for like half a year.

Tak to se mýlite!\nPrvní zmínky o tom, že se chystá další díl Grand Theft Auto ve mě vzbudily vzpomínky na stovky prohraných hodin a kdy už jsem málem zapomínal na to, jak vlastně vypadá slunce. Hned, když vyšel trailer, uvědomil jsem si, že tohle mi PC nerozjede a když ano, tak se to bude sekat, jak důchodce na chodníku. Čím víc R* vypouštělo snímky ze hry a poté i HW nároky, málem jsem si nadělal do teplákové soupravy od babičky, ale zjistil jsem, že nejsem sám. Víte v té době málo, který počítač tuto hru rozjel, anižby jste se museli bát, že zachvíli vyhodíte PC z okna a myš spláchnete do hajzlu. S přicházejicíma Updatema opravující chyby, bugy a otimalizaci to mělo být lepší, ale nebylo. A tak spoustu hráčům nezbývalo než jen tiše závidět, že se to rozjede jenom vývojářům a prosit Ježíška ať se aspoň jednou přeplácne přes kapsu a koupí nový PC, který by byl schopen hru načíst aspoň do menu.\nTakhle to vypadalo v roce 2008, ale dneska je rok 2015 a já jsem již hru dohrál po sedmé a to anižbych se musel bát, že mi spadne celý Windowns. A nemá ani cenu tady psát, jaký je příběh, za koho hrajete nebo v jakém městě se to odehrává, protože to je stejně každýmu u prdele. U téhle série je příběh jenom zástěrkou proto, abyste měli důvod k tomu někoho zastřelit. Samozřejmě, není to jen bezhlavá střilečka, kde jenom střílite,  kradete auta a zabijíte nevinné či zlé lidi popřípadě bezdomovce, abyste ho mohli okradnout, kvůli pár drobným na hotdog. Zkráceně, někam zajedete, spustíte misi, vyslechnete  si co máte vlastně udělat, pak tam zajedete, vystřilíte to tam, pak se vrátíte a vyslechnete si, jaký jste kretén, že jste to nestlihli dřív. A ruku v ruce je s tím doprovázen příběh.\nDíky novému enginu a prosrané grafice je teďka možné vidět emoce na obličeji a zda jste postřelen či ne, to je přece důležité ne? :D To co je na GTA IV unikátem je fyzika a reálnost a z toho plyne destrukce vozidel, který by se dala přirovnat k BeamNG.

GTA IV v té době nastavilo laďku velmi vysoko a nikomu se jí nepodařilo překonat až na samotné pokračování GTA V, která ji nastavilo 5x vyššeji než GTA IV. Zde máte zápory a klady a samotný závěr.\nP.S.: S tím nasazením laďky, je to jenom můj osobní názor. Hry které samozřejmě dostaly více ocenění, popřípadě lepší hodnocení nepřehlížím, ale nebavily mě na tolik, abych se musel stydět za to co jsem napsal.\n\n+ Grafiky\n+ Destrukce vozidel\n+ Multiplayer\n+ Velký otevřený a propracovaný svět\n+ Stánky s hotdogama\n-----------------------------------------\n- Optimalizace (HW nároky)\n- Málo aktivit\n- Poláci\n- Windows Live... nebo jak se ta píčovina jmenuje.\n\nZávěr: I po 7 letech mě hra neustále baví a to dokazuje, že R* je jedna z nejlepších společností na výrobu her, která snad ještě nikdy nezklamala, kromě odkladu GTA V PC verze! Neváhejte koupit, peněz je na světe dost.\n\nHodnocení: 9/8 víc čísel neumím.","March 25, 2015","true","33.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","100","12","12","11","0"

This is one of my favorite games in series, just because it made a huge difference from the previous games in series, it has great story, excellent characters, Niko is simply amazing, and fits perfectly in everything, cousin Roman and his bowling calls - AMAZING! If you're looking for game and want to spend money but want it to last at least 50-60 hours this one is for you, I didn't finish it on steam just because I finished it before, so that's the reason I got only under 20 hours in-game. So to conclude it's not a perfect classic like GTA San Andreas, nor GTA III but it's really worth playing. Do I recommend this game? Yes, it's worth the money, but I'd really like to recommend you waiting for the sale and get it then, since steam charges a lot for such an old game, yes it's still great to this day but it's little bit too much, so wait for sale.\n\nBADNow to the bad side, this game really suffers from opimization issues, you'll get frame drops every once in a while, even the most powerful PC's are struggling from these issues, because it simply won't utilize grahics card power at all, once it does your game is over 100FPS if you have a decent graphics card, but most of the time you'll be stuck around 40-60 FPS which isn't as great as constant 60 or 60-80 FPS, it's not due to PC specs, it's simply due to optimization issues, before it got udpated to 1,0,4,0 back in the day it was even worse, frame drops on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems were pain in the a$$. So, this is a great game in general, but it lacks from optimization and technical issues.","March 4","true","18.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","12","12","3","1"

It has endless replayability thanks to the modding community. The graphics can be made to look at least 10x better than some AAA titles that have come out in 2013. You are able to change the game in such as a way that you can more or less design something that is unique every time you play. Although the game is not without its flaws, game saves are link to one machine and can't be synced thanks to Games for Windows Live, extremely difficult to join a friends game and not end up disconnected and the worst one by far is the ridiculous amount of DRM protection on this game. Although if you remove GFWL you can at least launch the game quicker and save to a much easier to find location, this is also useful if you to play on another computer as you do not have to start the game from scratch. Aside for those, it is still one of my all time favourite games.","December 8, 2013","true","84.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

I can't even play the game because of Social Club. Selecting the option to play offline does nothing either. Once you click it, nothing happens. I'm not sure why this is happening. Even launching the game from its local files doesn't work. Apparently, this is a known issue that's existed for a few years now. I wonder why its never been fixed though? I highly recommend against buying GTA IV over Steam. Trust me, it isn't worth losing your money over. Now I know how that feels...\n\n*UPDATE 6/1/15*  In order to get the game to work, you need to download the X Liveless mod, which disables the need and use of online functions (Social Club, Windows Live).  However, because Rockstar shut down their servers for GTA IV 2 years ago, that shouldn't be a problem.  My stance on buying the game is unchanged, however.  Players shouldn't have to download third-party content just to get the game to work properly.  If you're looking for a clean, working install of GTA IV, I suggest buying this game separately (from Amazon, etc.).","May 29, 2015","false","28.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

I can play CS:GO & Dota 2 for 50-70 fps, Tomb Raider for 30-40 fps, and many other at decent graphic and fps. It's old computer, I bought it in 2011.\nAnd if you think (and I think too) that "maybe i can run this game for sure, my sysreq is good for GTA IV", you're totally wrong. this game is not optimized for PC, and you will have so many issues with this GTA IV PC version.\n\nthe first of all is graphic issue, if you don't have a powerful machine, my suggestion is to skip this game. you'll have a serious time about setting up graphic, tweaking your pc, defragment, playing with registry and many other files, just for to make this game playable. again, playable, not enjoyable.\n\nand like everyone else whining about the 3rd party drm, GFWL, i should too. GFWL will make you even have a hard time just to play this game.\n- GFWL is not compatible with windows 8.1\n- and yes, CD KEY Invalid still here, steam isn't behind this, if you have problem with CDKEY you must contact GFWL just to activate it, kinda manually.\n- I don't know why, but maybe just me. I install my GTA IV at my desktop PC via steam, just like many other games i have. and i can't login to my GFWL account, just for this game. I'm searching this problem on google, said SecureROM is behind this. so apparently, steam will allow you to install game to any computer you have as long as you login with your account. but not with this GFWL, GFWL restrict me to have many "copies" of GTA IV at my own computers.\n- don't make me mention that GFWL is ruining the online gameplay, yes, for now, you can't play online. if you just want to play singleplayer, well its not issues for you.\n\nI'm not going to say that it's not worth your money, $29.99 is worthed much for a good game like this. but what i want to say is, it's not worth of your time, to think that i spend money for this game and what i want is just.. simplicity. click install, and play. but not with this game..","March 16, 2014","false","4.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

After you gently mod the living daylights out of the driving physics ('Let's make these cars handle like cars, not beached whales plopped into the middle of a busy intersection') and the POV / FOV, the 'revolutionary' camera angle invented by Rocktard's Most Wasted Employee of the Month ('Bloody hell, what were these muppets inhaling?!')\n\n~Where was I...

Tend to chew my charges when I get peckish, then regurgitate fur balls and stuff. Not always as patient as I could be.)\n\n~The game teaches wholesome social interaction, the fostering of friendship and intimate relationships with mature pixels, and in general instils a healthy respect for others, along with good family values. (Why are you gasping and spluttering? Jack Thompson's got it wrong.)\n\nI'll explain. Using an example. This example grew, like a festering tumour, out of a comment I left on a friend's review. Namely:\n\n~"I love how my friends will call me go bowling."\n\nWell, play it some more and it will be the thing you hate most. Needy buggers. And resentful if you say no, say later, or get into trouble and arrive too late.\n\nTrue, you don't need to play the game for that, but so what. Maybe GTA IV was intended to work as a sim in this instance -- The Sims 4: GTA add-on pack. (Called it, you've seen it here first. And that is the true story of why I must hide my true name and identity. Otherwise people would beat my doors down asking for predictions. And for a share of my royalty cheques, 'because we're friends,' supposedly. But I digress).\n\nBack to the subject: the cab's not the issue, nor the drive. The frequent calls themselves, which the game can unleash on you, might become an annoyance. The endless stream of nagging, one call after the other sometimes: cousin, friends, girlfriends.\n\nCan make you want to stop the car, get out, and just start spraying bullets. Instead, since I'm not a sociopath, I sometimes do go, pick up Roman, take him bowling, let him have his jokes from the Motherland, then once outside, I shove a shotgun in his face and blow his head off...\n\n"Your friend has been injured."\nI guess so! Next time, think twice, call once, cousin.\n\nBut that's what keeps the game fun I suppose. You can play it as nest suits your mood, and do the 'no-no,' the unexpected, the socially unacceptable, the irresponsible thing at any time. Things that go against what the game tells you to do, and continue without an "Oh noes, you injured your cousin! Reload a saved game?"\n\n~I left out the best part -- the next part, the follow-up, the 'check-up.' The aggravated assault after the grievous bodily harm inflicted upon your pixellated companion, the aggravated punchline following the punchline.\n\nInstead of having to reload the game because you've done something naughty, you can go wreak some havoc, wait for your dear cousin to be patched up after you shot him in the face, and call asking you to pick him up at the hospital when he's discharged.\n\nAt which point you can decide to be a dutiful cousin, drive to the hospital, stop, get out -- and blow his head off again right in front of the hospital. It's very practical and considerate, what with medical help at hand. Rinse and repeat till he hates you.\n\n~Don't worry, he'll still call, he's as slow as he sounds:\n"Hello cousin! Could you pick me up from the hospital?"\n'Of course, Roman. I'll be right there, cousin.'\n*reloads shotgun nonchalantly*\n\nThis then is the story of Roman as Johnny in 'Johnny Got His Gun.' Always make sure to leave his medulla oblongata intact.\n\n~PS.\nSo you don't like this review, and wish to lodge a complaint, do you? Ah well, that hurts my feelings and annoys me. Now you've made me sad. Happy?\n\nNo worries, I'll find a way to get over it. Tell you what...\nHow about I pick you up and we go out bowling, dear reader?\n\n*casually reloads shotgun*","May 21","true","2.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","75","15","20","10","4"

One game -sorry- one masterpiece game, it's glorious on consoles -and even PC gamers jeaolus because console have them- and when the time comes, that game released on PC but it have a lot of problems.\n\nOh, also updates are not helping. Lots of players disscuss the "1.0.4.0" update gives a better performance and quality. You can downgrade the game and play, i've done it on Windows 7 with no problem but Windows 10 won't allow it somehow.\n\nAnd Good'ol Windows game thingy. No one loves you m8. I can't register game on GFWL because it not allows my key, keep saying same ♥♥♥♥. Hey Bill Gates, Games For Windows Live is a mistake. Just like Windows Vista pal.\n\nSome mods can improve performance and quality, it's confirmed by me. I have stable framerates with iCenchanter. Also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can help me more, it gets rid of GFWL. But the RGSC still stay. It's not too bad, but it's Outdated af.\n\nEven after all, i'm still playing after beating game twice. If you can't handle these, you should grab it on a console. It's worth it. It's better then Grand Downgrade Auto V. Really, you can just compare what they have, and GTA IV should win. Even it's has a ♥♥♥♥♥iest port ever.\n\nSo, last words. If Rockstar gave this game a shot again and make it remastered -it's so popular these days- please remove that GFWL, RGSC Launcher (Not RGSC, the launcher is the one with brain problems) and make a better optimization i can give a full game price again.\n\nIt's your cousin, lets go bowling.","February 3","true","24.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Remember games for windows live? It’s here and it will annoy you to hell. Want more? It's your lucky day because there are other issues with GPUs, OS, etc.\n\nIf you are patient enough you'll probably get it running but only after trouble shooting for a couple hours and even after that there is a high possibility it won't run as well as you might like. My game never went past 45fps no matter what graphical settings I played on (mind you, my current rig is more than enough to run GTAV at 60fps with everything on max)\n\nI frankly cannot recommend this game unless you want to take your chance as it could run fine or not run at all.\n\nEspañol:  No es mal juego pero es el peor de todos los GTA. La versión de PC se encuentra además muy mal optimizada pues tendrás que lidiar con games for windows live, problemas con sistemas operativos recientes, problemas con la gráfica y un largo etcétera.\n\nEl rendimiento es muy variable, en mi GTX980 no logre que me diera más de 45-50fps sin importar settings gráficos.

Let's go bowling! - Roman\n\nIs a phrase you will be hearing alot as you play as Niko Bellic, his cousin. Fresh off the boat and wishing to start a new life in America, you will kill, steal and intimidate your way to the top of Liberty City, leaving nothing in your way.\n\nStory: The story in Grand Theft Auto IV is very intricate. You start off with basically nothing but the clothes on your back and your cousin Roman, who is a struggling car dealer with lofty ambitions of fast cars, women and lots of money. As you complete each mission, you are greeted with a range of very interesting characters from the weed smoking Little Jacob to the balls to the wall crazy bald-headed Brucie. These characters have great chemistry with Niko and I found myself really wanting to play more to delve into this dark and twisted world. As you play through the game, the missions become more creative, intense and harder culminating in an epic finale. (The main campaign took me around 25 hours to beat).\n\nGraphics: For a game released in 2008, the graphics still hold up today if not looking abit murky. The textures are high definition but I often found myself wanting the game to use a brighter colour palette rather the the dark colours Rockstar have used. I guess the game's look is reflective of the dark nature of the story.\n\nSound: All the characters have defining personalities and this is attributed to the superb voice acting. In particular, Niko and Roman's voice actors really sell their characters and give them much needed charisma and presence. The radio stations are great too, with a wide range of music playing and funny radio personalities often talking. The sounds of cars are good though I would have to criticize the fact that most of them sound like vacuums.\n\nGameplay: I haven't played GTA V so I will base the gameplay of GTA IV based on its predecessor San Andreas. The controls are much improved this time round, with a newly implemented cover system that makes gunfights alot easier, accessible and less frustrating this time round. However, I believe that controlling cars and Niko himself have gotten worse this time round, often feeling floaty and imprecise to move about.\n\nAll in all, Grand Theft Auto IV is a solid game with an enticing story and memorable characters that will not let you put your controller (or keyboard and mouse) down.\n\n8/10.","November 13, 2015","true","24.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","1"

Having finished it, here's my impressions (TLDR: This is about 10% of the game content as you'll find in the two previous GTA games, and most of what is here is tedious and annoying).\n\nIn the beginning, the game is fun. You drive around a little, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old cars you mostly find are hard to drive but that's normal for a GTA game. You unlock some new clothing options early on, and while they seem limited, it feels like the normal tutorial-style starter shop that only has mostly undesirable stuff in it. After a while, your original people stop giving you missions and basically dissapear from the game unless you go do mini games with them.\n\nAnd that's when the game starts to fall apart.\n\nBasically, the game seems to want you to do minigame "dates" with the women and "friend hang outs" with the dudes. You can befriend several characters and do lots of boring, repetitive mini game ♥♥♥♥ with them. Sadly, this is mostly tedious, in large part because the above mentioned part where the cars handle like ♥♥♥♥ never gets fixed. The entire game you'll be fishtailing and losing control of every car you drive, never being able to turn when you need to and overturning when you least want to. You'll fight lots of mobsters, criminals, and cops in this game but the real enemy is the controls. This is compounded by the fact that the controls for moving NIco around often leave him unresponsive at the worst time, like when you are trying to escape a burning car. He will take his sweet ♥♥♥♥ing time. He also likes to lie around on his face and get shot in the back by cops. Eastern Europe has some weird hobbies I guess.\n\nThis might be forgivable if the main story didn't go off the rails about halfway through, where you spend a while getting to know a pretty interesting clan of criminal Irish (including the sister, Kate, who I'll get to in a second). Things seem to be developing nicely with them, until suddenly you find yourself working for a long string of about 8 Italian randos who blur together to the point that I could not tell you which one was which, or why I was ever working for any of them. Nico constantly talks about needing money, but the best payouts are from the missions you do with the Irish. The italians mostly drag you through a series of increasingly stupid plans, most of which involve walking face first into obvious traps.\n\nAdded on this, the dialog has no branching or control. You control executions only, and that only infrequently, and the only consequence of your choices (except the last one) is that you can get a generic side mission from people if you spare them.\n\nLike the game, this review is costing too much effort, so I'm going to cut the budget and let it devolve into a series of bullet points, instead of putting careful thought into each one and fully developing them.\n\n- Kate, the Irish sister, is a ♥♥♥♥ing horrible "girlfriend." She puts Nico firmly in the friend box and he refuses to accept this fact, always insisting she's going to turn around. There is one way to turn her around to actually getting serious, but if you go down that road she dies almost instantly in a random attack that you can never get payback for. Oh, and if you don't make the choice where she dies, then you get to watch Roman die. Frankly, she was stringing Nico along the whole time so he'd sooth her lonliness, knowing the whole time that she was playing with his emotions, so I was happy to see her go. Nico is better off with hookers because, ♥♥♥♥, at least they're honest.\n- Every interesting character from the first part of the game is sidelined in the second part in favor of the blandest bunch of Italian shitbags you'll ever meet. The voice acting for these guys is terrible, they obviously blew the budget on the dudes in the first half of the game.\n- Unforgivable that the driving is so bad that you'll end up taking taxis to almost every mission just to avoid it.\n- The developers put a toll booth in the middle of some of the bridges in order to make you stop, pay the toll, then continue on. If you don't do that, you have to shake a 1 star wanted level. Either way, you have annoyance and inconvenience. Also, often missions force you to drive across the bridge over and over again. This isn't challenge, this is padding the game out with pointless and tedious obstacles. It is very much like the endless same road encounter from Far Cry 3.\n- Nico is basically the errand ♥♥♥♥♥ for every gangster in the city, but never ever rises to any power of his own. At no point is Nico giving orders outside of immediate life or death situations, at which point he's mostly shouting ineffectually for flavor. Sure, you don't take ♥♥♥♥ from people, unless they pay you, in which case you'll suck anything they put in your path.\n- At one point, Nico is double crossed. The guy who double crosses him then spends the rest of the game cropping up to ♥♥♥♥ with him. At no point do you have the option to track this ♥♥♥♥er down and execute him until the plot finally allows it, WAY later than Nico would have done considering how his character is portrayed.\n- TLDR: The first two hours of gameplay are worth about $5. Don't pay more than that for this game. Don't bother beating it, read the wikipedia page to get the details on what happens.","February 7, 2015","false","52.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","1"

The most of Rockstars GTA games feels like beginning and the end of all parodies and wannabe sandboxes at one's time. Gameplots, mechanics, subsequential and miscellanious stuff - all sandbox developers imbibes and adopts every sip of that astonishing game series.\n\nBut, hereafter, with GTA4 you have one-time-through game. Storyline so dense, so alive... and weird for the most of us, that you need only one look at it. Vice City or San Andreas was very different, there was much more fun for returning in game in three-four years after the first time. Even knowing it's teens-oriented, even with all that PS2-level graphics I'm still adore San Andreas most of all Rockstar series...\n\nOkay, back to GTA$! Oh, sorry, GTA4, I mean. It's cool. And "Episodes from LibertyCity" are cool as well. But... They all are grim. Even horrid sometimes. And the worst part is that you (most of you) don't really like your protagonist. He's proficient, even wised up guy, okay. He had a hard start, that's okay. He's a psycho killer, fine, every main GTA-guy goes like that. But besides all of that... there are big hole with vacuum. It drains emotions out of Nico Bellic, out of any of his companions, activities. It drains YOUR emotions, so you don't know how to get excitement out of this game. One-time goer, for every opportunity in game. No more!\n\nUntil mods came by, of course. But not for long again. GTA 4 is not a hit, not a brilliant of any kind. And those damned DRM protection you need to work out... Very soon this game will become completely obsolete, comparing to new games. All hails to GTA5, that is!","October 28, 2015","true","36.6"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","5"

It's a fun game, sure, but only when it works. When I first launched the game I was getting massive frame drops. Now that may seem like my problem but I have double maybe triple the system requirements needed to run this game on a decently new computer. So I looked up the issue and found many MANY reports of the same issue. As well as an options menu that didn't help my cause in any way. After hours of testing and removing mods to help fix these issues I have come to the conclusion that this game is almost completely broken on my end and if you got it to work I envy you. This is one of the worst PC ports I have ever come across and by a major developer working on a major title. I don't usually recommend this but if you want this game buy it on console. Otherwise, I advise against buying this game on PC unless you think your computer won't have an issue or that you can fix the issue. I have given up on it but maybe you can do it.

However good you expect it to be, there's a tremendous chance it simply won't work. The forums are full of people who've paid money, can't play the game, and get no support from Rockstar. This is bordering on a scam at this point. The DRM is more extreme than any game I've every played. It requires games for windows live, which was a bad idea even before it started to get shut down. It uses securom which is famous as one of the worst bits of DRM anywhere. And on top of that it's not maintaned or supported to even the most basic level. This was the laziest of ports to start with, and it treates its audience, ironically, as potential criminals. Only buy this if you want to give your money away with little to no chance of getting to play the game itself, especially on windows 8.\n\nAs to the gameplay, compared to the previous game this is a tedious slog. The best cars handle as well or worse than the worst cars in vice city or san andreas. The story itself is grey, depressing, and lackluster.

If you have it on consoles, i'd advise you stick with it unless you're into mods. It's also under about 3 layers of DRM and runs on 'Games for Windows Live' which isn't great by any stretch of the imagination. With the game itself, it provides hours of gameplay with a pretty good storyline, messing about in Liberty City, and of course the mods. If you can get past all the stupid nonsense that the PC port has, you'll have a blast of a time.","August 3, 2013","true","125.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have beaten GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas at different periods in my life all had a profound effect on me. GTA3 absolutely sucked me in, I had not felt so engulfed in a game until I put GTA3 in my PS2 at the tale end of 2001. Vice City introduced me to the 80's, a decade that I was alive during but have few memories of. San Andreas topped them both by introducing a gangland so cal landscape that was the epitome of free roaming gaming .They were all ground breaking ,fun, and even comedic the but sadly , GTA 4 is alot of hype and thats about it.\n\nIf you've read any of my reviews you know I'm a stickler for story and I have to say that GTA 4 is pretty weak in this department. While there are some very interesting missions, the over all plot is so loose and bordering on incoherent that it really hurts the game, especially since the same company was telling better stories on older tech.\nThe story itself is fairly original, for a game anyway ,in that you are an immigrant fresh off the boat looking for the american dream. Initally I thought that the plot was going to be dramatic and a deep look at the United States from the outside. Sadly this concept is tossed aside for a story that relies on over the top neurotic characters that rely on flat comedy and stereotypical archetypes to carve out a thin plot than a deep narrative that makes you question american values. While there are bits of the latter lightly tossed in, its too bad the game didn't do more in this area.\nAnother area in which the story was under developed, is the number of characters. While main character Niko is very well done, the other characters are too under developed. Roman, your in game cousin is somewhat developed but is annoying and a ♥♥♥♥♥ too. Too many characters are introduced , all of whom we know next to nothing about. Little Jacob, a character I enjoyed in the game was vastly under developed. For all the nay sayers out there, taking a person to play a game of billiards IS NOT character development.\n\nTechnologically the game is outstanding and I think for this reason alone is where a lot of the reviews gave it such high marks. The impression of the real world being translated into video game form is at its apogee here. The best example of this is the feel of the weapons. Blind firing a shot gun into a person has never felt so good, especially seeing them realistically collapse.\n\nWhile the story is serviceable but lacking and the technology is spot on , the game aspect is where GTA4 hits its largest hurdle. Everyone knows the GTA formula; Steal car, drive to mission giver, complete mission, repeat. GTA 4 is no different but why fix something that isnt broken? The catch here is that you now have a cell phone that also functions as a quest giver, a quick restart button, as well as a complete pain in the ♥♥♥. While I enjoyed the concept of the phone, the date aspect falters because it is not rewarding, its repetitive, and in the end it just didn't do anything for me other than hang up on the person and not care about the thumbs down they gave me. When it comes to The missions themselves, they are usually ruined by the TERRIBLE characters that give them to you. While most people enjoyed the Brucie character I couldn't stand him. He wasn't funny, his missions were boring, and he was a ♥♥♥♥♥.\nAbout half way through the story you realize that most of the missions are the same as the old games. The combat, like Gears of War, is essentially Wack a Mole. The tech is impressive, but why spend so much money on mediocrity? At the end of the day GTA4 will go down as being a technical marvel that lacked a cohesive story and fun,enjoyably game play.","November 25, 2013","false","15.4"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EXcellenTTT/recommended/12210/","EXcellenTTT","asriel memer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EXcellenTTT/","234 products in account","Let's rewind the date back to March of this year. GTA IV was on sale for 5 bucks and I was curious, as I had only seen it when my friend showed me the game at his house. I nagged my father to allow me to use the funds, and he relented at about 10:00 that Friday night. I bought it and downloaded it overnight (I had a laptop at the time, so it took quite a while).\n\nThe next morning, I loaded it up for the first time. Immediately as soon as the ship cutscene started, I got graphical glitches and lag, although I attribute that to the laptop, not the game. Besides those technicalities, the game appeared absolutely gorgeous. The graphics (despite me setting every option on low, and despite the glitches) looked stunning to me, as I had never played anything as close to graphical perfection at that point in my gaming career. The dialogue also seemed to be my type of style - clear, sarasctic, and on occasion, angry. And this is just from the opening cut scene!\n\nAfter the cutscene, I gazed upon Liberty City for the first time. Good Lord. For someone who's closest "open-world" atmosphere was frigging Delfino Plaza in Super Mario Sunshine, this was like an entirely new path suddenly appeared through the darkened forest of 3rd-party Nintendo games. No longer would basic linear gameplay amuse me as much as the expansive and neverending environment of GTA IV.\n\nAfter staring at what little of the City I could see (with Roman probably anxiously awaiting me to actually drive to his apartment), now I'll talk about the missions. Honestly, I haven't done many of them in my 42 hours of gameplay - only up to the drug dealer house raid (however, the missions do explain aspects of gameplay in a well-scripted manner, and are exceptionally fun). Why haven't I played more of the main story, you probably won't ask but I'll still say the answer anyways? Two words: Free Roam.\n\nThe ability to do close to whatever I wanted in a gargantuan city with no setbacks (well, the cops maybe, but I just turn them off when I create a game for myself)? It was heaven for me. Most likely over two thirds of my hours in the game are from free roam alone - single player free roam nonetheless. I just found so much to do. Pretend to rob a Burger Shot armed with only grenades before blowing the place to Kingdom Come? Check. Launch off the ramps at the airport then dive out of the car and hope not to die? Check. Jump out of a helicopter and attempt to crush a pedestrian from 500 feet up? Check. The possibilites are endless, at least to me. I could go on and on about my Liberty City exploits, but I'll just leave it there.\n\nOf course I have a few minor qualms about the game. Fire kills you way too easily (Stop drop and roll, good lord Niko...), the cops can be absolutely relentless on 3 stars and above, and sometimes the physics just...go away (*coughSwingsetGlitchcoughDon'tHurtMeIEnjoyTheGlitchToocough*).\n\nHowever, despite these few setbacks, I absolutely love this game. Overall, 9.5 out of 10. While waiting for GTA V to come out for PC (if it ever does...), buy GTA IV. Even if it isn't on sale, it is definitely worth the price. As I sit here at 10:07 at night, finishing this review while listening to UFO's phenomenal album "Phenomenon" (See what I did there? Oh who am I kidding, you probably did. Ignore me...), I can safely say GTA IV is one of my Top 5 favorite games of all time, putting it amongst the other greats on my Top 5 Games list; Half-Life 2, Luigi's Mansion, Pokemon Fire Red, and Team Fortress 2.\n\nStay frosty.\n\n-Silent Scream","November 25, 2013","true","110.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","7"

What's worse is that many users complained that the code that comes with IV doesn't even work.\n\nBut that can be easily fixed with the use of a tool called "Xliveless"; for some reason, Steam censors that word but it's perfectly safe and it allows you to bypass the annoying GFWL Code Authentication/Login.\nI used a magic trick to make Steam Filters unable to censor that word in case you wondering why it's not replaced with hearts.\n\nYou can download Xliveless here: Download Link[gtaforums.com]\nHowever, if you really want to play GTA IV's official multiplayer mode then I heard that using GTA: Episodes from Liberty City's activation code instead would actually work.\n\nAside from that - GTA IV has been poorly optimised, giving users with low FPS even if you are using an high-end PC.\n\nBut once you're able to get the game playable then I'm sure you will enjoy this game a lot better than playing on a console since you get to play with mods such as LCPDFR, Simple Native Trainer, Tsunami, ENB/Graphical Enhancements and many more.\n\nI recommend this game because it doesn't feel right that this game's User's Reviews score is "Mixed" just because so many dumbasses doesn't know how to fix the game.\nYou should buy this game if you have a brain that has a good mindset of fixing things while having a PC that could run this game with more 20-30FPS\nOtherwise, purchase this game on a console instead.\n\nAnd last thing - here's something that could help you get better performances in this game:\nI heard that downgrading the game from 1.0.7.0 (the current patch that Steam is using) to 1.0.4.0 would give you more FPS as well as able to get the game compatible with certain mods that are only playable on 1.0.4.0.\nJust read the instructions here: http://www.gtagaming.com/forums/showthread.php?t=128300\n\nNow unfortunately, you can no longer buy this game on Steam currently since it "ran out of keys for the game".\nCould this be our chance? That Rockstar Games/TakeTwo Interactive would fix the issues for the game while stocking more "keys"?\nOr will they just let the game "unbuyable" since they no longer support it.","January 7","true","49.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

The answers to these questions are very simple.

Go to Youtube, type this in the search bar, "GTA IV Not Launching Fix (Steam)" Click the video by Doobie Boy (Shout out to him for the video and the fix link)\n\n2. Click the mediafire.com link and download the zip file I've already done this its not a virus.\n\n3. Unzip the file and exteract it to somewhere you can see it.\n\n4. Go to your GTA IV folder in your steam folder. (If you don't know how to get to it its. This PC (My Computer) > Windows C: > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Grand Theft Auto IV > GTAIV)\n\n5. Once you're in the GTAIV folder look for a file called "Paul.dll" once you find it drag it out and place it on your desktop you shouldn't need it anymore.\n\n6. Open the file you downloaded, and drag the two command files into the GTAIV folder, dont drag the readme.txt its not needed. If you have the Episodes from Liberty City Find the the folder called EFLC and do the samething for the regular game.\n\n7. Open the game it will take a few seconds to load up. If you have Windows 10 or 8.1 your computer may tell you, you don't have the current version of Windows Live don't listen to that.\n\n8. The game should launch and you never had to sign into Social Club or Windows Live.\n\nNow the next thing is to fix the resolution, the game by default is 800x600 and the game will not let you change it. Don't worry your pretty faces I got you.\n\n1. Go back to your GTAIV folder.\n\n2. Look for a application called "LaunchGTAIV"\n\n3. When you find it right click it and hover over "send to", then click "To desktop (shortcut)"\n\n4. On your desktop it should by default be called "LaunchGTAIV -shortcut"\n\n5. Right Click it and go to properties.\n\n6. There should be 5 tabs on the top of this window, click the shortcut tab.\n\n7. There should be a Box called Target where you enter text into. Put this in at the end. BEFORE YOU ENTER THIS IN HIT SPACEBAR ONCE. -norestrictions\n\n8. Clicky apply and then ok.\n\n9. Launch the game again and go into your options/ settings tab in game, and now you should be able to adjust your graphic settings. Just make sure you don't over do it and kill our computer.\n\n-Just as a side note because you are not using the Shortcut steam made, steam can not keep track of your game hours, and Shift + Tab doesn't work, so you'll have to Alt + Tab out to message someone or reply.\n\nI really hope this works guys GlHF! :)","March 9","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is more than 7 years old, yet it still struggles on today's hardware. I have a GTX 980 GPU and will not get more than 40 fps. (iCEnhancer hardly affects performance, before the mod's install I got 45 fps). DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOUR COMPUTER IS AVERAGE OR BELOW 2015 STANDARDS.\n-Forced Social Club. Social Club isn't even necessary to run the game. I can sign in offline in Social Club and still play multiplayer. In fact, Rockstar actually took out Social Club in a patch but put it back in a later patch. However, you still need to have Social Club to start the game.\n-Forced Games for Windows. Games for Windows is required to run the game. I cannot believe that Steam doesn't even install the application when you buy the game. You need to actually start the game, figure out that it doesn't work, and then look up on the internet for a solution, only to find out that this was a problem that could've been easily avoided. Anywho, Games for Windows could be replaced with Steam's multiplayer system.\n-Graphics are awful without mods. The game looks like the Hellen Keller Experience without mods. I'm serious, it's too dark to see anything. You need to mod the graphics.\n-You can't mod without editing the game. The current GTA version of Steam won't let you mod unless you're willing to experience bugs. You need to downgrade the game to 1.0.4.0 to actually mod it.\n-You can't play modded in multiplayer. You cannot join some multiplayer games if you are modded, the game will simply reject you.\n-Guns and cars are not upgradeable and are boring (unless you mod)\n\nAll in all, this is my favorite GTA because of how interesting and different it is from Rockstar's other GTAs. It will keep you playing for hours. However, the fact that Rockstar doesn't know how to do a proper PC port (excluding GTA V, that shows some hope), ruins it. You have to be willing to put up with a lot of garbage to play it. I'm going to ignore this games technical issues and make this a positive rating.","May 4, 2015","true","75.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

"GTA IV is a game with a compelling and nonlinear storyline, a game with a great protagonist who you can't help but like, and a game that boasts a plethora of online multiplayer features in addition to its lengthy story mode. It's not without some flaws, but GTA IV is undoubtedly the best Grand Theft Auto yet" ―Justin Calvert, Gamespot executive editor.\n\nThat pretty much sums up the whole game. I had a really good experience with GTA IV, and it was very fun to play. I have invested 3-4 hours on this game now, and I do not regret buying this game. At first, Nico (main character) may be slow in movement, and it will be hard to drive cars. Once, you get used to the game, it will really fun to play. There so many missions ta you can choose from (eg. Go bowling with Roman, go on a date with Michelle, go beat up some people for Vlad and do jobs and earn money for Roman).\n\nA game that offers this much is a really good buy. I very much suggest buying this game!\n\nThe only big issue with this game is the DOWNLOAD and RUNNING the game. It was very annoying that when I downloaded it, I couldn't run this game due to a bunch of errors. THIS IS HOW TO SOLVE IT: http://depositfiles.com/files/exnxnkwkj. Download those files, extract them and put ALL of those files into your GTAIV Folder.\n\nIf you dont know where your GTAIV Folder is, well, its here: OS (Hard Drive) > Program Files(x86) > Steam > SteamApps > Common > Grand Theft Auto IV > GTAIV. Put all those files there and your game will work\n\nScore: 9/10 (still has some minor flaws and the download is corrupted)","June 25, 2014","true","130.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

I've played other open world crime games like Saints Row and had a lot of fun.  But I found the missions in GTA IV to be repetitive and boring.  Most of the missions I played through involved having to chase somebody down and kill them.  Other missions involve having to kill people in a certain area (and then you'll probably have to chase down the main person you're trying to kill anyway).   Additionally, every enemy is a huge bullet sponge\n\nThat being said, driving around Liberty City is still fairly fun.  The radio stations in the game have some truly funny commentary.  The guns handle decently well and the cover system works.\n\nThe thing that makes me dislike GTA IV is that it is an extremely poor PC port. Textures fade in and out sometimes, FPS slowdowns for no reason (this game is six years old, that shouldn't happen), and the crushing amount of DRM. I thought Ubisoft was bad for making you use UPlay on top of Steam, but GTA IV has four layers of DRM (Steam, Rockstar Social Club, SecuROM, and Games for Windows Live).\n\nI really wanted to like GTA IV, but the bad far outweighed the good.","July 13, 2014","false","7.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

A game that offers a mix of sometimes beautiful visuals, mediocre online play and an interesting, yet repetitive story line? look no further!\n\nOn a serious note, the pc version of gta4 is possibly the most enjoyable moddablle game i've played in a very long time. The physics apparently abide by a completely different set of laws and, yes the multiplayer is plagued with obnoxious elitist who think they're somehow the gods of pc modding for installing a native trainer, but even when taking that and the horrific 'social club' into consideration... this is game is actually annoyingly addictive.\n\n\n","April 29, 2014","true","207.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It it terribly optimized for PC, resulting in relatively poor frames for less powerful computers.

One thing to consider however is the large mod community, which is really what makes is worth getting for me personally.","December 7, 2013","false","1.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's a real shame to admit this but the console versions are a lot more consistent, my minimum frame rate in benchmarks flickered from 13fps to 19fps, no matter how far i tried to scale the settings.\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay though?\nIt's got a fantastic story of discovery, betrayal, disappointment and sheer gritty(ness) that's worth playing through to the end even with the hardware difficulties, if you're after a great story; buy this. If you're after a smooth, pretty title, avoid this.","October 18, 2014","false","0.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/radonj/recommended/12210/","radonj","JBecks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/radonj/","276 products in account","Truth be told, GTA IV is the first GTA game I've ever played in depth. I've played other open world crime games like Saints Row and had a lot of fun.  But I found the missions in GTA IV to be repetitive and boring.  Most of the missions I played through involved having to chase somebody down and kill them.  Other missions involve having to kill people in a certain area (and then you'll probably have to chase down the main person you're trying to kill anyway).   Additionally, every enemy is a huge bullet sponge\n\nThat being said, driving around Liberty City is still fairly fun.  The radio stations in the game have some truly funny commentary.  The guns handle decently well and the cover system works.\n\nThe thing that makes me dislike GTA IV is that it is an extremely poor PC port. Textures fade in and out sometimes, FPS slowdowns for no reason (this game is six years old, that shouldn't happen), and the crushing amount of DRM. I thought Ubisoft was bad for making you use UPlay on top of Steam, but GTA IV has four layers of DRM (Steam, Rockstar Social Club, SecuROM, and Games for Windows Live).\n\nI really wanted to like GTA IV, but the bad far outweighed the good.","July 13, 2014","false","7.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Its like an "extension" and an upturn, if I may say, of the previous GTA games, meaning that the game has much better graphics than previous ones and also you can improvise - interact with almost everything on the game (you can use computers, enter various buildings, play various roles etc.) and boy you even got a cell phone!!! Both the storyline and the questline is big and amusing with many missions and many outcomes. The only thing I did not like in this game is the fact that the experience bars, which were used back in GTA: San Adreas (Driving Skill, Stamina, Muscle etc.) were removed and also the way that Police officers react and move (for example: You crush into a traffic light and no attention is paid.

When it asks to close the game, you are not given that option and the game freezes with your mouse cursor gone.\n\nHighly frustrating and will not want to waste my time on this trash.","June 29, 2014","false","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, this game is old but its still one of those games we will never stop playing and still have fun with. Being able to play this game in full 1080p 60fps is amazing, (again... coming from the PS3 version) to me and my friend, it felt like a remastered GTAIV experience.\n\nHere are some things you should know about this game in order to get it working properly:\n\n1. Make sure you do not have Windows Firewall or any Xbox related services disabled (it will prevent you from updating Xbox LIVE)\n2. If you have trouble logging into Social Club such as the dreaded "failed log-in" problem (the prompt of Social Club log-in before the game starts), close the game application and go to:\n\nYour drive letter may be different if your downloading games on a seperate HDD, be sure to change the letter to the correct drive letter of your steam games. ---> C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto IV\GTAIV\n\nThis is the main directory of the game. locate the Pual.dll file and cut the file (NOT copy), then head over to your desktop and paste the file there for now (somewhere you'll be able to see it easily). Now the Pual.dll file should be gone from the main directory. Start the game and it will skip the Social Club prompt and load the game directly. Once your in the game, try to go online (it should say you cannot access online because you are not logged into Social Club). Now go ahead and exit the game altogether, then cut your Pual.dll file back into the main directory of GTAIV and start up the game again, this time Social Club log-in will prompt you and when you enter your credentials, it should log you in rather than getting a failed log-in.\n\nNow that you are logged in, check to see if your able to go online, you should be able to. Once your online, quit the game and then rename the Pual.dll file to "Pual.dll.disabled"; this will bypass the Social Club log-in prompt. So everytime you start up GTAIV, you will never have to sign into your Social Club account because it won't prompt you to do so, you are permanently logged in and you will have complete access to online everytime you boot GTAIV.\n\nNow you can enjoy the game with out any hassle. I hope this review/guide has helped you out, Have fun. :)\n\n(If you are still getting the failed log-in, try resetting your PC and keep trying. Once you are able to log-in to Social Club, immediately disable the Pual.dll file as mentioned above.)","March 26","true","28.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The first 20 hours or so were delirium, the other 20 an increasingly dull grind. The gameplay is very monotonous and key elements are simply put clunky. Given the emphasis on gunfights, the poor execution is disappointing. Nico actually drops his gun when running out of ammo, so I have to buy him a new one, it is more luck than skill when I win etc. Nico is always on the lookout for more money but practically the only thing he can buy are clothes! Then there is the infamous cell phone, and the in-game friends that call to invite Nico into tedious activities, and so on and so on.\n\nThe story is uncontrolled and episodic and the various underworld types are more broad caricatures than actual people. The game perhaps wants to criticize US capitalism and crime but the scenes completely undermine all serious commentary. The most absurd example is a broad daylight bank robbery in the metropolitan area. It is utterly ludicrous for three criminals to shoot and outshoot police, escape with the money and then return to status quo -- with zero repercussions!","August 3, 2013","false","38.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gameplay control is fantastic except for vehicle driving which they finally fixed in V. The driving is doable, just more complicated than it should be.\nMy main problem is the back tracking. Copying NY city is a cool idea at first, but it gets boring after a while. NY is basically just dumpy dark color buildings everywhere. But what sucks is having to constantly drive long distances to get somewhere so you can play a mission. Playing a mission is actually playing the game. Driving there is more of nothing. Your not actually playing. It's like driving your kids to school, it is a task, not fun. And it is worse when the mission is hard, and you have to keep driving back to do it again.\nYou can take taxis, but only so often.\nOtherwise is good old GTA fun, just the previous and sequel are much better.","May 20","true","44.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But this has had a big impact on all of the games using GfWL, which is a problem. Most companies removed it, which caused very stressful game save removals, some kind of solved it, but Rockstar Games apparently aren't doing anything about this. Which is sad.\n\nNot only do you need GfWL to save games, but also to play on multiplayer. Which means third party multiplayer clients will be the only way of playing the game online and with your friends. People have created dll files to bypass GfWL, but what about multiplayer? Common, Rockstar!\n\nHopefully Rockstar Games will pull the dreadful GfWL out of GTA IV's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and everyone will move on. Again, I'm extremely sorry to make this a negative review.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/recommended/12210/","LeSharkeh","Schlechte ᖘlumm 🐝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/","375 products in account","GTA IV was probably one of the good/bad games of it's time, but it's more good than bad, so i'll go through pro's and con's on it\n\nPROS:\n\nCHARACTERS: Every character you meet has emotion and you make bonds with them, and if you had to make a choice with something it was hard to do.  Each character you meet has a different feel to them, and they are all loveable.\n\nGUNS: The guns were good in this game, when you shot someone it did feel like you did damage, and it showed, the guns in the beginning suck, but when you get the stronger guns you can do much more damage to someone.\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: You can have relationships with people you meet in the story, and so far every one you meet I have loved.\n\nGRAPHICS: The graphics are good, even though I seriously hate people that think "Oh the graphics look terrible the game must suck" That's a huge lie, look at Minecraft, Half Life 1, DOOM, those games looked like pure crap, but they are still fun, and if you do say you are a true gamer and you care for graphics then you aren't a true gamer.\n\nFIGHTING: I love this, I know i'm gonna get hate for saying this but GTA V's fighting is so boring, it's just duck, counter, hit, hit, duck, counter, dead.  Atleast in this one if you picked a fight with a old guy sometimes, he would kick the crap out of you.\n\nEXPLORATION: There are so many things in this game I haven't noticed even when I first bought it till now, you can ride the railcars going from one island to another, I NEVER knew about that, and there are so many places you can go.\n\nITEMS LYING AROUND: Throughout the city Items are scattered everywhere, to meleeing weapons to actual guns and grenades, and medkits, but they aren't easy to find, at all, and some are in such a annoying spot, I found body armor on a high way sign with no latter up, and they expect me to get that HOW?!\n\nCONS:\n\nDRIVING: Driving in this game feels so weird, it's like you have 2 dryers on the front of your car, and if you hit something at a angle you can spin the car out pretty badly, that and when you hit something your car dead stops, seriously, and I hate the fact that if you flipped the car on it's roof you are basically screwed.\n\nRUNNING AND JUMPING: These mechanics are kind of weird...you feel so slow when you jump over something or have to climb over, it takes forever, and you don't even get that much sprint if you are trying to run away from something or someone.\n\nCOPS: In almost EVERY GTA game the cops can be a pain, but in this it feels like they are more of a pain, not only if they do something to you, IE you are sitting in a car and a cop runs into your car you get a wanted level, but if you are wanted and try to run it's really annoying, the radar you have will make a blue and red flashing outline to show that you have to get out of it to get away from the cops.  Don't get me wrong, it's kind of nice, but it sucks when you are outside of the line, are waiting for a few seconds, you have 1 SECOND LEFT before it goes away, and some cop just "Happens" to come around the corner and see you, and you gotta start the WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN, not to mention when you get a max of 6 stars you may as well just die, no way you are getting out of that, or a Pay-N-Spray.\n\nRELATIONSHIPS WITH FRIENDS: I like the fact you can have fun with the characters you meet in the story, but jesus they pester you ALL THE TIME, and they get all upset that you don't want to go bowling AGAIN, (Seriously Roman, go away).\n\nHEALTH SYSTEM: This is another thing that aggrivated me, the health goes away SO fast, even if you have armor, you get hit by a car while running it can take away a good half of your health or more, and really, food to heal? Yes there are medkits lying around the city but it's not like they are THAT easy to find in the first place.\n\nFLYING: The PC controls for flying just suck, I suggest you change the keys around to maybe Saints Row 3 flying controls, VERY nice if you do it that way.\n\nMONEY: I know getting money in ANY game is nice, but in this it feels so heavy, if you don't buy ANYTHING and just do all the missions, you can get almost 1 million bucks, but what are you supposed to spend money on in the first place? All you really need is strong guns and some armor, as well as food for health, that's really it, the rest is just worthless.\n\nThere are ALOT of bad things and good things about this game, but if you get a config tool you can ignore most of them and just focus on the fun! 8/10\n\nEDIT 1: Niko isn't russian, he's siberian, I know it's crazy.","February 2, 2014","true","252.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With the pc version one can install awesome mods such as the native trainer, iron man, first person, and SO MUCH MORE!!!!1\n\nThis game has flaws as it is not even the latest installment, however the story is great, Liberty City is a beautiful open world with many places to explore,and with weather, and day changes it feels much more emersive than gta 3.\n\nThe controlls and driving mechanics are good, however some cars are very difficult to handle minor issue that was partially fixed in 5. After mods this game is a lot of fun. Though the story is great, I found myself leaving missions to explore as the game does give you too much freedom which sounds crazy.\n\nI reccomend this game to gta/open world game fans, as it is fun for shooters and explorers.","June 22, 2014","true","153.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you look on picking up V but never played IV please play IV first considering how V is mising the defined tone, Franklin is a shoe-horned character because they couldn't make a game in San Andreas without having to play a hood, the guns feel like plastic, the driving is worse because at least in IV the cars felt different compared to how V they all feel the same and speaking of driving the physics took a massive step back.  GTA IV also had a better story concering with anger, revenge, and the American Dream while V is just about 3 dudes doing crimes.  It could have gone much better Michael going back into the underworld with Trevor along to just ruin things while Franklin could have been cut for all I care.

Its a game I would tell anyone to play. The episodes from liberty city is a bit of an add on, I wouldnt say they are needed, but it adds onto the game. I have played both GTA4 and GTA5 on the xbox and I can most certainly say that both are great games on Xbox or steam. If the game is on sale it's worth a shot. I don't see why you should not buy the game. Game play is great, there is almost something going on in the game. There are also a lot of side stuff, you should try the side stuff out (such as hanging out with friends), instead of just doing it mission by mission, it makes the game funner in my mind. 9/10","June 24, 2014","true","20.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

GTA IV is a classic. Now most of us say its not what GTA SA was, of course its different. This one is very serious game and not much 'comedy' in it. It does have a lot of crazy things to do like we all do in GTA SA! This game has awesome physics....very very realistic physics. The graphics are amazing. If you got a high end rig you can try ENB mods and make it look like real life. BUT......its optimized like SH*T for PC which makes me go crazy. Even a high end rig will suffer with this game. Full of glitches and bugs. I think Rockstar was drunk while they were making GTA IV for PC. But still you can enjoy this game at even medium settings. The story is great. A big map to explore. Not a lot of good side missions though. Its a great game. Its GTA so no one can argue about anything. I give it a 8/10. I really enjoyed this game a lot!!

Played the games for years. However, this is the first time I played one on the PC. There are alot of negative reviews out there, and I feel like some of them are being a little unjust. Written by gamers that are not smart enough or patient enough to work out any issues they run into. So let me just tell you what I experienced. Good graphics after you edit the start parameters so that you can change the graphic quality (it is a pain that you have to do it, but it is really easy). I played this game on the Xbox 360 before and the port over to PC is fine. Just as good as the port for the Saints Row series, or any other free roam driving game. Controls are easy to use and easy to remember. Run's great on my computer, I have the graphics on ultra and it runs perfect with no issues. Now... Down to the meat and potatoes of what most of these reviewers complain about. Let's get real for a second here gamer guys and gals. Honestly, GFWL sucks, I know it's a thorn in some people's sides, and everyone complains about it but c'mon... All you have to do is log in. It is not a big deal. I logged in to both the rockstar club and GFWL and have not had a single problem.\n\n\nSo in summary:\nIF you are smart enough to log into your GFWL account and your Rockstar Social Clup account (if you do not have one or both of those you can create one on the spot) then this is an amazing free roam driving game/shooter/gangster/bowling sim. Once you get it going there should'nt be any problems, and if there are just check the forums or mod it.","March 5, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Let me tell you why\nI have on GTA 4 on CD version about 2,247hours and its still fun\nOne of the best positive is on GTA 4 story mod, missions are very emotional and good, i can say its better story than GTA 5.. The ending of GTA 4 was very emotional with the music..\nMusic is second positive on this game.. Perfect Soundtrack from GTA 4 side, for me its better than GTA 5 soundtrack.. In loading menu its very good theme song and in the missions its too good songs.\nThe MP game can be for someone boring, because you can´t do missions like in gta 5, but you can do another funny things.. Like searching secret car Sultan RS and then just ride around LC with good music on or just camp with your friend in multiplayer somewhere and just shot some helicopters from LCPD or just jump off the Empire State or go visit heart of Liberty City if you know where you can find it..\nOk.. you can´t buy clothes in MP like in GTA 5.. but you can do character with your favourite clothes and just tunning it with ranking up..\nBut the most annoying is on GTA 4 Games for Windows Live... I have always problems with this thing. It ruined the game but you can overlook this epic fail.. Second negative is on this game optimalization.. On some places is the optimalization very awful.. but if you have good computer, you will see just a litle drop of FPS. I played this game on my old computer where i´ve played it on 800x600 all low on 20fps.. so ye.. prob you will run it without problems, but if you have same old pc like i had, you will see the horible optimalization on Liberty City bridge :D\nSo this game maybe dont have so much option like GTA 5 but believe me, i can only recomend you this game..\nComunity is much better than in GTA 5, nobody will kill you here just for fun and nobody will put a reward on your head :D If you will find someone with Trainer, its fun, because they will build a ramp or do a airport party :D not like in gta 5 where cheaters will switch on a godmode and kill other.. no here is fun..\nSorry if you dont agree with me, its just my opinion and you can have your own and sorry for my english.","January 19","true","32.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I had a lot of fun playing this game.  My main complaints revolve around the whole Microsoft Live crap attached to this game.  There were several times I could not continue my game because I couldn't connect to the Live servers, apparently your save file is tied in with Live so if you can't log in all you can do is start a new game.  While playing Live would often log out and back in interrupting gameplay.  There were whole days of Live outages where I couldn't play.  I never figured out how to get multiplayer to work, I tried once but it was confusing and I quickly gave up.  My computer is not an X-Box, stop treating it like one Microsoft!!!  Anyways, the game was mostly fun, the story kinda falls apart in the late game, but overall I had a lot of fun.  Most of the missions were fun, a few were confusing and difficult, but I figured them out in the end.  Overall this is a good GTA game. I can't wait for 5, but they are taking wayyyyy toooooo loooooonnnnnngggg releasing it for PC, I will probably not have any interest by the time it actually comes out.","July 23, 2014","true","23.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Word of warning is to not call an ambulance to come heal you, they will most certainly arrive to kill everyone in their path and that may include you.\n\nAfter game play is finished however I miss the side jobs. Firefighting, Paramedics missions and Vigilante. Good thing about this is that there are mods that allow you to do all of these things now. Modifications and scripts addons are a great addition and breathe plenty of life back into the game just when you thought it was over. Handling mods, ENB, ELS, so much more.\n\nMost people have problems with their systems running the game. I am not one of them, I never had a super computer and I don't think I have one now.

You play as Nico, a East European fresh off the docks of Liberty City, who's coping with the demons of a violent past while making a life for himself in America.\n\nPros: The city looks pretty good and is very open. Walk into multiple stores, apartment blocks and warehouses. The city is divided in islands, making it slightly easier to navigate from one neighborhood to another as you eventually determine you personal favorite routes to each bridge. The city, the characters, television, even the game's internal world wide web reek of sarcasm about the flaws of capitalism, and so does the cliché but nevertheless interesting story. Get involved with gangsters, bikers, russian mafia, corrupt lawmen, and manage your friendship with different people in order to count on them at a later time. Driving is smoother than ever, but mastering it becomes a must soon enough.\n\nCons: The character graphics are already showing their age. The humor is much more subtle and won't get more than a chuckle out of the average player. The subway and train are poor alternatives to stealing the first crappy car you come across, and you'll only ever ride public transport because a mission requires it. Managing friendship also becomes a pain, as you force yourself to stop the action and story to keep your friends level up or risk loosing the service each provide, even permanently lose some of them. With the exception of a few safe houses, you no longer have any purchasable houses or businesses.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list\n\nThis game isn't perfect, but I'll still recommend it. The city feels alive, you can hear the people on their cells, behind their food carts, yelling and swearing at each other, getting into fights, causing accidents. You can easily immerse yourself in Liberty City, just as long as you are know the plot feels like a 90s crime/cop action flick.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","December 30, 2014","true","40.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Yes, this is another GTA game in which you'll likely spend the bulk of your time stealing cars and gunning down cops and criminals, but it's also much more than that. GTAIV is a game with a compelling and nonlinear storyline, a game with a great protagonist who you can't help but like, and a game that boasts a plethora of online multiplayer features in addition to its lengthy story mode. It's not without some flaws, but GTAIV is undoubtedly the best Grand Theft Auto yet.One of the many things that set GTAIV apart from its predecessors is Liberty City, which is more convincing as a living, breathing urban environment than anything that you've seen in a game before, and bears little resemblance to its namesake in 2001's GTAIII. Liberty's diverse population believably attempts to go about its daily business, seemingly unaware that several criminal factions are at war in the city. Niko has no such luck. He's compelled to start working for one of the factions shortly after arriving, when he learns that his cousin Roman has some potentially fatal gambling debts. Niko's military experience makes him a useful freelancer for employers in the business of killing each other, and though his reluctance to carry out their orders is often apparent, he does whatever is asked of him in the hope that completing missions for other people will ultimately give him the means to complete his own.Actually, Niko doesn't have to do everything that is asked of him. On several occasions as you play through his story, you'll be presented with decisions that afford you the option of doing what you think is right rather than blindly following instructions. You don't necessarily have to kill a target if he or she promises to disappear, but you have to weigh the risk of your employer finding out against the possibility that the person whose life you spare might prove useful later in the game, or even have work for you in the form of bonus missions. To say anything more specific on this subject would be to risk spoiling one of GTAIV's most interesting new features, but suffice it to say that every decision you make has consequences, and you'll likely want to play through the game at least twice to see how the alternatives unfold.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV's story mode can be beaten in less than 30 hours, and there are so many optional activities and side missions to take part in along the way that you can comfortably double that number if you're in no hurry. The majority of the story missions task you with making deliveries and/or killing people, and play out in much the same way as those in previous games. With that said, most of the missions are a lot easier this time around, partly because Niko is a more agile and efficient killer than any of his predecessors, and partly because the LCPD seemingly has better things to do than hunt down an illegal immigrant who's gunning down undesirables all over the city. Some of the more imaginative missions sprinkled throughout the story include a kidnapping, a bank heist, and a job interview. The cinematic cutscenes associated with story missions are superbly presented and are the sequences in which the game's characters really shine. Without exception, the characters you encounter benefit from great animation, great voice work, and superbly expressive faces. They're not always so impressive when they join you on a mission and refuse to do what they're supposed to (for example, not following you on an escort mission, or failing to negotiate a doorway). Nevertheless, these problems are few and far between, and they're made less painful by the new "replay mission" option that you're presented with whenever you fail.New abilities in Niko's arsenal include scaling fences and walls anywhere he can get a foothold, shimmying along ledges, and, most importantly, taking cover behind objects. The ability to stick close to walls, parked cars, and the like at the touch of a button makes GTAIV's gunplay a huge improvement over that in previous games, and, in tandem with the new targeting system, it also makes it a lot easier. Enemies are rarely smart enough to get to you while you're in cover, and given that you can lock your targeting reticle on to them even when they're hidden, all you have to do is wait for them to poke their heads out and then pick them off with a minimum of effort. Locking on to enemies targets their torso by default, but you can use the right analog stick to fine-tune your aim and kill them more quickly with a headshot or two. Playing without using the lock-on feature make things more difficult, but you’ll need to master the technique so that you can shoot blindly at enemies from positions of cover when you dare not poke your own head out to line up the shot.Given the amount of trouble that you get into as you play through the story mode, it's inevitable that the police are going to get involved from time to time, even when their presence isn't a scripted feature of your mission. Liberty City's boys in blue are quick to respond when you get flagged with a wanted level of between one and six stars, but they're not nearly as tough to deal with as their counterparts in previous GTA games. They don't drive as quickly when pursuing you, they rarely bother to set up roadblocks, and you'll need to blow up practically an entire city block before the FIB (that's not a typo) show up. Furthermore, you're given an unfair advantage in the form of your GPS system; when you're not using it to plot a valid route to any waypoint of your choosing, it doubles as a kind of police scanner. Any time you have a brush with the law, the GPS shows you the exact locations of patrol cars and cops on foot in your area, and highlights the circular area (centered on your last known whereabouts) where they're concentrating their search. To escape, all you need to do is move outside the circle and then avoid being seen for 10 seconds or so, which is often best achieved by finding a safe spot and just sitting there. It's not a bad system in theory, but in practice it makes dodging the law a little too easy, especially when your wanted level is low and the search area is small.If you're wondering about differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Grand Theft Auto IV, the truth is that there aren't many. The PS3 version can only be played after a mandatory install that takes around 10 minutes, and its load times are a little shorter and less frequent as a result. The visuals, which don't always hold up to close scrutiny but are impressive during typical gameplay, are comparable and feature the same quirks (shadows that flicker, for example) on both consoles. Likewise, the audio, which can take a lot of the credit for why Liberty City feels so alive, is exceptional regardless of which console you have and how many speakers it's hooked up to. True to form, GTAIV's soundtrack has plenty of great licensed songs and, unlike other games we could mention, it doesn't force the artist and track information down your throat with pop-up windows that detract from gameplay. However, if you want that information, you can simply dial up a song-recognition service on your cell phone and, after a few seconds, receive it in a text message. Genius.The minor flaws that you'll experience are no more difficult to overlook than those in previous GTA games, and they're greatly outnumbered by the features that will impress and surprise you anytime you think you've already seen everything that the game has to offer. There's lots to see in Liberty City, so you'd best get started.","May 4","true","385.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

GTA III for PC didn't connect with me.  This game is much more refined.  Better graphics of course, but also better story, better characters, and much better controls (when using XBox 360 Controller).  This game takes itself a little more seriously than GTA III, but you can still cause a lot of crazy mayhem. It goes without saying that none of this content is for the kiddies.\n\nThe PC version is no doubt the best looking version of the game, but there are some graphical glitches and texture popping.  I also ran into a bug in the final mission and had to Google to find a workaround.  I prefer the progression system in games like Assassin's Creed and Infamous.  At a certain point in the game, I felt like I earned all this money and had nothing to spend it on but ammo and weapon refills.  None of this takes away enjoyment for what the game does best.\n\nThe story missions alone take about 20-30 hours to complete, but there is so much to do (too many things to list), you could easily spend hundreds of hours in this game if you choose.  The city is huge and the developers did a fantastic job of making it feel alive.  This is where the game really shines and why gamers choose to keep playing long after the story is complete.  You can feel the massive amount of work that must have went into developing the simulation.  It really is an impressive feat.","December 5, 2013","true","11.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Niko Bellic, a Serbian immigrant fresh off the boat into Liberty City attempts to live a peacful and quiet life after being in a war that left many of his friends dead. Of course, he's in Liberty City, so while attempting to live, he gets mixed up into a whole lotta ♥♥♥♥. The emotions and personalities of everyone you meet are absolutely amazing, and it makes the enviroment realistic as possible.\n\nThe PC version is quite good, but it requires a fairly farily decent gameing pc to run it at max settings, or even half settings. That is my only complaint, and it's pretty obvious. Everything else about this game is 100% amazing. It's a must buy for any R* fan out there.","November 30, 2013","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is enormous, highly detailed, and - if you're into that kind of setting - beautiful. The soundtrack leaves something to be desired in its' default state, if you ask me, but I'm not a huge fan of rap, butt rock, or jazz, so I suppose you can take that with a grain of salt. The story of Niko Bellic is by far the best story portrayed in a Grand Theft series game, and the way the end plays out differs based on a pivotal decision you must make near the finale. Well worth picking up if you like Rockstar's game design style, but certainly not for everyone.","August 8, 2013","true","56.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
