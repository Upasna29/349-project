Now we've got Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen on the horizon.\nSo how does Starlight Inception compare to the pack?\n\n\nStarlight Reception\n\nIf the majority of reviews already out there are to be believed, Starlight Inception doesn't compare well at all!\nFollowing a kick-starter campaign and period of "Early Access" Starlight Inception saw a final release in April 2014 to a barrage of negativity.\n\nThere were complaints about the controls, the graphics, the game mechanics, the campaign, pretty much everything, but was all this criticism valid? The internet is full of haters and it can be all too easy to go along with what the "cool kids" are saying, maybe it was just a case of internet "bandwagoning".\n\nAdopting a philosophy of "You can't believe everything you read" Let's fire the game up and take a look for ourselves!\n\n\nStarlight Deception\n\nI'm a sucker for a future time line and Starlight Inception doesn't disappoint in this regard.\nUpon hitting the "play" button we're treated to a suitably melodramatic narration of events leading from present day through the colonization of space and the rise and fall of various factions.\nAt its end you will find yourself in 2114  stationed onboard the USF Midway and ready to earn your wings.\n\n\nStarlight Direction\n\nFollowing the stirring lesson in future history the screen jumps to a static image of a "room" inside the USF Midway, where what I think is supposed to be a character model, sits unmoving on a seat and in his own ham-fisted way, explains his motivations as to why he joined the USF.\n\nThe quality of the facial model and "animation" here is so bad its almost laughable and when I say "animation" the only thing moving here are the characters lips as he opens and closes his mouth like a fish gasping for air in a short animated loop which completely ignores the dialogue.\nEscape Hatch Entertainment obviously believe that lip-synching is unnecessary polish.\n\nIt's at this moment that a very wooden, very Irish accent echoes through the speakers demanding that I report to the ready room.\n\n\nStarlight Induction\n\nI'm filled with relief as the camera drops into a first person view and I no longer have to look at the "minecraft meets elephant man" visage gasping at the screen.\nI stumble blindly around the some grey corridors until I find the ready room, which looks suspiciously like the room where Mr Voxel delivered his opening monologue.\n\nHere we're treated to another brief cinematic as we're introduced to another unsurprisingly blocky faced man (I suspect a relation) who seems to be in charge. His mouth opens and closes at random as he delivers his orders (It's like watching an old overdubbed kung-fu movie).\n\nUnnervingly I notice that his mouth continues to open and close after he's delivered his instructions and all is silent.\n(Due to the blocky likeness and similar mouth malfunction to our original chunky faced colleague I'm beginning to suspect there will be some inbreeding in humanities future).\n\nAnyway... He wants me to strap on a fighter and earn my wings by way of shooting some stuff, which is fine by me, so I click a button and off we go!\n\n\nStarlight Inspection\n\nFinally it's time to get behind the stick of a spaceship, maybe now the game will shine, this is after all what this game is all about.\nFirst impressions on launch are actually quite good, following the blocky faced potential inbreds on the Midway, the graphics now look pretty decent. The ship models are polished and the skybox is almost beautiful.\n\nI'm starting to feel better as I look out of the window of my little spaceship at the Earth shining below me.\nMaybe things aren't so bad after all.\n\n\nStarlight Correction\n\nI fly to some waypoints, I shoot some things. Eat your heart out Mark Hamill, I'm the wing commander now!\nUnfortunately, the missions themselves quickly start to feel hollow and repetitive.\nPoint the nose of your ship at a way point, fly there, shoot some uninteresting targets that you can't really see until you're on top of them, fly to the next way point.\nRinse and Repeat.\nIt all just feels a little flat and uninspired.\n\n\nStarlight Objection\n\nThe controls can feel a little clunky at times, the physics of flight are questionable at best and the enemy AI is so woeful it brings me back to my theory about inbreeding.\n\nEverything here is functional, fly, shoot, fly, shoot. It just doesn't click with me, nothing feels satisfying.\nThe combat is underwhelming, the campaign is mediocre, The voice acting is wooden. Like I said, everything is functional at best.\n\n\nStarlight Reflection\n\n... and at its best, when everything is working in its favour, Starlight Inception can reach the dizzying heights of mediocrity for whole minutes at a time. It's such a shame, I love the space combat genre and I really wanted to like this title.\n\nWhilst it's not quite as bad as some reviewers would have you believe, It is far, far away from being a good game. Unless you've got some time to kill and money to burn I would suggest that this is one to avoid.\n\nFind my full review and others LINKED HERE[www.review-well.com]","November 19, 2014","false","2.9"," 126 of 137 people (92%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","92","126","137","30","0"

All menus are confusing and *extremely* clunky.\nTotal facepalms during the first few hours of gameplay: the bloody keys for rolling left and rolling right are interchanged and there is no way to reassign them; Missiles target acquisition either doesn't work or there's something about it that the tutorial or menus aren't telling me.\nMoving around the carrier is ship is a nice idea, but so poorly done (the controls, ouch, the controls!) and pointless (there's nothing interactive as far as I've seen) it looks like there's something planned and never implemented here.\nMission design on some missions is extremely poor (waypoints keep pointing you through solid objects, pathfinding is extremely hard, waypoint triggers are like a built-in exploit)  and unfair in some, when for instance a required, completely arbitrary waypoint, you need to reach, triggers enemies, that you are then too far away from to stop from destroying your mission goal in time. Just one example. Silly, pointless, frustrating.\nThe space combat itself is not very fun, you can play entire missions without ever seeing an enemy ship, as the enemies basically become large enough to see at 100 meters distance. That might be realistic, but it kills all dogfight feeling when you shoot almost exclusively at the center of a targeting rectangle.\nTargeting itself is absolutely terrible and clunky (as are most controls), as there's no way to target the nearest enemy, the nearest friendly, the nearest mission objective or your nearest attacker - as has been pretty much standard in such games 15 years ago. No, here you have to click through 37 enemies, while an unseen missile turrets keeps pounding you...\nJoystick support is terrible, i found no way to reasonably use my Saitek X52, but that's just a minor thing as mouse control is totally superior anyway. makes targeting so easy, it sometimes feels like a cheat in fact.\nI'll shelve this for now and wait for a patch or three, and may give it another go then.\nAs it's now, extremely disappointing.","April 25, 2014","false","9.1"," 68 of 73 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","68","73","0","1"

I bought this game based on some of the positive reviews posted here, and I had seen that this was a Kickstarter baby.  That gave my high hopes for either something innovative or a true throw-back to Wing Commander.  In truth, this is less WC or X-Wing and more a knock-off of Strike Suit Zero...which SSZ reminded me more of those lousy Wing Commander clones you used to be able to get for the PS1.  I played the game through a Patrol mission and the first Campaign mission.  All i can say is that I really want my $20 back.  For being a game no longer in Early Access and the "Final" version, I encountered my first bug a few minutes in when the targeting reticle in cockpit-view mode disappears after firing the gun for a few minutes.  Also, the cockpit graphics themselves are awful, ugly and appear (IMO) to be slapped on as an afterthought.  Reinforcing this opinion is that the starfighter handles better in 3rd person mode than cockpit mode.  The VO sync with the Ready Room animation is like watching bad muppets.  I was so disgusted that by the end of the 1st campaign mission i uninstalled and was compelled to write a review.  Bottomline: lousy graphics, poor space mechanics, derivitative gameplay of shiity knock-offs of a much better game = AVOID, it's not what it claims on the tin.","April 27, 2014","false","0.6"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","41","47","0","0"

A recent update to the game rendered it unplayable on my PC, killing what had been acceptable performance. I had held off playing through the campaign, believing that updates would improve the quality of the game over time. Now, I may never be able to play it.\n\nThe default controls on controllers and kb/m are awkward and there is no way to reassign them. Cockpit view is functionally useless in this game. Rather than make the game more immersive, cockpit view detracts from the experience and I recommend any player to use a third person perspective during flight.\n\nThe voice acting and character animation in the game are of low quality. Human models simply shouldn't have been included in the game. Botched first person controls between missions and in Exploration Mode make walking through the ship a dread.\n\nAs much as I can tell, the narrative is a generic sci-fi story about conflict between humans living on/from Earth and humans from extraterrestrial colonies. The conflict mainfests as World War IV (World War III playing a role in the game's backstory) and the player fights for Earth's United Star Force. From what I understand of the exposition between missions, a military documentary on World War IV is interviewing service members about their role and lives. The story is a retelling taking place in the future "present" and the missions take place in the "past."\n\nI couldn't believe it was possible to take such a step backwards in the genre in 2014. As a space sim/shooter fan, I am deeply disappointed in Starlight Inception.","August 13, 2014","false","1.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

To see if the developers had really taken on board the criticisms of the game and tried to tweak things to make a better PC flight sim experience. But it would seem not, the patch only added configurable joystick buttons and fixed a few bugs. Although some that had been reported are still in there.\n\nAlso to give a little history, I backed this game on Kickstarter for  and have seen the game and given feedback to the devs from beta (which came out August 2013) to full Steam release.\n\nThe main problems?\n\n1) One big core problem of the game, is that it is simply not fun to shoot other ships in the game. That's a pretty important thing people want out of a space flight sim. The dogfights are soulless, and stupidly easy, the laser cannon fire has this crazy auto aim tracking and the AI is barely there. As I say in my video, it seems that the gameplay was implemented quite late and never really looked at again. Surely the first step is to make sure the main gameplay loop is fun over and over.\n\n2) The other problem of the game, and why it just feels so off and not quite for PC, well I'll explain in a second. An example of what I mean it being "off" :  When it says "Enter your profile name" it loads up a virtual keyboard on the screen, and if you type it on your actual keyboard, you have to type it one letter at a time, if you try to type at a normal speed it can't register your key presses.\n\nSo why all these little quirks, lack of any real graphics options on PC etc? That is because it was also developed for the PS Vita at the same time. Although I haven't played the Vita version, once you know that about the development, things start to make a lot more sense. Instead of developing a separate but similar Vita game, this very much feels like what must be the Vita game, but poorly implemented for PC.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, Vita to PC ports of stuff can work, for example Hotline Miami or Guacamelee are great examples of it being done right. Also I'm not one of those "I WANT TRACKIR OR NOT BUYING!" type of people before you think that. All I was expecting was to dust off my joystick and play a fun modern competent single-player campaign, in the style of X-Wing or Wing Commander series. Which is how the Kickstarter was essentially pushed on their campaign and why I backed it.\n\nThe developer silence and vacuum\n\nPeople had asked this on a Reddit AMA and other places, that making this style of game for PC and Vita was a little odd, but the developers very much felt it could be a good fit for them and the smaller budget they were working with. And to assure us that the PC version wouldn't be crippled for the Vita version etc. Well....\n\nWhen the backer beta came out, I emailed my feedback saying that it wasn't exactly great and I was shocked at just how much of a clumsy Vita style port it felt like and that PC backers probably were not going to think highly of that. I imagine some other people probably also said that during the backer beta period too. I forgot about it for a while in the hopes that when it got released on Steam as a full release, that the feedback would be taken on board and they would really sit down and take a long look to tweak the gameplay and make sure the PC version felt & played like a PC game with a joystick and such.\n\nWell go to about a year later with the full release on Steam (April 2014) after a small time of it being on Steam as early access too. I downloaded it again and was very disheartened to find it was pretty much the same game, with some slightly better joystick control added and some bugs cleared up. But the core gameplay still as dull and not engaging, the laser fire still bending a crazy amount auto aim style.\n\nThe forum messages and Steam reviews were pretty much on the negative side mostly, some people trying to soften the blow when talking about their dissatisfaction. The developers sounded like they would try to fix more stuff about the game. A lot of "we're sorry, we're trying" "we have a patch coming next month!" from them, but the main developer who would reply on the Steam forums stopped for about 6 months, not a peep. Everyone assuming the game was dead after launch.\n\nThen a month ago, the developers popped up on the Steam forums again, saying we have a patch coming! Out of the blue, I thought ok, it's been almost a year since the game came out on Steam. Maybe they've really taken the feedback onboard and this patch will really answer some criticisms customers who bought this game had and make the experience better. Here we are today, tying back to my first paragraph of this review. The patch added very little. And pushed me to write my first Steam review.\n\nFor the past year, they've been trying to get this game submitted to Sony to go on the PS3, along with making a new game too. This game was very much, released on Steam and then move on, forget about the people who bought it and their complaints. That is not a way to gain fans or treat people correctly.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI mentioned a vacuum in the title of the last section, I think this game could have been something if the developers listened more, got people in the alpha earlier on and not bothered with the Vita version (or not bother with a PC version depending). Focus on one platform, make it as great as you can and see where to go once it was out and what would be a good fit. We could have told you very early on the flight model and the gameplay loop of shooting ships was not fun at all. Instead it was very much a vacuum, the Kickstarter campaign got funded. Then nothing for ages but a small trailer, then suddenly the backer beta. By which point it was already too late to perhaps make things better it seemed.\n\nThis review might sound rather harsh, perhaps. I normally understand things from a developers point of view, but not when it comes to releasing a product you know is not good, then run and not listen to paying consumers. I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt, maybe this patch they'll have listened... ok no. Maybe this one? Nope. Ok one more chance to really get this thing feeling good. Here's the patch! Oh barely even tried.\nI posted on the forums several times and made a few videos, pointing out parts of UI that were bad or clunky or just broken etc. And they're still there to this day. EG Cockpit view, if you blow up an enemy, it still shows on the target HUD. And other such things.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo I shall stop rambling now, again watch the video I made and linked at the top if you're curious. Big thanks if you actually took the time to read all this! :) What should you spend your money on? Easy if you've never played it. X-WING ALLIANCE! People always say oh I loved X-Wing, or X-Wing vs Tie Fighter. A lot of people forget there was a 4th game called X-Wing Alliance. Which fortunately enough recently came out on gog.com all ready to download and play out of the box on Windows 7/8. Download the fantastic, easy to install HD texture pack here http://www.darksaber.xwaupgrade.com/craftspackucp.html and you'll be feeling like a badass pilot in no time. With a interesting story that bounces between helping your Family against a rival business and being a Rebel Alliance pilot. Voice acting and mission designs still hold up today as they did then, and seems to support most joysticks you throw at it.

First time i tried to play it i couldn't because of a movie loading glitch. As soon as it loaded and you came to the splash screen it crashed. First i asked the devs to take a look into this matter, and they say they had it fixed. Four months later i reinstalled the game and the same thing happened. So i took it upon myself to try to fix the game and found out if you delete all the movies  you can get to the menue and play the game.  The controls are not smooth and if you don't play with an xbox controller, you have no hope in completing the game. Even the contols for the xbox are not smooth and jerky. Trying to aim at a moving target is hopeless if you want to use your guns and you only have limited amount of missles that you have to buy after each mission.\nThe lighting is so dark on everything. You cant see the ships you are shooting at just the aiming reticles in front of them. Walking around on the ship is like you are in a cave and everybody has a tan. The frame rate jumps up and down like a jack rabbit on crack. The second mission you have to turn the dynamic lighting off to even get a frame rate you can play it at. And then you cant see anything until you are right up on top of it.  The developers say this game is ready for final release. If you buy this game you are in for a big surprise.  If this game was freeware i wouldn't even bother downloading it. There isn't one good thing i can say about the game except the demo movie looked good. The people are talking statues and not very realistic. They talk and you cant listen to them for more than a few seconds before you jump to the mission so you dont have to hear them anymore. The narration is like, give me a break. Hope they didnt pay anybody for the voices.

With so many space combat sim options now there is no reason to buy this.\n\nPros:  Tries fairly hard to be a good Wing Commander / Freespace 2 clone and briefly captures the nostalgia.\nCons:\n\n- Very outdated graphics.\n- First person out of cockpit experience poorly implemented.  The actual movement lags behind a reticule causing motion sickness and an overall bad experience.\n- Shield / Stealth Module / Missiles / Mission contextual special device all tied to the same secondary weapon cycle.\n- The large amount of ships have been copied and pasted from an online description somewhere without even bothering to change minor things to make it "spacey".\n-  There is no incentive in the campaign to use more than 1 top notch fighter with a single configuration after the training mission despite the impressive number of ships.\n- Missiles have a description of Air-to-Air and appear to be copied from the same source as the ships.  They should be described as Ship to Ship or Ship-to-Surface.\n- Taking out satellites is a very boring extra bonus objective that really doesn't seem to affect the overall outcome of the mission or campaign.  The point of secondary & tertiary objectives are to enhance the overall campaign or to be of good effect in case the primary objectives can't be reached or if there were extra ordinance & time/fuel.\n-  Some ground targets sink below the surface of planets/asteroids making them unreachable by weapons and blocking mission completion at 100%.\n\nIn summary I love the spirit of the game, and the desire to make a space combat sim again.  When this was greenlit, there was almost nothing new out at the time and it was a gap waiting to be filled.  Now that Elite Dangerous is "out" and Star Citizen is maybe about to release something more fun to do than run people over with golf carts this game is relegated to the never to be installed or played again pile with about 100 other games in my library unless it receives some serious changes.","November 9, 2015","false","12.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I will recommend this game but there are caveats to this. 1) This game is awkward in play. The eating dinner over your best friend's house, after you have just been caught making out with his sister awkward. I absolutely hate the FPS movement through the ships. It's slow and when your alerted to report to the ready room you just mosey along to get there. The tutorial flight needs to more indepth. I "accidently" found out how to allocate power and command wingmen 3 missions in. 2) The flight mechanics are disturbing at times as you find yourself struggling to get the ship to right itself on a trajectory. I like being able to fly near the surface of a planet just not in one. One mission requires you to go underground killing bad guys and finding a scientist. You take damage hitting walls but the enemy ships ping pong ball of the sides making it impossible to hit them and they take NO damage. Loose this mission or change the scientist to a surface station.  3) Voice acting poor. The briefer for the first few missions looks like his is in his fifties but the voice is of a later teens to early twenties young man. Same akwardness with the stories one pilot who liked he was straight out of high school had 10yrs of experience. 4) The credit system isn't consistent. I completed a round and saw all sorts of bonuses flash up and completed bonus missions and recived nothing after the brief. All the work for nothing. Prestige points? Really? I have to earn a certain amount of points to get descent equipment? I would understand completeing some missions and getting extra stuff in mission to have new equipment to be researched then availible after a period of time.\n\nNow after all this I really do like the game, I hate the fact it's VERY Crossfire unfriendly. I had to disable it all together. The game has promise but it needs alot of work.

Unfortunately in its current state I really cannot do so. It lacks depth, challenge and polish.\n\nPros: In the actual ships, the mouse and keyboard controls work pretty well and the game is quite playable as such. There are some narrative beats in the campaign that could be interesting with a bit more substance to them. The autoassist targeting and landing guides are helpful.\n\nCons: There are significant parts of the game that feel vestigial, like the presence of sequences where you can walk around the ship (and have to walk from hangar to ready room at the start of each mission). There's nothing you can actually do in these sequences and they really don't contribute anything that a simple mission briefing cutscene or even text screen wouldn't have. Or being able to control your wingmen - you can give them orders, but there's not really any reason to do so and their presence is barely even noticeable. They never even speak outside of a few brief comments during scripted narrative. Missions consist of little more than moving between waypoints and firing lasers at enemy craft until they explode. The only times I took damage over three full missions were when I accidentally rammed into something, and your ship slowly repairs itself so I was never in danger. The cutscenes are deeply awkward with little animation and rough character models. Objectives are vague and not necessarily well cued (I spent probably fifteen minutes trying to figure out how to scan for one objective until I realized it had been allocated as a secondary weapon.) But it might be kind of fun as a throwaway shooting gallery if it weren't for the fact that it's also broken. Missile lockon stops working after the tutorial. Objectives don't fire or fire at the wrong times. Mission 3 automatically failed on me repeatedly because the script necessary to complete it successfully never triggered.

The controls have been semi improved as have the characters but the cockpits are still lackluster. Adding insult to injury is the fact that the development team has been absent for an unsettling amount of time.

For the love of god, buy Freespace or Wing Commander or Strike Suit Zero or X3 or even DarkStar One before you buy this. This game is not good. It feels like a game designed by people who only had the faintest idea of how video games worked, and set out to reinvent everything from scratch because they didn't know any better. The first-person walking segments are incredibly slow and the mouse/keyboard controls work like no PC first-person shooter ever. The targeting options are abysmal. Basic functions that Freespace had almost two decades ago, like "target closest enemy" or "target ship under reticule," simply do not exist in the game (though there's some loopy auto-targeting system that doesn't work nearly as well as you'd want it to). The game doesn't automatically switch missile bays when you run out of missiles.\n\nYou often don't know about escort objectives you may have until you fail them for the first time out of the blue (the ships you're escorting never cry for help and you can't see an indicator of how damaged they are unless you target them directly). This causes you to fail the entire mission, throwing you back to the last checkpoint. CHECKPOINTS ARE AWFUL IN THIS GAME. They often throw you back two or three encounters, even when it seems like you should be able to save at a clear waypoint in between.\n\nControls are so screwed up that I can't actually access the Controls menu in game because before I can move the menu cursor down to Controls, I get kicked into the Sound menu and can't find my way out with either the controller or the keyboard. Hitting Shift-F12 to take a screenshot snaps control of the game to the keyboard immediately, requiring you to kick back out to the pause menu to reset back to the controller. Also, I have to resort to a controller because using my joystick is out of the question because the button configuration is hardcoded, meaning basic functions are set on joystick buttons that are harder to reach. And since doing anything with the keyboard immediately locks the joystick out, playing this game like ANY OTHER SPACE SIM OF THE PAST TWENTY YEARS by using both the keyboard and joystick is impossible.\n\nI can go on: about the cutscenes with people who don't move at all except for their mouths (they're like bizarre talking statues), about the fact that the bad guys all seem to be random Arab and Asian countries, about the incoherent narrative, about how your guns run out of juice after ten seconds of sustained fire (if that), about how you can't even charge your guns while firing your afterburners, about how locking upgrades behind CPs are a baffling way to run a military (seriously, I have to UNLOCK good fighters?), about how it would take something like twenty or thirty playthroughs to come close to unlocking everything, etc., etc., etc. Just, no. Don't spend your time on this.\n\nI do wish Escape Hatch the best; clearly they've got heart and ambition. But it might be better to start with a basic game genre that's easier to iterate on and perfect, rather than dive headlong into a genre known for complexity (even though really it's not that complex) and getting so many things wrong.","May 13, 2014","false","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Why? I mean, yes, walking around the ship so slow (and pointless, really) that it's more of a chore than a perk, and the voice acting is distractingly bad, but I could look past such things.\n\nWhat really grinds my gears is what happens when you try to fly the ship. Just getting the thing pointed in the direction you want it to go is more of a battle than the actual fighting. Not only is the steering about as smooth as Paul Bunyan's beard, it's totally unpredictable. It's like your ship is saying, "Now, I know you SAID you wanted to pull straight up to put your target right in your crosshairs, buuuuut I think what you really want is for me to pull up, go slightly to the right, then instead of stopping on the target I'll jerk hard left. And up a little. And then left a little more. Soooo, I'm gonna do that instead. Myea."\n\nEven if your ship didn't follow directions with the obedience of a 2 year old or a cat, the ships turn so slow to begin with that even what should be the most maneuverable ones just feel dull and lifeless.\n\nI hope they patch some of this stuff up, because if the flight controls felt more like they do in the games SI is trying to emulate (Freespace, X-Wing, Wing Commender, Tachyon) it would be fantastic. Till then, it's no more than a bunch of pretty lights and cool ideas that just aren't any fun.","May 4, 2014","false","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Although this might make the learning curve a little steap for some people,  It will make the game that much more rewarding, and it will help the game stand out.
