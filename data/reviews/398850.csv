So picking up a game where you're a girl riding a fox through a whimsical land is not something I would normally pick up..i'm glad I did, the art style is sublime, the music enchanting and the gameplay addictive and tense during final battles; it is here that your typing skills will really be put to the test especially when multi elemental enemy types are skittering their way toward you. Purging the landscape you explore of the insectoid corruption is satisfying while making things grow to the- already mentioned- enchanting soundtrack is cathartic.

Closest thing I could compare it to aesthetically speaking would be "Tearaway".  Gameplay is a combination of exploration and light puzzle elements with the story unfolding through subtitles placed on the land. Enemies faced are killed through typing, each using related words that tell somewhat of a side-story.\n\nAs it stands, can be played through in about 90-120min. Two different areas containing puzzles and hidden chests followed by arenas where you do battle against waves of enemies. Combo+Point system exists but at this stage it's quite barebones. Chests found and points awarded can be spent on upgrades for your fox, such as runspeed and magic power. Plans for the future include, adaptive difficulty/word settings, leaderboards, fleshing out combo systems and addingmore chapters to the story.\n\nControls were all keyboard driven, WSAD keys could be used but since it's a typing game it does try and teach correct hand placement by using EFIJ instead. No in-game options available, screen resolutions of 4k+ were supported through the unity launcher. Given the wonderful presentation and the fact it I was hooked from start to end, Epistory gets my recommendation. Just keep in mind the target audience and current length (Devs mention 25%~ complete). If funds are a bit tighter, might be worth wishlisting instead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlyrom/recommended/398850/","deadlyrom","RhyDin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlyrom/","327 products in account","I'm a fast typist and have always wanted a challenging typing game. I bought this game on a whim and was pleasantly surprised with a great dramatic story dialogue, a mix of simple puzzle elements (mostly a hybrid of Legend of Zelda and Undertale-esque floor puzzles), cool upgrades, hidden-item secrets and thoughtful level design. The game is presented to you in a dungeon format and features an unlockable skill tree progression of your choosing. This is neat, because you can cater to your own play style for an easier or more challenging game early on (although you'll eventually unlock all skills).\n\nEverything in the game is done through typing - including the ability to navigate the pause menu (opened with the Tab key, how clever), movement, attacking and changing skills. Enemies crawl towards you (on easier difficulties, they move slower) and if you're hit once, you have to redo the encounter from the beginning. If desired, you can change difficulty on the fly with no penalty. For achievement hunters, note that there are no achievements related to difficulty setting.\n\nI used to play Typing of The Dead on my SEGA Dreamcast a lot and even picked up the new one, but it always lacked a challenge and isn't difficult to complete without dying if you're a good typist. With Epistory, the hard mode in combination with adaptive difficulty feels just right. Skills affect enemies in different ways and on harder difficulties, you need to use them effectively - being able to switch skills on the fly opens for really unique ways to tackle different situations.\n\nAs a learning tool for typing, I can see this game as being quite effective. The game itself has only cartoon monster violence and no explicit language in it's stock dictionary list (the author plans on implementing Steam Workshop support for community submitted dictionary lists, however). Multitasking is encouraged with skills, but you are only typing one word at a time - not sentences. Since the majority of the dictionary has short words, this has the benefit of reinforcing muscle memory quickly. The game would be best used for learning in combination with another typing tool or website utilizing full sentences, however.\n\nMy only complaint is that I do not feel in-game statistics (viewable at the title screen) of words per minute are accurately assessed. This isn't a huge deal and beginning typists should familiarize themselves with knowing where the keys are before chasing such numbers. I can only surmise this inaccuracy is due to the way words will slowly crawl onto the screen, as well as the typing of short bursts, but I don't know how the game timer calculates WPM. In other words, in a real world scenario, you will be typing full sentences and not waiting for words to crawl onto the screen at a varying pace.\n\nDuring boss encounters, the game throws hordes of enemies at you. This is when the game gets very fun and tests your ability to type short bursts of words in as little time possible. Once you defeat the boss, however, you cannot replay that same boss battle again without starting the game over (normal dungeon and overworld enemies will continue to respawn upon re-entry, even after completion). At the time of writing, the multiplayer mode is not present, but it's my understanding the online multiplayer aspect will feature a boss battle sort of scenario - allowing you to continue practicing in this fashion.\n\nEpistory took me about seven and a half hours to complete with all skills, unlocking all of the overworld and doing a lot of optional stuff on the hardest difficulty with adaptive on. Further replayability lies in multiplayer and achievements, which are mostly just replaying the game again to get more kills. Still, this is the best typing game I've ever played and worth it even at full price.","April 1","true","14.0"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","22","22","0","0"

The typing mechanics work well both in fights and during exploration, slowly a little variety is introduced with enemies requiring more than one word, repeating words to activate a lever etc. You'll also unlock different elements that are not only required to solve certain puzzles but also give you tactical options during fights         ( e.g. ice freezes enemies, fire burns out the next word you'd have typed). The game is pretty challenging when facing enemy waves, you're basically rooted on ther spot and have to deal with several waves coming your way: the challenge comes from having to quickly look at words, type them, ensure no new enemies spawn near and- eventually- having to quickly switch elements. And if you die you'll have to do the whole thing again so you can easily imagine how losing a few times in the last wave can get a bit aggravating.\n\nHaving to start over on some long and difficult fights during the late game can get downright frustrating to be honest, even more so if you just made a typo or wasn't expecting an enemy to spawn close: the game requires quite a bit of mental focus and good reflexes so prolonged plays can leave you quite drained. Also slightly frustrating were a few puzzles requiring precise movements where I felt the keyboard hadn't enough finesse to make things as smooth as expected.\n\nLast but not least despite being out for almost a month there's still a few bugs, most of them are simply annoying like the map not working in a certain dungeon, an achievement triggering at the wrong time and so on: the 13th April patch introduced a game stopping bug though and, when the devs reverted to the previous patch, experience points where reset for certain players (myself included). I was lucky enough to have enough chests and fights left to go almost go back to where I was (plus an hour or so of grinding the few respawning mobs you find around) but since those points are needed to reveal new areas and progress the situation was pretty dire.\n\nThere's not many typing games around and Epistory surely ranks amongst the best: it's a great experience despite a few flaws and fans of the genre, or those looking for novel game mechanics, will find plenty to like. You might want to wait for a few more patches to land though, to ensure things are smooth and nothing breaks again.\n","April 19","true","7.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/398850/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","My mother was a teacher for over thirty years. She was also ran the disadvantaged schools program for a significant part of her career. As such she was constantly pushing that the schools in her area had access to the latest technology and programs available. As an only child I was always close to her. I took an avid interest in her interests. I took an interest in her work. I’ve sustained friendships with a few of her colleagues long after she has passed away. They understand that one of my passions as an adult has been to incorporate gaming into education. One of the important programs that Steamified is in the midst of establishing is based wholly around this ideology. As such those friends have helped keep me up to date on the latest and greatest games that can be used for educational purposes. I’ve played most of the ones that I’ve been able to get my hands on. Therefore my credentials of understanding this specific genre of gaming is well grounded.\n\nWith that said I want to tell you that I have never found a game as good as Epistory: Typing Chronicles to educate school aged gamers to learn to type. I’ve played games such as The Typing of the Dead: Overkill, the legendary Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing and countless others. While they’re all very good games for various reasons they don’t match up as wholly well as what Epistory does. The game’s features and its story are so well executed that the learning experience that is available within the game is one that can be easily hidden. That’s part of what makes the game so special from that perspective. The best learning experiences are those where the student isn’t concentrating on the actual learning but the actual experience. An analogy to that is the best way to teach someone how to read isn’t by having them read the dictionary but rather through reading the types of material that they enjoy the most. You learn to type through the game by being engrossed into the game, its story and by enjoying its features. The player does not have their mind focused on the actual typing but rather the destruction of enemies and of eliminating pieces of the environment that need to be cleared in order to progress. In this essence, Epistory is almost completely flawless.\n\nDon’t allow me to pigeon hole the game as one for the kids because there is plenty here for adults to enjoy as well. As a game it is exciting and constantly challenging. The story is engrossing and the atmosphere is engaging. The game’s puzzles beyond the typing are intuitive and have been very well designed and implemented into the game. The paper craft world is among the most fascinating and beautiful that I have come across. I love how the graphics display the world opening up to the player. One of the game’s greatest strengths are the sheer amount of keyboard and language options. There are seven languages and seven keyboard options.\n\nFishing Cactus have added Steam achievements to their game as well as incorporating Steam Workshop and Steam Leaderboard tools. I would naturally love to see trading cards added to the game as it would be one of those games where I just have to level it up to level 5. Within the game I would like to see the ability to reset upgrade points implemented into the game. However, that would enable players to unlock multiple achievements without much effort. Another thing that I would like to see added is the ability to have different save profiles. I’d love to have Ainslie play the game but the game is on my account and to allow her to do so – without family sharing – is to have her play my save game which is something that I would like to avoid.\n\nThat this is the Steam debut of Fishing Catcus makes Epistory an even more remarkable achievement. It’s a game that I would dearly love to see spawn a sequel as it is such an easy recommendation that it will likely find itself among my favorite games of this year. At $14.99 this game is already a bargain.\n\nFor more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.","May 2","true","17.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","1"

However, the game has "Adaptive Difficulty Mode". So I'm guessing it start to go easier on you if you do more typos and stuff. I've no idea how exactly how this works.\n\nThe game has a narrative style similar to "Bastion", but more like Fantasy and Poems, it's not as involving but add a nice little touch.\n\nGame play is basically:\n\n1 - Explore the world and unlock new sections\n2 - Solve puzzles (They are quite simple)\n3 - Destroy obstacles and loot chests\n4 - Kill enemies and boss fights.\n\nAll of this is done with your keyboard, there's no mouse input.  Even switching from Fire to Ice spell for example is done by typing "Ice" or "Fire".  Killing enemies is done by typing words.\n\nThere's also a light RPG element to it, as you get skill points and can upgrade various things. So it gives a sense of progression which add to the fun.\n\nI recommend you watch a gameplay on youtube if you're unsure.\n\nI'm bad at writing reviews but this game deserves more than 137 reviews so I had to leave one.\n\nMy only complains are clunky controls when trying to solve some of the puzzles, only 1 save slot and max res is 2560x1440 (I use a 3440x1440 monitor), so I've to play it Windowed to prevent stretching.\n\nThis one of the best best typing game I've played since Typing of the Dead, and it's also a much more relaxing and atmospheric experience.\n\nVery pleased with the purchase.\n\n9/10","April 4","true","55.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

Instead of a lengthy write-up I'll just list the main pros and cons for the present version.\n\npros:\n- very focused gameplay concept that doesn't stray from its path ... doesn't try to do things not part of the core idea\n- very nice graphics, clean and colourful look, very pleasing\n- good sound design\n- the developer is very responsive on the forums\n\ncons:\n- neither features nor world and content are complete in this early version (This isn't really a downside, but when buying the present version it's still a fact. In the past on other early access titles even seemingly highly motivated developers ran away with the money / ran out of money and left without commenting or taking their game from the store. I don't see that happening here at all, but yea... ;) )\n- the concept is very limited (again: I don't see this as a real downside ... , but since the game already has the RPG tag in the Steam tag system I'd still like to mention it once more: The game is very focused on its core concept and doesn't stray from that. It might be labeled as an RPG by other Steam users, but really: The number of skills doesn't reach a two-digit number, there are no items, no NPCs, no dialogues, no real choices to be made etc. etc.. If you do NOT expect these things I don't think you'll miss them, just ... don't buy this game looking for an RPG with complex character customization options.)\n\nbottomline:\n- If you like short(ish) games with fresh gameplay mechanics and clean, nice, but not overly sophisticated graphics, but don't buy feature-incomplete games: WISHLIST this\n- If you like short(ish) games with fresh gameplay mechanics and clean, nice, but not overly sophisticated graphics and don't mind risking a few EUR on a feature-incomplete game which seems to be very well on track: BUY this now!

Literally a storybook that's being created as you move about the world. The core mechanic is switching into a "typing mode" and quickly typing out words hovering over the environment, chests, and enemies. Typing quickly extends a combo meter and when the meter is finished, it adds XP to your level bar. The XP bar gates abilities and places you can go. As you unlock new areas, new dungeons are discovered. Within these dungeons are "tools" that grant you new special abilities. The two I've encountered so far is my attacks/typing are now Fire & Ice based. By entering "typing mode" I can switch between them by typing "fire" or "ice". Fire burns enemies after the first correctly spelled word (most enemies take two words to defeat) and Ice will stop an enemy for a period of time. Since your character dies after being touched by an enemy, combat consists of using your typing skills to pick the right targets and switching between your two attacks.\n\nMy only criticism is that the movement is a little clunky. It Tries to teach you an alternative control screen at the start of the game but I found myself naturally using WASD to move. It works well enough and you can quickly put points into movement speed (and a sprint skill) but traversing the world feels very rigid.\n\nApparently the difficulty adjusts as you play the game. The worse you are at typing, the easier the words are. I spend my entire day typing so I'm getting some very long and difficult words thrown at me. There have been a few occasions where part of a word was not inputted since I was typing too fast. This isn't a normal occurrence, however.\n\nDid I mention you are a young girl riding around on a fox being narrated by a the author writing a book? I probably should have mentioned that.\n\nI really recommend this. Despite it being very Bastion, it's incredibly unique.","March 31","true","3.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/398850/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","TIME TO EDIT THE EARLY ACCESS REVIEW FOR A COMPLETE REVIEW\n\nI knew about Epistory before it was put in Early Access because Pedago-tic ASBL (I work there) happened to be among those who organized a game jam in Belgium, with Fishing Cactus. So, I heard about Epistory at that time and waited for the release.\n\nUnfortunately, real life got in the way and I only bought the game during the last Winter Sales. I'm testing it now and writing a review.\n\nEpistory is a game where you're a young girl on a giant fox, without memories, until she realizes that something bad will happen and that she will be the one that will restore the world around her.\n\nThe story is told by words displayed when you're going forward, in a poetic manner. However, you will have to remove obstacles, open chests, kill enemies or restore the nature by typing words that will be shown in writing mode - you don't see them when you're moving around.\n\nEach word spelt will give you XP and after reaching a certain amount, you can improve an ability by typing the noun. Words are also tied in the category: for gems/rocks, it will be names of them, for everything that needs fire in the game, it will be related to that topic....\n\nIf some words seem gibberish, it's normal, as you need special powers to understand them. For example, at the end of the investigation of the meteorite's crash site, you'll be able to use fire where you need, so that you can go forward in the game.\n\nThe girl has no power in the beginning, however, she'll acquire the power of fire (burn the next word), ice (stop an enemy for a few seconds), thunder (can destroy words above other enemies) and wind (can knock back enemies). These powers are the main focus of each chapter "dungeon".\n\nThe XP acquired is also needed to unlock new areas, whether they're related to a zone to clear or a nest to clear (nests being circles with black smoke: enemies are coming in waves).\n\nThat last feature of enemy waves is also found in the arena mode, with leaderboards.\n\nThe little downside to that is that as everything is written with the keyboard, when you're defending yourself against enemies, you can't move at all as the writing mode is keeping you where you stand. Besides, as you need to type fast, you're bound to miss letters and loose time as the enemies are advancing towards you.\n\nAlso, I wish that I could bind arrows as I'm used with this config since years. Here, I have to adapt myself to a ZQSD (which I can handle). But the problem is that the primary binding is EFIJ to move around. I struggled a lot with that because I couldn't put my fingers back to these bindings after writing. EF are also just next to ZD, so, you bet that when I wanted my character to go to the right, it was going to the left, because I pressed E/F insteand of Z/D.\n\nHowever, you choose your difficulty and you can also enable an adaptative difficulty during the waves. If you're struggling, each time you start, the enemies will be slower or simply not coming all in the same time but with more space in time for example.\n\nThe graphics are very impressive, like an origami or papier-maché landscape. I love the difference of ambiance: brightful in the beginning and yet, the more the girl is exploring, the more she's seeing devastated landscapes (a cave caused by a meteorite, an abandoned mine, a temple destroyed by water, shattered isles, even a forest full of spiders without forgetting a desert).\n\nWhile the audio was initially broken, I managed to get it back, though I don't know if it's due to the solution posted by Fishing Cactus or not. It's marvelous and magnificient. Also, they followed advices from players to include a full audio in English to tell the story written on the path of the girl. The narrator did very well her part.\n\nTrue, you still have some bugs around, after all, we're all stuck to 16 combos, which means that I'll probably have to erase my data and play the game again (but not before unlocking the achievements with enemies killed and words written). However, Fishing Cactus is reactive, so, I have faith to see soon a patch.\n\nEpistory was a game I was recommeding back then and I'm not disappointed by the whole package. If anything, it should be in your library as it's a wonderful story, so poetic. The typing gameplay is also a good core for it.\n\nReally, a true gem.","January 5","true","33.3"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roahn/recommended/398850/","roahn","Roahn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roahn/","236 products in account","Please note the developers did give me this game to review, but will not affect my review in any way.\n\nEpistory - Typing Chronicles is a typing game by heart, but a fantastic game with a beautiful world and great level design is found when you look at its layers.\n\nThe graphics of this game look fantastic. Everything from the paper mache/origami feel of the characters to the newspaper look of when the world expands; this game really utilises the Unity engine and gives something that is very unique to this game. Luckily, the graphics aren’t the only thing that makes this game unique.\n\nThe gameplay is much more than typing. You will explore the overworld; or as it’s called: “The Bridge”. Here there will be basic monsters to fight which you kill by typing, areas that can only be unlocked through abilities that you acquire as you progress through the game or other areas that has to be unlocked through ‘inspiration points’ which is the RPG element of this game. These points are given through fighting enemies and clearing dungeons.\n\nThe dungeons is where the gameplay absolutely shines. The level design is absolutely top notch with them looking simple at start but as you unlock the special ability of that dungeon lots of areas start to open up and it becomes really grand and lively. It feels amazing when you accomplish it.\n\nOther than using Inspiration Points to unlock new areas you can use them to upgrade your character and get perks such as getting more points at a combo or making a special ability stronger so it is more effective. There is also another part of the gameplay that really focuses on fighting the monsters and this is called ‘Arena’.\n\nYou will find these arenas in dungeons and on the bridge and here you can not move as monsters come at you while you fight back and not let them get to you. While this feature is welcomed and is nice at the start; later on in the game these go on for way too long as instead of raising the intensity of the amount of monsters they just make it longer and it just drags on and becomes a bore.\n\nI found the sound to be a hit and miss. The music is good at times and really works and emphasises on the emotional scenes but at other times it doesn’t really fit with what is happening on screen as there may a really intense moment but laid back light music is playing instead of something intense.\n\nThe narration however, is incredible with a really nice narrator telling the story of what is going on. And that leads us to the story, which is about a girl on a fox exploring the world around her but anything that was happening in the story I didn’t pick up as the narrator mainly talked about the environment and describing what the girl was feeling. So the main plot, until the end  was kind of was non-existent, but it doesn’t matter much either as a big story isn’t really needed in an overall relaxing game like this. It’s about the environments and gameplay, and that’s what this game does well.\n\nBy the I finished Epistory, I was in love with the game, even if the execution of this game was a little rough around the edges, all the elements add up to make a memorable and amazing game that shouldn’t be frowned upon just because it’s a typing game. Its unique and I recommend it to anyone willing to experience something different.\n\nI give this game a 4.5/5\n\nPros:\n+Graphics\n+Expansive world\n+Level design in dungeons\n+Narration\n+Unique gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Music sometimes misses\n-Arena sections go on for too long","April 2","true","9.4"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","15","21","3","0"

It is very much an adventure game with typing for combat. Unless you are absolutely dreadful with the keyboard you should enjoy playing this game. Some of the fights, especially the end of level fights, can be pretty fast-paced, but there is a dynamic difficulty so if you fail a fight it will be easier the next time.\n\nThe game itself is beautiful. It has a paper/origami styling in both the graphics and the game sounds and it is wonderfully executed. As you progress through the world you unlock new areas and these flutter and unfold into being in front of your eyes. You gain multiple powers of magic as you explore the different parts of the story/world and these abilities must be used not only to interact with elements of the world but in combat. All combat is against insects ranging from crawling, to walking, to flying bugs. There is nothing gory. The large fights can last several minutes and you are stationary during them while and onslaught constantly spawns around you. There is no penalty for death, you will just restart moments before triggering the fight, but as I mentioned earlier the difficulty of the fight will be reduced. I really like this feature and wish more games would provide it. I'm in the game more for the experience, the story, the exploration, not to perfect combat so it works very well for me. That said I've only died a few times and I'm not a touch-typer. I have my own typing style which has evolved from 30+ years of having computers.\n\nThe developer has done a great job making the powers feel appropriate. You start with the ability to shoot fireballs when you type words but you gain other types of magic as you progress. I'm not going to say what they are because I think unlocking those powers is part of the fun of the game. Not only do the ways the powers work feel appropriate to the type of magic, but the words you'll need to type are related. It is very easy to see by color of the text which type of magic must be used. It is possible this could be a problem for those with color deficiency issues so I'd recommend watching some videos of the game to see before buying.\n\nThe game performs very well. I have no trouble maintaining 60fps at 1080p. The music is wonderful.\n\nI've had a great deal of fun with this game and would highly recommend it.\n\nIf you'd like to watch my complete Let's Play of the game the first episode is here...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/377ghgYOoQo","April 18","true","7.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Overall I think this is a cool game.\n\nPros:\nArt direction. I am a pretty big fan of this. Watching the world grow around you as you progress really motivates you to continue and the book page animation style to the tiles really fits the theme of the game. Everything has the "cut from paper, seemingly origami" aesthetic. Very cool.\nSound. I think there is a subtle elegance to the sound that they chose to go with and it isn't intrusive but still gives a nice ambience. The end song was a wonderfully unique composition.\nGameplay & combat. This is as complicated of a gameplay style that a typing game can get. They did really well on this front. The game has an 'experience' bar, which uses a feather currency that is acquired from typing words and opening treasure chests, abilities that you can level up, and four schools of magic that you learn along the way, which allow you to progress to new areas of the game. Everything is very well-paced, albeit if you are a fast typist you will finish the game relatively quickly and be yearning for more. ;) I finished the game in approx. 5 hours.\nDifficulty curve. They have an adaptive difficulty setting that can be turned off or on.\nThe developers do seem very involved in addressing player issues/questions/reports.\nCons:\nYour character doesn't stop as suddenly as you would like sometimes, and more than once I found myself sliding into an enemy and dying as a result. Think Mario or Donkey Kong in an ice level.\nEdit-After typing this review I got a personal e-mail response from one of the devs addressing some of the neutral points and cons, which was very nice of them and so I've edited out some things that maybe was a quick judgment on my part. They are doing a great job!\n\n*Update*-Removed some bug-related things from the cons list as the devs have fixed them.

What a lovely game! I'm only 1.5 hours in, but I want to type a couple of words here before I forget.\n\nI can already say that it is well worth the money, and unless this game ends in like 30 minutes or less from where I am I'd even venture to say they should up it a bit, because 14,99€ seems like an absolute steal.\n\nThe typing feels great and thrilling - some encounters are really hectic, and pulling off a perfect spree when it's practically hailing words and letters at you makes you feel awesome. There is also a "dynamic difficulty"-setting which is hard to measure without knowing how it works, but it seems to me like the difficulty adapted pretty well. I feel that the challenge is just right to not be frustrating but still make me sweat a bit.\n\nThe world is very pretty with the crumpled paper look, and it's really sweet how it unfolds before your eyes.\n\nThe narration is stellar, well-paced and delivered in a way that befits a world that unfolds piece by piece as you explore it. Really draws me in and makes the experience feel really special.\nThe music is also great. I remember getting shivers down my spine when the music emphasized the sudden dramatic turn in the narration in the beginning. I feel like that sync between music and narration was lost a bit after the intro bit though, not as much well-timed changes that amplify the narration, but maybe I'm just a bit too focused on typing words like a raging lunatic to notice now.\n\nOne small gripe I have is that it becomes a bit tricky to follow the narration that happens during hectic fights because the audio seems to be overcome by the sound fx of magic being fired and enemies dying. Might be a setting to increase the volume of the narration, but I think the sound level is perfect out of combat, so not sure if that's a good solution for me.\n\nAs a final note, it takes a bit of getting used to the proposed control scheme(EFJI), but after a while it starts feeling natural and doesn't cause any noteworthy grief. I missclick from time to time, but no problem really, and it's getting earier all the time. If you really can't stand it they've enabled ordinary WASD-movement as well, so it shouldn't be a problem for anyone.\n\nI absolutely, absolutely recommend this game if you even slightly enjoy typing-games. Even if you aren't a huge fan, this might be the title to win you over since the world and the narration draws you in.","March 31","true","1.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The core mechanic relies on typing: obstacles, puzzles and enemies are overcome by typing. But the game is so much deeper than that.\n\nThe level design is just brilliant. Even the seemingly random words you type hold part of the story. Lots of play on words and fun puzzles reinforce the entire world, perfecting the core mechanic.\n\nEnemies are fun to type away, and there are four elements you can use (once you've mastered them) each with different results, giving you a varied gameplay experience and your own personal choice for combat (most of the time, anyway).\n\nThe story itself is nice. I can't really say much more without any spoilers, but I found it very enjoyable. Add the fact that world itself is telling part of it, a great voice actress, and a well-thought presentation, and you've got yourself a very fun and interesting joruney.\n\nThe game is very well paced, and it's neither too short nor too long. The progression system is neat, and unravelling the world (and the plot) feels very gratifying.\n\nThen there's challenges for those who like to explore the game, and those who want to improve their typing skills. Hidden treasures and parts of the map, plus very cleverly thought out mechanics, and this game is a gem among a lot of mud.\n\nAs a final touch, you have the option (on by default) to use adaptive difficulty, which is a great way of not interrupting the flow of the game if you're distracted / having a bad day.\n\nI heartily recommend this game for anyone who's looking for a fun, different game, that doesn't hold your hand through every step or insults your intelligence by making everything too easy / obvious.\n\nGreat job, Fishing Cactus!","April 4","true","7.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The story is beautifully written, and as someone who really enjoys "artsy" kinds of games, the game felt all together quite nice.\n\nEpistory plays out sort of like Bastion mixed with typing action. You'll need to face down hordes of insects to unravel the story. This can sometimes get to be a bit difficult when you get to the stages where the words blend in with the background.

I spent a lot of hours in the flash game of Typer Shark and numerous other games like it being compelled by some unseen force that really gets a kick out of typing. Then out of nowhere came Epistory – Typing Chronicles from Fishing Cactus and it was even more fun than the rest. Could this be then end-all-be-all? I’m not sold on that, but what we do have so far is very promising.\n\nEpistory uses an origami approach to the aesthetics of their game and it’s very cool to watch the world unfold as the story unravels and to watch your character explore and unveil the ever-expanding world unlocked with challenges. (Ok, that’s enough of that.) Either way it’s cool. I think one of the more frustrating things was finding a place you couldn’t get access to due to Epistory being in Early Access. It is understandable since it’s not done yet, but still… I want it! I’ve said it before and I’ll no doubt say it again, that if wanting more is “the problem” the player is feeling, then the developer us doing something right. (Unless your game ends on a cliffhanger and there is no sequel planned, then it’s just all sorts of wrong.)\n\nI was also thinking that this could be a good tool to help teach my daughters to type when they get older if we’re not all jacked in neurally by then. Alas, the difficulty shows itself numerous times with what’s been given so far. I think that as a tutor, this would only breed frustration. This is more of a get better and finesse your skills than it is a teaching game. That’s not a bad thing, but I think there is an opportunity here to capitalize on if they added a slower learning mode. That way a parent might be swayed into picking this up with two or more people in mind rather than just to enjoy the story so far themselves.\n\nAs far as the story goes, there’s not too much to say about it since it’s still not finished and I’m not sure what the end game is here. Epistory is, however, less interesting than it is more compelling. That’s a difficult thought to put into words, but let me try. It’s not going to win any awards at this point from me, but I feel strongly compelled to play more and level up. Also killing bugs is always a good thing since the only good bug is a dead bug. It almost feels like the story is a background to the action on the screen. That certainly shows when text pops up during the middle of a “boss platform” where tons of crap starts to get thrown at you… yeh, I read most of that after the fight. So there could be something to the story, but I think that Epistory has me on the gameplay mechanics alone at this point. That’s kind of cool too in its own way and it also wouldn’t be the first time I’ve enjoyed a game simply by playing it without cause or concern for a story. There might also be an element of disconnect from myself and the protagonist. I don’t know her name or story, I just start playing as her and I’m killing bugs. Like I said, it is fun, but I’m not emotionally invested in her yet. Maybe as the game goes on I will attach a little more to her. I still want to help her though.\n\nOne last note, at this time they have two powers to use when typing: fire and ice. Fire will slowly burn up the next word on an enemy’s “life bar/word que” so you won’t have to type the next word in and the ice power should be self-explanatory, but it freezes the bugs in place. You’ll get more time to type if you freeze them, but you’ll have to type less if you burn them. Some enemies will force an option on you while others will give you the choice of what powers to use (for me, it’s usually what I’ve already selected, but I do appreciate the freezing.) With that said, I’m not sure if there is a point system in place for burning a word up or getting more time to type another word in. Do I lose part of my experience bonus if I don’t actually type it in? If I freeze and eventually type that second word in will I get more experience points? I’m not sure, but I like leveling up so on the side of caution I’m just freezing as many as I can so I can level up more. Should they be clearer? Maybe. Am I worrying too much about this detail… probably. Is that how I’m going to continue to play the game since I don’t know… definitely!\n\nScore: Support This Title!\n\nYes, you should pick this up. If you enjoy a good typing game… well, this is a great one. There is a bit of challenge here, but that’s another reason to play this game, to get better. The story is neat, but the art style is something that I think most people should experience because it’s pretty cool looking. It’s very well done and I’ll try to stop harping about it. The game is fun and I can’t wait for more of it/the full game to come out so I can continue to play.","December 18, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I saw it come across steam while searching for new games to play and jumped right in not knowing what to expect. I get a sick pleasure out of typing games and this certainly scratched that itch. What I didn't expect what such a rich and engaging storyline to go along with it. It tells the story and shapes the world around you very similarly to how Bastion did and I think it really works in it's favor. Watching the world unfold around you as you unlock it bit by bit is very rewarding as it unfolds through paper crafting it around you. The environments were unique and felt very well fleshed out with their own personalities and dynamic. The levels weren't difficult to navigate and generally made sense to get around. I found the game just challenging enough without getting overly frustrated. As you progress through the storyline you gain abilities that have various effects on the enemies you are fighting. Each has their own unique playstyle that feels like it gives you the freedom to choose how you want to play. There didn't appear to be one power that was more effective than the others, but just promoted different strategies. There were definitely times where the game forced you to use a specific power to fight the enemies, but instead of feeling bound the game choosing for me, I felt challenged as it would force you to think on your feet quickly to prioritize which enemies you went for as there would often be more than one type of element at a time. There were numerous scenarios where you were fighting enemies in wave like fashion where the game never forced you to use any one element. In terms of story, I felt like I maybe wanted a little bit more out of the ending, however there does appear to be a decent amount of replayability with upping the difficulty and the arena challenges.\n\nNow while I enjoyed this game immensely and would recommend in a heartbeat, but there are things that I experienced that I feel should be talked about. The controls can be rather clunky at times making it difficult to navigate through some of the world. It isn't always clear what is part of the environment you can move through and what isn't. I found a couple instances where I would be working through a timed puzzle and would get stuck on an area that didn't look like it had anything hanging me up which was very frustrating. In terms of the game responding to the words I was typing felt very responsive for the most part, however I did find a couple weird issues on that front as well. There would be times that no matter what I did the words to kill an enemy would never pop up. Also, due to the perspective you are sitting in during fights it can be next to impossible to read the words from enemies very far away. It's not that they aren't popping up, but there is a distinct blur that doesn't get clear until they are basically right infront of you. The pop in of the longer words have presented problems for me as well. I understand that the longer words are supposed to be a challenge, however if a word that is like most of the alphabet long is coming from the right hand side of the screen, I won't be able to begin attempting to type it until the enemy is 5 seconds away from one-shotting me. In those instances I think it would help to zoom out from the arena a bit to give the ability to have a decent attempt at the word. There was a moment I had 3 huge monsters slithering towards me and when the words finally popped in there was a difficulty spike of damn near impossible. In issues with the enemies as well, there are moments where there are tiny flying enemies that only have one letter you have to press to kill them. This is fine through most of the game, however there are environments where you are in the sky or another light colored environment where you can't see the letter due to it blending with the background. The smaller enemies look like general non-threatening flies that add to the environment, so a combination of not seeing the letters pop up and the enemies looking like something that is always buzzing around anyway, led to some frustrating failures 5 minutes into a wave-fight that you have to start all over. My last and final gripe was the map....it never seemed to load correctly. There is no way to scroll through the level on the map and oftentimes it would just show black star-looking field of nothingness. I am sure this is something that can come through on a patch, I just hope it does.\n\nI am excited to see how the arena aspect gets fleshed out. I don't know if the dev's are still working on it, but I think this aspect of the game will give longevity and replayability to it as you can compete against others on a world leaderboard. My only complaint there was that the first playthrough I had on arena was fairly easy and I acheived a high score on the leaderboard. However, the subsquent next times I attempted to play the same arena, the words were IMMENSELY harder and this seems to be due to the adaptive difficulty feature. I think that this feature is helpful in keeping the game at the player's pace, however I don't know the scoreboards are able to distinguish based on difficulty and score. It seems to me you could turn adaptive difficulty off and set it to the easiest difficulty and play the arena just to amass a huge score. This could use a bit of balance if that is the case.\n\nAll in all, despite it's flaws, this game was engaging enough for me to keep playing all the way through to the end and then some. I think the flaws are little tweaks that can be made to improve the game that is already fairly well-polished. The quirks aren't enough to make the game unplayable in any respect. I would like to see more games like this one and maybe even another one in the future by the dev's!","April 3","true","9.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've not had so much fun with a game in a long while. It feels like a "casual game" in some sense, with only basic exploration and a really relaxing atmosphere with great music and a giant fox. And then you get thrown into an arena with spiders and wasps trying to murder you and you have to type furiously for your life.\n\nI really like the battle system. It actually requires a bit of thinking in addition to the typing, since you have up to 4 magic types that you can switch between (by typing their names) in battle. Some magics do damage over time, some do AOE damage, and some provide great crowd control. So depending on whether you're fighting a horde of tiny bugs with a few 4 letter words to type each or huge "tanks" with massive words you want to use a different strategy.\n\nThe puzzles and dungeons, while kind of basic compared to games like Zelda, are varied, fun, and gorgeous. I've beaten 6/8 of the dungeons and there were plenty new themes and mechanics that got thrown at me so I was never bored.\n\nSo yeah, highly recommended.","May 22","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It doesn't hold your hand to teach you how to type, just gives you insentive to learn muscle memory instead of watching the keyboard. Playing for five hours has already made me realize how well I actually do know my way arround a keyboard.","November 1, 2015","true","9.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This game is a gorgeous work of art - the isometric-view world looks like hand-crafted origami, and you guide a dreaming girl through it on her quick, brown fox.  (Yes.  That old gag.)\n\nThe narrative is a heavy-handed metaphor for a woman trying to convey how much inner strength is required to simply navigate the real world.  Each distinct and vibrant area you navigate your fox-riding author-avatar through represents the (traumatic) memory of phases of her life, whose mercifully-vague resolutions bring empowerment and... Whatever. You can easily ignore the breathless gushing of bad poetry and author catharsis to focus on the mechanics of typing to solve puzzles and kill insects.\n\nThe story might be one developer's alternative to expensive therapy, but we got a fantastic game out of it.  Different types of obstacle require different types of unlocked 'powers', allowing for that metroid style back-tracking fun.  Chaining together quick combos increases your exp generation, which affords you more upgrades to your typing power abilities and provides incentive to push forward swiftly, thoroughly typing at anything that moves.\n\nI strongly recommend this game for typing fans.  It's novel, gorgeous, and has an incredibly solid variety of tricks to spice up the otherwise simple experience of typing as fast as you can.","April 8","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not really sure how to describe just how much i love it. The story is just great. At this point its having small sound issues but i'm sure they'll be fixed very soon so i'm definitely not going to downgrade it on that.\n\nPros\n-Great story\n-Almost flawless controls\n-Beautiful Art\n-Decent progression if a little bit fast\n-GREAT music. LOVE IT\n-The voice actor. Most calming voice ever. This game is super relaxing until you get a monster with pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis over their head in which case its time to have a heartattack.\n-Seriously i love this game all of the cons are so minor i dont even really care about them. I just am putting them there for referance.\n-The music. Seriously. The music.\n-The ending threw me for a loop. No spoilers but not only was i shocked but i was very pleased with it. It wrapped up the game nicely.\n\n\nCons\n-For someone like me who types approximately 100 WPM it was pretty easy and a fairly fast game\n-Sometimes the game will decide to kill off an enemy that had the same word as the enemy i actually wanted to attack. I dont really think that's fixable though so adjust strategy accordingly\n-I felt like i was gaining experience too fast\n-Sometimes it would decide i was typing a different word than i was and ding me for a mistake. making it very difficult to get one of the achievements.\n-I think the rating on WPM may be a bit off. Not only have i taken frequent typing tests but my job required a minimum 80 WPM which i passed with 115 at the time about 2 months ago. This game however says i'm typing 35 WPM. So thats a little off but whatever.\n-As of right now my sound issues have stopped but i did have an issue with my sound working. If this happens to any one else try moving the volume bars in the options. That's what fixed it for me. They also may have patched it by now though.\n\n\nAll in all the cons are so minor that i don't really care about much on them. Its mostly just small things that could easily be patched later and didn't really effect my enjoyment of the game. If i had to score it I'd have to say it was a 4/5 if only just because i wish it was longer and the experience progression was a bit slower. I was max level before i ever entered the last dungeon. That being said i did EVERYTHING on the map before entering it so that may have something to do with it.","March 31","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

A good deal of effort has been put into both the mechanics and asthetics and it really does show. It seems fairly calm at first and you can quite easily type away to kill off enemies coming towards you but be warned, when you hit "boss" arenas you'll be wishing you took a touch-typing course because you'll soon be bashing away at your keyboard so fast you'll see your own hands become but a blur!\n\nI managed to complete the Early Access in one livestream playthough (approx. 1hr40mins) and I know a lot more content and story is coming and I honestly cannot wait!\n\nWhen I did finish, despite the manic typing I felt so relaxed I couldn't play anything else afterward, I just sat down and chilled out, no game has made me do that, I tip my hat to you Fishing Cactus.\n\nI absolutely reccomend you support this games' development, at £6.99 it's a steal for the amount of work that has gone into it already!\n\n4/5 - Needs a voice narrator, and I know this is something being looked into so expect this to turn into a 5/5 later on!","November 8, 2015","true","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Movement is done with the keys, but not the standard WASD movement.  It makes you keep your hands in the typing position.

I didn't realize how sloppy some of my typing was until some of the bigger boss battles (I'm looking at you, letter P).\n\nIt's quickly becoming my favorite current game, which I find surprising.  My one complaint is that I don't see a way to have a second game saved.  I'd love to have someone else in the family play it also.","April 6","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some minor gameplay issues, mostly to do with knocking enemies so far back that their target words disappear, but on the whole the strategic facets of combat and the absolutely absurd vocabulary more than make up for them. If you're looking for a typing game that aspires to be more than simply 'type the words on the screen,' this is it. I heartily recommend Epistory for the elemental combat mechanics, and for trying to reinvent a genre that never really tried to be more than pressing buttons.\n\nThe only real negative is the story - what little there is of it. The plot is lazy and angsty, mostly boiling down to 'Oh no, I'm so lost and alone,' and the writer has definitely attended the Academy of Vague. Most every line suggests that the character is trying to do something, but the continual lack of coherent progress kills the sense of mystery, and after a half hour or so I found myself just wanting our hero to be quiet and let me play. Alone, got it. Lost, got it. Feeling an urge to  reach XYZ for no reason, got it. The ending is disappointing and offers little real resolution; unfortunately that puts it entirely on par with what you're offered on your way through the game. Still, typing, right?","April 6","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It features some excellent narration that really adds to the overall experience. It also features an absolutely gorgeous paper art style, excelent voice work and very fun typing based gameplay.\n\nIt's an excellent tool for those looking to improve their typing skills but it also makes for a great game as well.  I managed to beat the game in 5 hours myself so don't mind that I only have 6 hours play time as of writing this review. (I'm used to typing everyday so I breezed through the entire game without much of a probllem)\n\nDefinitey a game worthy of checking out though, even if you aren't a fan of word/typing games, the game is worth playing just for the narration, art style and gameplay.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read our summary and full review folks, happy gaming!\n\n-Shaun Meyers out!\n\nOur Gameplay Video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T8OGt210CQ","April 10","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm a gamer that loves art and story in a game. I have always viewed Video Games as an emerging art form. (Seriously, all games are art. It's just a matter of how far you push the artistic form in one direction or another.) The oragami art style was an immediate draw for me as was the storytelling of the narator (anyone who doesn't catch the Bastion nod should be ashamed.) But what really hooked me was the typing mechanic. I'm a writer and having a game like this, typing the words to push the story forward, is almost like asking me to edit the piece a little, add in my flair.

Which is AWESOME. I am very much a fan of typing games, having put many hours into games like Typing of the Dead (the original Dreamcast version and TotD: Overkill on Steam) or the online competitive typing game TypeRacer; Epistory is one of the best in the genre.\n\nBesides just attacking enemies by typing the words above them, you also collect four elemental powers through the game that you switch between by just literally typing out the word - "fire" "ice" "spark" or "wind". Each elemental power has different effects on enemies (freezing them, blowing them back, etc.) and some enemies can only be defeated by certain elements, so you sometimes have to switch quickly. It adds a really nice extra layer of strategy and multitasking to an already fun concept.\n\nThe game scales up fairly well with typing speed - there are 3 difficulty levels (I played on the hardest difficulty). For normal typing I average around 120 WPM, and while it was never particularly difficult to beat the levels, it was challenging enough to be fun. There's not really any penalty for typos, it just discards them rather than making you backspace.\n\nOne of the most fun modes (especially if you're a fast touch typist) is the endless "Arena" mode where you try to get a high score with progressively harder enemies. It eventually gets to the point where your hands are flying over the keys in a frantic attempt to keep the enemy hordes at bay, and it definitely gets exciting. This mode even includes online leaderboards, which is a nice touch.\n\nIf you enjoy typing games, or you're trying to improve your touch typing skills, learn a new keyboard layout, or you just want something to test out your shiny new clickity clacky mechanical keyboard on, this game scratches an itch that few other games do.

Personally I had heaps of fun learning to touch type and I’d even try and find games that encouraged touch typing. Then I found Typing of the Dead. But sadly that was ages ago. But thankfully, after so many years my prayers have been answered with Epistory Typing Chronicles! Check out our Epistory Typing Chronicles gameplay and review video on YouTube below!\n\nGameReviewsAU Gameplay and Review Video[gamereviewsau.com]\n\nA Quick Gist\nSet in a fantasy world filled with monsters, magic and a giant fox, Epistory: Typing Chronicles takes you on a mysterious journey through a world that literally lays itself out before you.\n\nExplore dungeons, solve puzzles and take on masses of monsters that require you type words in order to defeat them. Epistory is not for the faint hearted and will certainly put your typing skills to the test. There are heaps of areas to explore, treasure chests to find and puzzles to solve.\n\nManipulate certain elements with your typing, such as fire, ice, lightning or wind. Each element provides you with advantages to sort out your foes. For example, when activating ice, your enemies will stop in their tracks when you hit them with a word. Fire will burn the next word to appear so you don’t have to type it, and so on.\n\nWhether you’re a two-finger typist or a profesh touch typist, there’s room to accommodate your play style with the differing levels of difficulty.\n\nEpistory: Typing Chronicles is simply incredible and such a breath of fresh air. I haven’t played a game this unique for a very long time and I thank the team at Fishing Cactus for bringing us such a magnificent game.

The words are also just random and not sentences so you could just mash the keys in the right area to success. It also repeats the same words a lot.\n\nIt has some kind of obscure analogous story about life or sickness or love or growing up or something but I didn't find it engaging. The animation is crisp and well done but felt repetitive and overused by the end.\n\nFairly short at about 4 hours worth of gameplay and not very challenging if you're reasonably proficient at typing. I died only twice for a whole play-though and never really felt threatened or under pressure.  It has some simple puzzles and some minimal "questing" but it's mostly a hack and slash but with a typing combat dynamic.\n\nFeel is pretty polished with only a few minor bugs but the lack of some basic features like movement-key remapping makes it still feel a bit beta-ish.\n\nI'd like to see some pvp content or some RPG aspects like items or stats; larger/harder/longer battles/enemies would also be a welcome addition.","April 1","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The narrative seems like it was written by a special snowflake reflecting on her life and trying to tell the tale of growing up and the stresses of childhood vs those of adulthood through not subtle enough metaphor. The subject matter seems kid friendly at first, which makes me think this might be a good tool for teaching a daughter how to type, but by the time I'd want a child to start tackling topics like heart break and social pressure, I'd hope I'd have already taught her qwerty typing. As cautionary advice from someone who's been there, it falls flat again. The story reads like it was written by a young woman (mid to late 20s) fresh out of a tumultous time in her life (college and a couple relationships) with words of wisdom and reassurance for the younger people behind her. When the author gets a little older, she'll look back on the age she is now and realize she didn't know anything yet.\n\nAs an adult who can type, It's not terribly useful as a keyboarding instructional tool. There doesn't seem to be any way to up the difficulty to a set number of wpm and I'm not sure how well that'd work anyway. The game is entertaining enough, but the challenge portions get frustrating when 1 letter enemies come flying in and break up your flow. If I'm spelling vexation for instance, and a little thing attacks that requires me to type an x, often the game will think I misspelt vexation or it won't count it towards the word I was typing (making the correct solution to type vexxation). In any event, it is rather vexing.\n\nI am intrigued by the language option. Will there be updates to allow me type in Spanish? That could be interesting. Hearing the dialogue in a language I don't speak would be nice too, only way it'd be new or original.\n\nVisually, the game is appealing, if simplistic. The puzzles are clearly influenced by and seem like a simpler version of Legend of Zelda puzzles. The camera style is reminiscent of Bastion (a good thing). The music (where present) is well suited to the gameplay, though a bit more on the overworld map wouldn't have gone amiss.\n\nOverall, it gets a recommendation, but only just, and only because the technical aspects of the game are pulled off mostly with some style and competently enough even in the rough spots. It's games like this that make me long for a third, neutral rating option. Sort of a wavy hand icon, as if to say "meh."\n\nIf you're looking for top down zelda esque game with strong narration and real life overtones, play Bastion. If you want a keyboarding program disguised as a game, Typing of the Dead is still a better buy for sheer customization options.\n\nIf you're trying to teach a youngster to type with a game, slap yourself. Then see if you can find an MSDOS copy of Reader Rabbit. Sure it's old, but you should be teaching a child to type at an age where they can't appreciate the difference between a 7 core souped up PC or a floppy disk IBM anyway, and besides, it's a better teaching tool.\n\nIf you want a more laid back, zombie-less keyboarding game with modern, but indie touched graphics and overtones of "childhood flowing into adult problems" vibe going for it, I guess this is your game.\n\nAll 8 of you young ladies in the feminist / early education / computer club at your local community college will love it.","April 4","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am really glad I picked it up - fun story and the art design was great.\n\nTook me a little over 6 hrs to make it through (almost collecting everything) and enjoyed all of it.\n\nWish I had games like this when I was learing to type, but having said that there were a few abrubt difficulty spikes due to the one hit death.","May 17","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork has really grown on me, I love the geometric feel it has to it! Two chapters in and the game only seems to get tougher, which is great (I love a challenging game). Definitely tests how well the player can handle a keyboard, so if you're a slow typist, be prepared to struggle...","May 26","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Art, storytelling, puzzles and intense typing. It totally sucked me in! I coincidentally noticed this game the day before it released and I just knew I needed it, I bought it, and it exceeded my expectations. Do you like typing??? Because this game wants you to type pretty fast.\n\nPros:\n-World is very nice to look at, all of the zones are beautiful. It looks like origami/paper mache and it's really cool lookin'. You discover more and more of the world as you progress.\n-Controls work like a charm.\n-Continuous storytelling, you figure out more about your character's psyche as you progress\n-There are 4 kinds of spells (you acquire them through playing the story) and they are useful during battles (tactical spelling... awesome)\n-The battles are tacticaland SO MUCH FUN! You will be under pressure, but also euphoric! When I fail, I'm still happy because I get to start over and it's THAT MUCH FUN!\n-Over 12 hrs of addictive gameplay\n-Rewarding (yeah dopamine woo!)\n\nCons:\n-NEEDS MORE LEVELS\n-but this game will be moddable soon\n-and that's awesome\n","May 13","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is quite fun to literally type your way through (you can even type through some of the menus). Aesthetics are fantastic, and the story is good.\n\nConcerns:\nThe difficulty scaling can get quite alarming, as you might be surprised with 15-letter monsters!\nWorld map is clunky to use--doesn't seem possible to un-center yourself when looking at the map","May 13","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a GEM for anyone that would like to test their tips to the keys.\nThere are some very long words and you have be quick witted  but also type fast. I love it!!!'\nI'm not the fastest typist but at least I can hold my own for now that is....The graphics are excellent and the music goes well with the story and environment...A GEM OF A GAME. I don't think you will be disappointed if you like or love to type. Its also a tool to learn how to type a bit faster, and efficient. It almost reminds me of Mavis Beckon teaches typing, if anyone remembers that program/game :)\n\nI've only played 1.3 hrs so far, and it can be intense.","June 4","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a nice subtlety to the combat as you have to switch to different elements and pick key targets to succeed. It isn\'t just about typing the words on the screen which is a refreshing change from game like Typing of the Dead. The art style is captivating and the score is very strong. The atmosphere the game creates really draws you in. It took me about eight hours to complete the game and I enjoyed every minute of the experience. The game has a similar feel to Bastion, which is one of my favorite games of all time.","June 1","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
