You play as Marie Umino, a deceased girl who must find who killed her 7 days earlier. There are several suspects that you can meet to try and find out who the true culprit is.\n\nThe story branches out in "routes", that lead to several ends : 4 "main" ends, one "true" end, and one "bad" end\n\nIn order to get the "true end" you need to finish the story at least 4 times, to get all the items needed. That means you have to re-read dialogues you've already read, which can get quite monotonous. At least you can use the "skip" function, although in the end, that makes the game very short.\n\nIt's not really hard to figure out what to do, as the choices you can make are fairly limited and rather simple (you can be "good" or "evil", basically), and the writing isn't stellar, though it kept me entertained.\n\nI wouldn't really recommend it, unless you're a diehard fan of visual novels or mystery novels, because there are far better visual novels out there (and with better art, too), and the price is quite high right now (luckily I got it in a bundle).\nBut for 2 or 3 euros, you might consider it...","January 30, 2015","false","2.8"," 46 of 67 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","46","67","0","4"

Also, I voluntarily will not speak of the game's details because it's not what I want to defend in this review.\nCafé 0 ~The Drowned Mermaid~ perhaps isn't the best visual novel ever made nor the prettiest.\nIt's probably one of the ugliest but, as a wise and just as ugly man once said, what matters is what's inside! And what's inside is okay! It offers an average and, somehow, a bit compelling story focused on characters interesting enough for you to keep on playing the game.\nI went through several states that I'd like to develop from before playing to reaching the true ending:\n\n1) The discovery: I was truly amused, mostly by the graphics (just like you I assume) and yet was curious about this setting (like you once again, explaining why you are currently reading this review).\n\n2) The purchase:  I ended up purchasing it due to my curiosity taking over my reasoning I guess (not that I regret it today), and felt this feeling ,which was a mixture of both amusement and a bit of nervousness, just like before you go on exploring the complete unknown of a safe experience.\n\n3) The playthrough: I played for a straight 4 hours (as I remember), at night alone in my house and went through a rollercoaster of feelings mainly composed of inquisitiveness and mockery at times which truly fulfilled those 4 hours I spent on the game. I was also really satisfied by the endings delivering something that can rarely be found in gaming experiences in my opinion.\n\n4) The post-experience: I went from making fun of the game, upon discovering the game, to making fun of the game and defending its qualities, because it deserves it. I even lost some credibility in some friends' mind but it doesn't matter because not only did I have a good time but I also became wiser as of judging one's book by its cover and therefore, by extension, learning to give a chance to everything and everyone.\n\nSome might point out the price of the game, perhaps a bit expensive for its content, and I can only agree but once it goes on sale, I truly hope that this review would have convinced you to give this game a chance. A chance it really deserves. Thank you.","April 24, 2015","true","0.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

I found the story to be fairly well written even though the character interactions themselves werent very well written at all. Strange dichotmy there, ay? Not sure what to say about that except that it exists. Good story, poor dialogue. The graphics themselves arent anything to write home about, at all. In fact, I would say they work against this game, as it's a graphic novel, and an important aspect of keeping you interested with a interactive novel is the graphics, or at least the artwork such as it is. That aspect of the game wasnt exactly a failure, but it really wasnt inspiring at all, and made the reading a bit more tedious than it should have been.\n\nThat said, this game is also super fast to play through, and after the first playthrough, you can skip through most of the dialogue in replays so as to see the various endings without having o read the exact same dialogue over and over and over (there are 7 endings by my count, btw).\n\nThe topic itself is all about how to cope with your own mortality, in a sense. The protagonist having amnesia adds a nice twist to the tale.\n\nAll told, I think this game shows a lot of promise from the developer(s), but it in and of itself just barely gets a thumbs up, and I would buy this game on sale or via a bundle (the latter is how I got it actually).\n\n5.5 out of 10.","February 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

The subject that's being brought up in this VN is a bit different. It's about dying and finding peace in the fact itself.\n\nThe story itself is quiet interesting from time to time, but if falls short on depth in my opinion. The conversations with the "important" characters are too shallow compared to other VN's of the same price. So, I would have expected more on that part.\nThe graphics are a bit different also. I can't say they're good, but they arent bad either.\n\nGameplay, hmm, without trying to spoil anything, it's basically a good ending / bad ending thing. You make some choices and get some progression "stat" throughout the game so you're able to see how you're doing. That's the part I liked a lot, because it's done in a different way than just displaying some numbers or bars.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like at all is that at the beginning you've got to enter a name. But, you're not told that you're supposed to enter a female name. So, if you enter a male name it feels like you're some kind of shemale. A bit weird..\n\nAnother negative thing about this VN is the fact that it falls short on length. It doesn't take that long to complete a path and the fact that there're several endings doesn't make it any better. It feels like a cheap way by the developer to stretch the game time.\n\nSo to put it all in a list:\n\nPros:\n-Interesting/different subject.\n-Interesting story.\n-Nice music.\n\nCons:\n-Too short.\n-Repeating dialogs.\n-Lack of information when entering a name.\n-The different endings feel forced.\n-Towards the end of the story it feels like a rushed product.\n\nAs you can see there're more negative things than positive aspects about Cafe 0. The thing is that I don't regret buying this Visual Novel, but I don't recommend it to people who're looking for a more fleshed out product.

The main character is unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, not voiced. CAFE 0 is listed as mystery/horror, though I would personally not call it a horror VN, as it lacks the tension and fear, being staples of the genre; the mystery is definitely there, though. The gist of the plot is that the main character has died and ends up at a mysterious café. Here, she is given the chance to relive the 7 last days of her life to prepare for what lies ahead. She has no memories left and is unsure of what to do with her “second life”. It is up to you to decide how she spends this time. There are 3 prominent characters, each representing 1 path, one being the true path, requiring items obtained at the end of the other 4. Then there is also a “bad” ending if you choose not to follow a path. There are 6 endings in total, and I would recommend going for all of them, as understanding the full story and changing your opinions on things and characters with each path is a pleasant experience. If you like the idea of going through it all, CAFE 0 is a solid purchase with a satisfying conclusion and good development.\n\nThe Bad\nThe only bad thing that really comes to mind is that the voice-overs are DLC. They do add to the experience, in my opinion, and it would be easier to recommend the game if they were in the full game without the extra price tag.\n\nThe “So-so”\nThe editing could be better. It is not terrible, and does not take away from the experience, but the English used in places could have used some more work, as it sounds unnatural and sometimes weird. I have seen mixed opions on the art, but I, personally, think it looks good enough and, as I am focused on the plot, I have no reason to point it out as a definite negative.\n\nThe Good\nThe plot, essentially. The concept of CAFE 0 is intriguing to me, and the game delivers the story in a good way. Each of the 4 paths, leading to the true path, gives you a different point of view and different ideas of how the characters are and how they are related to the main character before she died. Until the true path, I had mixed opinions and views on each of the 3 most prominent characters, which made each path interesting to play through, as I wanted to see how they would change with each one. The true ending then provides the last pieces and puts the puzzle together, leaving you with a satisfying conclusion to an interesting mystery plot. It kept me hooked, which is what a good book, or in this case, a good VN, is supposed to do. I also felt that I could relate to the main character on the “evil” paths, but that might be saying more about me than the game.\n\nThe Verdict\nOverall, CAFE 0 ~The Drowned Mermaid~ is a solid, intriguing mystery VN worth purchasing. The only thing I would consider is the price. As this is a very short VN, the full price is a bit high, but on a sale, I definitely recommend getting it if you are looking for a good mystery VN.","April 16","true","5.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

For the majority of my playtime, I absolutely loathed this game; the characters, the dialogue--all amounted to some of the most infuriatingly childish attempts at romance and edginess in a game with some very straightforward choices that lead to almost the exact same thing. I almost gave up, writing it off as another game more catering to tweens and their fledging libidos, and I am so glad I didn't.\n\nYou see, this is an otome visual novel; basically, this is meant for girls, and in just about every way, The Drowned Mermaid is that. At a lot of points especially I was put off by the main character and the choices offered, and all of the endings at first seemed extremely shallow, going the "I love you forever~~" route or the "burn for all eternity" route (which were always far more interesting). However, without giving too much away, this shallow presentation to some extremely shallow characters is actually a partial ruse for something much more intricate and sinister. While this does not discount the dialogue as being amateurish, somehow it adds to the intrigue this game builds up. With each ending, you get closer to the true one, and believe me when I say it won't take you long.\nBy the end of my little journey, a game I thought I would hate for its pandering had me wrapped around its little finger as I tried to piece together what actually happened, and once the real truth comes out? You will find even the most innocent and cringe-worthy romantic endings will carry a very different weight by the time you see the true ending.\n\nCafe 0 is a unique enough concept that manages to surpass its own failings, even though as a Visual Novel it leaves something to be desired. However, if you really take a moment to see this fairly short game through, you will be surprised as to how wonderfully put together this story is. For the price and for the length, I can say without a doubt that this little gem in the rough is more than worth your time; just don't be afraid to use the skip button after your first time through.\n\nEdit: A good two hours were not recorded on this log because of my finicky internet, so what you see there is only about half my playtime, just to give you an estimate on how long it took me to see everything.","May 8, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

She tries to uncover the reasons behind her death, since she has no memories of who is she or what happened.\n\nThe player must complete four endings in order to be able to get the true ending, that explains what really happened with Marin. The Novel mechanic is kind of strange. I don't want to spoil your playthrough, so I will not give anymore detail. The graphics are really above average, the BGM is repetitive and the plot in general is a bit poor.\n\nEven though the game is really short and a bit repetitive (I took like 3 hours to get all endings and achievements), it's true ending can be a little unexpected and make us think twice before trust into someone else.

In the end you discover that this is about pre-death hallucinations of a girl who tends to perceive people better or worse than they actually are, and it leaves rather indifferent, maybe slightly unpleasant aftertaste.

I got it free from a giveaway, so I didn't have to pay money for this or the Japenese voice acting DLC. I honestly only bothered playing it to unlock the steam trading cards.\n\nIt should take about 2-3 hours to unlock every achievement in the game.

When she returns home, she finds the waiter from the cafe, Sui, in her home and he tells her that she only has 7 days to live, and that she must prepare her heart for the afterlife.\n\nThe story has a total of six endings: two good endings, two evil endings, a bad ending, and a true ending.\n\nYou get the good and evil endings by talking exclusively to Shou and Tooru (getting a good ending if you say nice things, and an evil ending if you say mean things. Both characters have a good and evil ending associated with them). After each ending, your character recieves an item that she holds onto in the every playthrough onwards.

You take on the role of Marin Umino who has just died and finds herself in an unusual-looking cafe.

To understand the true story, it's necessary to play through most of the good and bad paths to get the necessary items needed for it.

But then I decided to get all the achievements and see if anything would change through the story.\n\nAnd boy, things got f*cking WILD.\n\nI wasn’t expecting AT ALL the true ending. Or the other bad endings. I thought it was going to be a cliché romantic VN, but I was wrong… and I’m glad because of it. Yes, the character art isn’t the best, especially the lack of facial expressions… But to be really honest, I think that the originality of the story shines through all of this. It’s a short VN, there are a few “ok what’s going on” moments… But it was a really interesting concept. I love mystery/horror visual novels, so this one just made my day. The Japanese voice acting was okay, nothing special. I guess that the only VA I liked the most was Sui’s. And speaking of him, I think it would be awesome to see this character again, in another story. The whole Cafe 0 concept is quite nice, even if there’s a few plot holes.\n\n7/10.

K.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973230221/","3588 products in account","This visuell novel has a cruel story and it start with a puzzle. You need to end first 4 endings to get the puzzle pieces to get the real end and to light the truth. You see 2 good endings and 3 bad endings all a part of hope or of trueness, but which one is one? So you need to play 5 story-lines, most time its only feels like much filling but that is normal in every game, movie or book but some parts like the mirror scene are boring and get on the 2nd walk skiped with fast forward option because no big changes most time. But the end was really not bad, not really surprising because some details in the walks before like a smile or other stuff but i find its one of the better visual novel stories i played (even if i not play very much).\n\nGraphics are not good and not bad. Most people could do it better or this standard so i give 7 of 10 points to it. Sure it could be better but its not so important. Sound is okay not nerving and not be making the game much better 6,5 points here and the story gets on the way trough the game 7 points (ignore the boring mirror parts and mornings, rest is a bit to short) but the end get 9,5 of 10 points for me, maybe i overdo it, but without the little signs before it would be really astonish but not so believable so it was a hard way for the developer to make it not to much and not to less and i find it hit it very well and a good ending is for me the most important point of a game like Zelda Majoras Mask or Metroid Prime 1-3 get the best/ full ending.\n\nSo for visual novel genre fans this game should be good, for others only if they want a story like a comic/ manga but dont need action or something and only if you hold till the end of all walks for the rest of the gamers this game should be the right choice, the storyline is not everyones (only SPOILER: If you love betray tales it could be something you like). I give this game for this well tought narrative 82%, but if you dont like VS, let your hands of it, if you dont know it, watch trailer and play maybe first some free VN. I would prefer a discount of 50 better 66-75 % or more to pay not to much, but here work FEW developers hopefully with a low bugdet many hours, dont forget how much work and hard a game development is. Thank you for reading and enjoy your time.","January 1","true","2.7"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","13","26","0","0"

We play as a girl, that find herself in weird, under water place, called Cafe 0. We meet equally weird blue-haired waiter, drink glass of water and then... We're back in reality and it turns out that we've almost drowned in pool, during swimming competition. The thing is... We don't have any memories. We don't know who we are and who are people around us. We can't even see our reflection in the mirror. If that wasn't bad enough, blue-haired waiter shows up again and inform us, that we will die after seven days and that we have to prepare ourselves to our journey into the afterlife.\n\nSince then our task is to speak with of the three other main characters - our, supposedly, best friend Amy, our ex boyfriend and school doctor, who is weirdly close to us. Endings depends on who will we choose as our company and what kind of answers we will give them. I think there's a six endings total. Of course all of those characters are clearly hiding something.\n\nGood thing about this game is that it does not give us schematic characters and non of the classic love story. It's a little deeper and a little darker (though not deep and dark enough, when you consider it's potential). Bad thing? It's short. Really short. And not realistic the slightest. Hey, I get it, it's a game, but if someone finds out that they have only seven days before they die, they won't just limit themselves to one short talk with only one important person during a day. And protagonist doesn't have her memories. She should be focused on getting as much information as possible. Protagonist's reactions to certain situations also aren't very realistic - though, sadly, it's a plague of visual novels, that take many serious or shocking revelations with merely a shrug. Protagonist of this game, for example, does not protest the slightest about the fact that she is supposed to day in the seven days. In theory, it's kind of explained by her "feeling" that it may happened, but it actually make it all less believable, not more. It's worth adding, that all of the endings are linked to each other in some way - you need to go through them all to have the full picture before you. After each ending you get a special item, that you get to keep during your next play - it almost creates an illusion that we're in the never ending cycle and that was definitely a good part.\n\nThe biggest flaw of this game is the fact that it doesn't truly exploit this intriguing premise. Instead of giving us something really deep, a picture, that we, as the player, will reveal slowly by getting each ending and this way we will solve our own murder, it gives us almost a few unfortunate coincidences, that ultimately doesn't feel relevant or satisfying.\n\nFor example, it's really hard to understand why respected doctor would be happy because of protagonist death. It wouldn't get him out of trouble. Quite contrary, someone would sooner or later discover how close they were and he would probably be suspected of murdering her.\n\nIn general... If you'll find this game for a very low price (in a bundle or during sale) and you are fan of visual novels, give it a try. Otherwise, you don't lose anything.","July 26, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I didn't expect some plot points and they were actually nicely put together. I really liked the heroine, who was pretty assertive... especially in the true ending. Ahaha.\nThe only thing that i'm not positive about is how rushed the plot felt, but i guess there's no helping that since the game takes place in such a short time.\nI liked voice acting and art. Many people complain about art in roseverte games, but i honestly don't mind?

If you getting sick of Lovely dovey kind of otome game, this is a good one. It's like a brick of reality just hit you in the face.\n\nI played with DLC with voice one, honestly I like them. But too bad they mention the name of the character. They should have done like Amnesia, subtitude the name with something else so it does sound like it intereact with you. But even whithout it, i think you will still enjoy it, since some people dont understand then and just skip before even the character finish talking.\n\nAnd when clicking of choice, they give the sign of what kind of ending we going to end up with is good. The white butterfly is good, while the black butterfly is bad ending. At least I know that which choice is the right one. This is good for the beginners.\n\nThe plot is nice. It's a short honestly. To feel it worth buying is when you get all of the ending, like until you get the true ending. It make sense and can feel how scary is reality.

It's a little frustrating because it's supposed to be a "choices" game, but they give you very little room to make any dynamic choices. Once you pick a path, you cannot diverge from the path in any way, shape, or form or you get the bad ending. lol If you go to see Guy A, you must go to see him every single day. If you don't? Bad ending.\n\nDespite that, the overall concept is very interesting. No matter what, you play through the exact same story. What changes is your perception of the story. I appreciated that. Instead of changing events, you just change how you feel about said events.\n\nIf you do get the game, I highly recommend getting all of the endings and seeing the final "true ending".

This café, however, is not your regular run-of-the-mill café: it lets you re-experience the last 7 days of your life.\n\nAs one comes to understand pretty quickly, our MC is a young woman who just died, and whose last 7 days will be our case of study. How did she die? Why did she die so young?\n\nWhat you see now is the past --- the last seven days before one's death.\nRight from the get go, this visual novel does a good job of setting up the mystery scene and making ourselves ask the right questions.\n\n...Maybe it did too well of a job compared to the rest of the VN, though. The prologue set my expectations a bit high, so the development, which can arguably be described as a pretty cheap dating sim, disappointed me greatly.\n\nThe true ending is decent enough. Without saying too much, it's a grim ending demonstrating where naive trust can lead, how relationships can affect your entourage and the twisted motivations of some people. It does suffer from the short length of the VN though (less than 3 hours), which greatly cuts and rushes character development and cheapens the true ending a bit by making its execution a little bit cliché.\n\nOverall, a good setting that could have offered much more if the execution was more fleshed out. The art could be better, but it does its job well enough to be experienceable in my opinion. 6/10, would half-heartedly recommend on sale or in a cheap bundle.","March 26","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't go into it expecting a "reverse harem" where you experience wonderful, heady romance with each of the guys, and you should do fine.\n\n---\n\nOverall Impression: Because of the fact that it's an early work, the graphics aren't all that amazing and the writing can be a little weak in some areas... That said, after completing the story, I really enjoyed it and hope more people give it a chance.\n\nContent: There are no visuals or text that are above about maybe PG, or at most, PG-13 levels. If you don't mind mild spoilers, I will say that the relationship between the MC and the Doctor does appear to be inappropriate, but there's nothing that a mature child would feel guilty for reading. That doesn't mean that it doesn't get disturbing. It is a mystery surrounding a death, after all.\n\nTranslation: There are occassionally parts that seem a little awkward, but there isn't anything that's really confusing (that's not meant to be confusing, that is).\n\nEditing: I didn't notice anything that needed corrections!\n\nArt: As you can see, it's not super flashy. It doesn't need to be, though. It's not the sort of game that "needs" flashy art and some of the CGs are actually really nice.\n\nCharacter Design: It does its job! This isn't the sort of game that really demands anything that "stands out" in that sense. Having said that, once having completed the game, I came to appreciate the way the Heroine's various looks worked.\n\nStory: It was a heck of a lot more twisted than I expected it to be. In a way, it was a lot more satisfying than I anticipated.\n\nI find myself not really wanting to say much here, because I feel as if every stage of my response to the game's story and the characters in it helped me appreciate it as a whole. I will say that I didn't enjoy it at first, but perservered simply because it was short. The more routes I completed and the more I understood the story, and the more interested I became in it. By the end, while I don't see myself returning to the game to read it again anytime soon (someday, I'm sure), I absolutely can recommend it if it's a type of story you'd be interested in.\n\nThe Heroine: I really disliked her at first. It took several play-throughs for me to develop some sympathy for her, but the more I played, the less I disliked her. The more I knew about her situation, the more I could understand how she came to be the way she is. As such, if you want a character who has a real personality - she certainly does!\n\nIn closing... Give it a go. I was able to 100% the game in only a couple of hours (even having left it open on the title screen for a bit to grab a snack, only to come back to Sui, the blue-haired boy, chewing me out for wasting his time). I don't think The Drowned Mermaid is what you're probably expecting. I hope you try it and agree with me that it's actually better.

I actually played the voiceless version ages ago, and recently got the deluxe voiced version as a part of an amazingly cheap bundle (which is still ongoing on indiegala.com if you guys are interested, 3.99 for ALL 7 games by this developer!!!).\n\nFirst lets discuss the game mechanics without giving away any spoilers. You are Marin Yumino (default name, can be changed but I keep it because people pronounce her name if I do), who has been given the chance to redo the last 7 days of her life to get closure on her death.\nThere is the added challenge of the heroine not remembering anything about her life, and there are 3 main characters you can interact with while trying to figure out the details of the life you had led until now.\nThe 2 men are potential "romantic interests", and each of them have 2 possible endings-one where you pick all the goodie-to-shoes choices and use this limited time to fall in love, and the other where you pick all the interrogating/suspicious choices and try to figure out if they had anything to do with your death. Like this you play 4 times (sounds tedious, but each route is pretty short so it doesn't take even half an hour to finish one), every end will give you a plot item, and then you play the game for the 5th time you take those items to the 3rd character, your female friend, and manage to figure everything out and get the "true end".\nTo be honest I can't review the story itself without giving too much away since the storyline is mysterious and interesting but short. I felt like the main concept of this game is how people can become twisted when they let their desires control them. There was a few things about the characters' motivations that confused me, but in general everything started to make sense once I started playing the true route and although the end was not 'happy', my character got to do what I wanted to and that's what is important to me.\n\nSo should you play it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a visual novel with a short but intriguing story that involves psychological analysis of the dark side of human nature, then HELL YEAH get it on sale right now! But if you either don't like visual novels in general or want a happy and fluffy romance, this is not the game for you.\n\nThe one thing I want to say to the developer- THE LAST MINUTE OF THE TRUE END WAS EPIC  10/10 CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE CAFE 0!\n\nP.S. I want to punch Sui /^/^\n","January 1","true","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The true (or should that be truth) ending is brutal. There is no happy ending. There is no off into the sunset with your true love. No way to undo the end, which given the entire nature of the game, you'd have thought there would be. But no...it's you, repeating the 7 days until you work out the truth. Which is grim.\n\nIf you like VN, go ahead. If you want a happy ending, avoid.\n\nAlso some of the scariest CG screens I've ever seen.","May 28","false","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I got this game as part of a bundle, and such I don't think it's worth paying extra for the Japanese voice. The game could have worked even without it, honestly.\n\nThe story is divided into six endings, of which for most of them you have to fill in the pieces of the puzzle accordingly to get the two main good endings or the two main bad endings. Where the good endings are bittersweet and sentimental, the bad endings are full of hate - and I prefer the bad endings for that. It places thought onto what went on behind the scenes of the story.\n\nEverything comes to a head in the True Ending (I won't spoil it, but it's by far the best ending).\n\nThe artwork isn't the best at some times, but there are some areas which I enjoyed the artwork (especially for the True Ending).\n\nI've had an issue with achievements, where I cannot gain them, and the same 72 files on Steam fail to validate. However, it doesn't put me off from enjoying the game.\n\nIf you find it cheap or in a bundle, buy it. It kills a couple of hours.","August 31, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's a mystery visual novel with some horror touches. I can't really write more about it without spoilers, so...\n\nSpoilers Ahead\nOk, so I leant towards Not Recommend because overall this game is depressing as ♥♥♥♥. Aside of the helpless heroine every single character is an abusive a$$hole, who coerce, injure and eventually try to kill her. There's also teacher-student sexual abuse and blackmail. Lovely. Even the god-character, Sui, is an a$$hole, though at least he's a bit less damaging than the rest of the cast.\n\nYou can follow various decision routes: on the 'Good' one you end up as a very trusting person full of love towards others, on the 'Evil' one you end up as a distrustful and cold person, suspecting the people around you used and killed you. Then you can unlock the 'True' route, and guess what? Your suspicious version was right all along...\n\nOverall I'm not sure of what to take away from this game. I mean, I guess it's possible that the creators just wanted to tell a story without further meaning, but I miss some kind of message or conclusion from it. The message would be what? Your best friend hates you and is plotting to kill you, the guy you grew up with as siblings is secretly lusting over you and pulls you into a relationship with wide age and power difference, only so when he gets bored of you he can pass you over to the popularity-chasing a$$hole who blackmailed him...? As I said, quite depressing.\n\nTechnical quality-wise the graphics are okay..ish, seen much better to be honest, and some of the CG screens have weird anatomy.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=564658789\nThe sound design is okay, the voiceover is a nice addition, it sounds professional.\nThe UI could be a bit better designed - that sizeable block of menu options permanently placed on the screen is kinda pointless and unnecessary. Those options could have gone in the top menu with the others.\nThe text sometimes has weird phrasings, it feels like the writers are not fluid in English.\n\nHonestly the most enjoyable part of the game is the Extra, after all the endings are unlocked. Sui does some fourth wall breaking. But even then there are some dialogue options to ask about the more confusing aspects of the plot (albeit we don't get answers) -  I guess the developers felt it too that there were some gaps in the plot.\n\nI'll finish the review with... this...\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=564659518","November 28, 2015","false","4.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I just got tired of playing it.\n\nThis was a very interesting Visual Novel. It was able to make me really feel the story and weird at the same time.\n\nOnly problem is that the repetition of a story to get new endings was not for me. Yeah it was a little different each time but I just got tired of it.\n\nIf you like to repeat a short game to get new endings, this game is for you.\nIf not, please move on.\n\nAlso, at the time of this review, the price was $5.99 (40% off of $9.99) so it was a little procey as well.","November 25, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Well my first impression was wow, I'm not a guy, and then huh the story is straightoforward (or so it seemed). The first story was finished quite fast. You get 7 days and there is only about one or two choices that you can make per day, and that can be bad if you are used to many choices like in other games, but its not bad for this approach, it is just different. After I completed my one good ending, I decided to try the other paths, and yes, you can have bad endings. I decided a different approach because at this point I was not yet invested into the characters as in other games, and I must say that I was not disappointed. You can go chaotic evil and be rewarded by the game. Now the bad, the game can get repetitive very quickly and you will find yourself skipping through some dialogues as you will have heard them before. The fisrt menu is no apparent that you are supposed to make a choice and on my first playthrough I ended up making a selection when I did not mean to. Overall though, I had a decent experience with the game and I do recoment that you play it. For the record I played the Deluxe (Voiced Version) and the sound sounds well. I hope this project continues to grow.","May 5","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
