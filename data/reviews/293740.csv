Instead of beating you over the head with a point that can't be avoided, it delivers bits and pieces to not tell just a story, but to provide deep themes about life, love, and loss. The keenly aware will pick up on the things that make up these themes, and what the final message appears to be, yet there's plenty of room for interpretation - In much the same way classic poetry does. I wish more games were like this.\n\nGameplay-wise, it takes elements of classic block sliding puzzles and crafting-based matching, dresses it up with beautiful art, and packages it in rougelike tropes. Success relies on thoughtfulness, planning, and situational adaptability. It's both casual and challenging. The better you get at the game, the more rewarding it becomes to finish each year with all the children saved and at a minimum cost to your energy levels.\n\nThere are lots of secrets, tactics and strategies, and surprises.","August 5, 2014","true","137.2"," 181 of 201 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","181","201","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/293740/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3061 products in account","Road Not Taken is a roguelike puzzle game about surviving life’s surprises. But life is so often content with stagnation and repetition, offering what seems the same grind over and over and over, soon only occasionally taunting with the glimmer of something new. But that’s just the way of things; everything new becomes old, in time. Eventually, new just begins to run out. RNT follows a similar cycle; in the beginning, discovering all these new things and how you can change and adapt them to your uses is exciting and intoxicating. But soon enough, the new is exhausted , and with it, the allure of the prospect of new discoveries waiting just behind each locked gate. RTN is profusely entertaining up until you realize this point has come, but even after then, its unique and challenging formula saves it for a time, despite other issues, both glaring and minute.\n\nRNT plays off its theme of “life’s little mysteries” remarkably well in its gameplay. As the town’s new ranger, you’re tasked in each of your years with rescuing the children lost to the woods during each winter’s storm. To deliver them safely, you’ll have to guide each to any of the waiting mothers, wherever they may be, using your limited amount of energy in carrying the odds and ends populating each level. The greatest joy had in this game also provides its greatest challenge; the discovering of new items and creatures that can both greatly hinder or assist you in your search. There’s a surprising amount of variety in the number of ways things can interact, with many even able to change into new forms entirely, given the proper combination. You’ll quickly begin filling your travel book with all manner of creatures and their respective “recipes”. Eventually, puzzles that seemed impossible in the beginning are soon found to have only been so due to your own ignorance of some combination relevant to the situation.\n\nBut here’s the rub, and it’s one that eventually hinders all games of this sort. After a while, it’s very noticeable which pieces the game favors, and which ones have yet to appear more than once, if even that. There’s a handful of items and creatures that are exceptionally common, changing in relation to your years. In my playthroughs, those handfuls have been identical. The aforementioned variety in items and enemies becomes less so when the same few common assets are used ad nauseam, which is a shame, given the inventiveness of some of the lesser used pieces.\n\nIn between winters, your time is spent in the town you call home. Here, you can take your hard earned coins, rice, berries, etc, and trade them for townsfolk’s friendship, a la the story of Rainbow Fish. In return, you may receive helpful recipes for your book, or even better, equip-able trinkets. Early earned trinkets’ perks are useful in smaller capacities, but the greater are earned through repeat visits. They, along with the tradeables found in the forest, make up the other half of the Roguelike formula, namely the part that you lose upon death. Make too many mistakes, resulting in zero energy or too few children saved, and all of these are lost. Given the time investment needed to get the better ones, I’ll admit to believing this a bit harsh, especially since death can often be the result of truly unfair elements brought on by the roguelike system, like unavoidable loss of children to enemies or rare, impassible gates due to poor default placement of pieces.\n\nA point of contention for me lies here as well, particularly in the store page’s embellishment of a winding, twisting narrative, unique to each journey. The only narrative comes in the townsfolk, who remain constant, personalities and dialogue alike. Even their preferences in tradeables remains identical between playthoughs. The only change is that of color scheme, and which one is most willing to marry you, which becomes readily apparent early on. Despite store page promises of offering the opportunity to lead a unique life each playthrough, the character with obvious affection for you will always yield trinkets and info for fewer tradeables. There’s no reason to invest in anyone else.\n\nRegardless of my issues with it (mostly with the not-so-random level randomization), RNT is tremendous fun, and it’s a unique challenge that I’m going to continue playing, if only to try and earn the remaining pages to my travel book. In retrospect, my biggest issues could easily be rectified with a few randomization patches, or better yet, a future DLC expansion. As it is, the journey slowly loses its luster more than several hours in, but it never loses its shine altogether. The combination of some amusingly humorous travel book entries, a charming art design and some legitimately unsettling sound work help to mask the budding feeling of familiarity on repeat journeys. I think what’s most disappointing is that despite the game’s want to emulate the unpredictability of life, it has instead exemplified how easily it can fall into routine and predictability. While the initial few hours and playthrough are wholly the most entertaining, a lackluster attempt at differentiating narrative and the occasional sense of déjà vu on later playthroughs only slightly diminish an otherwise fantastic puzzle-rogue.","August 6, 2014","true","11.9"," 87 of 102 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","87","102","0","3"

It is a good puzzle game with a storyline that is actually consistent throughout! The graphs are super cute, the music and sound effects are great, the character interactions are very nice too (and the characters looks vary on each career).\n\nYour choices have an effect on the outcome of the game: everything -from how many kids you decide to save to what gifts you give and what relationships you build with whom or what bonuses you decide to use- determines what pluses you´ll get and whether you´ll end up your career more or less successfully.\n\nAs I said, the game look is really cute, but one thing I really liked is that despite it´s design cuteness -or maybe because of it- it is still able to also give a slightly creepy and even acid atmosphere: The doctor, or the way the Mayor takes your choice of saving more or less kids could be good examples. Other surpirses I rather not reveal as to not spoil the fun, but let´s just say that experimentation and interaction has its rewards.\n\nAs for difficulty, the game instructions are fairly simple, so it is easy to get started. The gameplay itseld has a gradual increase of diffculty in its main story mode, plus it also has a timed version and a extra-difficult option too. It is worth mentioning again that inside a career, your performance on a year will affect the difficulty of the years to follow, if only because of the amount of energy you´ll have to deal with each level. So besides dealing with each level´s intrinsic difficulty you should have some strategy and consider future levels.\n\nTo me this is a very entertaining and well thought game. I don´t feel too guilty if I spend time playing it because not only do I have fun, I actually have the feeling I am using my brain. It can be re-played several times, which is a plus to me. If you like puzzles, charming design and eerie sense of humor try this one out.\n","January 1, 2015","true","68.5"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","33","34","0","0"

Some puzzles are hand-crafted, but the majority are procedurally generated.\n\nThe Good: The Art and Music are great! Wonderful Art Style and the music is a nice addition to the levels.\n\nThe Bad: Procedural generation is a double-edged sword. Yes, you're going to get rooms in which things are laid out in an easily-solvable manner, but you're also going to get rooms that are basically broken (or quickly made so by a bad move). For example, Bear Statues "stick" to nearby objects, so if you get an object in a corner behind a Bear Statue, you are pretty much out of luck. Good luck corraling six Deer or other animals (which move around on their own) to unlock a door. A single novice move can render entire areas of the map inaccessible.\n\nThe Ugly: The difficulty curve is brutal, and saps fun out of the game. Year 4 (of 15) seemed to be my Year of Death for a while, but with practice I've made it all the way to Year 8. Of course, Roguelikes have death, but after you die you should have some incentive to want to play again. In RNT, Death only occurs after several frustrating rounds of losing life/energy, and then when you are at your weakest, the Doom Spirits hunt you down and kill you. Where is the fun in that!?\n\nThe Save/Checkpoint system actively discourages you from using it - what is up with that?\n\nI know people will argue that the game is about hard choices and you aren't intended to save every single child in each individual year - but that makes me wonder about the narcissistic sociopaths who lack empathy for children freezing to death in the Forest.\n\nIn summary, my chief complaint is that the game is more frustrating than fun. There’s potential here, but in Road Not Taken’s current state, I cannot recommend it.","August 16, 2014","false","7.9"," 63 of 84 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","63","84","2","0"

It is a really well done puzzle-roguelike with a FANTASTIC core mechanic. It is one of those games that absolutely nails the concept of easy to learn, difficult to master. It also has a bleak yet hopeful atmosphere coursing through the entire thing, which I found very charming.\n\nWinter is slowly overtaking a small village. You play as a forest ranger tasked with recovering children lost in the woods. The core mechanic involves combining objects in the forest together to make new ones by picking them up and throwing them. You can also cary objects, but doing so depletes your ever dwindling energy reserves.\n\nThere is a staggering number of items and combinations, and it's a LOT of fun to expirament with all the different objects. Some combinations are beneficial, replentishing your energy, allowing you to manipulate the forest easier, and save the kids easier, but others are dangerous, and you should take care not to clumsly throw things around, creating hazardous items accidentally. However, many of the dangerous items can also be turned into bigger benefits if combined correctly. It strikes a  really great ballance between risk and reward.\n\nBeing a roguelike, it has a LOT of replay value, especially since you can forge relationships with a few of the towns folk. If they like you, they will tell you tips, secrets, and even give you items and accessories to make your job easier, or harder if that's what you're in to! You have the ability to replay the previous year if you really screw things up, but I have also tried starting over from year 1 to leverage all the new combinations I have learned.\n","August 5, 2014","true","6.7"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","26","33","0","0"

It's earned its puzzle tag here on the steam store and definitely favors deliberation. The need for strategy isn't unlike the roguelike genre, for sure, but rather than having to worry about enemies coming to kill you if you make a wrong move, you have to strike a balance between meeting objectives and the energy it will cost you to do so.\n\nThere are multiple ways to go about finishing every dungeon, and you don't actually have to complete the dungeon to leave it; find half the children and see them safely home, if that's all you feel you can do. There are different leaderboards, reflecting different things to strive for.\n\nAnd the game is pleasing to eye and ear.","January 3, 2015","true","1.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

Even if you're not normally in to puzzle games (I'm not) it's still very fun. Though there is a puzzle element (okay, more than just an element) it's mostly a logic thing. There have only been a few "puzzles" that I've seen that have any distinct way of beating, and for the most part, it's just matching/moving things around so you can get to the children to rescue them, in whatever way ends up being the most efficient for you.\n\nThe good:\n-Procedurally generated levels mean there's a lot of replay ability.\n-You can make friends with the villagers and they'll give you gifts, and you can even get married! :3\n-Challenging, in a good way. If you think and plan enough you should be able to overcome any challenges it throws at you.. and it will throw a lot at you.\n-Adorable graphics (as I have come to expect from Spry Fox)\n-The music and sound effects are perfect.\n\nThe bad:\n-Eventually, constant failing gets aggrivating... though that could just be me.\n-As far as I can tell, when the villagers get sick there's no way to make them better... I've pumped them full of medicine for DAYS and they stay sick... not really sure what to do about that.\n-If you die, you lose your stuff, which isn't a problem (I'm aware that that's what Rogue-likes are like) except that there isn't really much of a way to get them back. You can become friends with the villagers, and they MIGHT give you an item.. but there's no way to really guarantee that you'll ever be able to get back the items you've lost (EG the "Fork of eating alone")\n\nThis game is amazing, the flaws aren't really flaws.. I mean, if you never fail then you never have to worry about losing your gear, or the heartbreak of losing (though you may have heartbreak of a different kind if the villager you want decides to leave you, and start dating a man...), it's more than worth the money that you pay for it, on sale or not.\nI'm not normally into puzzle games, and I can't really get enough of this one :)","August 6, 2014","true","17.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

So much can be said about this game. I can't get enough of it! Here are a few main categories to sum up just some of the many amazing things about this spectacular game:\n\nThe Gameplay:  The dungeon randomization makes every year and every life unique, and it is up to your wit and problem solving to decide how to best craft and cluster the right items in order to get to the children. Sometimes the game can be UNBEARABLY HARD, but you still push on 'til you die or have to return to town without having saved all the children. Many of the negative reviews I see have to do with the difficulty of some of the dungeon generations, and yes, it CAN get infuriating! But there's nothing wrong with just starting a new life -I did it several times and got amazing careers afterward.\n\nEnergy preservation is key -a simple step in the wrong direction can take your life, or make your journey incredibly more difficult, so it is best to evaluate every room before taking action. You also do countless backtracking trips as you need to craft and arrange items with just the right amount of items, so your adjacent rooms are your friends. Low on health? Have an axe in one room and a ninja bear in the other one? Just throw it over and kill the bear for your apple. Need to get rid of a dark spirit AND acquire health? Take the blue fire from one room and throw it at the spirit in the other room to get a very helpful stew.\n\nI LOVE how creativity is emphasized -there are numerous ways to create the same item, and this mechanic can be both beneficial (multiple ways to make food) or detrimental (multiple ways to create daemon bunnies or dark spirits). The "teleport to mayor" mechanic can save your life in very many instances, or help you get to a room from one entrance if the other entrance is blocked or dangerous.\n\nBecause this game uses permadeath, you should always find ways to acquire money, rice, or berries, because the game is graceful in providing you a shrine to offer to and ensure that you will respawn. However, you lose very important charms upon death, so sometimes leaving some children behind when in a rut is a better choice than dying and letting your character respawn with next to nothing.\n\n\nThe Art:  The art is beautiful, charming, and deceptive- very gruesome and dark themes can be overlooked because of how cutesy the art style is. The atmosphere is remarkable -the sounds, surroundings, and music totally and completely immerse you, making you easily waste hours upon hours on this game.\n\nThe Characters: The customization in how you build your relationships -friendships and romantic- with differently generated characters every life gives you the desire to do better in the dungeons, and thus, receive more rewards to use as gifts to give to villagers. The dialogue is hilarious, sad, moving, touching, and sweet -the writers of this game put great thought and work into the dialogue. It makes the game that much more alive and real to you, and in combination with how you've built your relationships with the other characters, it can get you emotionally invested. I felt happy when a character would do kind gestures, return romantic feelings, and became unreasonably upset and sad when they would cheat on me (in romantic relationships) or simply decide they didn't like me anymore. I had to take a step back once in a while to remind myself that THIS IS A GAME! XD\n\nThis game holds a dear place in my heart, because you can see all the heart and soul the development team poured into it, and it offers infinite playtime that can always feel fresh and enjoyable. Because of this game, I have become a loyal follower of the small game developer team -SpryFox. There is something incredible about a small indie game developer doing so well with their games and it's encouraging for all other small groups of developers and artists that want to make their dream games become reality.","December 27, 2015","true","48.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

However, nothing could prepare me for the degree of unilateral cruelty of the random level generator, nor how immediately repetative the game becomes.\n\nIt initially reminded me of long lost point and click adventure games when I first viewed the trailer videos. However, it quickly becomes apparent that with no clear direction or reliable strategy involved, it simply becomes a matter of randomly flinging groups of items together until you get a favorable reaction. These are then noted in an in-game journal, and you spend the rest of the game desperately flipping through its pages looking for some sort of advantage to be culled from the horrific assortment of hazzards and obstacles that work to make your gaming experience both futile and frustrating.\n\nNOT ONLY are some levels seemingly impossible to pass, but "saving your progress at shrines" only means you respawn at the beginning of the current level... with NONE of your items or relationships SAVED!!

It's hard to describe.\nYour goal: To save all the lost children in the woods and reunite them with their parents.\n\nYour energy free controls are to move up/downleft/right, to pick up everything around you in the four directions, and to throw them all at once. If you move while holding something it will take precious energy. You can match several of similar items, or different items, depending on "secrets" (crafting recipe?) that you learn through play or from villagers. Like throwing the axe at a tree makes a log, and throwing two logs next to each-other makes a campfire which reduces the cost of carrying things on that screen, or putting three beehives together makes a jar of honey which gives you a little bit of energy.\n\nSounds simple, but while the controls are simple, the puzzle nature of trying to get to the kids, get them to their parents (or vice versa), get the kids to the starting area, or open pathways to another part of the forest can be complex. Sometimes it's downright frustrating but not in a bad game design way, just a yell obsceneties at the angry racoons who claw you if get next to them, or ninja bears who might block your path randomly way.\n\nDon't let the art style fool you, this game starts off fairly easy, but difficulty can spike. You won't always save all the kids, but that's okay. You can quit trying to help them at any time, but saving half or more of the kids is the minimum to make the mayor okay with your work. (Edit: Apparently failing to save half the kids 2x in a row kills you causing the revive mechanics to fire where you lose some of your items.)\n\nThere's an aspect of the game of getting to know the villagers that essentially breaks down to giving them the right gifts to raise your friendship bar. I got married to one just before the end of my first game! I'll definitely be playing at least one more full game of this title because the levels are somewhat randomly generated so it has replayability.\nOne full game took me between 5-6 hours.","October 8, 2015","true","11.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The art style may be cute but the world is unforgiving - it is very possible to irretrievably trap a child you're trying to rescue, or fail to get to her before a hungry witch or spider does. This is part of the appeal, I think, and also part of the game's theme. Life is hard, and you can't always save everyone. You can't always achieve the things you think you're meant to. I think this is beautiful, but I also understand why they're implementing an easier difficulty level in a future update. The wall most players run into at Year 5 can be very frustrating.\n\nThe art and music provided by Brent Kobayashi and Daniel Simmons is deeply nostalgic for players of the late MMO Glitch.\n\nThis is definitely worth playing, though I must confess that before I started playing I had been prone to some gloomy moods already. Occasionally you run into some enemy creatures that whisper things echoing what might already be in your dark thoughts. I think this could go either way for different players - it can be helpful to work through those feelings with the game, or it might amplify them and make you feel a bit worse.","August 23, 2014","true","51.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Despite the emphasis on 'choices', there is very little you can do to ensure you'll do better in your next year, or as the next poor fool in a 15-year quest to save the children of the town. You can ban a couple of items, choose from mostly identical equipment, and pick between easy or hard missions.\n\nThe easy missions tend to be randomly too easy: the hard missions tend to randomly be piles of objects you have to muddle through. The "recipes" you learn as you go are by and large useless, except for the two or three you'll keep to heart and use every time.\n\nIt's still a pretty good puzzle game when it works, though. The framing story is also quite unique: it's delivered in the smallest pieces that need to be recalled and put together, and every nitpick you might have about the plot is eventually answered.\n\nThe framing 'town' parts are purposefully random. Spend your resources wooing a townie, level them all the way up to True Love Forever, and they might still decide to ditch you for someone else at Year 15. Unlike the carefully exacting main game, the town section is one gamble on the future after the other and proud of it.\n\n"There are no stories here, just circumstances", one of the townies says. Yep. No comforting answers to hard questions like "am i doing the right thing", here. After some time you might wonder whether you should not only stop rescuing the children but actually set the entire town on fire; yet there are only so many options to you. Marry or stay single. Have children or not. Easy Mode or Hard Mode. Die in a struggle to get the last child out of the storm, or carefully pace yourself to your retirement.\n\nIn short, it's a game about choices more than it is about the consequences of those choices. Take it, or leave it.","September 7, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You are a ranger responsible for rescuing children lost in the woods, amongst strange items and dangerous creatures. The theme is rather dark, even depressing, but it holds together well.\n\nThe puzzle aspect is basically moving stuff around to get past obstacles. Some objects/creatures just sit there, others move around or actively pursue (or avoid) you, and many objects transform when they hit each other. Figuring out these "recipes" is a big part of the game, which is usually fun, but occasionally you'll forget and have an item you need get combined into something else! You have an in-game log of items and recipes found, but you really need to remember them as you play.\n\nYou have a limited amount of energy (hit points) each year (level), and if you run out, you die. Moving things in unlit rooms costs energy, and some things/creatures will damage you for varying amounts of energy. In addition to finding the children, you will need to find or make food to raise your energy—this is a critical part of succeeding! You also want to make fires to light up each part of the forest so that moving things doesn't cost energy. Figuring out how to do both is a big part of gameplay.\n\nDuring play you can form relationships with certain characters in town and in the forest, gaining charms that give you bennies, and eventually marrying them if you get really close to them. You can marry all the NPCs, male and female, if you want. But you are not guaranteed a long life with them....\n\nReplay value is pretty good as each year of your career the forest and its denizens change, and the charms are given to you in different order. It's never the same game twice, although there are a few set pieces that are always the same.","February 13","true","130.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However, I cannot recommend this game due to its solid yet shallow gameplay that fails to cohere with the superb presentation.\n\nThe core mechanic can be described as combining items to create a new item.  Good games are often based around simple mechanics.  But in the case of Road Not Taken, this simple mechanic does not combine with other mechanics in interesting ways.  Sure, there's a creature that knocks other items around, ice that switch places with another item, etc., but such additional rules do not combine with the core mechanic to create a new space or domain.  In other words, the item-combination is vast, but the rule-combination is shallow.\n\nThis problem could be avoided, I think, with better interface.  I am a fan of some wide-but-shallow games, e.g. Dota 2, that presents that user with contextually needed information such that the wideness of the game world isn't an incumberance for the player.  Something as simple as, let's say, filtering out the alchemy list based on the items available on the current screen would have made this vastness a lot more approachable.\n\nThe art, as charming as it is, could have been tailored to fence-in the player from getting lost in the vastness of the game as well.  For instance, angry animals seem to attack the players seemingly randomly, as there is not visual indication of which direction they will attack (or maybe i'm should be more observant?).\n\nOn the plus side, this game touches on many themes that most games do not explore and evokes grief, sense of loss, and the sort of sad beauty that is hard to evoke in any medium.  For that, the developers should be lauded.  However, in the final analysis, I cannot recommend this game as a game, though I would recommend a short playthrough (at a friend's house? or if it's on sale?) as an experience.","December 22, 2015","false","10.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Instead it opts for a nonsensical "checkpoint" system that has LIMITED USES and still takes away otherwise permanent items, which means effectively that the game responds to the player having trouble with a later part of the game by making that part EVEN HARDER.\n\nThis kind of thing is objectively terrible game design, and needs to be removed from the heads of developers.","October 16, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","3"

I also have one of their apps which I like a lot. I like the concept of the game and was really looking forward to putting some time into it, but I have reached the max of my frustration. I'm only on level 4 and every level 2-6 new items and concepts are introduced. It's too much. I can't enjoy solving the puzzles because once I figure out what the combinations of sticks and trees and rocks do, they introduce squirrels, color changing rocks, red spirits, white spirits, black spirits, nice bears, mean bears, demon rabbits, and regular rabbits all in one level. Sheesh, relax. Let me get comfortable with the game. Then to top it off, if you screw up one thing you're done. The level is ruined. It's overwhelming and becomes more frustrating than fun.

Unnecessarily long loading times aside (Especially for a trashy looking 2d game), I booted it up and I have to say, at least it managed to detect my screen resolution correctly. It went downhill from there.\n\nFirst off, the game's locked to 30fps, which is a nightmare. I alt-tabbed out to confirm this with FRAPS, and upon alt-tabbing back in, all of the art assets had been stolen, just like my money when I bought this trash. I was presented with a black screen with just the text overlaid on it.\n\nI rebooted it (I have no idea why, I should have just quit there and then), got past the introduction cutscene and mission for a second time, and decided I wanted to turn down the repetitive, irritating soundtrack and noises. Nope. I had two options: On or off. I mean, sure, I could go to the Windows Sound Mixer and turn down the program's sound, but that would mean alt-tabbing out, a "feature" this game doesn't support. Shame. I decided to opt with keeping the sound on and just switching from headphones to speakers so I could control the sound there, but I digress.\n\nI continued on with my "quest" (Can you call it that? I don't think many self-respecting "quests" would consist of overcoming a series of mild annoyances), and wanted to see if I could switch from full screen to windowed in the hope that that would let me alt-tab out. Nope. If you want to change between the two you have to reboot the game, something I'd done twice at this point. It might not be a problem, but the game doesn't actually seem to have any clear way of how to save your progress.\n\nI carried on, ignoring the plethora of bugs and missing features I'd encountered, into the third room. There are two NPCs in there that you can talk to. I spoke to both of them, listening to their unimportant small-talk (Why did they even include this in the game? It doesn't add anything and it's just infuriating to have to click through). After going through the boring dialogue, I saw something. Huh, there are three badly drawn boys (Hue) on a stage with musical instruments. This looks interesting (Funnily enough this was the first time I'd said this in my half an hour of working through the bugs). I interacted with them and the credits played. I felt a sigh of relief, thinking I'd completed the game and wouldn't have to play any more. Alas, after finishing the credits I just spawned back in the room I was in. Great, I had to play yet more of this. What's that? There's an exclamation mark above the heads of the two NPCs I spoke with before, indicating they have new dialogue. Oh, how exciting! I couldn't wait to hear what they had to say, especially after the thrilling heart-to-heart I'd had with them just minutes beforehand. What *could* have transpired in the time that I was gone?. Oh... It was the same dialogue they'd said before. Either they have Alzheimer's or the game forgot to save my progress before I watched the credits that for whatever reason, the boy band up on stage had access to.\n\nCarrying on, I moved onto the next area and finally got presented with a puzzle. I completed the puzzle and teleported back to the town, at which point I was presented with a console, a pause menu, and a "which mod would you like to play?" menu. I closed all of the boxes as I didn't recall asking for any of them (Unless Alzheimer's is now contagious, in which case I may have contracted it from the boy band). I tried to move. Nope. I tried to hit escape in order to leave this hellhole. Nope. Nothing was responding and yet again, half the "art" assets hadn't even loaded. It was at this point that I hit alt+f4 and decided to remove this broken mess from my hard drive.\n\nOh, did I mention this isn't even a roguelike, in any sense of the word?\n\nHonestly, just avoid this. I'd recommend playing anything else instead. Bad Rats or Infestation would be a better choice.","April 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/293740/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Road Not Taken is a simplistic and cute puzzle-roguelike taking place in a winter village where children frequently get lost in the woods. You play a ranger mysteriously tasked with finding the children and returning them to the village. Each level consists of a randomly generated 3x3 grid of rooms with 8x6 tiles each and you can move horizontally or vertically through them. Of course, there are many obstacles in the way and you have to use your magic powers to lift and throw them. The game uses an energy mechanic which is drained whenever you carry an item a space or take damage. When you reach zero energy, that’s game over and you can also lose by failing to rescue at least half the children per level too many times. There is also a recipe mechanic where certain items or monsters can be combined with other things to create new items (or monsters!)\n\nAs far as I can tell the game doesn’t have a whole lot of replayability besides unlocking creatures to ban from the forest and learning recipes, so I don’t think it’s worth the full price of $14. That being said, it’s still a good pickup if you’re into puzzle games with a cutesy look and feel.","September 2, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the tiles have different properties, but at its heart you are moving and matching tiles to solve puzzles and open up new areas. You have a limited number of moves to use and unused moves carry over to the next map, forcing you to make choices for whether you want to fully complete one puzzle, or save those moves for the next, harder puzzles.\n\nIt is procedurally generated and there is permadeath, but you don't really become all that much more powerful over time, nor do you really acquire new abilities. For the most part, the puzzles just get harder (and some of the late puzzles are butally hard) and the perks you acquire often aren't that helpful. It's mostly just hard. This isn't inherently bad, it's just not for people who want a short, easy puzzle game.\n\nThere is also a romance plot that is driven by one major player choice (who to befriend). You can romance a wide number of characters and learn more about them, mostly by bribing them with food. I have yet to complete a full playthrough, so I haven't seen a resolution of a romance plot yet, but it's an interesting little take on choice, consequence, and circumstance that could probably be a game all its own. There is also some interesting backstory discovered in pieces at random throughout the game, but I'll leave that for others to discover themselves.\n\nOverall, this is a fun game. It has its flaws, and the difficulty curve is a difficulty wall at times, but for a game that calls itself a roguelike I honestly can't be too surprised. It's still fun, and the backstory is interesting. Worth a shot.","August 27, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrecat/recommended/293740/","sabrecat","SabreCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrecat/","166 products in account","Road Not Taken has loads of charm. Its characters with their childlike proportions, animations showing exaggerated emotions from tears to joy, and even its core mission of returning lost children to their parents all achieve a heartwarming feel. The gameplay is tricky without being rage-inducing, and procedurally generated such that the solutions to the obstacles it throws your way never become rote.\n\nThe game also does an examplary job on the diversity front. Most characters (the protagonist and about two-thirds of the townsfolk) have their appearances randomized from one game to the next, most noticeably in skin tones that range through much of the human spectrum. You choose the main character's gender through a subtle dialogue choice, or can choose not to reveal it at all; whatever you pick, you're free to romance any of the six eligible objects of affection. It's successful and understated, a perfect example for what baseline assumptions of such things could be--in stark contrast to the usual default of "straight dude protag woos straight lady NPC in a fantasy world full of white people."\n\nSome past reviews complain about the game's difficulty. I suspect those reviewers played before the recent rebalancing that made a big chunk of the difficulty opt-in. If you stick to the "normal" difficulty path and hold on to a paltry bit of resources to spend on checkpoints, reaching the end of a full playthrough (called a "career," fifteen levels' worth) will only take you a few hours. If you don't have a head for turn-based maneuvering puzzles (think Sokoban, Adventures of Lolo, any Roguelike, etc.) at all, then I could definitely understand steering clear, but for the average gamer difficulty is not a concern.\n\nMy only complaint about Road Not Taken comes on the technical level: for some reason, this very unassuming game grinds along like it's a boundary-pushing video resource hog. Expect to stare at the initial loading bar for half a minute or so each time you play, and stutter for a couple of seconds on scene transitions. Perhaps installing to an SSD might help.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who appreciates the occasional break from washed-out grimdarkness and ultraviolence!","October 11, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
