This is in no way a bad thing. Spec Ops wants to tell a story about soldiers in war. But unlike games such as Call of Duty, it doesn't want you to feel like an awesome, unstoppable killing machine that's fighting terrorism FOR 'MERICA!!! or whatever; it wants you to see that war is not glamorous, awesome, fun, or desirable. It wants you to see the terrible toll that combat can exact on those who experience it. And above all, it wants you to see that in real conflict, there are no "good guys" and "bad guys," and the world is full of gray areas. War is hell, and anyone who goes in will either join the fortunate dead...or have to live with what they've done to survive.\n\nSpec Ops is a third-person cover-based shooter that alternates between desert environments and crumbling urban ruin. You have two squadmates who can be directed to attack specific targets or heal a fallen comrade; they're pretty good at following orders in a timely fashion and, unlike some other AI partners, they're not highly prone to getting themselves shot constantly or hung up on the level geometry. Enemies are decently clever, more than willing to flank you, toss grenades to get you out of cover, or trick you into walking right into a Heavy Trooper's line of fire.\n\nThe game also offers the clever idea of having drifts of sand piled up on fragile surfaces like windows, which you can shoot out to bury your enemies. It doesn't show up that often, but it's kind of neat when it's there.\n\nThere's the usual shooter stable of weapons: pistols, heavy pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, etc. They sound good and feel decently punchy, and aiming is never a problem. Most weapons also have an alternate fire mode, which does add a little depth to the combat.\n\nI didn't play the multiplayer, so I can't honestly review it. I will say the developers originally didn't even want multiplayer, and the campaign is designed well enough to stand on its own, so make of that what you will.\n\nI highly recommend this game. It is a breath of fresh air in an over-crowded genre that's becoming increasingly generic. This game is also visually stunning, with exceptional voice acting, and sound. It is definitely worth the money and the effort to play the game from the beginning to the end.","December 28, 2013","true","6.3"," 1,497 of 1,587 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","497","1","2","46"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/recommended/50300/","ericjdouglas","koala fish mutant bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/","561 products in account","About halfway through Yager's third-person-shooter Spec Ops: The Line, in one of the game's most controversial moments, I found myself disgusted and infuriated. Not at the scene I'd just witnessed, or at the game's statement as a whole, but rather that it even needs to be said at all. Two of the ten bestselling video games of all time are Grand Theft Auto V and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The "military shooter" is one of the most successful genres of the last ten years, and the objective of these games is to kill people. Lots of people. We eat it up non-stop, and always, always ask for sequels seconds. In order to keep the profit margins wide, we are encouraged to never think about it, to never stop and look at ourselves with a critical, compassionate, clear eye. Of course, it's not only Hollywood that benefits from the blinders we've all put on, since only the desperate and crazy would fight our wars for us if it weren't for the glorification of war peddled by the governments of this strange, sad world upon which we find ourselves spinning through the abyss.\n\nIn an ideal world, these things wouldn't need to be said and all of this would be a moot point. Games like The Line would be seen as a gratuitous miserywank, and people would rightly ask, "Why do we need something like this?" But we don't live in an ideal world, and as gamers, we inhabit a very flashy and seductive yet still a very small and confined space where, ever since John Carmack created Wolfenstein 3D and Doom and ushered in the era of the ultraviolent shooter genre, there is an elephant in the room covered in blood and gore. As such, The Line is a game that needed to be made, its message one that we need to listen to.\n\nThe plot, involving a small group of elite U.S. soldiers sent to Dubai on a rescue mission in the midst of a freak sandstorm that all but destroys the city, is adapted from the novella Heart of Darkness[en.wikipedia.org] by Joseph Conrad, which also inspired the movie Apocalypse Now[en.wikipedia.org]. The themes of both are intact here -- the horrors of war, the darkness that lives in the soul, and the lengths to which the human mind will go to rationalize its own nature -- but I would argue that they are made much more effective by the vicarious immediacy of the video game medium, and because so much of gaming involves visiting death on whole populations of pixellated AI effigies. Here, the formula is largely unchanged; indeed, you mow down an impressive number of folks with a variety of well-represented handguns, rifles and heavy weapons, but unlike your regular military shooter, The Line invites and occasionally straight-up forces you to think about the enemy soldiers: who they are, what their motivations are, and of course, how they die. The writers at Yager accomplish this in several ways, some with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face, but others which surprised the sheer hell out of me with their deft use of the medium's voyeuristic and user-participation elements. Spoiler: There's one such moment available in the demo after you use a zipline to reach a building where you sneak up on a pair of soldiers overlooking the ruined city. Their quiet, wistful conversation together is human, poignant, and, because you have no choice but to kill them to proceed with the mission, painfully affecting.\n\nA lot has been written about this game[en.wikipedia.org] and I doubt I'm saying anything new. It is well-deserving of its praise. It's mature and uncompromising. The characters are believable, sometimes heartbreakingly so. At one point I questioned Yager's decision to use the third-person perspective instead of first-person; it seemed to me that the latter would have been much more powerful. But when you stop to wheel the camera around and look at your character, you don't see your typical hardcore BAMF with the obligatory, almost muscular, furrowed brow, the thin, tight, all-business lips, the hard eyes, etc. You see a soldier scared for his life, scared for his soul. His eyes dart everywhere like a cornered animal, he breathes unsteadily, he looks like he feels: horrified, nauseated and on the edge of tears.\n\nThe devs say that the story is open to interpretation, but for me, the game is at its heart an honest illustration of post-traumatic stress disorder, or as George Carlin would say, "shellshock":\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSp8IyaKCs0\n\nIf George were still around and had been a gamer, he probably would've approved of Spec Ops: The Line. He was first and foremost an observer of life, a philosopher who just happened to be funny as hell. This is not a funny game. One of the characters starts off as the typical comic relief character that all shooters seem to require, but like Pvt. Joker in Full Metal Jacket[en.wikipedia.org], he sobers up fast and his wisecracks dry up completely during the events of the game. It's almost a shame the cover-based shooting mechanics are so well done, because I find myself torn between wanting to do another playthrough and not wanting to feel the way this game makes me feel. Because this is where The Line lives: the duality of our chosen brand of entertainment, where we "play" at the deadly game of simulated mortal conflict, and never stop to ask ourselves: what does my kill/death ratio mean for my soul? Does blood still stain if it only exists in my head? Should I even care?\n\nA man broke into my neighborhood\nHe threatened the family with a loaded gun\nHe tied them all up and beat 'em real good\nHe took everything and he got away clean\n\nAnd I can't believe that anyone would\nWanna do such a terrible thing\nBut why should I care?\n\nEvery time I look around this place\nI see them scream but I hear no sound\nAnd the terrible things happen down the road\nTo somebody else that I don't even know\n\nNothing bad ever happens to me\nNothing bad ever happens to me\nNothing bad ever happens to me\nNothing bad ever happens to me\nWhy should I care?\nWhy should I care?\nWhy should I care?\n\nOingo Boingo - Nothing Bad Ever Happens To Me\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is a game that needed to be made. It is a game that, in my opinion, needs to be (I hesitate to use the word "played") experienced. It is a powerful milestone in the ongoing evolution and maturation of gaming, and it asks hard questions that deserve to be heard. It's up to you whether or not to listen. To paraphrase Kenneth Jarecke, a Gulf War photojournalist whose photograph of a dead Iraqi soldier was pulled from the U.S. media outlets because it was deemed too shocking for the public[www.theatlantic.com]: if you're big enough to fight a war, you should be big enough to look at it.","August 29, 2014","true","47.5"," 980 of 1,076 people (91%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","91","980","1","15","50"

That assumption couldn’t be more wrong though.\n\nBased loosely on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Spec Ops provides one of the strongest and mature narratives in recent memory.\n\nThe story revolves around Captain Walker and his two wingmen, Lugo and Adams. Their latest mission sends them to a post-catastrophic Dubai to find Colonel Konrad who was in charge of evacuating the civilian population. Captain Walker is often forced to make difficult decisions and any pretense of him being some badass hero is quickly removed as it's clear that sometimes there's no correct decision to make. The character progression is strong and the voice acting is phenomenal.\n\nThe art direction is spectacular as Dubai provides almost a surreal experience. When you’re not avoiding sandstorms, you'll travel through luxury hotels and buildings that have all been submerged in sand. The game also gives you a taste of PTSD as you’re sometimes left wondering whether or not certain things are real.\n\nThe combat plays out similarly to other third person shooters. It will have you taking cover, blind firing and issuing commands to your squad mates. The AI is well done, making Lugo and Adams feel very capable while the enemy AI on the other hand could use a bit of work. The combat is solid but it makes no attempt to do anything new or innovative.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, including a lot of real songs along with ambient guitar pieces that match the mood perfectly. The inclusion of Jimi Hendrix and other classics really give the game an ‘Apocalypse Now’ type of feel which was another Heart of Darkness adaptation.\n\nUnfortunately, Spec Ops is fairly short (around 5 hours) but the different endings offer some incentive to replay the game. There’s a multiplayer mode that offers a few different game types, weapons, and stages but it feels a bit tacked on. It’s fairly clear that Spec Ops was designed to be experienced as a single player game primarily and it’s one I strongly recommend.\n\nFor a more detailed review, here’s a video by my friend and fellow reviewer, Trent:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnHItiRiBbs\n\nPros\n+	Amazing Narrative\n+	Fantastic Soundtrack\n+	Beautiful Art Direction & Environments\n+	Great Characters & Voice Acting\n\nCons\n-	Short length & Linear\n-	Generic Combat\n-	Multiplayer isn’t very exciting\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","January 18, 2014","true","7.1"," 363 of 388 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","363","388","0","32"

I just cant put into words how powerful it was to me. People will be against this opinion, but this is no doubts in my book the Culmination of what a game can be narrative wise. Last of Us, Undertale , nothing comes closer.\n\nSo, as someone who digs story and literature, this game sounded like a treat!\nA great 3rd person shooter with unique setting and a good story.\nI quickly realized that it was a not mistake to go in full blind. Honestly, it was the most twisted , exausting, tense, emotion packed experience I ever encountered in a medium. The sheer raw brutality and straightfoward truth of the whole narrative drew me in from the get-go.\nEverything helped to make the game feel incredible (in a harmful way)\n\nThe controls are a bit cluncky at first, but nothing some practice can fix. Its still a very accesible game, that anyone who played shooters (or not) before can handle.\n\nThe voice acting is Oscar worthy. Not a single line was wasted or weak. Especially the main cast really nail the dialouge. Belive me when I say few times I really FELT a game protagonist was a human being. Nolan North really sounds like a tired, angry, traumatized war victim.\n\nThe graphics, especially with everything cranked up to the max, are ****ing beautiful, the aestetic is superb and the levels are very well desinged.\n\nThe sound is overall intense and loud, each fight is nerve wracking to the extreme.\n\nSoundtrack is outstanding and fitting to the themes.\n\nThe overall story is open to your conclusions, which leads to very interesting interpretations from players.\n\nMultiplayer is NOT totally dead. A fellow user has made up a group that organises matches frequently. You can join if you want ! MP is sorta good. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Expendables-reality\n\nI could go on forever, but I rather not saturate you.\nJust buy it whenever possible.\nThis was the most incredible game I ever played, and I hope you can someday see why.\n\n"We do what is nesessary...and If we are lucky, we just die".","March 20, 2015","true","19.8"," 462 of 512 people (90%) found this review helpful 183 people found this review funny","90","462","512","183","5"

What does that mean, does this game suck? No. In fact, this game is incredibly beautiful in many ways, and when you are done playing this game, the whole game story is stuck in your head and makes you think about it. Definitely not some game that is recommended for those who only play Call of Duty multiplayer and such, but for those who are able to appreciate such an amazing story that this game offers. But the problem is that I do not know why this game is called "Spec Ops". I have been avoiding this game for a while, not knowing why and now I know the reason. Because this game is associated with the franchise "Spec Ops" that existed in the past, and Spec Ops games generally were not really good games when I was a kid. So, when I googled the name Spec Ops, I thought "Oh man, now I remember this name Spec Ops...now I know why I have been avoiding this game....all simply because it is associated with the franchise that I was avoiding as a kid." I honestly wish this game was rather called something else. Probably 33rd. The name "Spec Ops" might be the reason why the sales of the game was not that good as well...when the game is absolutely "nothing" like the Spec Ops games that I have played in the past, which is a good thing, a great thing even. The only complain I have would be that....probably as a TPS game, it is not that amazing to be honest. It doesn't mean it is bad, but it is just...not that amazing. But I really liked the fact that at some point, you can choose to do what to do. Such as disobeying the command, or you could simply just choose to obey.\n\nI guess the story alone covers everything in this game and this game is essentially worth taking a look at, all just for the story alone.\n\nThis game, is about the horrors of war. This game, is about the value of life. But this game is not about good and evil, or mayhap, it indeed is. But that depends on how you look at it. As a philosopher myself, this game is what I would call, a game for the thinkers. Who is Captain Walker in the end? What happened to him? The only person who can find out, is you.\n\n9.3 out of 10","November 28, 2013","true","7.1"," 351 of 389 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","351","389","0","7"

I played from 11pm to 4am, expecting that the game was some sort of quick-play game that I could put down easily at any time, like, say, call of duty (oh good grief, even the comparison makes me cringe). I was so driven to finish the game (the mission, as it were) much like Walker was. This revelation made me hate myself beyond belief, as I realized the very same determination, the self-same urge to commit to a goal made me ignore warning signs all over the place. This game makes you truly explore yourself, the deepest darkest recesses of your psyche where the hidden threads of psychopathy lie.\n\nWhen I finally finished the game at 4am, I was unable to sleep. I stayed awake, tormented by what I had done and the face of the white phosphorus burnt mother and child. I kept telling myself: "This is a game. Get over it and get to sleep.", but I just couldn't get over the fact that at the heart of every human is the capability to take things to an extreme in order to pursue a perceived greater good. It is the very thing that drives the best of humanity and the worst of humanity. Medical scientists pursuing a cure, versus the extremists ♥♥♥♥ing up Syria as I type this.

However for one reason or another, it ends up doing horribly. Spec Ops: The Line may be the biggest crime I've ever witnessed...\n\nSpec Ops puts you in the shoes of Captain Walker, you and two squad mates are sent into a sandstorm destroyed Dubai to find survivors. At first glance the game may appear to be another Call Of Duty type of modern shooter. Disaster occurs and America comes in to save the day, but that is definitely not the case.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this game is how beautiful it is, some may disagree, but Spec Ops on PC with max settings truly looks next gen to me, and this game was released a good while before next gen was a thing. The animation complements this point, for example since Dubai is a city destroyed by uncontrollable sandstorms, you will be traveling through a lot of buildings that are now buried deep below the sand. The moment when I first shot out a giant window I gleefully watched as the sand poured in and buried alive an entire squad of soldiers.\n\nEverything that should be good in a 3rd person shooter gameplay wise is present in this game, but I do not want to waste any time so I'll just tell you about the one thing in Spec Ops that will make you love it, the story. This is hands down the greatest story I have ever had the pleasure of playing in a "Modern War" shooter. Within the first couple levels, Spec Ops shows you that unlike what other games will tell you, war nowadays isn't as clear as "America=good guys, Foreigners=bad guys". Without spoiling too much you quickly see other American soldiers killing innocent families. What choice do you have? Will you just stand by and let mothers and children get burned alive? No of course not, you are going to take action and start killing your fellow soldiers. While going through the campaign I couldn't believe the light Yager was casting on the American military...and I loved it. Just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean you are a good, or sane, person. Your squad has to witness the entire breakdown of a city, piles of bodies litter the streets, peoples are dying of everything you could imagine, soldiers killing the innocent for sport, but Walker keeps pressing on, because he believes he is doing the right thing.\n\nThe voice acting is also great and it isn't just because Nolan North plays the main character, it is because not only do you see, but you also hear the changes these characters are going through due to what they are forced to live through. Once again I do not want to spoil anything, but Walker starts off as a by the book, top tier soldier, and North does an incredible job showing just how much war can change a man.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is an incredible game that will blow you away. The graphics are beautiful though the images you will see are gut-wrenching. The voice acting is fantastic though what these characters go through is horrible. The story is perfect, you will feel like you have walked through hell with these soldiers. If you are not interested in the "Modern War" genre because of it's glorification and unrealistic approach on war, play this game. If you do like the "Modern War" genre because it is fun, action packed, and brutally violent, play this game. If you haven't figured it out yet what I'm trying to say is Spec Ops is a game you should play, easily an unforgettable experience. Play this game and lets give Yager the praise and recognition they deserve.\n","December 8, 2013","true","6.7"," 230 of 254 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","230","254","0","23"

The 33rd Battalion, a United States infantry unit, is sent to provide aid but soon disappears. In a last ditch effort, a three-man Delta Force team is sent in to find out what happened and rescue survivors. As captain of this reconnaissance team it is up to you and your teammates to fight your way across the city and find answers.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is a third person shooter where you will find that you are heavily reliant on cover. You have the ability to command your teammates in battle, telling them who to target. Combat is fast paced and fun, albeit a bit generic. My main complaint with combat would be that the AI sometimes feels a bit clumsy, but nothing bad enough to be game breaking.\n\nThe game is very story rich and is definitely worth paying attention to. Occasionally you will be forced to make some very difficult decisions. What I liked about this is that there is never really a “right” or “wrong” answer. Unlike some military shooters, this game does not glorify war. Instead it touches on the horrors of war and the profound psychological impact it often has on those who experience it.\n\nThe environment is absolutely breathtaking, by far my favorite in any game ever. They did a wonderful job at making Dubai look so ruined yet beautiful, resulting in a few areas where you have to stop just to admire your surroundings.\n\nI realize that this can vary quite a bit from person to person but I was pleasantly surprised by the music used in the game. Quite a few classics including Hendrix and Deep Purple, as well as some more modern but worthwhile bands such as the Black Angels. If that’s not your thing, it’s still worth mentioning that the original score is pretty solid.\n\nI’m normally extremely skeptical of military shooters, but this game is something else entirely and is now considered among my favorite games.

It took me a while to really understand it, and the significance of the ending was a little bit Bioshock: Infinite-esque, so I'd really suggest paying attention to the cutscenes. The gameplay was pretty average and mundane for a third-person shooter, but the controls were the only nuisance I had. By default, they're unconventional and require some time to get used to. They remind me of the Mass Effect controls, but aren't nearly as polished. For example, sometimes I died from jumping over a box instead of taking cover behind it. Despite these cons, the atypical, dark, and twisting story overshadows its faults. The length of the game on the normal setting is just right. I can't think of any gaps in the plot that would extend the length.\n\nOverall, it was a comfortable game to play and I'd definitely recommend grabbing it when it goes on sale.","October 5, 2014","true","6.2"," 166 of 178 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","166","178","0","0"

You owe it to yourself to read this review and others like it :)\n\nfull review.People who know me, know that on first blush "Spec Ops: The Line" is not my kind of game.  This game sat in my library for a long time collecting dust.  I am not sure what prompted me to load it up and give it a try....but will I be forever grateful that I did.\n\nThis has instantly become my Game of the Decade so far.  There are parts of this game that will stick with me for years to come.  To suggest that this is mearly a game would be an injustice; it is a masterpiece.  It is a well-crafted story that took me places I never wanted to go, and will never forget.  Like Oliver Stone's Platoon, it's a powerful story with a strong narrative and superb voice acting that must be experienced to be understood.  To go into any more detail, would be giving away too much.\n\nIf you don't own this game; buy it.  If you have this game sitting in your library; play it. And tell everyone you know to do the same.\n\nPROS+ Strong, unexpected story/narative\n+ Well thoughtout and beautiful level design\n+ Killer game soundtrack\n+ Superb voice acting and compelling characters\n+ Intelligent and aggressive AI\n+ Excellent optimization / run it at 1080p 60fps on low-end cards\n+ Four endings, easily accessible from Chapter Select menu\n+ One of those games that gets better with a second play-through\n\nMEHS= Solid cover-based shooting mechanic\n\nCONS- Tack-on multiplayer feature\n- Cover and melee mapped to the same button","November 14, 2014","true","14.0"," 176 of 195 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","176","195","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BaptismByLoli/recommended/50300/","BaptismByLoli","Gradus Culpae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BaptismByLoli/","178 products in account","Spec Ops: The Line is not a game. No, I refuse to call it a game. Instead, a more fitting way to label this piece of work would be, 'art'. Plain and simple. Just as the 'Fountain' by Marcel Duchamp was a big slap to the face for the art commmunity on 'What is Art?', Spec Ops: The Line does the same for the Gaming Community on, 'What are Modern Military Shooters?' It takes the Badass, Stone-Cold, Heroic and invulnerable killing machine protaganist typical in your everyday Military Shooter and tears it to pieces with its masterful story.\n\nThis poigant work will really help making you wonder what it means to be a hero and needs to be played in order to be understood. To be honest, I feel like I ripped off the developers for buying this game when it was on a $6 deal.\n________________________________________________________________\nStory\n\nDubai was hit with a series of sandstorm that ravaged the city and turned it into a Kid's Sandbox basically. Colonel John Konrad, a decorated Officer in the US army and the 33rd 'Damned' Infantry Regiment volunteered to help the evacuated the city. Nothing was heard from them ever since until 6 Months Later when a Distress Signal by Konrad himself reaches out to the world. This is where you come in. You're Captain Walker, leader of a 3 Man Delta Team Operative sent to investigate Dubai for any survivors. (Cliche, Badass 3 Man Special Forces Protaganist trying to get stuff done and take care of business where others failed.)\n\nThis is about as much as you need to know to understand what's going on.\n________________________________________________________________\nGameplay\n(AI)\nEnemy AI seem to be good enough, alway shouting out what their doing and responding to each other in turn. There are 4 types of enemies Regular, Close-Combat, Sniper and Heavy. * = can be armoured, ie more durable\nRegular* - The Grunts. SMG/Shotgunners/Assault Rifle all day, everyday. Shotgunners tend to charge at you which can be a danger\nClose-Combat - Remember that Banzai Soldier from World at War? This is him except that its 1 hit kill, he dodges and insta-kills you with his knife when he gets close (Yes, no QTE)\nSniper* - He snipes? Also has shiny red laser sight which you can see since its tagging you\nHeavy* - Always comes armoured and just like the Bulldozer from Payday 2, his face is his weakspot. There are 2 varieties of the 'Heavy', M249 Saw or AA12. Either way you're boned as they love walking straight up to you... Jerks\n\nDon't worry about your AI though as they are okay-ish enough to get stuff done though they tend to go suicidal when you issue an attack order. They have no problem in getting kills or distracting enemies and will always shout out enemies of interest during a firefight such as, "Shotgunner coming from the right!". Take note that this needs to be heard as battle lines are not subtitled. What can be annoying though is when they take too much damamge, they need to be revived and you have a time limit but you don't have the ability to be revived (On Hard, idk about normal and easy)\n\n(Core)\nThe meat of the game comes from being a Cover-Based Third Person Shooter reminiscent to that of games like Gears of War. Basically, you sprint form cover to cover (Using a Toggle Key 'Space') and rely on Regenerating Health. The lower your health, the more bloodied your screen becomes in addition to being Black and White (CoD anyone?). There are 15 weapons in total give or take which felt the same with only the diffference being its 'Alternate Function' key which is 'C'. There are also 3 grenade types, Frag, Sticky and Stun which are pretty self-explanatory. You can carry 2 weapons and all 3 grenade types at once. However, you are only limited to 3 grenades per type making the total number of grenades which can be carried to 9(3 Frags/3 Stickies/3 Stuns). Different from other games is how ammo is obtained here. While there is still the basic, 'pick up ammo from dead body so long as same weapon' concept, what Spec Ops has added to spice it up is that in this game is that you can actually Execute wounded enemies to get ammo for your current weapon type. Because you know.. Executions are fun. Be fast though or they'll bleed out to death(GoW anyone)\n\nIn a nutshell, it's your run of the mill Third Person Cover based shooter like Gears of War or Future Soldier.. Just like any other games where you're the unstoppable saviour of your country.\n\n(Command)\nAs Leader, you have control of 2 Squad Mates who use order via the MMB. They are:\nLieutenant Adams\nYour Heavy Weapons Specialist carrying the M249 Saw. Order him to attack an enemy so long as their close and he'll do two things. FIrst, he unleashes hell on them with suppressive fire from his weapon. Second, he throws a frag which finds its mark 90% of the time, the 10% due to the enemy running away from it\n\nSergeant Lugo\nYour Sniper. Order him to attack an enemy from long range and he'll kill the guy so long as he has vision. Though it takes some time for him to pull the trigger, its usually a 1-shot kill\n\nAs you can see, the command aspect in this game is very weak but simple enough to make life easy.\n\n(Environment)\nAlongside your Red Explosive Containers, you also have the sand which can either help or hinder you. Firstly, Sand can act as either an alternative form of Explosive Barrels. Secondly, throwing an explosive into a pile of sand would create a sand cloud which effectively stuns all nearby enemies for a nice amount of time, similar to Stun grenades if I'm not mistaken. Later in the game at set stages, you'll come across Sandstorms which does two things. Making you unable to issue orders and increasing weapon spread. Extremely frustrating, especially on harder difficulties (15+ deaths on Hard)\n\nNothing revolutionary here really though I'll admit its interesting in theory.\n\n(Misc)\nCollectables are available in the game and are called Intels. The number of intels available in each level is shown by pressing Escape. It offers backstory to the world of Dubai and its inhabitants. As of the time this review was written, no Steam Trading Cards are available. Checkpoints in this game seem to be fair enough. 1 checkpoint pre and post engagement.\n________________________________________________________________\nMusic and Sound\n\nI like the music. It's nice... very Vietnam War-esque and is also perfectly timed and well-executed. It's either Gung Ho adrenaline fueled action or music that make you muse over your actions.\n\nSound also seems to be quite good though the sound of the AA12 doesn't seem to have too much force behind it. Other than that, the sound can of this game can really make firefights here intense, especially on higher difficulties.\n________________________________________________________________\nGraphics\n\nIt looks nice enough if you really care so much about it. It's able to capture the violence and carnage you unleash (Yay carnage and violence cause that's what every military shooter needs right!... right?)\n________________________________________________________________\nMutiplayer\nThere are two types of Multiplayer here.\nCo-Op\n2 players, 4 levels. A bit of a challenge when communication between the two is lacking. Can be fun for the first few times though I believe that it will lose its charm as fast as you finish it\nCompetetive\n4v4 PvP from what I heard though sadly the cream of this game comes from the SP hence why I never bothered to try it out.\n________________________________________________________________\nOverall\n\nStory is honestly speaking the saving grace for this game. It's what made it so spectacular as the entire gameplay is bland, rehashed and has been done countless times though it can be argued that the very fact that it copies its gameplay from other Military Games is what makes this so good. This is because of how Spec Ops question our beliefs on said game.

I was about to write a negative review for this game - it was a really hard way for me to play through it, but I finally managed to, after completely uninstalling the game twice.\nWhy I, despite that, do recommend this game and why I had so much difficulty getting it done I will tell you soon.\n\nSummaryYou might be able to tell from this short overview, otherwise, you just have all the points clearly visible.\n\nPositiveMediocreNegative+ Great Message+ Good Story~ quite short+ Cover System- Controls feel unresponsive and messy+ Realistic Damage- too slow recovery time~ I couldn't play properly with keyboard/mouse- aiming with a controller is a pain+ Using the environment, especially sand, to your advantage~ not possible everywhere+ Beautiful Dubai~ not so beautiful textures- Some really bad rendered cutscenes+ Cool and atmospheric music- Quite a few sound bugs+ Characters Evolve+ Choices matter~ or do they?\nThe StoryA three-headed Delta squad led by yourself is sent on a rescue mission to the once beautiful city of Dubai - now a wasteland covered in sand. In this hostile environment you are to find survivors of the 33rd Infantry Battalion who volunteered to evacuate the civilians of the city, afterwards received orders to abandon them and leave but disobeyed and broke contact since.\nThroughout the game, you will see what happened in the five and a half months and how the order of command in the city turned around.\nAs it is, I think it's not a great story but it is beeing told in a unique way that shows a perspective you are normally not shown by the media. At the end of it, you will be able to emphasize with everybody but yourself - you might hate yourself, you might want to kill yourself (not in real life, mind you, but as the character you are playing) and you will regret everything.\n\nThe WorldDubai is beautiful - it has always been and even all those sandstorms couldn't take the beauty of the city away.\nWhat however takes aways it's beauty are the tributes of war and the things that have long left the definition of 'war' and go into the fields of mutilation and violation.\nThere is quite a lot of detail - many posters and grafiti with different messages - some from the old face of Dubai like expensive cars and then the messages of the survivors, sometimes written in bloody red.\nThe textures are ok for the age of the game I guess and they are not your main focus anyway, they are pretty mushy at places, though.\n\nThe CharactersThe first man of your squad is 1st Lieutenant, heavy gunner, Alphonso Adams - a really loyal and devoted soldier - at the beginning, that is. However as the story progresses his attitude begins to change... for better?\nAdditionally, there is Sergeant John Lugo - your man with the Eagle Eye and the trusted engineer of the force. He makes it pretty clear what he thinks of the whole mission and the choices you make and his opinion is mostly not in your favor - you can image that this will not become better in the hot wheater of the desert.\nLast but not least there is yours truly Captain Martin Walker, the character you get to play and make the decisions with, for your team. Decisions you won't like, decisions that are bad and worse - but that's just how decisions are in a war. His mental stability will begin to fade in the heat of battle and you won't know whats true and whats not anymore - whats good and whats bad - who is a friend and who is a foe. It becomes clearer that he suffers from PTSD[en.wikipedia.org] - which is not too unusual in the light of the situation.\nBut wait? I am forgetting John Konrad - Colonel John Konrad, commander of the 33rd Infantry Battalion who intended to help the people of Dubai but damned them instead... or did he?\nThe GameplayIt plays as a third-person shooter with quite a lot of tactical elements.\nControl your squad: You can order Adams and Lugo to attack certain targets, it is also possible to ask for a distraction in the form of a flashbang. However be mindful that in the case of them going down, you have to get your men back up.\nStay in cover: The game has a simple cover system and you definitely have to use it - or die. Thankfully the linear levels are designed with a lot of cover in mind, so you will find something to crouch behind most of the time.\nUse your environment: Sand... sand everywhere - but why not use it? Shoot windows and glass roofs to unleash a sand avalanche upon the members of The Damned or make your bullets find some explosives positioned near enemy cover.\nTo be or not to be: It's your choice - you make a call to live or let live... or do you? You get to decide between bad and worse, there isn't anything else in a war anyway... is there? Whatever you do, at the end of it, you have to go through with it and live with what you have done. You can keep telling yourself, that your hand was forced and there was no other way but is this what you really think?However, there is a big problem with all this: the movement.\nI used to play this game with mouse and keyboard, but just couldn't navigate really well from cover to cover like this and soon found a lot of bullets in my belly, so I switched to my XBOX360 controller which made moving easier but aiming all the harder. Therefore, I could only play on the lowest difficulty and still died quite a lot.\nEnhanced was this problem by the fact, that the damage you take is quite 'realistic', meaning you can endure some 3 shots at most. There is a regeneration system but it takes so much time to recover from just one graze that it makes the firefights feel like walking through instant glue.\nThis resulted in me quitting the game so many times - I could play through it, after all, mind you, but it was no fun at the beginning.\n\nThe SoundYou will get to enjoy quite nice and atmospheric music while you play - provided by Robert Darden - the Radioman of Dubai.\nThe voice acting is good but not all too good in my opinion, at times it just wasn't matching the situation however at others it perfectly did.\nBut I experienced a lot of sound bugs such as hearing my own steps behind me, noise while inside of a sandstorm - which was not resulting from it and the like. This often hurt the atmosphere and, therefor, decreased immersion.\n\nThe VerdictAt the end of the day, the game has a great anti-war attitude which is shown directly through the eyes of a high-ranking soldier suffering  and losing himself in what started as a rescue mission and ended as a suicide commando.\nNevertheless, it's being held back a lot by the gameplay, which feels poorly ported.\nIf you can live with the problems it has and manage to maneuver your squad safely through the sandy wasteland you are in for good a story.\n\nNoteIf you have read this far - thank you.\nI hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.","January 3","true","6.0"," 157 of 176 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","157","176","6","11"

It features your average modern weapons that you can see in other shooters that take place in a modern day setting: Call of Duty, Battlefield etc.\nThere is also the two gun limit like in many other modern shooters: Primary weapon / Secondary weapon.\n\nThe gameplay itself is not innovative at all. It doesn't add anything new to the genre: Shoot, take cover, shoot, run to the next cover, shoot - repeat\nYou can assign different tasks to your two squadmates but you don't need to use them THAT much...or you barely use 'em at all. The tasks themselves are quite basic: "Mark and attack that target" "Shoot that thingy over there" etc.\n\nI have to say, though, that the gameplay in The Line is very smooth and the cover mechanics are one of the best i've seen. Sprinting to cover and vaulting over cover is very smooth. The gameplay is good, fast and smooth...very well done. It's just that it doesn't add anything new.\n\nThe Story\nSpec Ops: The Line may seem like your average military shooter at first but make no mistake! It is quite the opposite.\nThe game doesn't glorify war. You may play the game for 30-40 minutes and think that it's another one of these "murika fu'k yeh" games but it's not.\nThe story will change soon and it keeps coming up with surprises till the very end of the game. I can't say much about the story without giving away spoilers but all you need to know is this: This game has a story that has NEVER been done before in the TPS/FPS genre. When it comes to video gaming then this story is an unique pearl.\nYou have to trust me on this one.\n\nAlright, let's break it down, shall we ?\n\nPros:\n+5 different endings\n+Very good voice acting\n+Very well done characters\n+Epic Story\n+Nice graphics\n+Awesome music (Hush by Deep Purple; Rooster by Alice in Chains etc)\n+Good and smooth gameplay\n+Can be challenging at times.

Unrelenting sandstorms have all but destroyed the city entirely; and the evacuation (aided by the US army) was a failure.  You go in, with your two Delta Squad buddies, to try to assess the situation and rescue any survivors.\n\nThe combat is solid, if not simple.  You take out enemies in standard over-the-shoulder shooter fashion mostly, with some ability to dish out commands to your squad members.  The atmosphere is top notch, and the visuals can be quite stunning.  The voice acting is solid, but some of the lines are cheesy in trying to be funny.  The controls are good, and the game itself is stable.  The gameplay is fun, but a little limited.  You won’t see very much variety in terms of squad commands, grenades, or guns; and can only have 2 equipped guns at a time—which fits the story but somewhat limits gameplay.  Still if you switch your weapons out here and there, picking them up from fallen foes (which you probably need to, as ammo is scarce) you can get just enough variety.\n\nOne major strong point for the game is the story.  And not just the story itself, but the way it is told.  The pacing of the story keeps you moving from one combat scene to the next, intrigued with the notion of finding out what comes next.  There are some minor decisions to be made here and there; they don’t have a major effect on the progression of the game—they more so just allow you define the character you play.  The final decisions you make, however, will determine which of several endings you will see.  (You can see all endings by replaying just the last level, no matter the other decisions you made).\n\nAnother major strong point for the game is the atmosphere.  The setting and general theme of the game are constructed quite well.  It is a bit Hollywood-style sensationalist with the sandstorms completely destroying Dubai; but at the same time it’s pretty awesome because it makes for quite a novel setting for a modern-combat game.  However, it does put a restriction on the variety of locales in the game, but that’s OK.\n\nAll in all, Spec Ops: The Line is a very well put together, story-driven, third-person shooter experience with a great setting.  Highly recommended for fans of a good story, modern-combat FPS/TPS, and a powerful atmosphere.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","December 18, 2014","true","9.0"," 114 of 130 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","114","130","2","0"

Don't be fooled by the sun reflecting off Dubai's sand dunes, this game pulls no punches in bringing the horrors of war to you.\n\nThe game plays like a standard 3rd-person cover-based shooter, but all the interesting aspects of the game simply use that as the foundation. You control a small squad as they search for what happened to the American troops that were sent to help evacuate Dubai, and slowly uncover the truth. Its all brought home by some stunning environments and incredible sound design, and the story itself challenges the player to maintain their own humanity when there's none left around them.\n\nThe campaign is quite short, but I played it through on FUBAR difficulty as I enjoyed the game so much. There are a couple of scenes where the difficulty spikes (the "Freebird" scene being the main offender!) but for most of the game it is fairly well paced.\n\nThere are plenty of twists and lots of clues as to what is going on, just sit back and enjoy the ride.

I'm extremely surprised that 2K didn't promote it more, it just popped out of nowhere without much of an explanation.\n\nThe game is a third-person cover shooter, which I thought was an odd choice given the type of game it is.  That said, it actually works very well.  While I'm not a particular fan of cover shooters, I actually enjoyed it here.  There's a decent variety of military weapons to work with along with several grenades including a sticky grenade which I'm pretty sure isn't real so I'm not sure why they included it.  It's fun to use though.\n\nGraphics are decent, nothing special.  It was designed as a console game with no special PC features so I was able to get a constant 60 FPS on a GTX 260 at max settings.\n\nThe real strength of this game is the story.  It is extremely well written, perhaps one of the best written games I have ever played.  No other military shooter comes even close.  I'm not going to give any spoilers, but it really draws you in and makes you feel part of the story.  It is a lesson to the Call of Dutys and Battlefields how a single player experience should be.\n\nThere are a few tweaks you should use to fully enjoy the game.  If you want to use keyboard+mouse like I did, you will need to visit the game forum and download an INI decrypter so you can disable the mouse acceleration (it's REALLY bad.)  Flawless Widescreen also has support for this game so you can increase the FOV.  Once you do that, the game handles very well, though the combo controls can be annoying.\n\nPick up this game when you can, you won't regret it.","June 27, 2013","true","18.5"," 74 of 79 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","74","79","0","3"

Do you want a game that leaves you satisfied, happy or fulfilled? Then don't buy this. Spec Ops: The Line will force you into the harsh truth of war.\n\nYou play as Cpt. Martin Walker, a soldier sent to investigate a distress call alongside Sgt. Lugo and Lt. Adams, only to find out something more terrifying than what any of them expected.\n\nThe story is set in a fictional Dubai where it is undergoing a state of emergency and destruction. Unlike other war games, the story has a really powerful impact on one's emotional and psychological health. There was honestly one point where I had to stop because it was all too much to handle..... It's one of the best war stories ever told in a videogame.\n\nVisuals look amazing, plus I haven't experienced any crashes or bugs and it plays really smooth. It's set in Dubai so expect lots and lots of sand, and repetetive locations. There some areas where the music feels satirical and I love it :) The ambience plays a huge role in story, so I'd say they did a pretty good job in making this game the way they intended it to be.\n\nGameplay is probably their weakest point, it's awkward and sometimes will get you in trouble. Some buttons do multiple commands, depending on where you are and what you do and it makes the gameplay confusing at times. It's definitely not enough to ruin the experience though ^_^ I recommend using a mouse and keyboard primarily because of the aiming. I'd say the game can become brutal at certain points :( I played through this on normal and was killed several times to the point where I almost rage-quitted.\n\nOverall Experience: This game was very hard for me to finish because I don't want to keep playing it, not because it's bad but because it forces you to commit atrocities and actually shows you the devastating truth. I don't feel like a hero, I feel like a monster and this game shames you for the acts you've done..... I love this game and I hope I never play it again. I highly recommend that you experience this game at least once (I'm sorry) because it's horribly amazing.\n\n","January 29, 2014","true","7.8"," 45 of 45 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","45","45","0","1"

A third-person, over-the-shoulder view. In the game you take cover, you shoot blindly or get up from your cover to shoot , and then move to a different cover. If one just goes all-out, you will be dead pretty quick, this game takes a little thinking and a wee bit of patience. Also, since the game is set in a post-cataclysmic Dubai, there is sand everywhere, including on top of buildings that have huge windows. Shoot these windows and watch the tons an tons of sand crush your enemies (even though you don't get the chance to do it that many times).\n\nThe storyline is the driving force of this game, without it, it's not pleasant to get through some levels (in my opinion).

But where this game truly shines is its storyline, and Walkers journey throughout, where you expect a standard stopping-terrorists-saving-the-world scenario, they present you with a debacle of what you are doing is actually right.\n\nThe gameplay is standard for TPS games and does not really bring too much new to the scenery and honestly gets quite boring after a while, or at least repetetive, but the game is quite short so you will not be suffering for long if you despise it...\n\nIn conclusion, buy this game if you want a game with a great plot which seems to both make a great storyline and subtely mock other games in similar genres where everything is seen from a black-white perspective.

If you've read a review of this game, it probably praises the story more than anything else, and rightfully so. Nolan North is his usual fantastic self, and the voice work of Bruce Boxleitner is always top notch. This game explores the psychology of the average military shooter protagonist and flips it on its ear and shows us how truly psychotic these people actually would be. It starts off fairly generic, but becomes something unique and special.\n\nUnfortunately, poorly designed gameplay mars the experience. There are bugs that will cause progression events to not trigger. The cover system sometimes doesn't work. Moving out of cover is dangerous because it puts you in to a sprint. Vaulting over cover requires pressing the same button that you use to melee, so you'll occassionally punch at the air above a chest high wall instead of going over it. On and on, I would run in to situations where the basic mechanics wouldn't work. I could forgive all of that if the actual shooting weren't so monotonous and boring.  The most intense fire fights become are pace killing once you realize that your best strategy is to move at a snails pace. Pop out, shoot, wait for health to regen. It's basically modern whackamole. This is a problem that these cover shooters have had for a while now, but the best games find a way to circumvent that inherent flaw. Not in this game.\n\nIn some cases it takes one second to almost die, and nearly 15 seconds to get all of your health back. So slow progression and unspired game play put together means that the actual game is boring. I honestly just wanted it to end.\n\nIf you do buy this, it is the story that will get you to finish it. However, I don't believe story is enough to save a game. Novels exist.

The game has a lot going for it, gorgeous vistas, licensed music, a villain that blurs the line of who is the villain, story choices, but the real thing Spec Ops: The Line can hang its hat on is the engrossing story. I'm not a story person, but this would make a great movie watching the story unfold. There are brief cut scenes here and there, but nothing that gets in the way of the action. You are even given choices, so there is some interactivity to the story, but the choices don't have any real impact on the story.\n\nThe story is simple, subtle and deep all at the same time, you are sent in to find what happened to a group of soldiers in the 33rd and you quickly discover in the first 10 minutes they've gone rogue. You're not just fighting inhabitants of Dubai, but US soldiers and other factions that I can't name since spoilers. Dubai itself is in a post-apocalyptic state, because it has been hit by a major sandstorm destroying the city except for pockets of civilians and soldiers. You'll come across both. There are elements where you can use the sand to defeat your enemies, such as destroying glass will send sand oceans burying enemies. There are blinding sandstorms. The game makes good use of the environment and city. You'll be in the sand oceans full of wrecked yachts, on top of towering skyscrapers, inside falling buildings and junkyards, this game has a great variety of areas. Each area is gorgeous, no matter how depressing and shambled they are. When you execute enemies at close range, you'll see the detail on their faces. A lot of detail was put into this game beyond the gorgeous scenery.\n\nSince this is a cover based over-the-shoulder shooter, it feels extremely familiar to others especially Uncharted, especially when the main character is voiced by Nolan North who played Nathan Drake in the Uncharted series. Left stick to run, right stick to aim, left trigger to aim, right trigger to fire, left button to throw something, left and right on the D-pad to cycle through your grenades, Y to change weapons (between two, but you can pick up others), X to reload, B to melee, execute downed enemies and leap over cover. Up on the D-pad will let you alt fire weapons, but its mostly forgotten about. The only unique touch to this game is the right button will command your followers. Tap the right button and Lugo will send out a flash bang that on the PC seems virtually useless. I rarely see it even effect people. Holding the right button and aiming at an enemy will have your sniper take out a long range foe, but really when I'm aiming with the right button I can literally just shoot someone myself if I'm aimed at him. On top of that, it seems like commanding your sniper doesn't work on PC when it does on PS3. The final button is of course the all purpose A button that tap it to run, hold it to run and slide to cover, standing next to cover will make you stick to cover, but really this needs a lot of work. I find my character running in and out of cover or sticking to the cover behind me instead of in front of me. It is quite frustrating and results in most of the deaths I had while playing.\n\nThe enemy AI seems smart enough and they will flank you, just like you can flank them with your squad. The enemies are similar for the most part, but with AI so good, that means every enemy can kill you. They boil down to standard soldiers, snipers, shotgunners that come to you, bladers that will run at you to knife you and heavy soldiers that walk slowly at you and take a lot of bullets to kill. Its a lot like playing the Uncharted series. You and your allies get put into big open areas with a lot of cover and you need to stay there until everyone dies. Your allies feel competent enough and will take out enemies on their own and call out things to warn you.  They will need to be resuscitated if they take too much damage, but that rarely happens and you can command the other one to bring the fallen back to life. Your teammates serve as guides without seeming too overbearing. The voice acting in the game is great and its probably an unseen high point in a game full of amazing highs.\n\nFor the most part this feels like a fun game with an incredible story, despite frustrating cover and run buttons being the same. I can't say the game is worth $30 and I'm really surprised that its not $20 yet. Get it on sale. Its worth it for the single player.","August 16, 2014","true","12.3"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","0"

I won’t give you any other detail about it, with the exception that it is one of the most intense stories I’ve heard from a game and you just have to trust me and play through it. I don’t believe that there is any other game with such an unique plot and, in terms of how good the narrative is, it can be easily placed at the same level with other good story-driven games like The Last of Us and Alan Wake, which I highly recommend if you are interested in intriguing stories. Also, it is filled with lots of action, which makes it a good choice, even if you want to play something just killing some people, but, in my opinion, if you choose to play this game without paying attention to the story, you are simply wasting your time, as probably there are other mindless shooters out there which excel at this category.\n\nThe cover system is pretty well done, even though your character will sometimes get into the wrong cover, which can instantly lead to your death if you are already being shot, especially on harder difficulties.  The AI of the squad mates sometimes made my enemies' lives easier, by going out of cover in critical situations and dying, which, combined with a hard difficulty, made it impossible for me to get my squad mate revived. Neither of the above is game breaking and, fortunately, these things rarely happen, so I can say that the gameplay itself is well polished. One thing I want to point out is that the enemy AI is pretty challenging, forcing you to take tactical approaches instead of getting out of cover and shooting everyone. Also, I feel that the sand mechanics were not used at their maximum potential and the developer could do much more with the idea.\n\nThe sound is another aspect of the game where it can be seen that the developer put a lot of effort.  The voice actors did a tremendous job, succeeding in making players easily cope with the characters. Fun fact: every single line of the script was recorded in just one day. You’ll probably think that the actors didn’t manage to do this without getting tired. Firstly, that’s the point: the developers wanted the voice acting to closely follow the game, which, with the help of the actors, they did. Secondly: you are talking about professionals. Should I mention that the main character is voiced by Nolan North, the one who was featured in games like the Uncharted series and The Last of Us? Also, the OST fits the game perfectly, giving you an adrenaline shot every time you find yourself in front of many enemies. (I have to admit that I’m into rock/metal music, but in my opinion, the music you’ll find in the game is best suited for this genre.)\n\nThe graphics are pretty amazing! Everything takes place in a post-sandstorm Dubai, which was very well represented by the developers. You get the opportunity to see a beautiful sight of the ruins of Dubai from one of its tallest buildings. Also, the great lightning effects and the attention to details makes up for some minor texture loading issues. There isn’t really anything else to complain about the graphics! I didn't experience any FPS drops, graphical artifacts or any other technical problems throughout the whole campaign.\n\nI was looking for a game with a good story and I gave this one a chance when I caught it on sale. I have to admit that I don’t regret a single penny I spent on this game and even if I had to pay the full price, I would not complain, because it is one of the few games that sent chills down my spine. So, if you are wondering whether to buy this game or not and it happens to be on sale, do yourself a favor… buy this game. I can assure you that you won’t regret it at all.","January 28, 2015","true","7.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

The thing is already apparent in the first minutes of the game. Despite the first sequence seems taken directly from the market of ideas badged Tom Clancy, the home screen instead shows an American flag upside down and a hymn US entrusted with the notes of a distorted electric guitar. The thin line of ombraUn'immagine that provides a strange impact, considering the context of a video game from the apparent military realistic tone. On the other hand, as we reported previously, the narrative model taken as inspiration by developers is not exactly trivial, since the Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. A model that is not immediately apparent from the context and from the action of the game (aside direct references such as the name of Colonel Konrad, a sort of mix between the writer's name and that of Kurtz, from the same book), but that plan emerges plan, as covered by sand windy, when we realize that the mission of recovering the Colonel turns into something different and deeper, reflective, like a voyage of discovery and formation within a wild environment that has lost all its landmarks, returning to the primeval chaos. The thin line of ombraUn strange place where the misery of survival lies between jewels and opulent furnishings, the legacy of a rich and hedonistic humanity on which nature has returned to take over, throwing strong man into chaos. Then you realize that crossing the desert ruins (but not empty) is really "like taking a trip back in time, to the beginning of the world" and that "in the warm, thick and heavy", as in the book of Conrad, "There is joy in the shine of the sun." The experiment of Yager, as a shooter in the third person from entering the structure on a substrate rather mainstream narrative has a certain importance and originality, he certainly succeeded.","April 29, 2015","true","39.6"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","36","49","2","0"

What, on the outside, looks like a game about three hardened delta force commandos shooting up brown people in another sandy Middle Eastern hell hole defies outward appearances and proves to be a bit more clever and surprising. Given the fact that the earlier entries in the Spec Ops franchise preoccupied themselves with cut and dry tactical military action you would be forgiven for making such an assertion.\n\nThe game opens with a bombastic set piece that seems to have been ripped out of Call Of Duty. It looks like a deleted scene from True Lies, with your character manning a mini gun, shredding lesser enemy helicopters between the sky scrappers of Dubai. You shoot through large glass walls at choppers on the opposite sides of buildings, one unfortunate bird smashes into a crane as things are constantly going boom. It's what we have come to expect from this kind of game. The sequence ends and you flash back to the beginning of the sequence of events that led to that point. No surprises so far. You play as Walker, a Delta Force operative (voiced by Nolan North of Uncharted fame) and are accompanied by Adams and Lugo, your trusty wing men, on a mission to rescue the people of Dubai and locate Colonel John Konrad. The narrative is loosely based on Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and it takes a lot of cues from Frances Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, which is also based on Conrad's novella.\n\nThe not-so-unusual set up is followed up with some not-so-unusual third person cover based shooting as the game introduces you to Dubai and your squad mates. The shooting mechanics work well enough. You take cover, blind fire, pop out of cover to take precise shots, order squad mates to throw flash bangs and attack. Left to their own devices, Lugo and Adams prove themselves to be competent. They will kill enemies and they generally stay out of your way and make an effort to preserve themselves. It's very refreshing to have AI squad mates that do more than shout, “Reloading!” and “Stay frosty!” every five seconds. In short order, the first wrinkle to otherwise not-so-unusual formula is introduced—environment based attacks. You will find the sandstorm has left mounds of sand heaped behind fragile barriers that can be destroyed in an effort to bury your foes. These environmental advantages are sprinkled throughout the campaign and really brings the setting to life. Engulfing enemies in sand isn't enough to warrant playing any game, but from here Spec Ops only gets more interesting. The second major deviation this game makes is placing you in the middle of moral dilemmas. These sections don't have any lasting effects on the game's narrative but act as a means of reinforcing the game's themes. These are not about playing a “good” soldier or a “bad” soldier but rather having to make a choice you may not want to make. Making these choices strips any pretense of being a bad ♥♥♥ hero, they remind you that you can't save the the day all of the time and sometimes you might not be able to save anything at all...\n\nOne of the most uninspiring and unappealing aspects of modern military shooters is the art direction. I can only wade through so many brown mud huts, gray warehouses made out of tin and steel, and dilapidated villages before I want to gouge my eyes out. In spite of all of the sand, Spec Ops offsets the sandy, sun baked sections with vibrant, colorful interiors. You wade through seas of abandoned cars on highways, blast your way through luxury hotels, crawl out of the apocalyptic center of the city, and bounce across glass filled rooftops. Dubai, as depicted in Spec Ops, is a surreal place. The art style lends itself to the narrative—more specifically the character's mental states. What you see may or may not be real. The characters themselves are detailed and they become more haggard and war torn as the game progresses, animations are altered a bit to reflect the change in characters. There are some visual metaphors sprinkled about if you pay attention (and you should) to the detailed and engaging setting. It's not the technical marvel that the more recent Battlefield games are but the art direction makes this infinitely more interesting to behold.\n\nAlso the soundtrack deserves special attention. Dubai has also been rigged with speakers and a DJ, known as The Radioman, is broadcasting throughout the city. He sounds like an aging hippie and the music he plays kind of reflects this. Did you ever think you would have a shoot out in a modern military game while Deep Purple's Hush plays in the background? What about Martha and the Vandellas Nowhere to Run? It's fantastic. The juxtaposition of these tunes with the violence of the gun play creates and truly unsettling tone. It seems really obvious that Apocalypse Now was a huge influence on this aspect of the game. There are also some noteworthy ambient, largely guitar-based compositions that sew together the sections of the game that don't have licensed tunes playing in a cohesive manner. The voice acting is also commendable and the writing is very self aware of genre tropes and plays off of them. The whole game centers around critiquing and in some ways defying what you have come to expect from other games in this genre. You won't play anything like it.\n\nWhat sets Spec Ops back, and is likely to turn off most gamers, is its short length. It is completable in a single sitting and most players will clock in about five to eight hours depending on skill level. The moral dilemmas are not designed to alter the game but rather to set the tone for your play through and experiencing their different outcomes really doesn't extend the game play experience in any meaningful way. Spec Ops was clearly designed as a single player experience and the multiplayer is best ignored altogether. Playing the game in co-op will only further shorten the experience. It's a shame that completing the main single player experience doesn't unlock bite sized missions or episodes from your squad's past. Given that PTSD and war induced stress are huge themes it would have been an appropriate way to add to the game's content without artificially extending the main campaign.\n\nSpec Ops is one of the most mature and interesting games of the year. It is an experience. One unlike any other in terms of the way the game mechanics reinforce the themes and concepts put forth by the narrative. It should be on your radar but don't expect to put dozens of hours into it. In terms of gameplay it's competent rather than exceptional, but where it excels is where other games in its genre need to take a hard look at what they are doing. Games like Spec Ops and Bioshock will be important examples in video game history for integrating gameplay mechanics with narrative themes. This alone makes it worth playing and possibly revisiting in a few years time.","January 18, 2014","true","11.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","3"

The graphics were truly amazing. Game play was stellar third person shooter action with plenty of weapons and grenades. One thing that did annoy me was the game persists on telling you the xbox controls even if you are using a keyboard/mouse. I would normally play third person games with a controller but found this to be a lot easier to handle with a mouse.\n\nThe story on Spec Ops is one of the best I've played. You get a real feel of desperation towards the game and you can really make a difference to the outcome with the choices you make.\n\nHighly recommended, what are you waiting for?

The game play is 3rd person, coverage based shooting. Its good, not great....just good. The atmosphere is great in the sense that ammo is scarce and you have to constantly switch between your weapon and the weapons your enemies drop. This creates a fun conflict within the gamer, "do I hold onto this gun I really like, with very little ammo? Or take the downgrade with more ammo?"\n\nWhere this game truly excels though is in the arena of story telling. Story telling and character development being two things that seem to escape the vast majority of today's writers of games, TV and movies. The game is a roller coaster of conflict, internal and external. It follows 3 Delta Squad operators as they make decisions (most of which have potentially horrific backlash) most people would be too afraid to make.\n\nOne of the game's central themes is a subject that we in America seem to shy away from. Shell-Shock, or as the modern "news" media has ordered you to call it "post traumatic stress disorder," and the terrifying physical and psychological effects it can have on these young men that our "leaders" send half way around the world. You watch as the humanity of these young men is completely burned away as they become hardened killers, despite the desire to just leave and go home.\n\nOne character for example, goes from a happy go lucky jokester,  to having a near breakdown from the consequences of his, and more importantly YOUR, actions. This may sound difficult for a game to pull off in a believable manner, and that's because it is. Most writers would have dropped the ball on this subject so hard the ball would have fallen right though the crust and mantle of the Earth. But Spec Ops handles this very smoothly and paces his evolution (or devolutions, depends on how you view it) in a way that it feels very organic and genuine.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking for a well told story about the horrors of war.","January 4, 2014","true","22.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","2"

It starts like a generic shooter.\nThen it transforms to something... Different. Unique. It kicks you in the balls and doesn't let you get up.\nThe game reminds me Kane & Lynch: Dead Man. Both games are typical third person shooters, with\nself regenerating health, cover systems and dynamic camera. But their story makes them unique.\nWhat is this game about? Basicly it's a adaptation of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'.\nIt starts as a story about 3 commando soldiers on a rescue mission in Dubai.\nBecause of misunderstanding and coincidence it turns to something much worse.\nIn my opinion it's a game about war crime, about sacrificing morality or humanity for accomplishing your goals.\nIt shows how easy war can change into total massacre because of small factors.\nYou should play SO:TL and interpret it for yourself.\nGraphically the game is really OK, mostly because of original location and beautiful map design.\nWhat's really important - the game is very detailed. As our characters get deeper and deeper into Dubai conflict\nthey are changing both physically and mentally. They're getting wounds, their equipment is getting damaged, they speak and act differently. They are even executing the enemies with more aggression and hate. Even the tips showing during the loading screens are becoming cynical. The game itself is criticising your actions, it oftens breaks the 4th wall.\nThe shooting mechanics are good, same as the camera. I didn't have any problems with the technical aspects of the game. What makes the game even better is the soundtrack. It suits every single scene in the game, and makes me want to listen it even after the game. If you've watched 'Apocalypse Now' - you'll feel familliar.\n\nTry it. You will get suprised, how this seemingly generic shooter is going to shock you. It's brilliant.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/50300/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Spec-Ops: The Line is a squad-based third-person shooter, but really this is just a cover-up. The game is actually an experimental arthouse game that tries to challenge conventions of the modern game industry, narrative, and ask the player what they really want from games.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is the 11th game in the Spec-Ops series, but you'd be forgiven for not knowing that, as the series wasn't particularly great and hadn't had a new entry in its series in over 10 years before this game came along. However, Spec-Ops: The Line is more of a stand-alone game, and you need no knowledge of the previous Spec-Ops games to enjoy it.\n\nYou play as Captain Martin Walker, who comes into the town of Dubai under fictional settings that its been ravaged and left for dead by rampant sand storms and riots in the town. A US team, known as the 33rd, was sent there to help keep things under control. The last the city and the 33rd team were recorded doing was trying to form a caravan to help save the survivors of the city. However, all contact was lost, and the city was declared a no-mans land, with access to the city barred off by the UAE government.\n\nOur main character, Walker, comes in with a small team, with the only other members being Lieutenant Alphonse Adams and Staff Sergeant John Lugo. Walker has a personal stake in all of this... The leader of the 33rd, Colonel John Konrad, is a personal hero of his, someone who saved his life on the battlefield. This man changed Walker's life, and is the sort of man Walker inspires to be. So when a communication message from Lugo gets out, he takes on the mission very personally, and is determined to do whatever it takes to save him.\n\nSpec-Ops: The Line is a very beautiful game. Countless scenes and imagery are backed by fantastic artistic design, and one sometimes can't help but to just sit-back and appreciate the aesthetics of it all. The characters are well animated, the effects of things like sand and water are impressive, there are some gorgeous overlooks of the city at various points in the game, and visually stimulating environments that range from theaters to malls to aquariums to the natural desert itself.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very stimulating. The game features a variety of licensed music, ranging from Hush by Deep Purple to Star Spangled Banner by Jimi Hendrix. The original soundtrack is also rather interesting, featuring rather ethereal sounds, industrial, and pseudo-rock to home in the tones of each scene. The voicing is handled fantastically, and fits each character rather perfectly.\n\nBut there is something looming over Spec-Ops: The Line almost the entire time that may turn off a lot of people. The game isn't really all that fun to play. It's serviceable and not badly made, but something about it makes the gameplay never really a fun experience. And as odd as it may sound, I think this is what the developers were going for. There comes a tedium to the combat, a sort of unfeeling to it all. It can be a struggle at times, and there are some moments that are really cool from a visual stand-point and conceptually so, but it still somehow remains unfun.\n\nAlso as someone who played the whole game on hard difficulty, I recommend you do not. I usually play games on the hardest difficulty available as I find it fun to be challenged, but in the case of Spec-Ops I'd argue it actually actively worked to try and make me enjoy the game less. I wasn't having fun with the harder challenges, it didn't feel satisfying to overcome difficult segments, and it caused me to repeat several segments over-and-over again, and not in a way that it was enjoyable.\n\nBut I'd still say Spec-Ops is worth experiencing. While the game poses as a third-person shooter, and there is definitely third-person shooter gameplay here, that isn't at the same time really what the game is or is about. Talking about Spec-Ops is difficult, as I believe it is best to go into it without knowing almost anything at all. But at the same time, there is a tedium, a drudgery to pull through in the game.And that arguably is part of the game, and is part of the point of the game and its themes. Spec-Ops has a lot of thought put into it, and is a case where the narrative, atmosphere, and overall experience is much stronger than the gameplay.\n\nHere's an odd analogy; This game is essentially to Shooters what Silent Hill is to Survival-Horror or Braid is to platformers. The games are well-made, but gameplay isn't the focus. Other elements take the lead, and the games have rather strong emphasis on its other elements. The gameplay without these other elements is arguably rather lackluster, or kind of tedious. But with the other elements, the games rise from this to become a rather interesting experience in game form. Some may never see the enjoyment of a game that isn't fun to play from a gameplay perspective, but if you can, there is a lot to love in Spec-Ops: The Line.\n\nIt's depressing, sometimes hard to swallow, and you may not honestly understand everything the first time you play it. However, it is likely to stick with you, and really delves into a sort of symbolic social message on shooters and war, and how the general public see's it. It's not very fun, but Spec-Ops is still an experience worth undertaking.","May 14, 2014","true","11.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

To follow orders or go against them. By the end of it all, are you done serving your country?\n\nBrief game summary:\nYou play as Captain Martin Walker who is accompanied by a Delta Force team sent to Dubai to rescue civilian survivors. But as you progress through the game, you are faced with betrayal, horror, hallucinations, and a heck load of sand which forces you to make moral decisions. Ultimately, whichever decision you make, you'll have to live with it. As you spiral down the horrors of war, your fellow squad mates will react differently to your chosen paths.\n\nReview:\nThis game takes on a perspective where you place yourself in the shoes of a soldier tasked on a rescue mission. Throughout the game, you'll be faced with moral dilemmas, just like the trolly effect, and you will have to choose your own path.\nI really like the story line (hands down, the best story line I have ever seen) and the combat in it was entertaining enough. You have to use your environment, which is sand, to your advantage. Your 2 squad mates, unlike other game bots, are very effective. You are literally in control of the outcome of the game. #1 PTSD simulator.\n-Storyline: 11/10 (Hit me right in the feels)\n-Gameplay: 8.5/10\n-Combat: 8.5/10\n-Graphics: 9/10\n-Sand: infinity\nEDIT: Finally completed the game and will very likely be playing it again. Storyline again, is beyond phenominal which also made an impact on me while playing--had to take breaks in between because it got really intense after a few unfortunate  events where it made me feel like sh*t. won't spoil it for the unlucky people who haven't played yet. Unlike other war games, this game takes you on a different perspective, you experience the horrors of war, the aftermath of war, the PTSD experience, and most importantly, it forces you to make unspeakable decisions under very stressful circumstances, in which you would have to deal with the consequences of your actions.\n\nI can definitely say that if you were Anakin Skywalker, you will probably sit this game out. But you're not Anakin! Sand doesn't scare you! So what are you waiting for? There's a demo for you to try, however it'll probably end before you even get to the good parts. Or even better, you can just get the game during a sale and experience it yourself.\n\nIn the end, do you choose to save a fellow brother in war? Or do you finish what you were sent to do?","May 17","true","10.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","1"

I finished this game twice to make sure I got the facts and the story straight.\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nDo you feel like a hero yet?, this is tag line that will haunt you all throughout the story of Spec Ops the Line.\n\nAt first glance this game looks like your average American Action War Hero game much like most modern day military shooters but it's not, its something else.\n\nPROS:\n+ Great story and unexpected plot: -Most games glorifies war and conflict but this game oddly focuses (in a good way) on the horrors of it. It takes unexpected twist that makes you question all the decision's you've made through the game. Gameplay wise (see Cons) you can call it generic, the thing that carries this game however, is the story.\n\n+ Graphically pleasing: -Given that most games right now has stunning visuals, this is unique in it's own right, adding small details such as sweat, grime and atmosphere makes into a nice experience.\n\n+ Sound : -Very nice voice acting that draws you into the story.\n\n+ Healthy Game Time: -Not too long, not too short, it doesn’t overstay it's welcome but long enough to make the price tag reasonable.\n\nCONS:\n- Gameplay: -Aside from the added "sand" feature, it's a generic 3rd person cover based shooting game much like Gears of War.\n\n- AI (both allies and enemy): -Some parts of the game, your allies act like real Special Forces, but in some parts they act like a clueless kid playing a multiplayer match. The game artificially increases the challenge by enemy numbers and bullet damage, but does nothing to improve the enemy AI's survivability. Would have been nice if they properly used cover and flanking moves (like FEAR 1).\n\nConclusion:\nGREAT GAME for someone looking for a good story and plot, Spec Ops The Line has that movie "Apocalypse Now" feel to it.\n\nNOT for people who are looking for a Gung Ho, Rambo, "look at me I'm the best" storyline. For that I can recommend something else.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

That story could have been told in any medium and any genre of game and it would still be phenomenal. Don't read about it if you still haven't, just get the game and follow through and enjoy.\n\nOnce done, try not to overthink it, a lot of critics are all over it already, just feel for yourself the impact it makes. You'll be able to talk about that game with anyone who played it for quite a while.","August 2, 2015","true","21.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","2"

Then you shrug it off and do it a few hundred more times. You beat the game, you do something else, the shock forgotten.\nI've been there.\n\nSo I wasn't expecting much from Spec Ops: The Line, a game I'd heard had a deep and moving story and would mess you up. I thought maybe there'd be a lame twist, a heavy-handed moral, and then a shock ending that would leave me nonplussed. Honestly, for the first half of the game, I thought I was right. I felt like everything was progressing naturally, that I would wind up disappointed. I even got sick of the game about halfway through and left for a while.\n\nI'm glad I finished it, though. Here's why.\n\nSpec Ops drops you into the sandy combat boots of Captain Walker, a man with a gun and a couple of companions. Seems about par for gaming. Two squadmates, one a heavy gunner with explosives and one a long-range specialist. Average.\nIt prods you through a few levels, and I have to say that's one thing Spec Ops never disappointed me in: these levels are great. They're full of color and design variety, and I actually stopped and looked around admiring the view whenever the combat would let up.\nWhich lets me segue into a quick point before I get back to the main one: Spec Ops: The Line is very by-the-numbers, as far as the actual combat mechanics go. Two guns, some grenades, the lightest of squad-command mechanics, a cover system, and waves and waves of enemies to shoot. It never progresses, save for dropping you into a couple on-rails segments, and it's the only real flaw I have with the game.\n\nThat said, about halfway or so through, I was just about done. I'd shot some people in the head, shot some more people in the head, shot some people I wasn't sure I should be shooting in the head, walked through beautiful landscapes and disgusting squalor and I'd seen some serious ♥♥♥♥.\nI was about done.\nThe game was dragging, and then it led me to a slightly-different segment. I won't go on about it, but I thought it was pretty boring and I guessed what was about to happen. I was right, but I wasn't prepared. It finally shocked me, and my character's expression mirrored my own. I tuned out everything else. I was thoroughly engrossed and a little bit repulsed. I took a break for a while, letting everything sink in, and I set off again on my trail of shooting people in the head.\n\nThe game funneled me through wave after wave of enemies, punctuated by comments from other characters and general story beats. It was fun, I had the right emotions, I was in the groove.\nWhen I got to the final levels, major ♥♥♥♥ was going down. I was pumped. Bad things happened. I got to the end.\nThe game threw me for a loop, and I was forced to reflect on a new reality.\nI faced the last of a few major moral choices.\n\nI made my choice.\nThe credits rolled. A song played. I sat back in my chair, stunned.\nHad all that really just happened? Had a video game just done all that?\nNot all of it made sense. Not all of it had to. That was the point.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line had caused me to think, it had caused me to feel, it had caused me to reflect on my actions in a video game. Had that happened before? Surely. Of course it had. But Spec Ops did it in a unique way, and I want to congratulate it.\nThe writing throughout was top-notch, set the mood, and progressed the story. The characters were fleshed out, deep, and believable.\nI also give a nod to the soundtrack, with various tracks all ready to pump you up, get you in the mood, and keep you heading forward.\n\nDo I recommend Spec Ops: The Line? Yes. It's full of gore, guns, explosions, and buff men. It has you shooting people in the desert, it's got on-rails sequences.\n\nEven with all that, it's still unique. It's still full of heart, or soul, or charisma.\nIt's not without flaws, of course. It is, however, worth playing.\n\n9/10","January 12, 2013","true","16.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","5"

At first glance this game looks like the average shooter with no meaning what so ever but this is not the case. Spec Ops: The Line is a deep emotional ride through the mind of one man in dire situations. This games story kept me enthralled and entertained at all times. The story takes a few chapters to piece itself together but after a few painless chapters it comes together.\n\nVisuals - This game isnt the newest game on the block but there is no lack of beautiful vistas and cut scenes. The characters transition from the begining to end is all envolping in facial features and body language. Nothing short of awe is captured from start to finish in the vast vibrant yet desolate Dubai. I ran the game on ultra with absolutley no hicups.\n\nGameplay - The line, to me, leaves something to be desired in this department. While the shooting and such serves its purpose it feels somewhat hollow. Now don't get me wrong when it comes down to it there are some scenes where it is down right awesome but i think that comes more from the visuals and story and not so much the game mechanics itself. I found myself missing environmentals and just running through waves of hollowed "baddies" to progress the amazing story. If i had to compare the gameplay itself id say its not all to disimilar to Army Of Two (1).\n\nOverall this game is overlooked all too often and should be taken seriously for the heavy amazing story that ensues. I give this game a  4.5/5\n","June 22, 2014","true","6.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The multiplayer is essentially a miss, the gunplay is somewhat formulaic, and the controls have a bit of a snag, but it is a great return to the franchise.Were it not for some technical issues and console-related shortcomings, Spec Ops: The Line would be one of the best games for 2012. But, things being as they are, it remains merely a diamond in the rough, destined for wicked crazy status within the following years. Spec Ops: The Line proves that, with a steady vision and soul, a genre so clichéd like military shooters, can not only surprise us pleasantly, but totally overwhelm us. A solid third-person shooter that delivers intense action and a compelling setting, but relies too much on established mechanics, rather than delivering something new. The story however really stands out - a grim and challenging reflection on violence is something you won't find in any typical shooter. Fortunately it's also missing that dull patriotism you've come to expect from today's military action games.It truly deserves applause for the courage to confront us so harshly with our own character, even if our choices sometimes seem forced or useless. Spec Ops: The Line tries new and interesting ground on storytelling, but falls short on the action department. Still, it's worth playing through for the atmosphere and few different endings alone.","May 14, 2014","true","252.1"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

But once you get a couple of hours in the game, the story goes deeper, especially into the characters. Once you reach the last act of the game, the game seems very confusing, but all is explained with its amazing ending. It's a must have for its amazing story.

It's one of the best games I've ever played, and it's one of the rare games that I know I'll still be remembering in 10+ years. I've played it when it came out (2012) and I still shiver whenever I read about it or hear the soundtrack.\n\nA few things to consider just so you're not disappointed :\n\n1) You're buying this for the SP campaign. MP isn't great.\n2) The campaign is maybe 7 hours long. It's the perfect length for this kind of game.\n3) Since the game is "short", I HIGHLY recommend trying to beat the game in a short period of time. Ideally in 2-3 sessions, unless you're willing to clear it in a single sitting which I'd recommend if you can. The story is intense and can be quite confusing, so waiting weeks between 2 gaming sessions could have a negative impact on your appreciation.\n4) Don't read anything / watch anything about the story or pretty much anything about this game before playing (even some reviews). Spoilers would ruin it.\n5) Don't give up on it too early because the first hour or so is average at best.\n6) Should be obvious but anyway, make sure to play with sound on (music, sound effects, voice acting). It's not a game you want to play while the TV is on or while talking on Skype.\n7) Pay attention to the little details. Hints : Title screen, voice acting, flow of the game, etc. This is part of why it's a masterpiece in my opinion.\n8) If you're not great at shooters, don't hesitate to play at an easier difficulty. Seriously you're not playing this for the challenge / gameplay. Some parts near the end can be annoying, and there's no real point in playing this at a difficulty where you'll have to restart often. Just make sure you're comfortable for the ride and enjoy it.","November 13, 2015","true","11.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I was conflicted about the storyline and content, as it's a game that it's nearly possible to complete in good conscience. Spec Ops : The Line is a common 3rd person military shooter in a lot of ways, save one : Its narrative. Some will find this game to be overly preachy, but having completed the campaign I think I know what the developers were going for.\n\nMilitary games of the last few years have shown players a lot of things. New graphics, firearms, and storylines that encompass many historical geopolitical campaigns. Spec Ops intends to show players something they've never been forced to confront. Themselves. In many ways, it's incredibly difficult to put a rating on this game as it's mediocre gameplay is carried by the narrative and (more importantly) the narrative's intent. It's also difficult to avoid spoiling as this is a game you will only experience the first time once. (duh) But the first time will be a troubling journey. During this game you will do horrific things simply because the objectives say so. The developers prod at you by saying "Just because the objectives dictate you should, doesn't mean you have to. You could simply turn the game off." In this way, Spec Ops is more of a mirror than anything. It puts a storyline in place which makes you angry, frustrated, and saddened by what transpires. It then steps back and allows you your chance at revenge. Sure, you're railroaded from a gameplay standpoint but as the Colonel says near the middle of the story, "This could have all been avoided if you just stopped."\n\nHe's right. I could have stopped at any point. Spec Ops features imagery that is horrifying; war crimes are committed and witnessed in plenty. Yet you keep playing simply to make it all justified, to somehow convince yourself that the ends will justify the means and that everything will come out ok. It's not your fault. You were forced. In the end Spec Ops : The Line was the first game I've ever completed that I didn't feel happy about finishing.  Not because the gameplay was bad, but simply because no one with a conscience can finish this game without feeling dirty. I should have stopped somewhere in the middle of the game, and said, "Nope, this objective has gone too far. ♥♥♥♥ this game." But I didn't.\n\nMy impressions of this game are almost the same as though I were reviewing A Clockwork Orange or Inglorious Basterds. You're not supposed to feel comfortable while you watch. Spec Ops is a bit different though, as you're in control of the "ultra violence" that's taking place. Maybe it's because I grew up in a violent neighborhood, where actions were always justified by their ends that this game hit me so deeply, maybe I'm just soft. In any case, if you've been on the fence about Spec Ops I'd strongly recommend a purchase based solely on its interperative value as it stands apart simply by having something to say about combat and war. I've been scratching my head about the ending all evening.\n\n9/10","June 24, 2014","true","9.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Even though the game is fairly linear - with little decision making in terms of the events unfolding - it still instills a sense of freedom as to how you choose to go about it.\n\nThe game is clearly trying to grapple with the moral choices during times of war and battle, survival and necessities and in many ways it succeeds quite well.\n\nThe setting and graphics are both very nice, while the locations are well thought out and quite detailed. The story (while nothing to jump out of your clothes for) drives you forward quite well, more than anything because it succeeds in instilling the feeling that you have to move on, that there is no choice but to move on...\n\nThere isnt extraordinary variety in the weapons and most dont feel much diferent between them, but the momentum of the game doesnt really allow you to think about it much. You mostly grab whatever weapon you have some ammo for.\n\nI played it at the hard settings, which in some situations challenged me, but was overall an enjoyable experience (I believe normal dificulty might be a bit too easy).\n\nFinally there are a few points in the game where your (moral) decisions affect [if only partially] how the game unfolds.\n\nAll in all it is a very nice story driven third person shooter, full of intense moments of combat. Not sure if there is a lot of replayability, unless you are after all the achievements, but I can see myself going back and playing it all over again.","December 8, 2015","true","13.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","2"

A conflict of ethics and code of conduct. What's the importance between one's conscious and one's choice just to survive. Spec Ops: The Line define such philosophies. The game's narrative is one of the most memorable in video game history as modern first-person shooters are too mainstream and cliche. There are certain scenes in the game that might or will make you pause, reflect, or even quit the game just to remind yourself on what war is. However, Spec Ops: The Line is NOT an anti-war game. It just tell what war is like. Many people and gamers can compare this game to Apocalypse Now. Sure, that's comparable but the game can be interpret to many literatures and certain documentaries like Waltz of Bashir. The gameplay is decent and typical but I believe that the developers strongly focused a lot more on the story and its message rather than gameplay. Spec Ops: The Line is a memorable game, but its more of the "one-time play" game mainly because of its heavy subject matter. Would I recommend this game to others? Yes, but it is up to you if you can handle the game's content.

It's crazy. And this game displays exactly that very, very well. You can behead people with sniper rifle, pop their heads off with a shotgun and turn them into bloody giblets with explosives.\n\nBut that's not the reason you play this game, no. The gameplay is very mediocre 6-7/10 as one would rate it. It's the story that keeps you wanting to play and find out what happens next more than anything. The characters are all well crafted into believable and realistic feeling experience as you play the game and advance within the story. The witty comments, yelling in combat and the terror is all well displayed and feels authentic. The soldiers you fight against yell orders loud and clear, just like you would in combat to relay the info. The game just feels right atmosphere wise.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that displays how f*cked up a war can be when there's no clear answers, and how it can affect your morale and choice making, and how ruthless some things you must decide on can make you feel like a complete d*ck for doing so. This game extremely well relays the weight of your choices, if you f*ck up, you will feel and see what it will cause.\n\nA must buy to people who want to experience something different, and enjoy a really well made story.","January 2, 2015","true","13.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","3"

But it is only an envelope which brings you emotionally affluent, strong message. Message about soldiers, war exhaustion and very basic one - about role of destruction in our system of values.\n\nFor a gameplay Yager offers you a railroad shooter with a bit of squad support. If you seek a glorious, challenging gunplay - look the other way, that's not about Spec Ops the Line. For some reason, the most of the action feels like you were shell-shocked from the start of the game. Shooting part not really engaging. Two big notes about AI:\n1) your companions are not that bad, as you can expect, playing in games like Bureau: XCom Declassified or Battlefield3. They scoring kills, and it feels like in normal difficulty setting they can bend opposers almost without your support. If only they were not rushing forward before it's clear sometimes, I'd say they are a perfect team.\n2) Quite opposite, behavior of your enemies usually is quite weak from the point of battle effectiveness. Even in the hardest difficulty setting where they shoot very precisely, and you dying alot being both outnumbered and outgunned... Still they a prey, and you are the hunter. You mow them, in dozens and hundreds.\n\nBeing quite a mundane FPS, Spec Ops the Line offers a rather spanning visual experience, though. Sights of Dubai, all those sand and weather features are gorgeous. Impression when you destroying something to let another portion of sand, symbolizing chaos, gets even more space over a once-a-great-city... Can't buy it with mastercard, obviously.\nAnd music! Music part is fabulous. Maybe the best part of whole game.\nOverall, an artwork, audio and visual feast, all of this combined - is what keeping your interest, where the rush for gunplay challenge leaving you.\n\nBut again, all of that - gunplay, visuals and one of a kind soundtrack - still just a cover for story with guaranteed catharsis in the end. For that Spec Ops the Line is taking such inordinanar reviews, like "take a PTSD in 6 hours. 10/10!" That game Will Be Remembered.\nStory what starts like "Only the dead have seen the end of war", and goes with "I destroy therefore I endure". What we observe as happening with the protagonist, Erich Fromm called "splendid isolation". This philosopher was describing destructiveness as a defence mechanism to preserve a human integrity, which is offended by some unexpected trials. That mechanism never working like you're expecting. See the game for it.\n\nOverall mark 7.5/10 killed Americans","August 1, 2015","true","62.6"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","19","29","3","4"

You shouldn't go into this game for gameplay, it isn't anything new but it works perfectly fine with guns being relatively fun to use and enemies having good AI. At times you will find yourself dying a little too quick while some enemies feel like bullet sponges, but that's about right considering how little you wear while they are fully armoured. Now that we're done with the gameplay, the story is the real hook to buying this game. You will find yourself in a gripping story where you are put though many different situations to test your morality, most of which are no win scenarios and give no obvious good choices making you feel worse the more you play. The game is not black and white but rather the complete opposite with the game itself questioning you on whether or not you're really the hero as you fight your way through an entire army in order to find Konrad and end the nightmare he brought to Dubai when him and his soldiers were unable to evacuate this forgotten city. As the game progresses both you and the main protagonist will start to question what's really happening and your current mental state until you reach the ending which left me in such shock that I was left speechless and felt the need to replay the final mission numerous times to see all the endings. I personally felt dead inside after my first run. By the end of my experience I encountered so many twists and turns I didnt know what to expect next and after everything was over, I wanted to go back through the game and make different decisions from my first run to see how my teammates, myself and how everyone around me would react. Overall This was the ultimate video game narrative I've ever experienced and found it more than worth my time, this game took me about 8 hrs to complete due to some moments that took me a few too many tries, keeping it from being fun at all times, but for most people this shouldn't be much longer than 6 hrs though for most who play it on normal difficulty. I found that this game's length was excusable due to the fact that it was so immersive it felt at least twice as long.

I would surely recommend this game to every one who likes action games or who like a game that touches you.\n\nIs it worth buying right now?\n\nThis is a though one... I would say yes cause it is such a good game but when I look to the price tagg (20€) then I also think about the fact that I finished the game in 4.5 hours... If you do not like multiplayer or co-op there is nothing much to do after you completed the game. And from what I hear and see MP and Co-Op are dead... You should have played this game but since it is such a short game I would wait untill the price drops. Do not get me wrong it is a very good game and many people will say that it is worth 20€. Let me say it this way: If the campaign would have taken at least 8-9 hours to complete it I would say Yes buy it right now! But it is not like that and thats a shame cause it is really a good game. Damn I really would like to say to hell with it, buy the game right now! But I can't.","April 27, 2014","true","4.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Also note that I didn't try the multiplayer and I'm only going to comment on the single player campaign.\n\nThe game presents a well-crafted story that starts out as a mission to scout the city of Dubai as it suffers from the destruction caused by a gigantic sand storm. Civilians are trapped inside mile high dunes of sands after the military lost contact to a former evacuation squad and they send Martin Walker and two companions to investigate after they received a distress signal. The deeper the squad dives into the city, the more gruesome events get. You witness atrocities done by American soldiers who lost track of their goal as the horrible story of the fallen Dubai unfolds with your discoveries and the game doesn't hesitate to shock you when it wants you to see what terrifying things people can do in a struggle for survival. (if you don't have a thick skin, you might want to plan to take breaks)\n\nIf it weren't for the story, the game would be forgettable, and that is the biggest danger if you don't know it yet - those who don't know what to expect will easily lose interest. The shooting itself plays well enough to work - there's cover-based shooting with various real-life weapons, there are melee attacks and finishers, a small selection of squad commands, you can sometimes destroy terrain to take out clusters of foes with sand dunes. There's not much traditional gameplay evolution, except that the selection of weapons grows as some weapons only appear later in the game.\n\nIf you ONLY come for the shooting, you will most likely be disappointed or even confused through the first couple of chapters. If you want to give this game a fair chance, keep on playing until the end of Chapter 8 at least. If you get there and still only come for the shooting, but want to give the game a chance nevertheless, start over again and pay close attention to the dialog and try to think about the twists that happen in the beginning of the game, which are admittedly a little hard to follow the first time around.\n\nA word about the length of the game: The play time is rather short (I beat the game in 6 hours on easiest difficulty.. there is a reason you don't want to turn up the difficulty in the late game, which I leave up to you to find out), but if you get into it, it probably won't let you go for a while, especially since many discussions on the internet send you away with spoiler warnings right away. Once you've played through the game and see the revelations, you will want to play it again to see things in a different light. If you find yourself in an obsession about the meaning of the game, a good reading after you finish it is "Killing is Harmless" by Brendan Keogh. It's an affordable eBook that expands on a lot of details that you will easily miss on a casual playthrough. It links a good amount of articles on the internet, some of which include stances by the developers and lead writer. My Steam profile says I've played this game for only 16 hours, but I spent well over 30 hours reading up and watching on YouTube on what others thought about it.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line deserves more attention for the sheer courage the developer showed for demonstrating such a cruelly honest truth through a video game, and I recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone who likes unconventional games. It makes you think about the nature of good and evil and takes a harsh stance on recent topics like Western military interventionism and the cruelty of modern warfare. It made me think for long, and it pulled something off that is impossible to do with a book or a movie. I want more people to play this game, because it deserves to be talked about, but can't be talked about unless you've given it at least one complete playthrough.","October 3, 2014","true","15.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

It was a bit slow from the beginning as I waited for the hyped morale choices and desert sandstorm environment to deliver. This game was not packed full of morale choices with quick action decisions. thier was a few. their was also a couple of sand storm scenes. Both of these have been way overblown. Almost gave up on this in the first hour as it seemed ,just another shooter with some age old gears of war cover mechanics. Kept playing and have to say it got much better as far as shooters go. the story was really good and although it seemed you and your two companions were all indestructable Rambo's. You were glad for it as the game made me like the  characters, and I didn't want them to die*not to say they do or don't, i wont give that away. There are some really good fights in some nice area's. the environment changed enough to keep it fresh enough without leaving the desert city atmosphere. I would say, to play it a difficulty level above your comfort zone as while i had to replay some parts many times to survive,many more semed to easy. If you fail to much it gives the option to lower difficulty in game. Overall - everything was good to great. I had fun playing it. However if your looking for anything more then a well done shooter with a nice story objective, you might be disappointed. Their is no heavy load of morale decisions that stay with you. They also could have done more with the sand storm idea. both were weak and easily forgotten.

In reality, it is a cover based third person shooter. Sadly I’m sure most people glazed right over this game amongst the veritable sea of cover based third person shooter garbage flooding the market. In many respects, it’s hard to blame them. The controls are average, squad AI is passable at best, the shooting isn’t weak, but at the same time doesn’t carry as much weight as you would expect. The difference with Spec Ops is that the narrative is absolutely fascinating. I can’t in good conscious point out any specifics of the plot because to spoil it would ruin the impact it would leave on anyone who hasn’t yet played it. What I can say is that at the end of the final cutscene I sat back and really thought about all of my choices and actions I took throughout the campaign. I can only think of a handful of games which have ever made such an impact on me.\nSpec Ops: The Line breaks the mold and is a must buy if nothing more than to see what modern military shooters have to offer us besides 10 year old multiplayer daycare.","November 10, 2014","true","18.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

After few minutes when the story opens, it really grows on you and makes you curious. Then you don't care that much about the overplayed gameplay style that doesn't bring anything new to the table, because it's made like this just to let the story shine.\n\nThe multiple endings are worth watching and all of them are very, very powerful. I will never forget that moment when we bombed the base with soldiers and also hiding civilians. When I saw to the bone burnt dead woman holding her child, and tried to protect it, I just hold my face with goosebumbs, saying to myself "What have I done" If a game can give you unforgettable emotional moments, you know you played something special, and this little known game (unluckily!) is something special.\n\n"Do you feel like a hero yet?..."\nIf you want to unlock all achievements, prepare on very mentally challenging FUBAR experience. As I said, gameplay is very CoD and those few heroic moments are OK if playing on first 3 difficulties, but it's absolutely horrible on FUBAR, especially in solo parts when you are outmatched 1v10 and you have few bullets and low HP. Took me definitely more than 60-70 replays through whole campaign, so good luck with it.","January 24","true","31.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

However, how far would we go to do the right thing?  How much would we be willing to sacrifice to do what is right?\n\nCaptain Walker and his covert Delta Force team of three face this exact dilemma.  Tasked with conducting reconnaissance and radioing for extraction once completed, the mission was straight forward.  However, upon arrival they realize the situation has changed and the mission must as well in order to do the right thing.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is a shooter unlike others when it comes to storytelling and presenting a different perspective on war.  The game portrays warfare as an ugly affair.  This it accomplishes through its visual and auditory details.  Furthermore, throughout the game you will witness the affect this has on Walker and his team.  Around him the situation rapidly is deteriorating and Dubai becomes essentially hell on Earth.  Walker primarily is affected by this and his appearance and demeanor changes as a result.\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay, Spec Ops is your typical shooter.  Although ammo is manageable you should avoid spraying and praying.  Instead issue commands to your team to conserve ammo and prioritize targets.  The game is linear for the most part but you should be able to complete it within 5 hours.\n\nI highly recommend Spec Ops: The Line to anyone looking for a unique perspective on modern warfare.

The Xbox 360 controller works well (even though you don't get the same precision as with the keyboard/mouse) and this game is a good one for playing on the TV from the couch, but it's just as good in front of a desktop computer controlled with the keyboard/mouse.\n\n\nMain review:I was very positively surprised by this game.\n\nThe story starts out in Dubai, where most of the population have been evacuated due to heavy sandstorms. Your team is sent on a recon mission, and when discovering dead American soldiers, you continue further in to the city to investigate and look for survivors.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482770326\nThe basic mechanics of the game are those found in most third person cover based shooters. Most of the time you're behind cover, returning fire at any enemies present. You also have grenades at your disposal, and you can issue simple commands to your squad members (target certain enemies, and in some situations order one of them to throw a flashbang).\n\nThe game mechanics themselves are good enough to make the game worth it, but as the game unfolds, you discover that there is more to it than most other modern action games. You are faced with some difficult choices, and have to live with the consequences of your actions in the game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482770499\nThe choices are few and far between, and don't really change the storyline, this is not a role playing game, it's more of a cinematic experience (the player is even credited as a "special guest star" in the credits) where you take control over the action. The level design is quite linear, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nI don't want to reveal too much about the story, but when you in other games kill hundreds of enemy soldiers and don't think much of it, this game makes you think about what you're doing. You experience the trauma through the main protagonist, and chances are, you won't feel great about what you've done after playing through the game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482770201\nExcellent graphics, solid game mechanics, and a story that makes you stop and think. I would definitely recommend Spec Ops: The line.","July 20, 2015","true","11.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","3"

Gameplay-wise, it's a fairly competent shooter marred by some very poor design decisions- checkpoints often come before cutscenes and are too far apart, which, combined with the surprisingly unforgiving difficulty (even on Normal you can find yourself gunned down in seconds) can be teeth-grindingly annoying. The range of guns you can pick up is unremarkable and there are nice secondary functions to a lot of them; you can carry three kinds of grenades; the cover mechanic is just flawed enough to be irritating but functions tolerably for the most part.\n\nThis is not a game about gameplay, however.\n\nWere it to be judged purely on its design and mechanics, Spec Ops: The Line would be pretty forgettable, but it has an ace in the hole: a story so out of the blue in its direction and message that it's a miracle a major publisher put this game out at all. What you think you're getting- particularly if you only play the demo- is another gung-ho gun-wielding slice of Americans saving the day by killing all the brown people. What you actually get is a slow, spiralling descent into madness that wears its Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now inspirations proudly and uses them to forge a modern-day commentary on the type of video game you thought you were going to play. Captain Walker is no godly Call of Duty avatar who can murder a thousand people and walk away- he falls apart mentally, visually and audibly as the game continues, his professionalism is stripped away and raw ego left exposed. "Tango down" becomes a more chilling, "Kill is ♥♥♥♥ing confirmed" as the game confronts you with issues of culpability and responsibility. It's incredibly unsettling.\n\nIf you don't come away from Spec Ops: The Line with questions and doubts about shooters, I have serious concerns about whether you're dead inside. Do your best to ignore the sometimes-frustrating controls and systems and try and appreciate just how important this game is in the history of, and commentary on, shooters.","August 10, 2014","true","15.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Spec Ops is a game that will indeed shock you in some parts of\nthe campaign. The developers wanted to show us the other side of the war where everything that you think will be all right, goes wrong and you are the one blamed for that. The campaign takes place in destroyed by storm Dubai where we have the mission to rescue any survivors. The game shows us then a very good perspective of how a such a powerful city as Dubai can be destroyed in days by thirst, hunger and civil war. The campaign then also shows how rest of the world just do not care about other conflicts. The game takes then focus on team-work where you and two other soldiers are going through the city trying to survive. I also felt like the campaign was slowly turning you into a murderer, where you began as a friendly soldier and ended as a killer.                                                                                                                                                              The game itself is very good. The shooting mechanics are great, there is also some stealth gameplay. The game offers a wide list of weapons which is also great. The missions are ´´OK´´designed, so do not expect much. The game offers some decent graphics, but it´s still the gameplay that shows most potential. Spec Ops: The Line offers also a great addition where you have to find several ´´intelligence files´´ so it´s also a great thing for achievement hunters. Unfortunately I haven´t played the multiplayer yet, so I can´t review it.\nI personally liked the game. I bought it on Humble Bundle for several dollars and I can´t really say it was not worth it. The campaign after all was great experience in my opinion even though it shocked me in some chapters. The game itself was also good; the AI, weapons, Dubai perspective are definitely its best features.\nOverall I would like to say that the game was great and I truly recommend it to anyone to try it out.\nI give the game a solid 7/10","August 23, 2014","true","5.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/50300/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1598 products in account","Spec Ops: The Line is a cover based third-person shooter in which the player controls one Captain Martin Walker. The player also has some control over Walker's crew, Adams and Lugo, in terms that they can be commanded to kill specific enemies on the battlefield. The entire game takes place in a post-war zone Dubai, where Walker and his crew have been sent out on a reconnaissance mission.\n\nAt the time of writing, it has been nearly three years since Spec Ops: The Line released initially. The game has definitely stood the test of time in every aspect imaginable; the story, graphics, gameplay and soundtrack have all aged beautifully. For the time, the graphics were above par for shooter titles, and they're still outstanding to look at today; especially the way Walker's face becomes more and more disfigured by the turmoils of war as the campaign wears on. The use of dynamic lighting is also some of the best that I've seen in early-era last gen games. The city of Dubai, as sand-swallowed as it may be, is massive and stunning to look at.\n\nI will also add in a quick note here that the game does not suffer from any type of performance issues, at least in my experience. I always maintained a stable 80-120 FPS throughout the duration of the game while capping out at 144 FPS, and there were no crashes, glitches, or bugs.\n\nThe gameplay is solid for a shooter, there are no clunky controls. The entire control scheme is similar to that of the first Gears of War title; which is not unusual, seeing as Spec Ops was indeed crafted using the Unreal Engine. There are slight annoyances, such as when you're running you will sometimes stick to a piece of cover. Other than that, the control scheme is smooth and nearly flawless. As expected, there are tons of shooting sequences... almost too many at times. Around every corner there lurks another gang of foes who are waiting to rip Walker to shreds bullet by bullet. Like any good military style shooter, there is also Intel to collect.\n\nWhere Spec Ops: The Line really shines is within its story, and its soundtrack. This game has one of the best soundtracks of any shooter that I've ever played; from the rocking classic tunes to the Louisiana bayou styled twangy guitars, the tracks never get old no matter how many times one plays through the game. The same can be said for the story, which has a possibility of four endings once the player has reached the end of the ride. While I won't say a lot about the story, for those that have not played the game yet, I will say that Spec Ops definitely ripped off the original Black Ops, but I personally think this game does it way better.\n\nA once respected high ranking military man who gradually goes crazy over the course of the campaign, only to have a huge twist revealed at the end. There are lots of feels-hitting areas between the beginning and end of the game, and the player can become very attached to Walker, Adams and Lugo throughout the time spent within the title; making it that much harder on the emotions when something goes awry. This aspect is where every single Call of Duty ever created has failed, and it's why people love Spec Ops: The Line. The game does spend a good amount of time carving out the characters, so that they don't just become more expendable jarheads in another military shooter.\n\nIf you haven't played Spec Ops: The Line yet, and you're in the market for a good third-person cover based shooter, definitely pick this up. It will be one of the greatest storylines in a shooter that you've ever experienced, and it's sure to stay within your memory for years to come. There are also many replay factors, and reasons to go back to the title; whether it's as soon as you complete it, or a couple years down the road. However, I cannot justify $32.99 CAD for a title that is almost three years old, get it on sale.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An amazing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 23","true","18.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

In today's gaming industry, many are looking for the next great narrative to be found in a small indie game, or an expertly crafted RPG. Absolutely nobody was expecting a third-person military shooter to be the breakthrough they were desperately searching for, and that just adds to the utter brilliance of Spec Ops: The Line.\n\nAs you may have heard, the game is very much intwined in the same themes as Joseph Conrad's incredible novel, "Heart of Darkness". You are a Special Forces captain sent in with your 3-man squad to the ruins of Dubai. The way the city is presented is unlike any other world design in recent memory, as you truly feel the suffering of the survivors, from the rotting, strung-up corpses to the creepiness of the multiple murals and graffiti you will stumble upon. Even with the bright aesthetics of sand and sun, make no mistake; Dubai is a wasteland with nothing left to offer.\n\nHowever, world design takes a backseat to narrative here, where the characters you encounter and the actions you take break down every preconception you might have had about military shooters. From the eerie antagonist to the journalist who could've very well been the brother of Dennis Hopper from Apocalypse Now, every character here feels needed. You will be forced to take actions that will genuinely shock you. By the third hour, I had committed what was by far, the most horrifying thing I have ever done in a video game. And make no mistake, none of this is purely for shock value, but truly necessary thematically, in order to build up to an unforgettable finale.\n\nBy the end of the game, you will wonder why you bothered to play this game at all. But really, that's just it. In this game, you are not meant to be the hero. You are not supposed to have a happy ending, you are not meant to be the great patriot fighting for his country. It is the war epic that is needed after America's decade-long conflict in Afghanistan. It is what "The Red Badge of Courage" was to the American Civil War, what "The Deer Hunter" was to Vietnam. Even the game asks you towards the end, "Do you remember why you came here?" But that's just it. You may have forgotten why you played this game, but you'll be glad you did.","July 5, 2014","true","7.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Joe antics and flag waving over character development. And, at first, Spec Ops: The Line falls right in line with that stereotype--you take control of Walker, a soldier sent into a sandstorm-ruined Dubai to find a missing Colonel. But as time goes on it becomes more and more obvious that there's something more devious afoot, and the shooter's story transforms from run-of-the-mill to one-of-a-kind.\n\nWhat unfolds is a damning criticism of shooters themselves, questioning everything that gamers have grown accustom to. Walker's journey sends him marching into the nucleus of the genre, playing with the storytelling in ways no other game has. By the end you might feel anger or sadness, but the important thing is that you'll feel something, and that's pretty rare in military shooters." I strongly urge you to play this game.

It's something that all gamers, particularly fans of the shooter genre, should pick up at least once.  If you haven't played already, quit reading reviews (it's better to go in blind) and pick it up, on sale if you need more persuasion.  The gameplay may not be great, and downright infuriating at times, but there's a reason for that, too.  Keep that in the back of your mind as you play.  Pay close attention to what's going on around you, how the people act, what they say.  Keep an open mind, and be ready for ♥♥♥♥ to go sideways.\n\nSpoilers-\nWow.  Yager did a fantastic job of creating a game that challenges the norms of the genre, and speaks volumes for video games as an art form.  The gameplay may be frustrating, but it only serves to emphasize the fact that while everything tells you that you/Walker should stop playing/fighting, you continue to push on.  Losing your sanity, the difficulty ramps up, anger builds, the game opens professes its hate for you, and it's not even fun to play - but you keep going.  Why?  What does that say about you?  Is simply reaching the end worth what you'll have to do to get there?  The line between player and character is blurry.  You can justify your actions by saying that it's the only way to move forward, that the game is forcing you to do it, but you - and Walker - always had the choice to turn away, to leave Dubai, to put down the game.  But you keep going.  Notice how some of the transitions fade to black, while others fade to white?  Notice how often you begin a new segment of the game by falling, rappelling, descending?  Even though you were just underground, you're now above it just so you can descend another thousand feet into insanity?  "Welcome to hell, Walker."

Never had a game make me question my morality as much as Spec Ops: The line. This game surpassed the level of a game, bringing to me what I can only described as "a very real experience".\n\nThe strong emotions of the graphics and voice acting emersed me into a setting where I ponder over every decision I made while playing as the protagonist. I can still vividly remember the very first time I was shown the repercussions after I made a "mistake". Without revealing spoilers, I can only say I regretted so hard I did not make a save before making that decision and it "haunted" me for the rest of the game, quite literally.\n\nTogether with This War of Mine, I'm pretty sure Spec Ops: The Line can be arguably the next most realistic war game ever scripted. It introduces as a shooter, but jolts you back up and shake you vigorously, reminding you that every single round that connects with an "enemy", someone out there lost their loved one.\n\nI have been late in picking up Spec Ops: The Line, and I regret letting it grow dust in my collection and not playing it sooner.

Welcome to Dubai.\n\n\nStory\nStarting my review with commenting on how good of a story this game had (IMO).\nDramatic twists of events. Taking choices you wouldn't want to. Going through a deep slow path of insanity by each chapter.\n\nI'm usually not amused by any type of story an army game has to offer and I must admit in my eyes most of them are more or less the same.\nHowever out of the bucket of clichés and reused material Spec Ops: The Line stands out.\nThe fictional concept told here is so well blended that it kept my interest through the whole time from start to end.\nI even did 4 runs of the game itself in order to experience all 4 different endings.\nCan't say it is original, after the amount of movies and games that have been out so far, there's hardly anything new to be served in militaristic games. However it is the way the content is served that makes the difference in this type of games, this one right here gets the cookie for me.\n\n\nDirection\nThe game is very very well directed. The way the story is balanced through action sessions, intense cutscenes, sweet environmental designs, and impressive musical options.\nAll combined so smoothly with some of the very best voice acting I've seen for an action shooter.\n\nGraphics\nNeatly scripted on Unreal Engine 3, the game has sweet physics and sandstorm and smoke dynamics. Of course there have been titles a lot more famous for their graphics for 2012.\nBut for the experience offered, Spec Ops: The Line's graphics are just perfect and it's lacking major bugs or issues.\n\nGameplay\nVery easy and comfortable to handle. Ammo and amount of weapons is just about right.\nDestructible environment (just a few details here and there) add a good taste on the style of the shooter experience and of course not missing the ability to take cover and using commands to make your crew help you dynamically in various situations.\nDifficulty makes a difference from the easiest to the hardest mode and it gets more and more challenging, sometimes kinda too hard in the hardest difficulty level.\n\nMusic\nThe music used in the game is AMAZING.\nNot only the acoustic backrgound is very good, but you will also hear a brilliant collection of songs through the game, every single one very accurately put in each situation like a glove.\n\nSound\nCool environmental and battle effects that seem about right at any moment of the game. No problems with blending music or voice acting.\n\n\nAverage\nConsidering that this game was implemented by a very small team and the studio itself is not even famous for having any other major titles around the market (Yager Development only have one other game implemented which is very old)\nIt was freaking amazing. With a story that has a beginning, a peak, and an end.\nWell made, balanced, satisfying, with good action and even a well done multiplayer and co-op modes.\nConsidering how shallow other a lot more famous games from bigger studios have ended up being, Spec Ops: The Line is by the full meaning of the phrase 'a job well done'.\nAnd for the asked price, this title is pure gold!\nDo get it. 100% recommended!","March 29, 2014","true","36.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","4"

I guess it wants to be clever (compared to most other games in the genre it is definitely somewhat smarter), making you question your motives and the enjoyment you get out of killing for the sake of your own entertainment or some such. Didn't quite work for me, to be honest. Can't really pin it down to either lacking characters that I did not get invested in or the general signs that the "hero" slips into madness and it all could well be a fever dream. It boils down to you making "tough" moral decisions - the result of these decisions being revealed to you (exploitation, ho!) - the game telling you that you are ♥♥♥♥ed up (and kinda forcing you on a path that often times seems quite illogical but is needed for the big revelation at the very dramatic end).\n\nWhat really sets this game apart from the rest (for me anyway) is the incredible setting. Since the early nineties I hated desert-settings. Green-yellowish sandscapes everywhere you look were just not very visually pleasing and didn't offer much variety. Now, Spec Ops on the other hand is quite unique by offering you a glimpse of what a place like Dubai being swallowed by the desert could look like. And it is bloody amazing. Skyscrapers half-buried in dunes make for excellent postapocalyptic vistas. The insides of all these monuments of decadence slowly decaying and rotting away with the last remaining survivors scuttling through the underground mazes of floors and basements like insects in a hive. It is an amazing backdrop for any kind of game. But the sand is actually part of the experience not just background-decoration, as you will encounter sandstorms, quicksand-situations and buildings just crumbling under tons of sand. Let me just put it this way: fans of urban decay will be delighted!\n\nNow, if you changed the color-saturation to "vibrant", these setpieces also look downright fantastic. This has to be the most colorful military-shooter ever, but it is never gaudy or too bold - with some scenes really sticking out, like the march through the desert at the beginning. Three shadowy figures in front of a bright glowing, orange-ish background. Quite artsy and wouldn't look too out of place in a frame on a wall. But seeing it in motion is even better. Also, the scale of the locales is fantastic, you really get an idea of the massive size of these buildings and the great tragedy of them being swallowed whole. I am a bit in love with the concept, to be honest.\n\nAs mentioned before, as a game it is rather mediocre. You played any number of cover-shooters, you know EXACTLY what this feels like sans chainsaw-guns and heavy metal curb-stomping. The shooting parts have a tendency to last a bit too long (eventhough the game takes just about 5 hours) and it starts to get ridiculous once you have killed 30-40 men in a single fight - three men taking on an entire infantry division? I do like the flanking opportunities built into most areas where fighting takes place. It feels tactical enough to make switching cover and gaining the high ground an actual thing rather than an option. Slowly gaining the upper hand in a combat zone was fun and the game never had any hiccups in terms of control or anything else of the sort. But ultimately, the game itself is just means to an end - the defining feature of the game, as devs probably wanted it, is the story - but as far as I am concerned it really is the setting, the setpieces, the overall art direction with its splendid appliance of color and the grand realization of ruined Dubai.","October 19, 2014","true","4.7"," 33 of 58 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","33","58","0","2"

You basically get to watch Dubai slowly crumble into a deserted wasteland with a few hellish parts in between. The diolague is great and the art design is fantastic. Voice acting is superb and the story is one of the best I have ever seen in a game. This is what Max Payne 3 should have been in this regard. The ending also wraps up nicely and makes perfect sense while being shocking.\n\n---|GRAPHICS|---\nThe graphics can look pretty nice but may freak out. Imagine texture pop-in without the pop-in part. Also has inconsistent frame rate. Set it to HIGH setting for best results, VERY HIGH generates a lot of heat for those with cheap fans and laptops. Lighting is also overdone in some parts to a certain extent.\n\n---|GAMEPLAY|---\nSpec Ops plays like any other 3rd person shooter. I have a feeling that the Devs had this in mind so they expected the story alone to carry the title. As a result the game didn't sell well but I still suggest you pick it up and don't read the spoilers. You will have a great time. Also, the AI completely freaks out on FUBAR difficulty but you shouldn't need 2 playthroughs to really enjoy it.\n\n---|MULTIPLAYER|---\nDon't. Just please stick with singleplayer. Multiplayer feels rushed and slapped on to the wonderful singleplayer story.\n\nIn conclusion if you want a great story I highly suggest you try this title out. This isn't like all the other military shooters like Homefront and CoD. Spec Ops is not one of those "MURIKA kills evil terrorists" games. It simply shares the same setting.","August 3, 2014","true","12.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There's the giant towers buried image (like sea level rise, but ground level this time?), the luxurious rooms with aquariums for walls (in the desert), or a favorite of mine, a room that has a beatiful aquarium on its floor, that room is so damn pretty.\n\nMusic is also okay, it transmits that you should have fun (due to meta, or because it's a game, maybe both?), there is at least one interesting non-standard choice that stands out. Sfx is also good.\n\nGameplay is cookie cutter fps but on third person. The ideas are good but I found the most problems here due to "bugs", bug as in the cover system works, but you keep dying because you fail to take cover, or the sprint button works, but you sprint when you dont want to, and dont when you do, all of this due to poor design I believe, or perhaps programming itself (cover and sprint are the same button, if the programming is on point then I would decouple the actions to separate buttons because it messes everything up, but in theory it should work, so the programming could be not as tight as it needs to be for this to work).\n\nI hear you run faster with light weapons, but while perhaps realistic, unnecessary, should have been removed especially since there are sections where you must run fast.\n\nYou may get killed instantly at points, at other you may never get shot (cod problem), devs should have added invincibility frames to the single player so that guns didnt have a "shots to kill" (which leads to death in 0.1s) but "time to kill" stat with perhaps that time getting halved if attacked by a number of enemies to give you time to react and hide (like, 1s to die, that's all you need to be fair, sure, not realistic, but its a game).\n\nSome checkpoints are placed with the storytelling in mind but not the replayability, so you get them right before cutscenes or world presentation (a long trek), that works if you quit and start the game another date, but, on the same session, that means if it is followed by a tough fight, it gets annoying fast.\n\nOnce you get past the annoyances, firefights are good, and level design helps by not being 100% shooting gallery and giving plenty of alternate ambush routes (which you dont figure until after you get past the shooting gallery so you feel dumb for not taking the clever route, but at least that would help to spice a second playthrough). There's also the sense of game progression, which is also nicely done, the game gives you new weapons (without making a fuss about it) to try and discard at a good pace, almost all of them having 2 (realistic) fire modes, mostly zoom level or select fire mode, with turrets having two stances. Due to the design every weapon actually has uses, there are big health sinks you can use the smgs on, long range enemies for snipers, close range for shotguns (and shotguns can be decent at medium range although aiming may be tougher), big groups with lots of suppression that just require explosives of any kind and so on. You start with the simple weapons, and by the end of the game you are using the one-shot-kill sniper, and pro-rifles with noob tubes or m32 6-round grenade launcher with infinite ammo and short reloads. If you notice, the boss enemies start spawning closer and closer to you, forcing you to stop cowering and learn how to beat them, give you less room to hide, and get more personal as the game goes (you have to be the one that kills them, not your ai allies), that the good progression I felt during the game.\n\nAll things considered, remember to buy it.","March 15","true","5.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I thought about my actions and what they caused, how many people I had killed in a senseless fantasy to do "what was right" and why even after completing it I never felt happy I never felt that I was the hero of the story that I had become the savior of Dubai. A particular moment stood out to me during the playthough, a moment when I on impluse, shot into a crowd of unarmed, innocent people because I wanted revenge I wanted to do what was right and I was determined that I could do what was right. but that same drive to do what I percieved as right, lead to the deaths of so many others.\n\nI went into Spec Ops wanting to do good and thought that I could always choose the least evil option when I was given the chance and in the end It would all be fine.

It was originally planned to be a new IP but was made part of the Spec Ops brand for sequel bait. This is important because this ties into what Spec Ops the Line was advertised as. It was advertised as a big budget modern military shooter with an interesting setting but overly generic game mechanics and plot premise.\n\nWhat we got was an elaborate satire of modern military shooters. Spec Ops the Line starts out similar to how you'd expect a big budget AAA game to start. You are a squad of soldiers, sent in to investigate a crisis, and you have to cowboy in and shoot some brown people.\n\nHowever the game plays with this a lot. What was the exact nature of your mission? Why are the enemies so hostile to you? Why are your squadmates talking erratically about you? There are so many questions raised and the game delightfully gives you answers that you don't want to hear.\n\nSpec Ops the Line's writing is very top notch. It satirizes the heroic power fantasy nature of modern military shooter plotlines and characters. And it plays with the idea of "how would killing hundreds of people change you as a person".\n\nBeyond that the gameplay is sound, it has Mass Effect style squad combat and fairly generic multiplayer. The singleplayer is what you get Spec Ops for, and it remains one of my favorite games ever for its message and its post-modern view on the 7th generation of video games overall. The main gripes I have with it are due to the linear nature of the game, and due to how the plot is written it isn't as replayable as you might think. But it still is one of the most breathtaking games I have ever played, and one I dearly recommend to people who want to play a game that'll make you feel uncomfortable and uneasy with your objectives.","December 24, 2015","true","6.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I felt like the game was going to be very short, for the first half of the game I was constantly thinking, "well this'll be the last chapter". The destination was always clear, the journey was a lot more entertaining than initially expected. Once I was hooked on the story I wanted to play to find out the conclusion. My total gameplay according the save file (I believe this does not include time in which I paused to chat, and does not count checkpoint restarts due to death) is 3 hours 44 minutes and 8 seconds.\n\nThe game looks fantastic. I've never been to Dubai myself, but have seen plenty of photos and videos and the game makes me feel like I'm there.\n\nThe controls are a real downfall. Whoever thought it was a good idea to have sprint and cover be the same button should be punched by every person who has played this game. Also, sometimes you'd move along a piece of cover, and randomly stand up\n\nThe game has a story to tell and isn't ashamed of being linear. I actually enjoy a linear game in an age where eveything's trying to be open-world. Kudos to the devs for doing this.\n\nThe bottom line: An enjoyable experience, with a refreshingly good story.

It's called cognitive dissonance and Spec Ops: The Line makes you take a nosedive into a sea of that feeling.\n\nIt shows war as what it is. Not as the glorified, heroic, romanticized ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that we get stuffed with from games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, but as horror, pure, unfiltered horror. If you felt like the moral choices in games like Fallout punched you in the gut, what you'll have to do in Spec Ops will leave you feel like the game punched you in the face, wrenched open your jaw, reached down your throat and ripped out your guts.\n\nSpec Ops makes the player feel what the main character is going through, but not simply via making you identify with the character you play. Its gameplay, world design and everything makes you feel uncomfortable, nauseous and morally torn apart. It really is brilliantly crafted.\n\nI'll stop here to avoid possible spoilers or how you perceive the game while playing, but if you feel like dropping the game after playing for an hour because the combat feels generic and/or bad, please, please don't do that and press on, it's well worth it.\n\nThere's one last thing I'll say, if you decide to play it: When you hear the line "Because you wanted to be something you're not.", that's aimed at you, not the character you're playing.","October 3, 2014","true","6.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Mechanically speaking, Spec Ops is a pretty standard third person shooter - two weapons at any one time , three throwables, and a selection of alternate weapon options with a comparatively smooth cover system. I did not really like the inability to aim and fire while sprinting, but that's a bit of a minor issue that I feel can be overlooked.\n\nThe graphics are reasonably good, especially for a game released in 2012. The background and setting is particularly well done, well able to convey a sense of a city tearing itself apart, and also the issues that have arisen from a city cut off from the rest of the world. It is a pretty brutal Dubai that you find yourself in, and the game conveys the sense of horror that has descended on the city very well.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic. Both it, and the storyline, short it may be, are probably the standout features of the game for me. Evoking imagery of Apocalypse Now, Spec Ops: The Line shows just how nightmarish and hellish war really is, apart from the glorified imagery that certain media has portrayed it as. Offering a look at the damage that can be done to a soldier's psyche from tours of duty, it also offers a look at the chain of command, something that is explored comparatively rarely. Offering questions regarding morality and cause and effect, while short, Spec Ops: The Line is well worth playing through.","July 24, 2015","true","10.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Finally I completed this game third time (2 times like not license version and one more time here) and I can say with full confidence -  it is the best shooter I've ever played. But let me tell you more closely why I think so.\n\nGraphic. In this game, you might find one of the best images in all shooters. Since the beginning you will be amazed by the fantastic scenery of the desert ... detailed characters, weapons, and equipment. Due to the game engine Unreal Engine 3 you'll subjugated by landscapes in this game .. it's just something incredible (for 2012).\n\nGameplay. The gameplay is also at a very high level. I can say with full confidence that it is much better than in CoD or Battlefield (yes, I played all these games). Every movement, every jump clearly and realistically worked out. To stay alive you need as quickly as possible to cross from one shelter to another, 'cause here you can be killed by EVERY bullet. Here is a great combat system and a large selection of weapons. You can kill your enemy with machine guns, pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers, different types of grenades. You can kill with his bare hands (it looks fantastic, and not just waving a knife as in CoD)! Or even just to fill their enemies great bunch of sand, which almost break out the windows or rooftops.\n\nStory. Apparently, I have not enough words to describe it. For me - this is the best story that I have experienced in the game world. This story, the story of three brave friends deserves an Oscar! Welcome to Dubai, paradise on earth, which turned into hell! First, we have an intriguing start that somehow draws you and you want to know more... During the game events are fantastic, I will not spoiling, but the game has a heap of points that can cause you to fear and even tears. As for the end of the game ... I am quite sure that by the end of the game you will overfill different feelings... There are several different endings, and you have to make it for your own choice .. no matter how difficult it will be... This story impressed me to the core. And I really happy that I passed this way together with Delta team - Captain Walker, Lieutenant Adams and Sergeant Lugo.\n\nI can talk for a long time about this game. Because for me it's really clever game that I'll always want to play. I want to say thanks studio Yager that they gave me this small miracle. I am so depressed that many players don't pay attention to this really fantastic game and continue to play CoD and Battlefield which  just turned into a boring conveyor.\n\nThank you for reading my own point of view.\n\nDefinitely 10/10","September 27, 2014","true","11.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

The 'Do you recommend this game, Yes : No" is very limiting here because it depends. If you are looking for a good game this isn't it. If you are looking for one with a great story that is a military game no less than you found it. In this "I'm offended" generation where someone always has to be offended by something and demand its removal the devs went all out and didn't care who they offended. They had a message to send and pulled no punches.\n\nGame wise Spec Ops The Line suffers. I was constantly fighting with the controls and couldn't help but be bored to death whenever the shooting started thanks to the mediocre mechanics and bad AI. It came to the point where I was trying to rush through the game just so I could be done with it and that's a shame because it somewhat took away from the impact of the story.\n\nThe visuals are average and the aliasing hurt my eyes but it runs worse than Crysis 3. On a rig equipped with a 3770K, 16 Gigs of RAM, and a GTX 780ti I was getting frequent stutters, shaky mouse movements, and framerate drops.\n\nWith that said the creators of Spec Ops The Line clearly had a vision and they must have fought tooth and nail to make it happen. What starts off as a cliché military shooter ends up as something far more. The story is grim, depressing, bold, and a big middle finger to military games which rely on unquestioning patriotism and make war seem like it's fun and cool. It is not afraid to tackle the horrors of war and PTSD. It's designed to make you feel uncomfortable and it's about time a military game goes this route.\n\nIt's a shame then that there isn't a good game here to compliment the work put in by the writers. I am glad to have experienced Spec Ops The Line but it is not something I can easily recommend.","May 24, 2014","false","6.0"," 105 of 198 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","105","198","0","6"

And if the truth is undeniable, you create your own."\n\nI remember when this game first came out, and I completely over looked it. Looking back on it now, I find myself wanting to go back, and buy it upon it's release date. Spec Ops: The Line is easily one of the darkest, and most harrowing games that I have ever played.\n\nThe choices you make in the game are extremely important, and with almost every choice you need to choose between two negatives. That being said; some of the options are just downright disturbing, and make you feel like a bad person afterwards. This game makes other war games look like a joke. While games like Call of Duty and Battlefield make you feel like some extremely overpowered bad ♥♥♥ soldier, this game does the opposite; it makes you feel like a monster, and not in a good way. This game shows that real war isn't so simple.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game, is that it is very, very short. Only taking about 8 hours to beat, Spec Ops is still one of the best stories I've ever experienced while playing a game. While the gameplay, and arsenal of guns are nothing too special from a standard 3rd person shooter, you'll find yourself wanting more, and more to know what exactly is happening in Dubai.\n\nIf you like dark, and twisted stories, then this game is definitely for you. Do yourself a favor, and just buy this game. It's a great story, and it only takes about 8 hours of your time.","June 29, 2014","true","8.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, you arrive to find the people being oppressed by rogue US soldiers. What follows is a long, hard journey, punctuated by brutality, anger, insanity and blood. In this regard, The Line could be described as a parody of CoD, except no-one's laughing.\nA little pre-warning for this game: you will feel evil. Certain events in the game involve doing things that no sane man could do, and you will hate yourself.

Good story, and the voice acting was also spot on.\n\nSPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!This game will make you feel bad, really bad. Seriously. As you progress you will eventually (if you live into the game as i did) realize that you are the bad guy here. Especially at the part where those civilians killed off Lugo, i felt anger and wanted to end every single life of those ♥♥♥♥ers. You believe along the whole game that you are doing all this for the greater good.. but in the end, you were so focused on taking Konrad down that you completely derail from your original objective and that eventually lead you to your own downfall.\n\nCan't say the same for the multiplayer part, it feels like a degraded dull third person edition of Call of Duty with a touch of sandstorms. If you are in cover and a grenade lands in front of you.. you are ♥♥♥♥ed, no time to run away and i feel (my opinion) that the cover system is bugged. To be honest, it feels like it doesn't even belong here and was just added for the sake of "we need people to come back to our game" but fail miserably. I played a couple of hours just to get a hang of the multiplayer i got to rank 10 or so.. Absolutely garbage. Also, if you hope to find alot of multiplayer action, you will be disappointed.

Lugo - one of your fellow men, always disagrees with your orders but always does what you tell him to, Adams - the guy with machinegun, does his job fast and without mumbling, and Captain Martin Walker - protagonist, the one who appears to be crazy in the end(or not?). So, i don't want to spoil the whole story, but i'd like to say that games like this one show the real face of war: murder, madness, cruelty. By the time you'll reach the end of campaign, you will most likely notice that our protagonist changes, you will even get curious "who the bad guy here?" So, what i want to say that this game is really worth buying even if it was released in the 2012. I can't say that the graphics are awesome, but for me it was acceptable. The storyline will appear to be boring in the first few minutes, but after you'll spend some time in Dubai you'll understand that the story is actually interesting.\n(I think developers deserved these 18$)","December 14, 2015","true","21.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is another game made by 2K https://www.2k.com/games . It's interesting to note how many of the games are made by 2k when we asked the various gaming groups to nominate games with the best story. This particular one entitled 'Spec Ops: The line' is actually the 8th one in this particular series though it shares nothing in common with its former installments of the games with the same namesake.\n\n(Spoiler Alert)\n\nThe story basically follows a soldiers personal journey through limbo. You take control of a captain Walker who is in charge of a 2 man delta squad. The three of them are on a rescue mission to find the 33rd battalion and their captain Konrad who is someone considered to be of noble rank since he saved your life in a previous battle.\n\nDubai has become somewhat apocalyptic thanks to huge never ending sandstorms requiring that the whole city to be evacuated. The politicians and the elite downplayed the situation while at the same time evacuating it themselves in secret leaving countless thousands of refugees behind. The 33rd battalion coming home from a war in Afghanistan volunteered their services to help with the relief efforts.\n\nThe United States government however ordered the 33rd to abandon the city and its refugees, but the 33rd led by Captain Konrad ignored the command and insisted upon their wishes of leading a caravan of 1,000 people out of the city. However the sandstorms grew worse and the caravan promised never arrived at the proposed time given. Future communication and travelling was severed and the 33rd was publicly disavowed for treason.\n\nAfter significant time a looped radio signal could be heard coming from the city again. It was a brief one from Captain Konrad. It basically stated that the attempted evacuation was a complete failure and the death toll was too many. The US military then decide to send a covert 3 man delta team in to locate any survivors and then radio for extraction.\n\nProblem is as you guide this 3 man crew into Dubai, things begin to seriously not add up. The refugees are trying to kill you, the 33rd battalion wants to kill you and so does the CIA operatives. As you begin to hallucinate voices and visions, you also begin to witness some atrocities that each splintering faction of the city has done to each other. The game unfortunately forces you to make some of those atrocities yourself in order to push on and find answers and hopefully in the vain attempt to nobly save someone. Somewhere at the end of the game you will be haunted by the dead faces of those that you have killed asking you why you committed such acts and for what purpose? Eventually you will realize that your character is suffering with severe effects of PTSD.\n\nThere are 18 campaign chapters to play through with a somewhat highly decorated abstract version of Dubai buried in the sand. These chapters are spasmodically broken up with several morale choices placed throughout the game. The importance of these morale choices and the effects they will have on the game are purely there for illusion. None of your choices will really matter. No matter what you choose or how you go about things your character will be haunted by the people he has killed. There is no pleasant way out of this. The game literally forces you to make a decision which unknowingly at the time will kill thousands. It will then show you the consequence of that decision regardless of the fact that you had no choice about it and it will ask you why did you do it?\n\nHere's where the nobility of the story fails immensely and does not have the same power or punch to a story where your choice really does matter. Any morale judgments are quickly dismissed under a rigged gaming framework. While it does get you to think about things and it has moved and inspired countless people to think about the consequence of actions, I personally think it could have been delivered better to make more of an impact on gamer's than what it already has.\n\nDefinitely worth a look...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx-DgKI12qA","July 21, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Good story, and the voice acting was also spot on.\n\nSPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!This game will make you feel bad, really bad. Seriously. As you progress you will eventually (if you live into the game as i did) realize that you are the bad guy here. Especially at the part where those civilians killed off Lugo, i felt anger and wanted to end every single life of those ♥♥♥♥ers. You believe along the whole game that you are doing all this for the greater good.. but in the end, you were so focused on taking Konrad down that you completely derail from your original objective and that eventually lead you to your own downfall.\n\nCan't say the same for the multiplayer part, it feels like a degraded dull third person edition of Call of Duty with a touch of sandstorms. If you are in cover and a grenade lands in front of you.. you are ♥♥♥♥ed, no time to run away and i feel (my opinion) that the cover system is bugged. To be honest, it feels like it doesn't even belong here and was just added for the sake of "we need people to come back to our game" but fail miserably. I played a couple of hours just to get a hang of the multiplayer i got to rank 10 or so.. Absolutely garbage. Also, if you hope to find alot of multiplayer action, you will be disappointed. There's almost nobody playing it anymore and finding servers will take alot of time.\n\nBut i will recommend the game anyway for the amazing singleplayer experience!","August 26, 2015","true","8.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/50300/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nSpec Ops: The Line is a third person shooter who takes a warfare story telling aspect, and mixes in gritty realism, coupled with very solid cover-based-game play.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  How do you talk about the story in this game without giving away any great details? The story goes in a very unorthodox direction from most Shooter games I've played. Additionally there are choices that you make throughout the game, and it's not just "go right or go left" as the saying goes "indecision is a choice".\nIn the words of William T. Sherman we hear the well known quote "War is Hell" To be quite honest not very many shooter games run with that concept, in Spec Ops: The Line, you will see far more gritty details of consequences of warfare... and the people effected.\nAs a final note regarding the story length, I after playing through the game my first time I put in 5.5 hours. I generally play slower trying to find extra items and do restarts for achievements, so that should be longer then a standard player will take to get through the game.\n\nGame Play: Spec Ops: the line is a cover-based third person shooter, meaning while you're being shot at you will move from cover to cover, most of the mechanics are quite straight forward, but do take some getting used too, you can jump over cover, change cover quickly by looking or pressing a movement key in that direction THEN pressing Space, there is a fair bit of learning to be had.\nIt should be noted that the controls will take some getting used too, I had already played a few third person shooters so those old controls were messing me up while I was trying to learn the new ones. Once you learn the controls the rest of the game is quite enjoyable to play through.\nEven if you're unfamiliar with cover-based-shooters the starting difficulty is friendly enough that you can get the hang of it while gunning down your foes. (I would still recommend getting used to hiding behind cover)\n\nAchievements: There are 50 Achievements in Spec Ops: The Line, after my first play through I had 33 of those achievements, there are four achievement category types: Find the lintel (collection), Get kills or special kills with weapons, Make this choice in the story, and standard story quests.\n\nPrice Spec Ops: The Line is priced at $29.99, by this point most people should be used to games (especially shooters) being priced there, as I always say "I recommend waiting for a sale".\n\nConclusion: Spec Ops: The line will appeal most to people who enjoy the two qualities of "Third person shooter", and "story telling". If you just want a shooter where you run in and pew pew pew, this isn't the right game for you. If you like playing games with meaningful stories, making hard ethical decisions while gaming or just looking for a change of pace this game will provide it.\nTo quickly recap: Story - Outstanding story telling methods. Game Play - Controls might be a bit tricky at first, but the cover based combat is very good. Achievements - Pretty Standard, there are a few tricky looking achievements though. Price - Standard, wait for a sale.\n","March 12, 2015","true","23.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I went in like it was another generic third person shooter so I can kill some time but after playing I was 3 hours further. without even noticing. next to the shooting and blowing up heads there is a engaging story.\nNow lets get into the review!\n\nThe Story:\n\nYou are playing as captain Walker. a delta force operator who was dropped in Dubai for a mission to find survivers of the failed evacuation of Dubai. but when you and your team reach the outskirts of Dubai everything goes south real fast. You get ambushed and attacked from all sides. And you seem to be landing deep in a ♥♥♥♥♥torm. after a while you find some terrible secrets about Dubai after the sandstorm. ( dont want to spoil anything)\nyour mission just changed: SURVIVE\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis is a 3th person shooter with cover based shooting mechanics. The game has some responsive controls and plays very well, you can also command your squad to stun the enemy with flashbangs or kill them from a distance to get you out of pretty messy situations. It is a bit more tactical than most shooters of this genre. You can choose from a variety of weapons do completely destroy your enemies, ranging from pistols to long range rifles. The gameplay ain't anything special but it works well for this game. Jump in and out of cover while you try to dodge bullets and command your 2 comrades in battle.\n\nGraphics, voiceacting, performance\n\nThe game has some really neat graphics and it looks good for a thirdperson shooter. The devs really brought a post-apocalyptic hit by a sandstorm Dubai to life. Destroyed enviroments, broken buildings and snad.. lots and lots of sand. as for the voice acting I have nothing to complain. The voice actors did a good job. The game itself did not suffer from bad framerate and bugs, glitches. nothing to take me out of the game. It is well optimized and there are enough settings to mess around with at the menu.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nDont, just dont.. it adds  nothing  to your experience and is just boring as hell.. the devs were forced to put it in so I guess we just have to go along with it. you cant blame them for being forced to put it in.\n\nConclusion & Final verdict\n\nI would recommend you this game if you are in for a 8 to 10 hours of explosive gunplay and a good story to go along with the shootouts. (not a fun story, its war. war isn't supposed to be fun) but well written and voiceacted. If you are not here for a story you will still have fun with shooting people straight in the face I guess.After I played trough the game 2 times  (dont mind the only 3 hours because I just bought it again since I had a version of the game which was not on steam.)\nThis is one of the most underrated games out there in this genre. I highly recommend you to pick it up if you are in for a good story and some enjoyable gunfights.\nMy final verdict for Spec ops: The line is a great 9/10\n\nWant more recommendations?

Hands down, it is one of the best third shooter games I've ever played. This is not another one of those shooters were you go all Rambo on your opponents' asses in the name of 'Murica.\n\nThe story is something else. I went through a lot of mixed feelings while playing it ranging from anger, to disgust, to regret. The story features multiple decisions to make, which neither will be good or bad.\n\n\nThe graphics are pretty and the setting of the game is unique. Despite being a work of ficition, it actually gave me sorta of an answer to my question which is; how would a post apocalyptic Dubai look like ?\n\n\nNow for the gameplay. While many people found the gameplay to be average, I actually loved it, probably because I love third person shooters such as Killswitch (regarded as the godfather of 3rd person shooters, Uncharted, TLOU, Gears and many others. Aside from shooting, running, and hiding, you get to order your unit to either take down targets, stun them, heal an injured comrade or "revive" him if he is down.\n\nThis game is a must play.

This is a tough one. I mean it is a ♥♥♥♥ing cool game, but the emotions it gives you can really be tough to deal with.\nGames with  Stories like this should be in every gamers library and every gamer and non gamer should experience a story like this.\nWe hold for granted what war is actually like. We go around blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and blasting the ♥♥♥♥ out of whatever moves without any ideas to the reality, the actual truth of war. I recognize first hand what war can do to somebody. I know the mind can become damaged with PTSD. My father is a Vietnam veteran and is  100% disabled with PTSD. He has been suffering all his life and will for the remainder of his lifetime. We don't understand the horrors and choices of war if we have never experienced them for ourselves. Well, this game brings out some of those feelings and choices that War can bring people to. What is right or what is wrong? Who is bad and who is good? What must we do to survive?\nThe game play is not the greatest cutting edge style.. You may get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at your NPCs or at the controls of your character, but the story and really nice visuals will overpower these flaws. Don't get me wrong the gameplay is fun. I truly love playing cover style shooters. They just seem more real to me because if you're in a fire fight the first thing you're going to do is jump behind whatever you can. The cover system does have its flaws, but nothing that ruins the fun.\nIf you want a game that is not your typical shooter a game that really gives you tough choices you should play this game..\nThis game is the chronic ♥♥♥♥.\nhttp://youtu.be/deSEELtbQIs","March 26, 2014","true","12.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Some of the controls, however seem to be directly ported from console as the key to vault over cover is the same as melee, and sprinting is the same as getting into cover (wait...what?!), however, after a bit of playing it, you will get used to it, but you may get some cheap-shot deaths from those awkward controls in the start...\nAs for story, the game nails it. It happens in a corrupt war-damaged Dubai, where a squad of 3 soldiers battle to get civilians out of the mess that happened, however, you face many decisions, that fight your moral principals and can make you feel bad for the sh*t you've done throughout the game. Your choices, like an RPG, affect the ending and most of them are really tricky as you don't know which one to take, since all of them have heavy consequences. Spec Ops: The Line makes you use your morality and ethical code to the extreme. Something rare nowadays in the gaming industry...\nMultiplayer is just...there, it can provide fun moments but not many, since it feels tacked on, you can clearly see that all the effort was put in the SP Campaign. Co-Op can be fun with a friend but not much else as you only have 4 missions, but they are really hard to pull off so an extra hand can be a life-savior, too bad the Co-Op isn't for 4 players or 3 (like a squad, like from the campaign), it's only for 2 players, but i'm ok with it actually unlike, MW3 survival mode for example, as 4 players would make much more sense.\nAlso, gameplay is well done, the gunplay is smooth but some guns come punch a bit harder...\nThe cover system works well (one of the best and most fluid I've ever seen!), and other mechanics (execution for example) work nicely too, despite the confusing controls, but although the gameplay mechanics work, it isn't groundbreaking in any stretch of the imagination so the game may get repetitive after your first playthrough so the final difficulty unlocked after beating the game may never be experienced due to the repetitive nature of the gameplay.\nSpec Ops is one of those "don't miss it" games, and, despite it's *minimal* flaws, it deserves an 9.5/10\nWhile the game doesn't really surprise in the beggining, the situation gets better in the middle and end, so youtube gameplay may not be helpful to make up your mind. Also, only when you *are playing the game yourself* does the game appeal, not in gameplay videos, in my opinion.

I jumped in expecting another mindless shooter with loose story, but found myself in love with this game and its story.\n\nOn the technical aspect, the gameplay is relatively simple and easy. Suicide difficulty is not incredibly challenging, but a large factor of combat is to utilise your Delta squad and hide behind cover. The game can be completed in under 7 hours, probably less, which seems perfect as the story isn't drawn on and combat seems fast enough behind cover that you aren't getting entirely bored.\n\nGraphically, I am also surprised at how beautiful this game can look. Your Delta squad continues to degrade and gain battle scars, blood, and torn clothing as the game progresses and otherwise looks like days of fighting in Dubai. The scenery and city looks amazing as well! I play with a GIGABYTE P35K-1 with nVidia GTX 765m and ran everything to the max and had no flops.\n\nStory: 10/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nStrength of Denial: 100/10","December 25, 2014","true","6.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Compared to fps like Mass Effects, CoDs & Battle Fields etc, the controls for Spec Ops is a little unsmooth. I struggled to shoot behind cover most of the time becoz the character would suddenly stand up and get shot.\n\nGameplay-wise its a little mix of good and bad. Some parts of the game really depends on your luck. You replay the same part after dying for a few times, doing the same thing and finally get through after trying many times. AI is mediocre, but you definitely can't Rambo like you do in CoD.\n\nGraphics are ok, I know some people complained about the lack of details, but overall I think its still acceptable. The game is 2 years old anyway.\n\nStory. Especially after playing recent CoDs & BFs with terrible storyline & endings, Spec Ops' story definitely got me hooked.

And looking at the metacritic score and the name itself I rather expected it to be another generic, mediocre shooter.\nOh boy, I couldn't have been more wrong!!\n\nGameplaywise it totally fits that description. It is a Gears of War-esque Shooter with slightly harsher damage model.\nGraphics are typical PS3/Xbox360 stuff. On the other hand the Leveldesign, though linear, is well made and creates a atmospheric and breathtaking environment I often found myself starring at in appreciation.\nAI is decent. Squadmates are actually useful, taking cover and supporting you. Enemy AI will use suppressive and cover fire and try to flank you and also use grenades to flush you out of cover.\nNot gonna talk about MP. Yager studio themself said in an interview they didn't want it and they didn't do it. But Publisher 2K still made a different studio do it and shoe-horned it in...\nSo what is the BIG selling point of this game? It's narrative!\n\nIf "Apocalypse Now" (and for that matter "Heart of Darkness") was a game, this is what it would be like. You will see plenty of references and parallels but rest assured, the game isn't just a copy. It has a story in its own right and goes its own ways.\n\nAs the story unfolds the lines between good and evil will start to dissolve until there is nothing left. You are being dragged into a conflict you have no concept off and always left one step behind. It keeps spiraling out of control fast as things turn sour and ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan - mainly because of your own ignorance - while you also have to bear the dire consequences of your actions.\n\nOn the metalevel the game is toying with alot of our preconceptions about Shooters, how violence and morality is represented and going into some other really deep stuff if you start thinking about it.\nSpecOps deliberately keeps giving the players red herrings, false targets and vague objectives and watches us kill again and again regardlessly. It says we need to blow up some people and we do it.\nBecause it is what needs to be done to accomplish the mission, right?  "We have no choice" like Cpt. Walker says. After all we are the good guys, fighting for a just cause with only the best intentions. Violence is a mere necessity.\nWho would have thought those people might be unarmed civilians with children? And at the next loading screen you will be asked  “Do you feel like a hero yet?”\nThat effectively is what SpecOps is all about: to ♥♥♥♥ with your head and expectations. This game is a mind ♥♥♥♥ through and through.\n\nBottom line: don't let yourself be put off by it's looks, because there is more to it than it first seems. You should really give it a try! Chances are you won't be disappointed.","May 16, 2014","true","9.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Essentially, it is gaming's Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now.\n\nThe Gameplay is standard cover shooter fare, so it begins to feel a bit tired towards the final third of the game, but given the story content, I almost feel that this exhaustion with the game mechanics helps reinforce the themes of the game - which I will not comment on here, and instead say: Play this game, it is an amazing piece of work that is sadly vastly underappreciated.\n\n"Survivors: One too many."","January 20, 2014","true","6.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've heard the multiplayer is terrible, if you can find anyone still playing it at all.\n\nSo why is this game so amazing? The story in the campaign. It plays on your psyche, messes with your head, and makes you question why you even play games like this. It's a critique of the entire genre, one that desperately needed to be made. Why do we, as gamers, typically like to shoot things for fun? Is killing people in a video game truly harmless? If so, should we still enjoy it as much as we do?\n\nThe story draws from some classics for inspiration (most notably Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad), but it takes what it needs and expands on the rest. It takes some classic conventions, and finds a way to use that to tell its own story, and tell a completely new and fresh message.\n\n"To kill for yourself is murder.

Why? Because Spec Ops: The Line is a commentary as much as it is a game. Since the story is what makes this game gold, I'll avoid saying too much, but the game does a good job of making the player aware of the struggles on all sides of war. On top of this, it continually references the destructive military culture of America, and questions the player whether they are truly okay with the way media treats war in general.\n\nIt's all done in a way that simply poses a question : Do you feel like a hero yet?\n\n","May 14, 2015","true","29.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Do -not- play it.\n\n"It's my game for 2012, not necessarily for being the best game functionally but for being the game that most ♥♥♥♥ing deserves to be played...It's one for the history books! Or at the very least, it will make you want to pick up a history book and hit yourself with it until you're a less horrible person." - Yahtzee (Zero Punctuation)\n\n"Being in the modern military is probably one of the hardest, most trying things a person can do and it's so great to see a game make more of that than a simple power fantasy." - Extra Credits\n\nIf you're looking for a mindless, nationalistic military shooter, this isn't it. No other shooters have explored the weight that comes with pulling the trigger in war more than this game has. Although the mechanics are a part of the storytelling, the gameplay isn't as advanced as the current flurry of Call of Dutys, Battlefields, or Medal of Honors but the trade off is worth it. Those games don't even bother trying to touch on what most soldiers struggle with (mainly PTSD) and focus on glorifying and romanticizing war. It's honest, visceral, and engaging in all its literal and metaphorical symbolism.\n\nIf you decide to pick this up, and I strongly suggest that you do, experience it for the single-player story. The multiplayer was just an added bonus but do not judge the entire game by it if you decide to try that out first. It'll be one of the most eye-opening gaming experiences you'll ever have. The game trusts you to make your own decisions.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is well worth your money if you like anything that gives more thought into context rather than content.

I love this game. I love it more than Portal, more than Half Life and more than CS GO. This game is underrated and didn't get the attention that it deserved.\n\nGraphics and Audio- This game looks really good for 2012. The environments are rich and have so much detail. You can even use your surroundings to your advantage. The models look great for both characters and weapons. The only thing that I don't like about the graphics is that some cutscenes look worse than the actual game and they seem poorly rendered. The audio is also great and has a lot of depth to it, but the audio design seems simple. What I mean is that the stronger guns sound more powerful than the weaker guns, but this doesn't bother me.\n93/100\n\nGameplay-This game plays kinda like Gears-of-War and shares some similar mechanics. For example, when you sprint your camera gets lower and your character is slouching. Also, you can vault over cover while behind it and you can switch cover if you are looking at it. But, the gunplay is different. Each gun is designed for a different situation. For example: most shotguns are ment for close range, the ARs are ment for medium range, the SMGs are ment for close-medium range and shooting while on the move and so on. The gameplay can get annoying at time since sometimes, while your character slides into cover, he can get riddled with bullets and even get killed. This gets really annoying and even frustrating at times.\n84/100\n\nStory- I'm not going to spoil you the story because it is just amazing. Once you play through it, you might leave with some unanswered questions. This is good becuase that means that this is a game that makes you think about what happened, what you did and if you really are the Walker you think you are. Also, there is a lot of character development. First you start off with three cocky Delta operatives and through out the story, they change and by the end, they are completely different characters. The story is the best I have ever seen in a video game.\n100/100\n\nMultiplayer- The multiplayer doesn't use the story so you don't really care if you loose or not and the game modes aren't even that great. It's just gunplay here.\n65/100\n\nFinal Verdict-I highly recommend this game to anyone that is tired of CoD campaigns going over the top and making you think about what you are doing. Right now this game is $30 and I think that is a fair price. The Final score is an 85.5/100, but that is with the multiplayer. If you take it out than this game becomes a 92.33./100. The second score is more accurate and if multiplayer wasn't in the game, I think $30 is still a good price. If you don't want to pay $30, you can wait a bit since I see this game on sale a lot or you can get for a great price online. The story will blow you away and make you want to play more, so give this game a try.","August 9, 2015","true","9.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","7"

Your mission in Dubai is to save some people, but how far you go to save them,  the further you will go into insanity.\n\nTo give my opinion about the experience of playing the game, I have to say it, at first it felt generic to me. ( like the trailers felt generic to me) I didn't really care about anything or anyone. The game felt like a parody of modern shooters, because it was so generic. But after I reached a certain point in the game I finally saw what makes this game so special. And that is letting you feel the pain of making choices in war.\n\nThere were some gameplay parts that were exciting but most of the time it wasn't. The only thing this shooter has that other shooter don't, is the use of sand, which hasn't been used that much sadly in the game. You can use your A.I. partners to help you. Sadly, you can only order them to throw flashbangs or target enemies. So you can't really execute big tactical moves with them. But I have to say on the hardcore difficulty I played the game on they sometimes were useful. Except when you have to revive them...  There are stealth missions, that are just 'kill these 3 people and than just go on shooting again.' I had really hoped that they would expand on those parts just for the variety.\n\nThe levels are really well styled with a lot of detail. But, in many places, it doesn't look that amazing graphically, I think the reason for that is due it being an unreal 3 game. This also contributes to the game looking often like a generic shooter.\n\nI really liked when the game let you made in-game choices because they felt well thought out. This occasionally stops the game being a 'shoot everything that moves' game, and allows you, for example, to make a choice whether to kill or not to kill someone. But, often you will be shooting everything you see, which struck me as strange. Sadly, these choices have no effort on the game ending. You will always get the same two endings to choose from. Once I completed the singleplayer I reloaded a save to see the other ending I didn't choose. I also reloaded some missions to get 3 collectables, most of the time they are easy to find, because of the invisible walls. The collectables told some other stories. Also helped with the achievements, which are easy to get in the game.\n\nI would really recommend this game to anyone who is interested in war. The game really made you confront with what you done and makes the line between good or bad people invisible. It also made me think about different aspects of war while playing it.\n\n(Co-op &  Multiplayer:\nYou should get the game for the singleplayer experience.\n\nI haven't played the 2 player co-op, but, from what I have seen, it is just 5 edited levels from the singleplayer. I guess they are just okay, because nobody is talking about it.\n\nFrom the multiplayer I have played I can say it is what you would expect from the game after having completed the singleplayer. If you are interested in playing it, you can join the spec ops group  here	  , which has just recently been made. It already has many people joined up, though that could be because there aren't many proper online third-person cover-based shooters on steam. ( correct me if I am wrong ) They are also working on some mods. Still, if you search for an online match normally you will find nobody.)\n\nIn short: Spec Ops: The line is a third person cover-based shooter which shows that killing people doesn't make you feel like a hero.","December 24, 2014","true","9.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

The scenery you go through is stunningly beautiful and devastating at the same time. I love the level design. Along the way you have to make choices that carries real consequences. You can use the environment as cover and as means of destruction. You get a wide variety of weapons with limited ammo and face waves of varied enemies that want to take you down. Tha AI seemed quite good in this game. And there is hidden intel to find.\n\nI found the game hugely entertaining, but it also leaves a foul taste in the mouth.

About the cutscenes, the editing technique is very well done and the graphics are the same as the rest of the game keeping the action style, the main character suffers an insane transformation to get the end of the game, you can see him as a wild animal cornered trying to save his life by destroying his hunters, look at his eyes.\n\nAbout the sound, is all realistic about gunshots, blasts and enviromental, the voice acting is superb, i read they hired Desmond from assassins creed, in that game he kinda sucked but here he really delivers all his lines, the interaction with the characters is also really good, lets say something like at the begining he sounds like all technical and professional soldier, but later on he becomes sadistic and full of rage and you can hear him getting all psychotic, its insane.\n\nAbout playability, what, lots of guns, explosives, properly represented-- and is really friendly to master combat techniques, there is also some interaction degree, like firing heavy machine guns or issuing orders to squad members, also destroying certain parts in the map to let sand bury your enemies alive, all the good ♥♥♥♥, but is in the command to your guys stuff that i found the weak point in this game, The AI is mostly lame as it gets, if you fail to cover them, your guys will run into certain death and that is more troubles for you. About the dificulty level, easy is for dumb ♥♥♥♥s, on the other side, FUBAR dificulty will get your ♥♥♥ on the grill, hard as nails, it is a big challenge.\n\nLast words.. man i loved this adventure, but it left me with a weird feeling in my soul (?), something other war games failed to portray, lets say call of fruty, where enemies fall just like shapes under your relentless gunfire, this game will make you think over your choices, war is not fun, i really dont know when we desensitized so much about killing other humans, i know ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, its just a game but think about it, you're getting used to the idea of unloading your mag upon other humans without feeling anything, thats not right.

An oasis of technology and lust in the middle of desert. Magnificent buildings in a developed city. But nature is always more ruthless than our ability to oppose. Destroyed by intense sandstorms, a city in ruins. The 33rd Battalion of the American army is sent to town for a rescue and extraction operation of the survivors. And then, they disappear from the map.\n\nYou are Captain Martin Walker, leader of an elite team of Delta Force of the Army of the United States of America, leading his fellow Lieutenant Alphanso Adams, heavy gunner and Sergeant John Lugo, sniper. Sent to Dubai after a transmission captured after six months without contact, his mission is to locate, reunite and rescue possible survivors.\n\nBeautiful scenarios, even among ruins. The opulence of Dubai can be seen in the ruins and in few places that remained intact. Even the desert, displays an exotic beauty that brings a melancholy tone to the game.\n\nSpec Ops is not just a shooting game in third person. It is a psychological plot. Every dialogue, every action, every event in this journey shows you more than bullets flying. Dubai is alive. Dubai is at war. And war... war never changes. The horrors of war are not shown as simple digital polygons falling to the ground with AI off. You will really feel them. You will hesitate. You will have anger and and will be thrilled. And maybe you even cry. You'll be confused. Do not stop. Go straight. Reflect, try to understand. Do not come to this game to play. Come to this story to live it. And so, you will not regret it.\n\nGentlemen, welcome to Dubai.\n\nMy Personal Score                Fun:        9/10                Gameplay:        9/10                Ambientation:        9/10                History:        10/10                Replayability:        6/10                Multiplayer:        1/10\n--\n\nSpec Ops The Line - Análise: Perdidos e Condenados\n\nDubai. Um oásis de tecnologia e luxuria em pleno deserto. Construções magníficas em uma cidade extremamente desenvolvida. Mas a natureza, é sempre mais impiedosa do que nossa capacidade de nos opor. Destruída por intensas tempestades de areia, uma cidade em ruínas. O 33º batalhão do exército americano é enviado a cidade para uma operação de resgate e extração dos sobreviventes. E então, eles desaparecem do mapa.\n\nVocê é o Capitão Martin Walker, líder de uma equipe de elite da Força Delta do Exército dos Estados Unidos da América, liderando seus companheiros Tenente Alphanso Adams, artilheiro pesado e Sargento John Lugo, franco-atirador. Enviados a Dubai após uma transmissão ser captada depois de 6 meses sem contato, sua missão é localizar, reunir e resgatar possíveis sobreviventes.\n\nBelos cenários, mesmo entre ruínas. A opulência de Dubai se destaca em traços que podem ser percebidos nas ruínas e em poucos lugares sobreviventes. Mesmo o deserto, exibe uma exótica beleza que traz um tom melancólico ao jogo.\n\nSpec Ops não é apenas um jogo de tiro em terceira pessoa. É uma trama psicológica. Cada diálogo, cada ação, cada acontecimento nesta jornada te mostra mais do que balas voando. Dubai está viva. Dubai está em guerra. E a guerra... a guerra nunca muda. Os horrores da guerra não são mostrados como simples polígonos digitais caindo ao chão com IA desligada. Você realmente irá sentí-los. Você irá hesitar. Você terá raiva e se emocionará. E talvez, você até mesmo chore. Você ficará confuso. Não pare. Siga em frente. Reflita, procure compreender. Não venha a este jogo para jogar. Venha a esta história para vivê-la. E assim, você não irá se arrepender.\n\nSenhores, bem-vindos a Dubai.\n\nMinhas Notas Pessoais                Diversão:        9/10                Gameplay:        9/10                Ambientação:        9/10                História:        10/10                Rejogabilidade:        6/10                Multiplayer:        1/10","September 5, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even after 4 years, the graphics look nice and the engine works well (no bugs encountered). What made me love this game is the soundtrack, playstyle (getting headshots 24/7), and the story, although the last one is a love-hate relationship, as it shows the somewhat real army life - gorey and brutal, rather than running around killing people (though you have that too, from time to time). Also, the cinematics are pretty amazing, especially towards the end of the game - destroying buildings whilst flying a helicopter - what more could you want? You're allowed to make multiple choices throughout the game, which affect your sanity. The only drawbacks for me are the 30 fps/720p cutscenes, and the length of the game (6 to 12 hours), but that can be justified by the quality of the game, and the multiple choice scenarios. Overall, it's a great and original TPS, definitely deserving more recognition. If you haven't played it, make sure you get it on a sale, it can go for dirt cheap, and it's definitely worth playing.","March 31","true","6.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Your mission in Dubai is to save some people, but how far you go to save them,  the further you will go into insanity.\n\nTo give my opinion about the experience of playing the game, I have to say it, at first it felt generic to me. ( like the trailers felt generic to me) I didn't really care about anything or anyone. The game felt like a parody of modern shooters, because it was so generic. But after I reached a certain point in the game I finally saw what makes this game so special. And that is letting you feel the pain of making choices in war.\n\nThere were some gameplay parts that were exciting but most of the time it wasn't. The only thing this shooter has that other shooter don't, is the use of sand, which hasn't been used that much sadly in the game. You can use your A.I. partners to help you. Sadly, you can only order them to throw flashbangs or target enemies. So you can't really execute big tactical moves with them. But I have to say on the hardcore difficulty I played the game on they sometimes were useful. Except when you have to revive them...  There are stealth missions, that are just 'kill these 3 people and than just go on shooting again.' I had really hoped that they would expand on those parts just for the variety.\n\nThe levels are really well styled with a lot of detail. But, in many places, it doesn't look that amazing graphically, I think the reason for that is due it being an unreal 3 game. This also contributes to the game looking often like a generic shooter.\n\nI really liked when the game let you made in-game choices because they felt well thought out. This occasionally stops the game being a 'shoot everything that moves' game, and allows you, for example, to make a choice whether to kill or not to kill someone. But, often you will be shooting everything you see, which struck me as strange. Sadly, these choices have no effort on the game ending. You will always get the same two endings to choose from. Once I completed the singleplayer I reloaded a save to see the other ending I didn't choose. I also reloaded some missions to get 3 collectables, most of the time they are easy to find, because of the invisible walls. The collectables told some other stories. Also helped with the achievements, which are easy to get in the game.\n\nI would really recommend this game to anyone who is interested in war. The game really made you confront with what you done and makes the line between good or bad people invisible. It also made me think about different aspects of war while playing it.\n\n(Co-op &  Multiplayer:\nYou should get the game for the singleplayer experience.\n\nI haven't played the 2 player co-op, but, from what I have seen, it is just 5 edited levels from the singleplayer. I guess they are just okay, because nobody is talking about it.\n\nFrom the multiplayer I have played I can say it is what you would expect from the game after having completed the singleplayer. If you are interested in playing it, you can join the spec ops group  here	  , which has just recently been made. It already has many people joined up, though that could be because there aren't many proper online third-person cover-based shooters on steam. ( correct me if I am wrong ) They are also working on some mods. Still, if you search for an online match normally you will find nobody.)\n\nIn short: Spec Ops: The line is a third person cover-based shooter which shows that killing people doesn't make you feel like a hero.","December 24, 2014","true","9.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

The scenery you go through is stunningly beautiful and devastating at the same time. I love the level design. Along the way you have to make choices that carries real consequences. You can use the environment as cover and as means of destruction. You get a wide variety of weapons with limited ammo and face waves of varied enemies that want to take you down. Tha AI seemed quite good in this game. And there is hidden intel to find.\n\nI found the game hugely entertaining, but it also leaves a foul taste in the mouth.

As usaul I looked around for reviews on the game lots said it was good and others said it was bad. Yes its not the longest campaign out there, but its short because the campaign would get repetitive, as you are in Dubai which is torn down and you and 2 other members of Delta Squad go in to try and save people. Although the story has an interesting plot twist. For it's normal price which is $29.95 I wouldn't recomend buying it due to the campaign length but when it's on sale like right now for $5.99 it is a bargin. I have not tried the multiplayer but I am sure it should be pretty good or at least decent.","August 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not your typical gung ho shooter in the slightest. The actual gameplay is solid but the story is where it really shines. It's actually pretty subversive and it's clear the writers put a lot of thought into it. I don't want to say too much about the plot as I'd hate to spoil it but it should be experienced by anyone that likes shooters.\n\nThe setting deserves a mention too. It looked fantastic and was dripping in atmosphere.\n\nSounds wrong to say I enjoyed it as some parts are pretty gut wrenching but it's easy to recommend. Just don't blast through it like you would any other shooter.

Even after 4 years, the graphics look nice and the engine works well (no bugs encountered). What made me love this game is the soundtrack, playstyle (getting headshots 24/7), and the story, although the last one is a love-hate relationship, as it shows the somewhat real army life - gorey and brutal, rather than running around killing people (though you have that too, from time to time). Also, the cinematics are pretty amazing, especially towards the end of the game - destroying buildings whilst flying a helicopter - what more could you want? You're allowed to make multiple choices throughout the game, which affect your sanity. The only drawbacks for me are the 30 fps/720p cutscenes, and the length of the game (6 to 12 hours), but that can be justified by the quality of the game, and the multiple choice scenarios. Overall, it's a great and original TPS, definitely deserving more recognition. If you haven't played it, make sure you get it on a sale, it can go for dirt cheap, and it's definitely worth playing.","March 31","true","6.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is pretty short though, you can complete it in about 5 - 7 hours on the normal difficulty. After replaying this game about 5 times to get every single achievement even the one for completing the game on FUBAR (which was brutal and almost made me commit a war crime on my computer) I can safely say that I understand the story of the game (at least that's what I say to look cool). I won't be revealing details about the story for people like Vikezor who don't want anything to be spoiled for them even though they may never even play this game in their lives, but what I WILL say is that it isn't your typical military shooter story about taking out a terrorist leader threatening to blow up Pluto or something. The story is pretty unique and left me questioning ''What happens next?''. The story makes you think about war and the attrocities people commit under speciffic circumstances. It also has multiple endings about 4 I think and a few descisions you have to make during the story. The soundtrack to this game is also amazing, it fits the story pretty well and makes me wanna replay it to be able to battle enemies while listening to some rocking tunes. Without going into the hostile spoiler lands I can't really say much more so I will cross the border into them for a few seconds to say this:\n\nSPOLERS YO KIDS SPOILERS RIGHT HERE\n\nThe game left me wondering what happens to Walker after he leaves Dubai in that one ending where you shoot at Konrad in the mirror and don't kill the US soldiers that arrive to extract you. Questions like ''What's he gonna do now? Will the things he's seen and done haunt him forever? And did he even have any family to return to?'' popped into mind while watching Marty boy leave Dubai.\n\nEND OF THE SPOILERS KIDS\n\nIn general I personally think this game is amazing because of the story. However the developers have revealed that they won't be making a sequel or another game in the Spec Ops series for a while because as amazing as the game is it didn't make them a lot of money, not as much as they hoped for at least.\n\nFinal score: 578/603\n\nP.S.

I love this game. I love it more than Portal, more than Half Life and more than CS GO. This game is underrated and didn't get the attention that it deserved.\n\nGraphics and Audio- This game looks really good for 2012. The environments are rich and have so much detail. You can even use your surroundings to your advantage. The models look great for both characters and weapons. The only thing that I don't like about the graphics is that some cutscenes look worse than the actual game and they seem poorly rendered. The audio is also great and has a lot of depth to it, but the audio design seems simple. What I mean is that the stronger guns sound more powerful than the weaker guns, but this doesn't bother me.\n93/100\n\nGameplay-This game plays kinda like Gears-of-War and shares some similar mechanics. For example, when you sprint your camera gets lower and your character is slouching. Also, you can vault over cover while behind it and you can switch cover if you are looking at it. But, the gunplay is different. Each gun is designed for a different situation. For example: most shotguns are ment for close range, the ARs are ment for medium range, the SMGs are ment for close-medium range and shooting while on the move and so on. The gameplay can get annoying at time since sometimes, while your character slides into cover, he can get riddled with bullets and even get killed. This gets really annoying and even frustrating at times.\n84/100\n\nStory- I'm not going to spoil you the story because it is just amazing. Once you play through it, you might leave with some unanswered questions. This is good becuase that means that this is a game that makes you think about what happened, what you did and if you really are the Walker you think you are. Also, there is a lot of character development. First you start off with three cocky Delta operatives and through out the story, they change and by the end, they are completely different characters. The story is the best I have ever seen in a video game.\n100/100\n\nMultiplayer- The multiplayer doesn't use the story so you don't really care if you loose or not and the game modes aren't even that great. It's just gunplay here.\n65/100\n\nFinal Verdict-I highly recommend this game to anyone that is tired of CoD campaigns going over the top and making you think about what you are doing. Right now this game is $30 and I think that is a fair price. The Final score is an 85.5/100, but that is with the multiplayer. If you take it out than this game becomes a 92.33./100. The second score is more accurate and if multiplayer wasn't in the game, I think $30 is still a good price. If you don't want to pay $30, you can wait a bit since I see this game on sale a lot or you can get for a great price online. The story will blow you away and make you want to play more, so give this game a try.","August 9, 2015","true","9.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","7"

An oasis of technology and lust in the middle of desert. Magnificent buildings in a developed city. But nature is always more ruthless than our ability to oppose. Destroyed by intense sandstorms, a city in ruins. The 33rd Battalion of the American army is sent to town for a rescue and extraction operation of the survivors. And then, they disappear from the map.\n\nYou are Captain Martin Walker, leader of an elite team of Delta Force of the Army of the United States of America, leading his fellow Lieutenant Alphanso Adams, heavy gunner and Sergeant John Lugo, sniper. Sent to Dubai after a transmission captured after six months without contact, his mission is to locate, reunite and rescue possible survivors.\n\nBeautiful scenarios, even among ruins. The opulence of Dubai can be seen in the ruins and in few places that remained intact. Even the desert, displays an exotic beauty that brings a melancholy tone to the game.\n\nSpec Ops is not just a shooting game in third person. It is a psychological plot. Every dialogue, every action, every event in this journey shows you more than bullets flying. Dubai is alive. Dubai is at war. And war... war never changes. The horrors of war are not shown as simple digital polygons falling to the ground with AI off. You will really feel them. You will hesitate. You will have anger and and will be thrilled. And maybe you even cry. You'll be confused. Do not stop. Go straight. Reflect, try to understand. Do not come to this game to play. Come to this story to live it. And so, you will not regret it.\n\nGentlemen, welcome to Dubai.\n\nMy Personal Score                Fun:        9/10                Gameplay:        9/10                Ambientation:        9/10                History:        10/10                Replayability:        6/10                Multiplayer:        1/10\n--\n\nSpec Ops The Line - Análise: Perdidos e Condenados\n\nDubai. Um oásis de tecnologia e luxuria em pleno deserto. Construções magníficas em uma cidade extremamente desenvolvida. Mas a natureza, é sempre mais impiedosa do que nossa capacidade de nos opor. Destruída por intensas tempestades de areia, uma cidade em ruínas. O 33º batalhão do exército americano é enviado a cidade para uma operação de resgate e extração dos sobreviventes. E então, eles desaparecem do mapa.\n\nVocê é o Capitão Martin Walker, líder de uma equipe de elite da Força Delta do Exército dos Estados Unidos da América, liderando seus companheiros Tenente Alphanso Adams, artilheiro pesado e Sargento John Lugo, franco-atirador. Enviados a Dubai após uma transmissão ser captada depois de 6 meses sem contato, sua missão é localizar, reunir e resgatar possíveis sobreviventes.\n\nBelos cenários, mesmo entre ruínas. A opulência de Dubai se destaca em traços que podem ser percebidos nas ruínas e em poucos lugares sobreviventes. Mesmo o deserto, exibe uma exótica beleza que traz um tom melancólico ao jogo.\n\nSpec Ops não é apenas um jogo de tiro em terceira pessoa. É uma trama psicológica. Cada diálogo, cada ação, cada acontecimento nesta jornada te mostra mais do que balas voando. Dubai está viva. Dubai está em guerra. E a guerra... a guerra nunca muda. Os horrores da guerra não são mostrados como simples polígonos digitais caindo ao chão com IA desligada. Você realmente irá sentí-los. Você irá hesitar. Você terá raiva e se emocionará. E talvez, você até mesmo chore. Você ficará confuso. Não pare. Siga em frente. Reflita, procure compreender. Não venha a este jogo para jogar. Venha a esta história para vivê-la. E assim, você não irá se arrepender.\n\nSenhores, bem-vindos a Dubai.\n\nMinhas Notas Pessoais                Diversão:        9/10                Gameplay:        9/10                Ambientação:        9/10                História:        10/10                Rejogabilidade:        6/10                Multiplayer:        1/10","September 5, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even after 4 years, the graphics look nice and the engine works well (no bugs encountered). What made me love this game is the soundtrack, playstyle (getting headshots 24/7), and the story, although the last one is a love-hate relationship, as it shows the somewhat real army life - gorey and brutal, rather than running around killing people (though you have that too, from time to time). Also, the cinematics are pretty amazing, especially towards the end of the game - destroying buildings whilst flying a helicopter - what more could you want? You're allowed to make multiple choices throughout the game, which affect your sanity. The only drawbacks for me are the 30 fps/720p cutscenes, and the length of the game (6 to 12 hours), but that can be justified by the quality of the game, and the multiple choice scenarios. Overall, it's a great and original TPS, definitely deserving more recognition. If you haven't played it, make sure you get it on a sale, it can go for dirt cheap, and it's definitely worth playing.","March 31","true","6.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The storyline is what makes this game a true and EXCELLENT game despite its flawed and boring combat system, the story will keep you on your edge for about a good 3-6 hours, constantly while playing you keep delving yourself into the story until you know you have to beat this game; this game has a lot of twists in it that it will have you leaning to your monitor and when you finally see the end of the game you will gasp with awe and be in shock (which I rarely get shocked or am in awe as I am a very mellow person)\n\nSPOILED VERSION: You, Adams and Lugo are all 3 Delta Operatives that are sent into Dubai to find Komrad (a general) and over time you realize Dubai is a utter ♥♥♥♥ storm, you try to find everything out and keep pushing you and your men forward. You accidentally kill civilians with a mortar, but you keep going on and at the end of the game, you realize everything you did, all your actions to "help" the people of Dubai, you realize your guy that you're playing as is MENTALLY ILL which is a SICK TWIST but a great twist and you realize as your guy starts to flash back everything that he talked to corpses, made up scenarios as his troops stood by questioning him but followed his orders.\n\nYou would buy this game for the story rather than the gameplay.

Whilst the gameplay mechanics are pretty traditional and bring little to the table, the story is fantastic. The Line is a linear game through and through but does a very good job of making the player feel responsible for the actions they carry out. Part of this is due to the illusions of choice that occasionally pop up through the game, allowing you to feel as though your decisions will make a difference. Multiple endings add a bit of spice to it as well.

An action/adventure title which grips you with just above average game-play mechanics. Along side that, there is profound situational scenarios that forces an analytical and emotional side from you, with every decision. It may seem like you start as, just, another soldier given, just, another mission. Although, as you act in what seems to be an orderly manner, you begin to question the authenticity, or integrity of such orders. You begin to question because of the veracious nature of these orders. It becomes difficult and even, regretful, when you persist to just 'follow orders.'\n\nIt is a game which for the most part of the story, is confusing. Your distaste by all the violence you do as this character, I don't want to give any spoilers but there are some really deep philosophical questions that the game provokes from you, after these unfortunate situations. All that thought, accumulates into a severe confusion and doubt about where this is all going. Why so much pain? So much death?...Well, the ending holds a powerful question, the question is what will you do?\n\nIn regards to the game-play mechanics, they're inherently superficial and refined. This allows for the player to not completely focus on just the action, but the scenery, the sounds, the presentation of a doomed Dubai. There were many breathtaking scenes, in which I have numerous images for.\n\nThere is only one reason one should purchase this game, it is if you are looking for a intellectually provocative game. Take head tho, there is alot of filler action. Seemingly useless scenes of violence. Furthermore, I would like to add, that discussing such an issue, as this game does, with such a small script, was impressive. I hope the studio is working on the next of the series, maybe one that jumps further deep into the monstrous acts of war, and the repercussions of those wars.\n\n","March 23, 2014","true","5.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It was released on 26 June 2012 in North America and 29 June 2012 internationally for Microsoft Windows, and the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles.\nn Spec Ops: The Line, the player controls Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a reconnaissance mission, where they find dead American soldiers. Upon the finding, Walker declares that the team's mission has changed, and that they will search Dubai for survivors\n\nSpec Ops: does so many good things right, but falls short from a masterpiece. While the game is a brilliant set-piece of PTSD and the true horrors of war, it falls short as a game in whole. While the story, soundtrack, voice acting, visuals and overall quality is amazing, it's gameplay is just so generic and boring. Nothing new will be seen here, unfourtunately. The game is a third-person cover shooter game, with no originality. The cover system and gunplay are mediocre at best, and this is a real drawback from it being an amazing experience in all sectors. But, I really don't want to get too much into such details, it's just something you've played in a hundred other games, let's focus on what's so amazing about this underrated game.\n\nThe story. It may sounds like something trivial, because people have high standards these days, amazing gameplay, amazing graphics, amazing this amazing that, you get my point. This game is narative driven game, and that's it. Multiplayer is shallow and unstatisfying, but this isn't the point of Spec Ops. It's a game that sets one goal, and one goal only. To trully showcase the Horror of war. War is a gruesome experience that really scars the human mind, and while me and you won't probably fight in one, this game has a trully shocking way of showing us just how brutal things can get between the gunfire. It will surely have a last impact on you, it did on me at least. The game starts pretty standard, a turret section that's pretty bland and boring, nothing too over the top here. But once the game kick off, things start to get heated. We start in the shoes of Cpt. Martin Walker, voiced by Nolan North. The game starts off with you and your squad mates being sent to the new destroyed Dubai, to investigate and search for survivor, call for reinforcements and get back home. Those are your only orders, nothing more. But things get out of hand once Walker gives to order to  open fire on the enemy. This thing will become more relevant down the line, since this game has set out to question one simple thing, Who is the enemy?. And it will teach you that thing, once you complete it.\n\nBeing developed on the Unreal 3 Engine, the games shines mostly. Dubai is a super showcase of glowing sand, vibrant interiors and a feel of depth and complexity. But it's all just a shell to hide all of the horros that lay ahead of your journey to destruction. The game will soon present to you the brutal, and extremely graphic violence of when things get ouf of hand when people mentally breakdown and can't tell the difference between good or evil. It's amazing, especially since this game breaks once and for all the trope that all enemy's in video games must be shot down immediatly without question, and because they are different or russian/middle eastern. It's superb, to be honest.\n\nIn the end, since I could talk about this game for hours and hours, even though it's a short, but it's an intense ride, and filled with guilt. Never, ever I have felt such guild after playing a videogame. Like, really. Videogames that make you feel guilty? How is that? One might ask. Well, it's quite easy. This game does not reward you for shooting everyone in a 100km radius at the speed of Clint Eastwood, it will break you down as fast as the protagonists. It's amazing how well the story is crafter, considering at the end of the day, it makes you feel human, it makes you question so many things. Superb. Honestly, superb.\n\nIn case you don't want to hear all of my rumbling, I will list the things that I enjoyed and disliked about this game and give it a rating.\n\nThe good\nAmazing story\nSuperb story\nBreathtaking visuals\nRetroactive enviroment\nUnique setting\nIncredible soundtrack/voice acting\nMoral and emotionally heavy\nThe bad\nGeneric gameplay\nMediocre gunplay\nShort lenght\nCookie cutter multiplayer\nNo replay value\nThe cover mechanics are a bit awkward\n\nI give this game a 8/10 rating, thanks to so many good elements in it, falling short, unfortunately to such a generic gameplay. Amazing overall nonetheless, I highly recommend this game to everyone.","August 11, 2014","true","5.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

FTL would be my "hidden gem," but after the whole massive Kickstarter success thing, it was obvious FTL was going to be good in my point of view. Honestly, I used to play Call of Duty and Halo. There. I said it. However, after Black Ops 1, I quit the Call of Duty series and haven't played any of the games since MW3. Halo Reach was the Halo that I played the most, and was the only Halo game (Halo 3 and Wars were good though) that I loved and played often. However, above all of these games, Spec Ops: The Line has one of the best stories of all time. It isn't like Call of Duty how you're fighting as some American soldier running around solo armed to the teeth with weapons and murdering terrorists and in the end "saving the world." Not at all. Some people believe there are "good guys" and "bad guys," but this game is solid evidence that war is just opinions being decided to the death, sometimes costing one's sanity, social health, emotional health, and physical health. Spec Ops: The Line proves war in no way is enjoyable, cool, or humorous in any kind of way. War is horrific, and this game is enough to prove that.\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals are absolutely outstanding. The environments look beautiful, and the atmosphere is bright on the outside, but dark and horrific on the inside. The characters look amazing, and it's rare you can actually see the sweat of a character in the middle of combat. This game is able to do that. If I were to compare these visuals to The Last of Us, Spec Ops: The Line would win by a mile. These graphics are extremely realistic, but the only con to this is that the facial animations can look weird. For example, when Walker is talking to Lugo or Adams when it isn't a cutscene, it looks like he's gaping every time, like he's shocked at everything for some reason. During cutscenes though, Walker looks fine and doesn't gape like that when he speaks.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is suprisingly the weak point to the game. Although this game is a shooter, Spec Ops is more for people who want a story based game, rather than a gameplay based one. The AI is suicidally bad and the difficulty spikes at times and the awful gunplay ruins it even more. My squadmates keep bumping into me and I die, one enemy shot 3 RPG rockets in a row without reloading for some reason (He had an RPG, I saw him with the weapon, I swear!) and the AI prefer running toward me like overconfident barbarians. However, the game understands the meaning of "limited" unlike other games *cough* Call of Duty *cough* *cough* and makes ammo a bit more difficult to get, so that's something few games did that aren't in the zombie survival genre.\n\nStory\nThe story is the reason Spec Ops is highly praised. Like I said before, it proves that war is a terrible thing and (quoted from Fallout 3) "never changes." Lugo, Adams, and Walker's bond with each other was strong, like they were old friends, then all of a sudden, Lugo and Adams part away from Walker, realizing that he's gone insane, but Adams is still merely following orders, while Lugo wants to make a stand. You realize that Walker is in no way a hero, but calling him a villain is illogical. The plot twist around the midst of the game was amazing and blew my mind. I'm going to do another quote, but this time from one of my favorite songs: "This ain't no place for no hero, this ain't no place for no- better man, this ain't no place for no hero, to call home." -"Short Change Hero" by The Heavy. It perfectly describes the story, mixed with the atmosphere, and how the characters develop over time in the destroyed and now insane city of Dubai. I assure you, this game has one of the finest stories in gaming. It seems like 2012 was the year for gaming, since games like this and The Walking Dead came out and wowed us with their storytelling. In the end, the story for this game is simply outstanding.\n\nAudio\nThe audio is also amazing for this game. The voice actors did an amazing job with their roles, and all showed personality. They  weren't androids and were kind of like the Mass Effect characters, in a way you grow attached to them because they feel like real, breathing humans. But you still gotta hate Walker. Then, hate yourself while you're at it for doing all the harsh decisions. Name me a few other games that truly make you want to hate yourself that much. The music is similar to those found in a zombie apocalypse game, like the recent ones State of Decay and The Last of Us. It's usually a guitar backed up by a few other instruments or the guitar playing solo. It sounds beautiful and fits in perfectly. The audio in this game is some of the finest in recent gaming.\n\nReplayability\nIt's a bit more difficult to provide replayability to a game like this, unfortunately. However, you could go back and get all the endings. The multiplayer is pretty dead, so I haven't had any chance to try it yet. Either way, I suppose the replayability in this game is determinant.\n\nVerdict\nIn conclusion, Spec Ops: The Line proves war is terrifying and that it's not fun at all. However, the horrible gameplay holds it down significantly, along with a dead multiplayer and the jaw drops that happen when Walker talks while playing (Not in a cutscene) hold it back. Either way, Spec Ops: The Line is a must have for any story based game buyer. I highly recommend this gem.\n\nGraphics- 9.5/10\nGameplay- 4/10\nStory- 10/10\nAudio- 10/10\nReplayability- 5.5/10\n\n.:8.2/10:.\n\n+Pheonominal story\n+Outstanding visuals\n+Developed characters\n+Top notch voice acting\n+Amazing music\n\n-Dead Multiplayer mode\n-Horrible gameplay\n-Walker frequently gaping","July 22, 2014","true","4.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is different than what you would expect on face value. I looked at it once in a game shop and though oh looks like a kinda cool shooter but i have COD for that. My friend told me to pick it up and play it because its ♥♥♥♥ing shocking and actually has some incredible plot elements with twists and turns and some really deep character development. He wasnt ♥♥♥♥ing wrong... This game goes from "Boo Hoo, Cliche squad of justice ridden USA FREEDOM FIGHTER Military Men end up arguing with each other and cause explosions" to Holy ♥♥♥♥ i did so many bad things and i feel ♥♥♥♥ing awful now make me stop. But you cant...\n\nPros:\n- Amazing Story\n- Awesome Narrative Elements: Flashbacks, Plot Twists and Enigmas you will ask yourself a lot\n- Characters are developped incredibly through the course of the game\n- War isnt a typical glorified actiony explodey fun time. But a gritty and brutal fight for survival that could really harm people physically and mentally.\n- Explores themes of Psychological trauma\n- Actually makes you want to stop or to make things right when sometimes you just cant\n- Has some neat lil tricks that fit what i said above but you will probably not find them on your first playthrough i know i didnt.\n- Difficulty is actually ♥♥♥♥ing enjoyable for once. You arent punished for higher difficulties. Sure the enemy do alot of damage but the player seemingly does aswell, providing a more enjoyable experience while also being tense, keeping to cover and being careful\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ing dead\n- Uses simple and conventional gunplay that glorifies war which can get boring and repetitive and makes the game easy to get through fast. (However is told to be used ironically to shock the player with its dark and gritty twists to be used as a counterbalance that unglorifies it, but the gunplay doesnt change throughout making it still boring after a while)\n\nOverall if you want a darker and grittier war story that actually leaves you shocked and horrified, i really reccomend this game. It may get boring and repetitive but it has been said that the gameplay is like that for irony sake to be of a satire nature in comparison to contemporary modern military shooters. You will only be paying for the single player though because the multiplayer is dead, unless you have a friend willing to play Co-Op which i cant review as i havent played it.\n\nTl:dr Dont judge this game by screenshots.

The storyline is what makes this game a true and EXCELLENT game despite its flawed and boring combat system, the story will keep you on your edge for about a good 3-6 hours, constantly while playing you keep delving yourself into the story until you know you have to beat this game; this game has a lot of twists in it that it will have you leaning to your monitor and when you finally see the end of the game you will gasp with awe and be in shock (which I rarely get shocked or am in awe as I am a very mellow person)\n\nSPOILED VERSION: You, Adams and Lugo are all 3 Delta Operatives that are sent into Dubai to find Komrad (a general) and over time you realize Dubai is a utter ♥♥♥♥ storm, you try to find everything out and keep pushing you and your men forward. You accidentally kill civilians with a mortar, but you keep going on and at the end of the game, you realize everything you did, all your actions to "help" the people of Dubai, you realize your guy that you're playing as is MENTALLY ILL which is a SICK TWIST but a great twist and you realize as your guy starts to flash back everything that he talked to corpses, made up scenarios as his troops stood by questioning him but followed his orders.\n\nYou would buy this game for the story rather than the gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxeel/recommended/50300/","dxeel","-P|T- DxeeL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxeel/","234 products in account","Spec Ops: The Line is a 2012 third-person shooter video game developed by Yager Development and published by 2K Games. It was released on 26 June 2012 in North America and 29 June 2012 internationally for Microsoft Windows, and the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles.\nn Spec Ops: The Line, the player controls Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a reconnaissance mission, where they find dead American soldiers. Upon the finding, Walker declares that the team's mission has changed, and that they will search Dubai for survivors\n\nSpec Ops: does so many good things right, but falls short from a masterpiece. While the game is a brilliant set-piece of PTSD and the true horrors of war, it falls short as a game in whole. While the story, soundtrack, voice acting, visuals and overall quality is amazing, it's gameplay is just so generic and boring. Nothing new will be seen here, unfourtunately. The game is a third-person cover shooter game, with no originality. The cover system and gunplay are mediocre at best, and this is a real drawback from it being an amazing experience in all sectors. But, I really don't want to get too much into such details, it's just something you've played in a hundred other games, let's focus on what's so amazing about this underrated game.\n\nThe story. It may sounds like something trivial, because people have high standards these days, amazing gameplay, amazing graphics, amazing this amazing that, you get my point. This game is narative driven game, and that's it. Multiplayer is shallow and unstatisfying, but this isn't the point of Spec Ops. It's a game that sets one goal, and one goal only. To trully showcase the Horror of war. War is a gruesome experience that really scars the human mind, and while me and you won't probably fight in one, this game has a trully shocking way of showing us just how brutal things can get between the gunfire. It will surely have a last impact on you, it did on me at least. The game starts pretty standard, a turret section that's pretty bland and boring, nothing too over the top here. But once the game kick off, things start to get heated. We start in the shoes of Cpt. Martin Walker, voiced by Nolan North. The game starts off with you and your squad mates being sent to the new destroyed Dubai, to investigate and search for survivor, call for reinforcements and get back home. Those are your only orders, nothing more. But things get out of hand once Walker gives to order to  open fire on the enemy. This thing will become more relevant down the line, since this game has set out to question one simple thing, Who is the enemy?. And it will teach you that thing, once you complete it.\n\nBeing developed on the Unreal 3 Engine, the games shines mostly. Dubai is a super showcase of glowing sand, vibrant interiors and a feel of depth and complexity. But it's all just a shell to hide all of the horros that lay ahead of your journey to destruction. The game will soon present to you the brutal, and extremely graphic violence of when things get ouf of hand when people mentally breakdown and can't tell the difference between good or evil. It's amazing, especially since this game breaks once and for all the trope that all enemy's in video games must be shot down immediatly without question, and because they are different or russian/middle eastern. It's superb, to be honest.\n\nIn the end, since I could talk about this game for hours and hours, even though it's a short, but it's an intense ride, and filled with guilt. Never, ever I have felt such guild after playing a videogame. Like, really. Videogames that make you feel guilty? How is that? One might ask. Well, it's quite easy. This game does not reward you for shooting everyone in a 100km radius at the speed of Clint Eastwood, it will break you down as fast as the protagonists. It's amazing how well the story is crafter, considering at the end of the day, it makes you feel human, it makes you question so many things. Superb. Honestly, superb.\n\nIn case you don't want to hear all of my rumbling, I will list the things that I enjoyed and disliked about this game and give it a rating.\n\nThe good\nAmazing story\nSuperb story\nBreathtaking visuals\nRetroactive enviroment\nUnique setting\nIncredible soundtrack/voice acting\nMoral and emotionally heavy\nThe bad\nGeneric gameplay\nMediocre gunplay\nShort lenght\nCookie cutter multiplayer\nNo replay value\nThe cover mechanics are a bit awkward\n\nI give this game a 8/10 rating, thanks to so many good elements in it, falling short, unfortunately to such a generic gameplay. Amazing overall nonetheless, I highly recommend this game to everyone.","August 11, 2014","true","5.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","Game reminds me a LOT of Binary Domain; another third-person shooter (wall humping and military lingo included) with average gameplay and a fantastic plot. I'm not gonna dwell too long on the game mechanics. It's typical stuff with nothing impressive or worth mentioning. This is one of those games that's more about everything BESIDES the gameplay, which says more about the writing than anything negative about the gameplay. I will only complain about one thing: the game has mechanics that are severely underused. Specifically, silencers, which would let you sneak around getting kills if the game dedicated more to that aspect.\n\nAnyway, the plot is fantastic, and its SPECTACULAR how it handles good and evil. Ultimately, the paradigm (big word alert) is meaningless here; everyone has their motives and reasons for doing what they do. The game weaves a complex narrative that ultimately pins you as neither a 'good guy' nor a 'bad guy'; you are merely someone doing what he believes is right. Emphasis on ''believes'' because all supposedly moral actions in this game are subject to questioning.\n\nI love the title for that alone. I love when villains are given motives and reasons for their actions other than ''I am bad raawr come get me in my evil evil castle''. They took it a step further by making the protagonist's morality ambiguous as well, and you get to shape some of it along the way. There are some segments where you have to make choices, and the writing makes it so that each option in these segments is a valid choice. Moral choices in games tend to boil down to ''kill grandma; don't kill grandma'', so there's never really any critical thinking involved; developers take note, this game does it right.\n\nI could go on and on about how the pacing is done very well and how I love the narrative. But I'll end on a few unrelated notes:\n\n-For a console game this ♥♥♥♥ looks great. This dude's bald head is so...so bald.\n-The menu changes as you play the title, which is a cool touch. It's little things like that that give a title some flavor.\n-The game is loosely based on an old novel from the 19th century. So, like Binary Domain, it isn't exactly original.\n-You might not get sound in pre-rendered cut-scenes. It's a bug having to do with NVIDIA cards or some ♥♥♥♥. Anyway, the fix is insanely simple and there's a thread on the forums about it. Or you could watch pre-rendered stuff on youtube.\n\nThe game's pretty short and straight-forward. I love strong narratives so I can't recommend this enough. And while you're at it, pick up Binary Domain as well.","April 20, 2014","true","16.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This game will make you feel like a monster at the end. You'll see the destruction you caused, the violence you inflicted on people, and the deterioration of your soldier's mind.\n\nThe gameplay in Spec Ops is really nothing special. It's a Gears of War-type shooter. You're in third person, you shoot enemies, you hide behind cover, you make things go boom, so and so forth. Playing a demo of this game will not do you justice. Sampling a portion of this full course will either make you crave more and throw it away. If it needs to be experienced, it needs to be experienced in it's entirety. Through out the 14 chapters, the gameplay stayed mainly consistent, with turret sections and tons of cover shooting. It's simple, and can get repetitive very quickly. There's nothing special about this gameplay. Some scripted sequences are definitely pretty cool, but other than that, you're going to be shooting and hiding behind cover for most of the time.\n\nSpec Ops is all about story, though. You might think that story has no impact on a generic military shooter like this, but you would be wrong. The story in this game is incredible; it's like a good book you can't put down. It's very well written, and in the end, you'll transform into a hurly, burly tough man into a hollow shell of a human being.\n\nI highly recommend playing this game. First time I played this, I felt that it was just a simple third person shooter with nothing to offer. After friends told me about it further, I tried it again and realized it was about the story. I was super impressed with this game. If you do choose to play it, make sure you don't look up any info of the story on the internet, it will give stuff away. You'll want to experience it for yourself.","January 22, 2014","true","5.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Enemies comes in varied forms, from light soldiers to heavy-armored juggernauts.\n\nWith a good plot, and a good concept for a war game, give it a try, as you won't find such a realistic approach in another game.\n\nIt's worth every penny.","December 31, 2013","true","6.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"Kind of good" is an understatement. I was really amazed by this game, it's one of the most profound games I've ever played. It can be seen as an "Anti Call of Duty", because the setting of the game could also be as well the setting of the next Call of Duty edition. But the story develops in a direction where Call of Duty (most likely) never will go: no glory, just madness. Even though the game starts in quite a standard way (not only in terms of story and setting, but also in terms of gameplay), the direction changes quite fast.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay: it is a solid cover shooter. The cover mechanics work quite well (most of the time), the shooting part is good and the AI of the enemies is really good. They are more than just cannon fodder and put some real pressure on the player. The gameplay itself might be standard nowadays, but the implementation is top-notch. The overall game experience is what you would expect from a AAA title, which is a big surprise, considering the topics covered by the game's story.\n\nI have a few points of critique, but those points rather fit to modern shooters in general:\nIt is rather short (it took me ~13h to finish the game on the hardest difficulty, and I'm not really experienced in playing cover shooters and thus was dying a lot)\nThe levels are very linear (but you can also see this as a metaphor for the freedom of choice you have or haven't in the game)\nThis game is one of the most underrated games in recent history. Apart from the story it fulfills all the criteria of a successful AAA title. It is really a pity, since this is the only AAA game (I know) that is brave enough not only to be mature, but also to raise unpleasant questions to the players and it didn't get the appreciation that it deserves. Seems like in future this will be only done by indie games.\nAnyway, I was very surprised (in a positive way) by this game and I can recommend to everybody to see, what can be done with the medium computer games.","April 26","true","14.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's hard to enjoy it and even harder to like it. Why the thumbs up then? Because it's bad for all the right reasons. Let me elaborate:\n\nMILD SPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nThe game starts as a typical military shooter but as you go about shooting "bad guys" things get F.U.B.A.R. real fast. Your character is forced to commit a series of war atrocities, each worse than the last one. The gameplay in between is dull and repetitive but this is a very conscious design decision on the developer's part. While you get bored your mind wanders and you can't help but think about what your character has done. As you try to rationalize his actions you go through some of the same psychological changes that shape his mind during the game. These changes are further pointed out by the exceptionally good voice acting.\n\nThis game leads you on at first, reinforcing your childish, video-game/action-movie inspired expectations. And then it shows you what killing hundreds of people in a single day actually does to a person's mind. It gets in your head and hammers the point home by breaking the fourth wall and messing with you, goading you to simply stop playing. You're not supposed to have fun while playing this and the game itself is perfectly aware of that. If you do decide to play it to the bitter end it will simply leave you feeling drained and dirty.\n\nSpec Ops fails as a game on purpose to prove a point and teach you a lesson. I can't help but respect that.","January 23, 2014","true","19.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

This game brings forth emotions like none I've seen before or since in gaming. I actually felt for the characters.

We've all heard this particular turn of phrase. Hell, for some of us, we've heard it so many times it's lost all meaning. For people who don't believe in hell, what's it supposed to mean in the first place? For those of us who've never been to war, what do we have to compare it to? What frame of reference would I have, aside from that vaguely haunted look when my dad would politely decline to discuss his time in Vietnam, or how he prefers not to watch movies based on real wars.\n\nI think the closest thing I've seen yet, at least for the most part, has come as quite a surprise. I have a habit of picking up Call of Duty games because I played the first one way back in the dusty days of the early 'naughties when they had intense single-player campaigns and the multiplayer was decent but not the main focus. They were really trying to show you how hard it was being a soldier at first. Nowadays, it's 'MERICA FK YEAH except for the scenes with the charmingly amoral SAS soldiers. Don't get me wrong, Captain Price is a total badass, but a believable character he's not.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is not the first in its series, but it's the first I played. I'd never heard of the series before this one, and wouldn't have picked it up if not for the good words of two critics I respect, a well-done demo on Steam, and Amazon having a summer sale of 50% off on a game only released maybe a month prior with a key redeemable on Steam.\n\nTo get the technical aspects out of the way, because those will surely not be the focus, the gameplay does not carry this one at all. I can't imagine people will be flocking to the multiplayer, as the land of chest-high walls makes an appearance here, along with his best friend, Mister Cover-Based-Shooting. It's average gameplay at best. I hesitate to say the Call of Duty franchise does it better, but that's not where it shines.\n\nI was truly taken aback by the story. I went in expecting a gung-ho John Rambo-style, check your brain at the door experience, with the ever-popular Delta Force as the main characters. That was not what was delivered. The game starts out, innocently enough, as you're tasked to investigate a distress call from a military commander of a unit, the 33rd, that stayed behind after Dubai was swallowed by massive sandstorm with people still living in the city. What follows is several episodes of standard shoot-em-up combat with a surprisingly hostile US Army force. Just as you get over questioning why these supposed friendlies are firing on you and you start to get into the rhythm of counter-attacking, the game drops a huge moral choice in your lap.\n\nYou encounter two men suspended from a bridge. You're told that one man, a civilian, was stealing water to help his family. The other, a soldier, was in the process of apprehending the man and used excessive force, resulting in the death of the man's family. You're then advised, by the very man who sent the distress call, to shoot one of them. You cannot simply refuse, as there are four snipers with their weapons trained on you from behind cover. Refuse, as I did, and you are forced to take the snipers out, resulting in the two men both dying in the exchange.\n\nOK you say. That's not too bad. A play on a common theme. It gets worse. At one point, the 33rd launch a white phosphorous mortar strike on a group of insurgents sponsored by the CIA that you're only meters away from.\n\nWhite Phosphorous, or as it's colloquially known as Willy Pete, has valid uses. It burns obscenely bright, as far as illumination, and can produce a solid smokescreen for obscuring movement. Loaded into a mortar, as in here, and almost nothing better defines "Death From Above." An airburst of WP burns and poisons, and can cause death from multiple organ failure if you don't die from shock first. The few times it's been used in combat have been wildly controversial to say the least, and it's been addressed under Chemical Warfare conventions.\n\nYou have to walk through the burning and dying remains to reach your next destination. This comes back to haunt you later as you reach the outskirts of a 33rd outpost that simply could not be breached on foot, due to the sheer number of soldiers and weaponry. Unfortunately for them, they've left their own white phosphorous mortar lying unattended. It was about this point that gnawing in the pit of my stomach started growing into something ugly. It didn't go away, as the next few moments left me shaking, when my character realized there had been civilians in the encampment. Approximately 40 of them.\n\nThe game takes a decidedly "Heart of Darkness" turn towards the end, in the only real stumbling outside of the slightly clumsy third-person cover shooting. You finally, after the painful ends of your team, reach the tower where the voice on the radio has been waiting. You are saluted by the remaining squad of the Damned 33rd, and told you are now in command of Dubai. After climbing a few staircases into a posh, almost spotless loft, you come face to face with Konrad, who continues talking to you even after you find his corpse slumped in a chair with a gun hanging out of his cold, dead hand. In a scene straight out of Fight Club, the reflection of Konrad holds a gun on you and you relive key points in the game that are not how you remembered them, such as Konrad's voice never actually coming through the radio, and the two men strung up on the bridge being long-dead, and you're faced with the option of shooting your reflection or Konrad's. Or not firing at all.\n\nThe game's writers throw a saving pass when you shoot Konrad, as you're allowed a post-credits playable sequence as the window shatters, and Konrad says "You can still go home.."\n\nHe's right. Cut to Army Humvees making their way to you, as you're slouched in front of Konrad's tower with an AA12, in Konrad's uniform. Your actions, and yours alone dictate what happens. As the soldiers approach, do you open fire on them? Or do you drop your weapon and allow them to take you home, admitting that the city defeated you.\n\nThe statement of "War is Hell" has been captured perfectly here, to the extent few stories of any other medium have captured it. The narrative forces you to feel the toll that hard decisions can take on a man, while at the same time giving us a warning that even the hardest and best of us could break under extreme situations. What makes you think you could be any stronger?\n\nHighest recommendations, if you can pick it up for less than full price.","July 19, 2012","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a sad game for adults.\n\nI liked the story, the graphics, the sound, the handling of the character, the weapons, nearly all of it.\nI disliked that certain situations are so much harder than the rest of the game.\n\nIf you like shooters where you have to use cover to be able to survive, if you like a good story then you should like this game too.\n\nIt is not very long, it took me 6 hours on normal difficulty. But this game is really good.\nI think it is only for persons > 20 years interesting, but I might be wrong there.

Unfortunately that means you can't/shouldn't show or tell why it's a great game in screenshots, videos, or reviews. I bought this game blind, not even knowing it was a third-person shooter and not a FPS. Just heard a bunch of people saying "you gotta play this, it's not the generic brown military bro-shooter you think it is." Otherwise I would've ignored it entirely as I'd been doing.\n\nI'll say this: the game looks beautiful, it's well-acted, and the gameplay is solid albeit rather conventional cover-based action. It's also pretty darned short. It took me 9 hours instead of 6 on Normal because of repeated dumb screw-ups brought on by the fact that the controls for exiting cover are a little screwy. If you move perpendicular to the cover's orientation...you leave it.

It's a Third-Person Shooter with a story that is designed to make you think about your decisions. My problem with the game is that the major decisions are out of your control. You have no say what-so-ever in the outcomes of them. The few decisions that you are given are minor and ultimately have no effect on which of the 4 endings of the game you will receive. The endings are based on which of the 4 options you choose at the very end of the game. I have a hard time feeling bad for a decision that the game chose. The "obvious" answer to some who say you do have a choice is to just not play the game. That is a poor answer to me. You would not experience the rest of the story or the game unless you watched it on YouTube, or had someone tell you what happens.\n\nThe actual combat in the game is typical TPS or FPS run-and-gun. I would recommend playing on Easy if you do decide to play the game. You do not lose or gain anything other than achievements by picking this option. I would play the game for the story and not the gameplay.\n\nAll in all, it is an interesting game, but I would never say that I had fun playing it. Get it if you are just absolutely interesting in playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/recommended/50300/","droniac","Droniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/","884 products in account","At first glance Spec Ops: The Line seems like an average modern military third-person shooter with a cover system. And that assessment is largely correct. It feels and plays a lot like Call of Duty and Battlefield singleplayer campaigns, mainly due to its action-movie style setpieces. This despite it being a third-person cover shooter.\n\nEven so Spec Ops: The Line is one of the better singleplayer shooters you can pick up today. It's not a standout in visuals, bombastic action scenes, shooting mechanics, or multiplayer options. Rather it sets itself apart due to the atmosphere set in the singleplayer story, the gruesome choices you're forced to make, the cruel twists as the story moves along, and some horrific scenes of brutality.\n\nYou get to make only a few choices during the campaign and Spec Ops' environments are linear throughout. But those choices you do get to make have an impact - not so much on the game's story as on you as a person due to their immediate effects. Additionally the game comes with several different endings. There's no need to replay the game for them, because the decision that determines which ending you get is made in the final mission, which is both sad yet convenient.\n\nAt 6-7 hours the game never overstays its welcome. Likewise it's never overly challenging, and that's on Hard (Suicide Mission) difficulty. That short, mostly-linear campaign holds up surprisingly well in a second playthrough. Finding all the nuances that point to the game's final twists further enhances the experience.\n\nConclusion / TLDR\nSpec Ops is not a fun game. But it's one hell of an experience for those who can handle a bit of grimdarkness in their third-person shooting. Definitely recommended.\n\nTechnical Droning\n120Hz - Yes\nBorderless Windowed - No\nFOV - No\nGraphics Options - Minimal\nTexture Quality - Average\nMouse Acceleration - Acceptable\nConfig Tweaking - No (3rd party tools required)","May 23, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When you watch a movie and you're still thinking about it days later, you know you've seen something special. I am having that same feeling with this game.\n\nI am not a big shooter player so I won't comment in detail on the gameplay mechanics or the difficulty, I found them both great, but the story and the artwork was incredible. I found myself rationalising the protagonist's choices as if they were my own. Even as events started to spiral out of control, I found myself trying to think about what I would do if it were my boots in the sand. I couldn't ever question Walker's decisions because they were always based on a truth he had compiled from an incomplete understanding of the situation, which was something I shared with him.\n\nIt's a three dimensional look at war, imaged in breathtaking scenes and with commendable voice-acting. Oftentimes, war is not as we traditionally define it. Decisions are not always based on what is good or bad, heroic or cowardly. They are often driven by interpretation of orders and gut-feel. And when dreadful things happen, do we really fully appreciate the toll on those that felt they had to pull the trigger, squinting though the fog of war?\n\nThis is a visceral and engaging experience which I highly recommend to gamers looking for something a bit different.","March 22, 2015","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's kind of like "Apocalypse Now!" with Dubai as the setting but that comparison is giving it a little too much credit.  It's more like an ultraviolent summer blockbuster war movie. The story and dialogue come off hamfisted and silly at times. The voice acting is decent for the most part and the sound design is good.\n\nI would've liked the guns to be louder and bullet snaps would be great for immersion. The shooting mechanics are satisfying and the intensity of the combat is what kept me coming back to 100% this game. It's no "Red Orchestra" immersion wise, but I think it illustrates the horrors of war well in some ways. Enemies collapse and some suffer while clutching wounds or crawl away. They cough and whimper as blood pools around them. One thing they never do is surrender, which is an annoying trope of modern shooters. At least there are unarmed civilians on some levels, which goes against convention. The game also forces you into some bad situations with civilians which is a great way to show the ugliness of war.\n\nThe game looks fantastic, even years later and it's surreal to see Dubai turned into a wartorn blood soaked ruin. Every firefight is fun and challenging if played on the harder difficulty levels. It would've been nice to have stealth be more viable. It's also a little funny that a 3 man squad kills off thousands of enemies. I know it's supposed to be somewhat of a satire on the modern military shooter but I would've rather had "Rainbow Six" style squad selection/commands and losses than 2 invulnerable baby sitters. I hope more games try to execute a "military shooter gone horror" vibe. I really like that the game is a train wreck of bad events and it tries to make you feel responsible and bad for it, kind of like the Kane & Lynch series. It was just a little too hamfisted, on rails and "gamey" for that feeling to hit me, but I enjoyed the horrific descent into madness nonetheless. If you are looking for a solid 3rd person shooter with an intense atmosphere, definitely grab this game.\n\n7/10","June 22, 2014","true","34.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Pretty soon ♥♥♥♥ (mixed with an unfeasibly large amount of sand) hits the fan, and being such a badass your character is increasingly more determined to find out wth is going on.\n\nAs the story progresses you are faced with some plot changing ultimatums which will have an impact later on, the more you get to these stages of the game the more you are drawn into this world and the story itself.\n\nIf you can set the detail level and textures to max on your PC, then i strongly advise to do so. So many times i'd completely forget about the objective and just stop and look around in awe at the strange mix of a half destroyed metropolis, really quite impressive considering it was released a few years back.\n\nDifficulty is actually quite challenging and can be brutal in some places, it's a fairly short game but dying so many time got a bit more longetivity out of it. Both your squad AI and enemy AI are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in places but it can be forgiven for the times that your tactics work like clockwork, hit and miss.\n\nEven i'm getting bored of this review now, so all I will say is that if you're into challenging immersive games, with ultimatums, well written story and a bit more level of tactical awareness needed than a bog standard FPS, then pick this up in the sale and you'll be glad you did.\n\nOh yeah, and don't buy it if you're easily grossed out or offended - aka: a massive crybaby\n\n\n\n","May 15, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

This game brings forth emotions like none I've seen before or since in gaming. I actually felt for the characters.

"Its PTSD the game."\n\nThis is not your typical war game. It puts the player into the soldier's boots and has you make decisions for the city of Dubai. These choices that are made are not so cut and dry as the other war games. In Spec Ops, your selections consist of picking grey or gray in a world of black and white; therefore, by the end of the game you will be questioning your own motives and thoughts. As a result, your mind begins to play games against you.\n\nThe combat is well done for being a cover system. This story is mind blowingly good. The AI is smart for the most part on both sides of the fight. Overall, the environment is beautiful; at the same time Dubai is alive and dead as you enter the skyscrapers and walk the streets of this bloodstained, sand filled warzone.","June 21, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's kind of like "Apocalypse Now!" with Dubai as the setting but that comparison is giving it a little too much credit.  It's more like an ultraviolent summer blockbuster war movie. The story and dialogue come off hamfisted and silly at times. The voice acting is decent for the most part and the sound design is good.\n\nI would've liked the guns to be louder and bullet snaps would be great for immersion. The shooting mechanics are satisfying and the intensity of the combat is what kept me coming back to 100% this game. It's no "Red Orchestra" immersion wise, but I think it illustrates the horrors of war well in some ways. Enemies collapse and some suffer while clutching wounds or crawl away. They cough and whimper as blood pools around them. One thing they never do is surrender, which is an annoying trope of modern shooters. At least there are unarmed civilians on some levels, which goes against convention. The game also forces you into some bad situations with civilians which is a great way to show the ugliness of war.\n\nThe game looks fantastic, even years later and it's surreal to see Dubai turned into a wartorn blood soaked ruin. Every firefight is fun and challenging if played on the harder difficulty levels. It would've been nice to have stealth be more viable. It's also a little funny that a 3 man squad kills off thousands of enemies. I know it's supposed to be somewhat of a satire on the modern military shooter but I would've rather had "Rainbow Six" style squad selection/commands and losses than 2 invulnerable baby sitters. I hope more games try to execute a "military shooter gone horror" vibe. I really like that the game is a train wreck of bad events and it tries to make you feel responsible and bad for it, kind of like the Kane & Lynch series. It was just a little too hamfisted, on rails and "gamey" for that feeling to hit me, but I enjoyed the horrific descent into madness nonetheless. If you are looking for a solid 3rd person shooter with an intense atmosphere, definitely grab this game.\n\n7/10","June 22, 2014","true","34.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And that assessment is largely correct. It feels and plays a lot like Call of Duty and Battlefield singleplayer campaigns, mainly due to its action-movie style setpieces. This despite it being a third-person cover shooter.\n\nEven so Spec Ops: The Line is one of the better singleplayer shooters you can pick up today. It's not a standout in visuals, bombastic action scenes, shooting mechanics, or multiplayer options. Rather it sets itself apart due to the atmosphere set in the singleplayer story, the gruesome choices you're forced to make, the cruel twists as the story moves along, and some horrific scenes of brutality.\n\nYou get to make only a few choices during the campaign and Spec Ops' environments are linear throughout. But those choices you do get to make have an impact - not so much on the game's story as on you as a person due to their immediate effects. Additionally the game comes with several different endings. There's no need to replay the game for them, because the decision that determines which ending you get is made in the final mission, which is both sad yet convenient.\n\nAt 6-7 hours the game never overstays its welcome. Likewise it's never overly challenging, and that's on Hard (Suicide Mission) difficulty. That short, mostly-linear campaign holds up surprisingly well in a second playthrough. Finding all the nuances that point to the game's final twists further enhances the experience.\n\nConclusion / TLDR\nSpec Ops is not a fun game. But it's one hell of an experience for those who can handle a bit of grimdarkness in their third-person shooting. Definitely recommended.\n\nTechnical Droning\n120Hz - Yes\nBorderless Windowed - No\nFOV - No\nGraphics Options - Minimal\nTexture Quality - Average\nMouse Acceleration - Acceptable\nConfig Tweaking - No (3rd party tools required)","May 23, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I found myself rationalising the protagonist's choices as if they were my own. Even as events started to spiral out of control, I found myself trying to think about what I would do if it were my boots in the sand.

Oftentimes, war is not as we traditionally define it. Decisions are not always based on what is good or bad, heroic or cowardly. They are often driven by interpretation of orders and gut-feel. And when dreadful things happen, do we really fully appreciate the toll on those that felt they had to pull the trigger, squinting though the fog of war?\n\nThis is a visceral and engaging experience which I highly recommend to gamers looking for something a bit different.","March 22, 2015","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is amazing, but it took about two hours of play before it actually got interesting.  It has a really slow generic start and I almost gave up on it, but I'm glad I didn't.  The slow start actually helps build the characters and helps with the pay off at the end.  The gameplay is a pretty straight forward cover shooter.  Really nothing new or interesting here.  It is well done, but again, nothing new.\n\nPros:\n-Awesome story\n-Really good character progression, seeing the main character fall from grace is an amazing journey.\n-Nice set pieces and overall the visuals are decent.\n-Perfect length.

Gameplay-wise is also great with easy controls, fun cover base combat that allows teammate commands, a good variety of weapons and enemies to takedown. I highly recommend that you watch Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 classic Apocalypse Now (preferably the Redux edition) before you play Spec Ops which has very similar themes to the film for the ultimate Heart of Darkness experience.","March 18, 2014","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The antagonist is even named Conrad. It tries to shine perspective on the choices that you make as a soldier to survive, but if you just want to gun everyone down like I do, the game is still rewarding for that.\n\nThe graphics are alright, although the sepia tone gets tiring after a while.

When you watch a movie and you're still thinking about it days later, you know you've seen something special. I am having that same feeling with this game.\n\nI am not a big shooter player so I won't comment in detail on the gameplay mechanics or the difficulty, I found them both great, but the story and the artwork was incredible. I found myself rationalising the protagonist's choices as if they were my own. Even as events started to spiral out of control, I found myself trying to think about what I would do if it were my boots in the sand. I couldn't ever question Walker's decisions because they were always based on a truth he had compiled from an incomplete understanding of the situation, which was something I shared with him.\n\nIt's a three dimensional look at war, imaged in breathtaking scenes and with commendable voice-acting. Oftentimes, war is not as we traditionally define it. Decisions are not always based on what is good or bad, heroic or cowardly. They are often driven by interpretation of orders and gut-feel. And when dreadful things happen, do we really fully appreciate the toll on those that felt they had to pull the trigger, squinting though the fog of war?\n\nThis is a visceral and engaging experience which I highly recommend to gamers looking for something a bit different.","March 22, 2015","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/recommended/50300/","droniac","Droniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/","884 products in account","At first glance Spec Ops: The Line seems like an average modern military third-person shooter with a cover system. And that assessment is largely correct. It feels and plays a lot like Call of Duty and Battlefield singleplayer campaigns, mainly due to its action-movie style setpieces. This despite it being a third-person cover shooter.\n\nEven so Spec Ops: The Line is one of the better singleplayer shooters you can pick up today. It's not a standout in visuals, bombastic action scenes, shooting mechanics, or multiplayer options. Rather it sets itself apart due to the atmosphere set in the singleplayer story, the gruesome choices you're forced to make, the cruel twists as the story moves along, and some horrific scenes of brutality.\n\nYou get to make only a few choices during the campaign and Spec Ops' environments are linear throughout. But those choices you do get to make have an impact - not so much on the game's story as on you as a person due to their immediate effects. Additionally the game comes with several different endings. There's no need to replay the game for them, because the decision that determines which ending you get is made in the final mission, which is both sad yet convenient.\n\nAt 6-7 hours the game never overstays its welcome. Likewise it's never overly challenging, and that's on Hard (Suicide Mission) difficulty. That short, mostly-linear campaign holds up surprisingly well in a second playthrough. Finding all the nuances that point to the game's final twists further enhances the experience.\n\nConclusion / TLDR\nSpec Ops is not a fun game. But it's one hell of an experience for those who can handle a bit of grimdarkness in their third-person shooting. Definitely recommended.\n\nTechnical Droning\n120Hz - Yes\nBorderless Windowed - No\nFOV - No\nGraphics Options - Minimal\nTexture Quality - Average\nMouse Acceleration - Acceptable\nConfig Tweaking - No (3rd party tools required)","May 23, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This all while having players make the choices themselves so that there is an actual feeling of guilt or accountability gives it a strong character and creates an unforgetable experience. 10/10","August 18, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is so complex it feels like a Nolan's movie at times, it even messes with you in the loading screens.\n\nThe graphics are very committed to the desert feel but still manages to take your breath away at times.\n\nThe music is just amazing, ranging from Hard Rock to Motown and you may feel not all this songs are fitting to a shooting game, but they are to the emotional feeling of it, which is the game's strongest point.\n\nOne of the only downsides is how the difficulty scalates, I was so mindblown by this game I decided to replay it in the FUBAR difficulty, which is the hardest possible, it gets you thinking outside the box most of the time, looking for different ways to achive your objective, picking your shots carefully, but sadly at times it's just ridiculously hard with unskippable instadeath scenes that you will replay DOZENS of times to get through by sheer luck, and it feels like the game is trying to be longer in a really cheap way.\n\nOther than that this game is a jewel that deserves to be appreciated.\nI am yet to try the coop mode, will update this review when I do.","March 8, 2015","true","24.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is amazing, but it took about two hours of play before it actually got interesting.  It has a really slow generic start and I almost gave up on it, but I'm glad I didn't.  The slow start actually helps build the characters and helps with the pay off at the end.  The gameplay is a pretty straight forward cover shooter.  Really nothing new or interesting here.  It is well done, but again, nothing new.\n\nPros:\n-Awesome story\n-Really good character progression, seeing the main character fall from grace is an amazing journey.\n-Nice set pieces and overall the visuals are decent.\n-Perfect length.  At about 6hrs it was just right.\n-I absolutley love that the characters all get more and more beat up and battered visually, more games should do this.\n-I also love that they had different voice clips as the game progressed where the characters sound more worn out and tired.  Amazing!  More games again need to do this!\n-Excellent voice acting.  Nolan North takes the lead and is awesome as usual, but all the other voice actors are amazing!\n\nCons:\n-Slow start could potentially keep people from playing through the whole game.\n-Nothing new or interesting about the gameplay, a standard cover shooter.\n-I wish they had used the sand storms more often.  I think it only happens two or three times.\n\nOverall a good game with an amazing story.  I wish more games had stories that were as good as this one.  I ended up putting it on Easy mode half way through so I could just play through the story and enjoy the game.  In fact, I actually would recommend playing it on easy as medium (or whatever they call it) was kind of all over the place.  Sometimes it would be perfect, other times it would be really hard.","March 6, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForbiddenLover/recommended/50300/","ForbiddenLover","Yuno Gasai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForbiddenLover/","87 products in account","Overview:\nThis game....OHOHOHOHOHHO this game,I will try to describe it through my eyes,on the surface you play as Captain Martin Walker,generic badass delta op commander as he and his 3 man squad is sent to Dubai after some kind of super sandstorm(s) destroyed the city,you are tasked with confirming the presence of survivors and  nothing more,and you would be forgiven for thinking by the title and setting it would be another " 'MURICA ♥♥♥ YEAAAA KEEL ALL THE FAKKING ARABS! " kind of game,but it isnt in fact,its the TOTAL opposite,as Walker and his squad,Lugo and Adams find the tattered remains of the 33RD infantry battalion,they are confronted by civvies who are hostile to americans and through distrust open fire,the literal FIRST enemies you kill,are refugees,then through even MORE distrust the 33RD think Walker and his team are CIA trying to wipe them out,after that its just a massive clusterfu*k of bullets,death and despair as Walker marches down the road to hell\n\nStory (Massive spoilers) :\nThis is perhaps the highlight of the game,it almost feels like a parody of all modern war games as if it was saying "Go on player,killing is easy right? here are some refugees and fellow american soldiers to kill,what you dont want to? I though you said killing was easy,right? "  you wont find any russians,terrorists or nazi's here,and in Dubai everyone has only one objective: survive, now lets talk about the atmosphere, its VERY well done, sometimes you overhear conversations between "enemies" which make you feel even worse about shooting them,soldiers talking about home,their reasons for fighting etc,then the turning point came with the infamous white phosphorus section, when walker and his squad are faced with a large contingent of enemies they were forced to use white phosphorus shells on their enemies,and holy sh*t,after you bomb out the area the game treats you to a nice stroll through the field you just shelled as if to say "Killing is fun right? OH look some of them are still squirming around! dont you love their screams?" as you hear people cooking,screaming for their lives,it reminds me of Hotline Miami when you finish a level and you have to go back to the car and see what you have done,then Walker finds it,a tent full of civilians burnt to a crisp,this is when Walker breaks as he loses his sanity bit by bit,Walker unable to accept what he has done decides to pin all the blame on Col. John Konrad a former CO of walker whoms voice is in his head,taunting his choices left and right,and in my book,Konrad's voice is the last of  Walker's sanity,telling him to stop,in the end he ends up taking out Dubai's water supply,doming everyone,after the deaths of both of his men,Walker finally does it,he finds Konrad,dead by his own gun,it is then when it is revealed to us the players what we were doing,we were marching on because we wanted to be a hero,get the glory,throughout the story Walker could have just left and radioed command outside of the 'stormwall' (it jams comms from inside the city) and that would be that,but no Walker starts out from a walk to a jog then a run and just when he sees Konrad at the finish line a mad dash to claim his glory,only to come to a dead stop when he finds Konrad dead, this is by far the saddest war story set in a modern time i've ever played\n\nGameplay:\n\nStandard cover based shooter with a few tweaks,the cover system feels very smooth and fluid,you'll feel like a badass when you pop 2 guys switch to the other doorway pop 2 more then run out of cover to another wall,overall very good,but why in the Jesus H CHRIST did they map the sprint with the cover?! sometimes Walker would stick to the wall right beside an enemy grenade when i wanted him to run away,and something unusual is that ammo is quite hard to find,which is good because it forces you to use a variety of weapons, picked up a SCAR-H? hope 80 rounds last ya!\n\nSummary:\n\nPros:\n+Best war story set in modern day i have ever played\n+Smooth cover mechanics\n+Very good voice acting\n+Makes you feel like a c*nt for killing people\n\nCons:\n-Short story (took me 7 hours-ish on normal)\n-No replay value whatsoever","May 28, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While most ego-shooter try to distract from their lack of depths by multiplying the amount of action and explosion you encounter, Spec Ops manages to eliminate your excitement to blow up buildings and countless waves of generic and faceless enemys.\n\nI had to stop playing several times, because I felt disgusted by what I "achieved" on my journey to complete the campaign, furthermore it became very clear that at the end of said campaign I would not feel any closure just incomprehension.

" kind of game,but it isnt in fact,its the TOTAL opposite,as Walker and his squad,Lugo and Adams find the tattered remains of the 33RD infantry battalion,they are confronted by civvies who are hostile to americans and through distrust open fire,the literal FIRST enemies you kill,are refugees,then through even MORE distrust the 33RD think Walker and his team are CIA trying to wipe them out,after that its just a massive clusterfu*k of bullets,death and despair as Walker marches down the road to hell\n\nStory (Massive spoilers) :\nThis is perhaps the highlight of the game,it almost feels like a parody of all modern war games as if it was saying "Go on player,killing is easy right? here are some refugees and fellow american soldiers to kill,what you dont want to? I though you said killing was easy,right? "  you wont find any russians,terrorists or nazi's here,and in Dubai everyone has only one objective: survive, now lets talk about the atmosphere, its VERY well done, sometimes you overhear conversations between "enemies" which make you feel even worse about shooting them,soldiers talking about home,their reasons for fighting etc,then the turning point came with the infamous white phosphorus section, when walker and his squad are faced with a large contingent of enemies they were forced to use white phosphorus shells on their enemies,and holy sh*t,after you bomb out the area the game treats you to a nice stroll through the field you just shelled as if to say "Killing is fun right? OH look some of them are still squirming around! dont you love their screams?" as you hear people cooking,screaming for their lives,it reminds me of Hotline Miami when you finish a level and you have to go back to the car and see what you have done,then Walker finds it,a tent full of civilians burnt to a crisp,this is when Walker breaks as he loses his sanity bit by bit,Walker unable to accept what he has done decides to pin all the blame on Col. John Konrad a former CO of walker whoms voice is in his head,taunting his choices left and right,and in my book,Konrad's voice is the last of  Walker's sanity,telling him to stop,in the end he ends up taking out Dubai's water supply,doming everyone,after the deaths of both of his men,Walker finally does it,he finds Konrad,dead by his own gun,it is then when it is revealed to us the players what we were doing,we were marching on because we wanted to be a hero,get the glory,throughout the story Walker could have just left and radioed command outside of the 'stormwall' (it jams comms from inside the city) and that would be that,but no Walker starts out from a walk to a jog then a run and just when he sees Konrad at the finish line a mad dash to claim his glory,only to come to a dead stop when he finds Konrad dead, this is by far the saddest war story set in a modern time i've ever played\n\nGameplay:\n\nStandard cover based shooter with a few tweaks,the cover system feels very smooth and fluid,you'll feel like a badass when you pop 2 guys switch to the other doorway pop 2 more then run out of cover to another wall,overall very good,but why in the Jesus H CHRIST did they map the sprint with the cover?! sometimes Walker would stick to the wall right beside an enemy grenade when i wanted him to run away,and something unusual is that ammo is quite hard to find,which is good because it forces you to use a variety of weapons, picked up a SCAR-H? hope 80 rounds last ya!\n\nSummary:\n\nPros:\n+Best war story set in modern day i have ever played\n+Smooth cover mechanics\n+Very good voice acting\n+Makes you feel like a c*nt for killing people\n\nCons:\n-Short story (took me 7 hours-ish on normal)\n-No replay value whatsoever","May 28, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Figured the story would be o.k enough to justify the price, so I bought it during a sale.\n\nTo put it bluntly, yes, gameplay wise it is as GENERIC of a TPS or any shooter for that matter. Guns have little to no punch, enemy AI is basic but otherwise predictable and unchallenging, and weapon variety is decent but limiting with the 2 weapon loadout system... but, BUT... the story...\n\nLet me just say the STORY for this game is the REAL SELLING POINT, far above the gameplay. You play Captain Walker accompanied by his boyband of I swear must be Ice Cube and Matt Damon impersinators. They at first seem uninteresting with that classic "HOO RAAAWWW" mentality games like Call of Duty suffer from. As the story progresses they get broken down, beaten up, shot, stabbed, burned, and tortured until only a husk of a human being survives.\n\nThe stuff these guys go to is the stuff of knightmares and it culminates to shocking revelations, and mental barriers being broken one by one. As each character commits atrocious acts of violence they lose whatever humanity stuck with them at the beggining, degrading into savage killing machines who literally cause the city to burn by the end of it.\n\nI dont wish to spoil too much, but it is a serious trip.\n\nI repeat DO NOT buy this game if you are looking for a satisfying TPS like Vanquish, Gear of War. Space Marine, Uncharted, Last of Us, etc. Instead BUY THIS GAME if you want a jaw dropping and heart wrenching story that characterises the horrors of War in a very Apocolypse Now esque manner with brutality, savagery, and sheer gut wrenching violence NO MILITARY SHOOTER HAS EVER DONE outside of some obscure Vietnam games.\n\n11/10... would feel like a terrible person again.","January 22, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Really, just for its setting it's worth being played. Spec Ops puts you in the shoes of a Delta Force squad leader who - along with two members of the same squad - must uncover the truth behind the disappearance of a famous colonel. Search is immediately started after receiving a radio signal and your squad eventually finds itself in the middle of a war.\n\nThe game is a relatively difficult tactical 3rd person shooter - you control the leader but can give orders to the squad members.  You clear one room after the next - while the game is linear it offers a great story that tries to portray the dark side of a war, a war where it's almost impossible to make good choices. The game has stunning visuals and superb voice acting - all delivered from the best in the gaming industry. Replayability exists due to the different difficulties and also the different endings offered based on the choices to be made by the players.\n\nI never tried its multiplayer mode but did not plan to do so.

Now to the actual game.\nI'll start with  pros :\n1.  Graphics: Now here there isn't much to explain. Astonishing views from the tall sky scrapers of Dubai and the sandy color were on the high level. It makes you believe you are in Dubai on the war zone, and not in your half broken apartment with neighbours drilling walls. Also worth noting that the demands for such beauty aren't high.\n2.  Difficulty level: This one is very balanced. Like in some games of this types, you are playing a role of one man army, and fighting against huge huge huge amounts of enemies. Unlike in most of the games, and this is very important, you have very frequent checkpoints. So even if you die, you will not be thrown back to the beginning of      10-20 min fight as often it might happen, but rather 1-5.\n3.  Music: During the tense fights you might not even notice it, but the music that's playing is very good, at least to my taste. Some hardcore rock really does it during the fight. Bands like Deep Purple, Alice in Chains, Bjork and others are featured in the game.\n4. Plot: And here comes the beast - the reason this game is worth all of the fuss. Mainly, the aim of the plot was to show the tough job of the soldier, and the decision making, but also criticise the fact of the war itself, and the way we make war in general. Some touchy issues were shown like use of chemical weapons such as white phosphorus, and the unpleasant consequences that it can bring. You can accidentally vaporize a whole camp of civilians... And then you will have to deal with it.\nOne of the other touchy issues, although only if dug deep enough, is the USA "invasion" in the middle east countries and their interference in the local conflicts often in order to protect their own interests which brings more victims. But this discussion will not occur here.\nIn conclusion the plot really makes this game a big deal with very unexpected twist in the end of the game. If you play the game the second time, you will feel as if you would watch say Fight Club for the second time. You know the big twist and you can see how the game slowly leads you into it.\n\nRegarding cons, this game doesn't have too many of them. The big one is movement, and controls in general. Sometimes when you want to get behind cover the character disagrees with you, running is also a bit weird.\nAnother big con, and I really really really hate this one, is when one of your crew members goes down, you have to pick him up, and if not, you'll have to start over... This is the most annoying part of the game, especially on the higher difficulty levels, where you'd run towards him and die, or you just won't be quick enough. Other than that...\nEnjoy the game.","May 24, 2015","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omggggclarissa/recommended/50300/","omggggclarissa","omgggg clarissa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omggggclarissa/","606 products in account","I would describe the core gameplay as a competent shooter. Nothing too unique. I have become tired by repetitious shooters over the last few years when I just have so many other options in regard to games I can play. What makes this game recommendable is everything else about it. Most obviously the story - its great, and it actually feels pretty important. Its similar to Apocalypse Now but in modern Dubai rather than 70's Vietnam. The story, once it gets rolling, asks you to question how you as a player of a shooter video game can convince yourself that it can ever be right to take the life of another human being - and the lengths we go to make rationalizations for killing. The game is an exercise in cognitive dissonance; you're forced to question the act of killing and come to terms with the consequences of taking another person's life, but at the same time you're supposed to kill hundreds of people. People who thrash about near-death on the ground, coughing up blood, frantically asking for help with what little breath they have left. The story is thoughtful, the voice acting is great, the sound design and implementation of soundtrack are both great, and the game looks great. The core gameplay itself, though, is still pretty average for third-person cover shooters.","December 7, 2013","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Indeed, it is both very similar to the basic TPS and very different from the other "common" games.\n\nFor a start, the game mechanics don't really stand out from other shooters. The cover system is quite classic, the various weapons are nothing but well-made, enemies will most likely be coming by everywhere while shooting and yelling, the different AIs are correct, although your teammates will most of the time die while running, and there are shining red barrels that will explode when shot, as well as turrets and miniguns. Multiplayer is not worth the single player, and coop consists of alternative 2-players missions. Still, there are quite some original things, such as the contextual sand that will often allow you to get rid of a bunch of angry people or some eye-candies like the trees, walls or towers that fall when shot at.\n\nThat brings us to the fact that the game also looks like a movie. Indeed, it's very linear, as the main storyline can be summed up with a map. But it's also pretty scripted, and every single detail seems to have been done with care : the crashing helos, the falling towers, the blowing glass roofs, the collapsing quicksands... and even though sometimes, the action is spoiled by the too obvious script, it still succeeds in stressing the player, who'll eventually have to choose between four pretty different endings.\n\nBut the biggest part of the game revolves around the story. It may be a little hard to get why you get shot at so much in the beginning, but except a few odd things, the struggle between morality and immorality, allies and enemies, life and death is surprisingly thorough for a videogame. Indeed, there is nothing silly, as it's not a simple confrontation between good and evil, but rather a showdown of cruelty, selfishness, and deceived ideals meant to ensure the survival of a few people - or to wipe out guilt -, even if it leads to the death of dozens of - more or less - innocent people. There is no one truly good, not even civilians, and no one truly evil, not even soldiers, and there is thus no right choice to do : whatever you do, people will die, and you only can determine who - to some extent. Indeed, you'll end up doing things totally against common sense, only because it's the only way to face the others, who are already doing crazy things : it's a shocking experience that to burn people with white phosphorus and watch them burn while speaking to a dying burnt man. The dialogues are, by the way, pretty interesting, and the characters' psychologies are really profound, as both of your two teammates will have a different position on what happened, what you've done and what to do next. The interesting part is that it's hard to tell who to follow, as no one seems to be wrong, and in the end, you'll be the main problem down there - but you won't realize it before the last few minutes.\n\nIn the end, the story can be summed up as a descent into hell of a mad soldier caught in the spiral of violence and guilt, and the whole game leads the player through sceneries of despair and desolation, all along a depressing story tainted with blood. But if that game is a masterpiece, it's also thanks to the fact that the story is complex and insanely hard to get, as the main character is sliding into madness - which is also hard to get to which degree until the very last moments. Thus, this game isn't suitable for everyone, as it requires to be able to use their brain while playing, so as to make choices as well as to try to understand the story so far: you simply can't play just to shoot. That game is a proof that videogame is art.\n\nP.S. : Somehow, the game made me remember of Prayer of the Refugee, by Rise Against.

The story line is fantastic, and is filled with choices that basically boil down to, "Do you really want to do it the hard way just to spare some civilian lives?"\n\nThe gameplay on, normal difficulty, was perfect for me. Easy enough for you to mow down enemies if you play right, and hard enough to where it messes you up the second you get cocky. The ai and levels are designed to force you to change weapons 2-3 times a level keeping the experience fresh and fun. The AI is pretty smart as well, they have scripted flanks and occasionally you get to hear them talk about their personal lives, reminding you that these are people you are killing.\n\nLike most FPS these days the game is littered with collectables that have their own mini story to tell. Usually I collect them for the sake of collecting them, but these were so good I'd find my self searching dark corners of the level just for a little more story.\n\nOVERALL, it was a great game, I only picked it up because I heard it was a bit unique and it was on sale for like $3. I got lucky, but if I had got it at full price I'd still be very happy. My only complaint, the take cover and sprint button are the same key, it can be as annoying as Assassins Creed's run and climb button from time to time.\n\n\n9/10 When bullets are flying, sometimes your character might decide that instead of diving out of the way, he wants to die a rhino.","May 26, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On the surface it appears to be a generic shooter but if you take the time it is a lot more. The story pays homage to the novel Heart Of Darkness, and draws inspiration from Apocalypse Now, which are both exceptional pieces. Unfortunately it does a lot to turn away the casual player, it has lacklustre game play and a very unfortunate title, that was likely a thought by some producer. However once you look past that it really is a hidden gem amongst terrible tripple A titles. Stay for the immersive stories about the glories of war and ignore the short comings of the gameplay. I would reccomend playing this game on a medium difficulty as I played on the "Suicide" setting and it was frustrating in all the wrong ways.\nAlso the game was very short, I finished on Suicide at 3 hours and 55 minutes. In saying that I got about 50x the enjoyment out of it then any shooter I've played in a long time.\n\nHighly Recommend.","August 8, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is in no way a bad thing. Spec Ops wants to tell a story about soldiers in war. But unlike games such as Call of Duty, it doesn't want you to feel like an awesome, unstoppable killing machine that's fighting terrorism FOR 'MERICA!!!' or whatever; it wants you to see that war is not glamorous, awesome, fun, or desirable. It wants you to see the terrible toll that combat can exact on those who experience it. And above all, it wants you to see that in real conflict, there are no "good guys" and "bad guys," and the world is full of gray areas. War is hell, and anyone who goes in will either join the fortunate dead...or have to live with what they've done to survive.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the storyline, I felt sad, very sad at parts.

"Its PTSD the game."\n\nThis is not your typical war game. It puts the player into the soldier's boots and has you make decisions for the city of Dubai. These choices that are made are not so cut and dry as the other war games. In Spec Ops, your selections consist of picking grey or gray in a world of black and white; therefore, by the end of the game you will be questioning your own motives and thoughts. As a result, your mind begins to play games against you.\n\nThe combat is well done for being a cover system. This story is mind blowingly good. The AI is smart for the most part on both sides of the fight. Overall, the environment is beautiful; at the same time Dubai is alive and dead as you enter the skyscrapers and walk the streets of this bloodstained, sand filled warzone.","June 21, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's kind of like "Apocalypse Now!" with Dubai as the setting but that comparison is giving it a little too much credit.  It's more like an ultraviolent summer blockbuster war movie. The story and dialogue come off hamfisted and silly at times. The voice acting is decent for the most part and the sound design is good.\n\nI would've liked the guns to be louder and bullet snaps would be great for immersion. The shooting mechanics are satisfying and the intensity of the combat is what kept me coming back to 100% this game. It's no "Red Orchestra" immersion wise, but I think it illustrates the horrors of war well in some ways. Enemies collapse and some suffer while clutching wounds or crawl away. They cough and whimper as blood pools around them. One thing they never do is surrender, which is an annoying trope of modern shooters. At least there are unarmed civilians on some levels, which goes against convention. The game also forces you into some bad situations with civilians which is a great way to show the ugliness of war.\n\nThe game looks fantastic, even years later and it's surreal to see Dubai turned into a wartorn blood soaked ruin. Every firefight is fun and challenging if played on the harder difficulty levels. It would've been nice to have stealth be more viable. It's also a little funny that a 3 man squad kills off thousands of enemies. I know it's supposed to be somewhat of a satire on the modern military shooter but I would've rather had "Rainbow Six" style squad selection/commands and losses than 2 invulnerable baby sitters. I hope more games try to execute a "military shooter gone horror" vibe. I really like that the game is a train wreck of bad events and it tries to make you feel responsible and bad for it, kind of like the Kane & Lynch series. It was just a little too hamfisted, on rails and "gamey" for that feeling to hit me, but I enjoyed the horrific descent into madness nonetheless. If you are looking for a solid 3rd person shooter with an intense atmosphere, definitely grab this game.\n\n7/10","June 22, 2014","true","34.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game expertly puts you in the shoes of the main character as he teeters on the edge of sanity as his PTSD nightmare slowly consumes him. But in the end, the game's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness.\n\nThe game not only encourages, but actively pushes you towards making crazy "gamer" decisions that leads to the story spiraling out of control. Executing a downed enemy is a common video game mechanic that players have come to expect. Executing a downed enemy also gives you ammo for both weapons. However, should you choose to simply double-tap them with your gun, you will not spiral into madness at the same rate as a normal playthrough. Although there are many hidden third options to most of your choices, the game doesn't let you make any key decisions that sidestep everything.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line does a great job of telling one story but fails to give you the other option of not succumbing to monstrosity. The gameplay is very tiresome and rather boring. Some would say that this is in part of the game trying to parody the meaninglessness of your generic modern First-Person-Shooters, but was this honestly the best way of going about this? Couldn't we have some fun going down this hellish slide?\n\nI only wish that there were more choices that we could make that would better simulate PTSD/anxiety/paranoia. Why was there no choice to interact with the civillian NPCs in a way that would test our distrust of the local populace? Why was there no option to deal with groups that were obviously armed and cutious, yet not overtly hostile?\n\nOverall, Spec Ops: The Line is a good game to experience but not necessarily to play. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy storytelling experiences.","April 3, 2015","true","23.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So the Steam Summer Sale 2015 claimed another $9.89 of my money and thus this game gommba stomped its way to the top of my play priority list. Not at gunpoint this time so I have that going for me. Well it might as well be at gunpoint seeing as the state it left me in after the 4 hours of pure pain and suffering, and yelling to take cover. I knew a few spoilers before picking up this game, the white phosphorus bit, the bit where the black guy turns into Irish from BF4, the turret section, etc., etc. I wanted to get through this game with no surprises and shock. Well the game saw my wants and said,"Well this guy actually wanted a positive outlook on life, he gets the special treatment". I played through it, got frustrated but perservered. My mental state was pretty much neutral: shooting people that were already down, letting characters die, just to see what happens if I actually played the character like I was supposed to. This game made sure that playing the part would be ♥♥♥♥ing disturbing. Imagine Chris Pratt playing as Hitler but with a relatable personality and the whole role revolved around improvising around being cruel. He'll watch the footage and probably curl up into a ball and think on his thought based sins. That's how I felt after seeing what the actual hell Walker was thinking this whole game. No spoilers but when I remembered that the game is based directly on Heart of Darkness/Apocolypse Now near the end, I nearly pisses the bed when I thought I had it all figured out.

Is it the video games? I bet it's the video games."\n\nI'm just going to start off with overall ratings as I know some people don't like lengthy reviews\n\nMajor aspects:\nGameplay: 9/10 Very good for this style which has become so rare (a third person cover and shoot)\n\nStory line: 10/10 The best I have ever encountered, far better than even games such as the Telltale's “The Walking Dead”\n\nImmersion/atmosphere: 10/10 The atmosphere was incredible, this game is one of the rare games that you can truly lose yourself in.\n\nGraphics: 10/10 Despite the game being a few years old I have never seen a game with better graphics.\n\nMinor aspects:\n\nRealism: 8.5/10 Aside from the lack of friendly fire and the fact that you face hordes of enemies while surviving (though your health is relatively low), this game is rather realistic\n\nSmoothness (gameplay): 9/10 This game felt very nice to play and its only fault would be occasionally I would not duck for cover unless I pressed the button several times.\n\nVoice acting: 10/10 All the voices suit the characters very well and there is not a single voice actor that taints the immersion of the game.\n\nPlayer involvement (choices): 10/10 The choices were incredible, however I would have preferred it if there were a few more.\n\nOverall:\n\nI don't really base the score from the minor aspects so the score (from critic point of view) is:\n9.75/10\nThough, personally, I believe this is the greatest game I have ever played and would rate it:\n10/10\n\n\nGeneral review:\n\nWhen I first decided to play this game I thought it was a typical trashy shooter. This was reinforced by the single player being referred to as the "campaign" and even more so when the game started off with a typical Gatling gun in a helicopter scene. However, a few minutes into the game I was proven wrong, this game has the greatest storyline I have ever seen, there aren't really any incredibly “tear jerking” moments as there are with games such as the walking dead, however the game still does an incredible job to connect with the player emotionally as well conveying the emotions and journey of the protagonist. Without trying to give too much away, the game also includes a variation of choices that effect the game and also lead to multiple diverse endings.\n\nThe game play mainly consists of finding cover, coming up from cover and shooting enemies. Though the gameplay is repetitive the various amounts of guns, enemies terrain variations and other things, make the game continuously enjoyable. The animation of combat is very nice as well, the darting for cover and switching to different cover was a very nice animation that made the game feel extremely nice to play.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game, contrasted with the outstanding graphics, creates a unique world for the player to experience. The atmosphere in this game is unlike any other shooter and truly makes you feel like a real soldier, rather than just an emotionless killing machine, this is reinforced by the two soldiers under you command that are polar opposites, I won't go into that though for it would spoil a large portion of the game.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this game any more highly, it is easily the greatest game I have every played and the only real drawback would be the length. The game has everything that you could possibly ask and so much more. IT is incredibly unique and simply extraordinary, it is definitely worth buying and playing.","March 5, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

So the Steam Summer Sale 2015 claimed another $9.89 of my money and thus this game gommba stomped its way to the top of my play priority list. Not at gunpoint this time so I have that going for me. Well it might as well be at gunpoint seeing as the state it left me in after the 4 hours of pure pain and suffering, and yelling to take cover. I knew a few spoilers before picking up this game, the white phosphorus bit, the bit where the black guy turns into Irish from BF4, the turret section, etc., etc. I wanted to get through this game with no surprises and shock. Well the game saw my wants and said,"Well this guy actually wanted a positive outlook on life, he gets the special treatment". I played through it, got frustrated but perservered. My mental state was pretty much neutral: shooting people that were already down, letting characters die, just to see what happens if I actually played the character like I was supposed to. This game made sure that playing the part would be ♥♥♥♥ing disturbing. Imagine Chris Pratt playing as Hitler but with a relatable personality and the whole role revolved around improvising around being cruel. He'll watch the footage and probably curl up into a ball and think on his thought based sins. That's how I felt after seeing what the actual hell Walker was thinking this whole game. No spoilers but when I remembered that the game is based directly on Heart of Darkness/Apocolypse Now near the end, I nearly pisses the bed when I thought I had it all figured out. In the end, the twist made me play through all the endings in a trans and afterwards I started sniffing fundip hoping that it'd improve my mood. Buy the game(on sale) and just go ♥♥♥♥in' nuts.

While the only things holding this game back is the functionality of the controls which can be somewhat frustrating at times and of course the length, being about 4-7 hrs depending on how fast you play. What it lacks there it makes it up in some unique mechanics like sand avalanche kills and some really cool enviroments to play in such as a canyon of sand dunes jumping from skyscraper to skyscraper. The gem that is this game however relies solely on one thing however, it's story.

The game expertly puts you in the shoes of the main character as he teeters on the edge of sanity as his PTSD nightmare slowly consumes him. But in the end, the game's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness.\n\nThe game not only encourages, but actively pushes you towards making crazy "gamer" decisions that leads to the story spiraling out of control. Executing a downed enemy is a common video game mechanic that players have come to expect. Executing a downed enemy also gives you ammo for both weapons. However, should you choose to simply double-tap them with your gun, you will not spiral into madness at the same rate as a normal playthrough. Although there are many hidden third options to most of your choices, the game doesn't let you make any key decisions that sidestep everything.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line does a great job of telling one story but fails to give you the other option of not succumbing to monstrosity. The gameplay is very tiresome and rather boring. Some would say that this is in part of the game trying to parody the meaninglessness of your generic modern First-Person-Shooters, but was this honestly the best way of going about this? Couldn't we have some fun going down this hellish slide?\n\nI only wish that there were more choices that we could make that would better simulate PTSD/anxiety/paranoia. Why was there no choice to interact with the civillian NPCs in a way that would test our distrust of the local populace? Why was there no option to deal with groups that were obviously armed and cutious, yet not overtly hostile?\n\nOverall, Spec Ops: The Line is a good game to experience but not necessarily to play. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy storytelling experiences.","April 3, 2015","true","23.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hit detection never betrays you and you rarely feel cheated.\n- Difficult...I mean...enemies can actually pose some form of challenge. They WILL flank you and they WILL toss grenades World at War style but you are usually given a decent enough warning that if you die, it was probably your own fault.\n- Close encounters/executions are brutal and the game teaches you this rather quickly in a way that doesn't break the immersion.\n- It's actually fun to play. *OPINION WARNING* I genuinely enjoyed playing through it more than once and will be doing it again in the future.\n- Both keyboard+mouse and controllers feel good and neither is necessarily preferable to the other.\n\nStory:\n- It's a ♥♥♥♥ing bloodbath of a war/rebellion-torn Dubai ravaged by mass sandstorms...survive.\n- Okay, there is an initial objective but I don't like spoilers, let's just say there are genuinely concerning questions posed by the twists of a generally taboo topic...think about it...what if the Americans weren't ALWAYS the good guys? Mind-♥♥♥♥ing-explosion, right?!\n\nVisuals (last because it's a ♥♥♥♥ing video game, shut up and play the damn thing):\n- On a high-end machine, it's absolutely stunning the amount of detail placed into the game.\n- Even on a lower-end pc, the game looks solid and if you don't want your pc game looking slightly worse than on xbox, ♥♥♥♥ing buy it on xbox.

The story line is fantastic, and is filled with choices that basically boil down to, "Do you really want to do it the hard way just to spare some civilian lives?"\n\nThe gameplay on, normal difficulty, was perfect for me. Easy enough for you to mow down enemies if you play right, and hard enough to where it messes you up the second you get cocky. The ai and levels are designed to force you to change weapons 2-3 times a level keeping the experience fresh and fun. The AI is pretty smart as well, they have scripted flanks and occasionally you get to hear them talk about their personal lives, reminding you that these are people you are killing.\n\nLike most FPS these days the game is littered with collectables that have their own mini story to tell. Usually I collect them for the sake of collecting them, but these were so good I'd find my self searching dark corners of the level just for a little more story.\n\nOVERALL, it was a great game, I only picked it up because I heard it was a bit unique and it was on sale for like $3. I got lucky, but if I had got it at full price I'd still be very happy. My only complaint, the take cover and sprint button are the same key, it can be as annoying as Assassins Creed's run and climb button from time to time.\n\n\n9/10 When bullets are flying, sometimes your character might decide that instead of diving out of the way, he wants to die a rhino.","May 26, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While you play, you get the opportunity to choose between to options from time to time. But these options are pretty tough. Like, really tough. If you manage to immerse yourself in the setting and the story as i did, you will feel unable to choose sometimes.\nYou literally have to decide wether should saomebody live or die. If you don't, either the game will decide for you, or you simply can't advance.\nYou get a feeling for war and all its cruelties, often with very grafic material, wich is, when immersed, hard to play through.

On the surface it appears to be a generic shooter but if you take the time it is a lot more. The story pays homage to the novel Heart Of Darkness, and draws inspiration from Apocalypse Now, which are both exceptional pieces. Unfortunately it does a lot to turn away the casual player, it has lacklustre game play and a very unfortunate title, that was likely a thought by some producer. However once you look past that it really is a hidden gem amongst terrible tripple A titles. Stay for the immersive stories about the glories of war and ignore the short comings of the gameplay. I would reccomend playing this game on a medium difficulty as I played on the "Suicide" setting and it was frustrating in all the wrong ways.\nAlso the game was very short, I finished on Suicide at 3 hours and 55 minutes.

The main focus here is the EFFECTS of war on the soldiers not the shooting, although the mechanics work great and the gameplay feels solid too. The story follows 3 soldiers stranded in a dying Dubai, a Dubai they thought they were there to save. Surrounded by a raging sandstorm that is too strong to break through they fight their way through hostile sand covered streets and buildings to reach their goal of saving the civilians trapped there. Although nothing is what it seems.\n\nThe twists and turns the story takes almost put the writing of games like Bioshock and GTA to shame.\n\nGamesRadar.com reviewed the game in their "The best videogame stories ever" article and I feel a direct quote would be sufficient:\n\n"Military shooters don't often rank high on the narrative front, usually favoring gung-ho G.I. Joe antics and flag waving over character development. And, at first, Spec Ops: The Line falls right in line with that stereotype--you take control of Walker, a soldier sent into a sandstorm-ruined Dubai to find a missing general. But as time goes on it becomes more and more obvious that there's something more devious afoot, and the shooter's story transforms from run-of-the-mill to one-of-a-kind.\n\nWhat unfolds is a damning criticism of shooters themselves, questioning everything that gamers have grown accustom to. Walker's journey sends him marching into the nucleus of the genre, playing with the storytelling in ways no other game has. By the end you might feel anger or sadness, but the important thing is that you'll feel something, and that's pretty rare in military shooters."\n\nI truly feel anyone who can play a shooter, even poorly, NEEDS to experience this game!\n\nSide note, I know it reads out I only have 2.5 hours, but most of the time spent playing through the SP was offline while my internet was disconnected lol.","April 25, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything is spot on, save for a couple large issues.\n\n1.) Cover is everywhere and reliable almost all the time. I say almost, sometimes you'll take cover against the wrong side of a wall and you'll end up dead because of it. Sometimes the cover doesn't work at all. Some things that look like they should be cover aren't, which can get you killed very easily. But as I said, it's very uncommon for this to occur.\n\n2.) The Checkpoint placement is absolutely H O R R E N D O U S, forcing you to redo large battles over and over, considering the game is relatively difficulty. This is a major problem, especially near the end of the game when you lose a squad mate (not permanantly) and are forced to take on droves of enemies on your own. Many battles seem to occur in waves, it would have been nice to overcome one wave of enemies, then get a save, then continue. It has caused me on multiple occasions to quit the game because I just don't have the mental capacity to deal with this kind of rage. This is coming from someone with hundreds of hours clocked in Dark Souls. I know that there's nothing worse than getting far in a tough situation, only to die and have to redo the entire fight. At least in Dark Souls it  makes sense though.\n\nOther than that I only have praise for the game The story is powerful, I like the clashing characters (I don't /like/ their clashing, I just find it realistic and a great way to cause tension), the gunplay is top notch. The enemy chatter when not engaged is realistic and immersive, reminds me of the guys in Battlefield Bad Company 2 who talk about the movie "Predator" before you have to kill them. It makes you think that these are real humans, it makes you think about your actions and everything you do.

The whole game is intense, unique and will certainly stand out from other third person shooters of the like.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nYou’ll be greeted with a sand-filled Dubai metropolis and a vast desert environment full of dangerous hazards. The lighting, shadows and the small details is what makes this game stand out in the graphics department. It really wants you to see the small details that would usually go unnoticed, nice touch.\n\nStoryline: 10/10\nIt places the player in a situation where a choice must be made whether the player likes it or not. You have come to Dubai for one purpose and one purpose only and that is to locate survivors and radio for Evac. But instead you find this city in the middle of war and the sole purpose of the mission is lost.\n\nSound: 10/10\nGunshots, the sandstorms and voices sound very clear. There are almost no distortions in the sound that could be heard. Each and every weapon in the game sound different from one another. The character voices sound deep and clear, which is a positive aspect of this game.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nThe third person shooter style gameplay is just like any other generic third person shooter, it’s nothing special I’ve seen before. But that’s not to say this is a bad game, of course it’s not. It plays out smooth with no significant frame drops from location to location. The controls, the movement speed and the weapon recoil are all very well implemented.\n\nPrice: 6/10\nComing in at a premium price of £19.99, it is on the expensive side when it comes to the ‘pound per hour’ basis. It’ll only take you around 5-8 hours to finish the game, so it only gets a measly 6 for me. You are better off waiting until this game goes on sale for it to be worth buying.\n","May 30","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It ends like no other.\n\nWARNING: There is a mandatory part of the game that should have a gigantic epilepsy warning in it (In middle of chapter 11). Just a word of caution!\n\nThe TL;DR short summary (scroll down further for long review):\nPros:\n+Incredible single player story. It is thought-provoking and very refreshing. This is what you're playing this game for. Did I mention the story is amazing?\n+The decisions you make, aside from being very morally ambigious and "there is no good choice", are actually pretty creative in that the game does not tell you WHAT you can choose. It plays both on the minds of the characters as well as YOU, as a player.\n+Decent gameplay. Standard 3rd person shooter with cover system.\n+Using sand as a gimmick mechanic adds a little originality to the title. There is also a little bit of tactical squad use (ordering your squadmates to do things) that is limited, but works very effectively and keeps the game from being too boring.\n+Great music, very fitting for the game. A few well-known bands are in there, such as Hendrix, but the original score is not too shabby either.\n+Co-op challenge modes are available, but...\n\nCons:\n-Fairly generic gameplay (It's good, just not great or bad. To be honest you can't really innovate modern warfare without getting all ridiculous though).\n-Co-op is available but only in the form of challenge modes, not in the campaign. Multiplayer is also available but not worth it. You're playing this for the story!\n-Single player campaign is fairly short, although I found it to be the perfect length. Any longer and it would have been too dragged out.\n\nAlthough I played this fairly late (a couple years late, since this came out in 2012), it still remains a testament to story telling in video games, let alone one that is so focused on the things most people seemed to be entertained by - Ridiculous amounts of violence involving weapons and warfare. One only needs to look at the recent sales of the biggest hits to notice the impact shooters have in the games industry.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is a terribly dull title and has a "seen that before" cover art. But don't judge a game by its cover, as it contains some truly entertaining and thought-provoking storytelling that is sadly rare in the shooting genre these days.\n\nTaking place in Dubai, the worst sandstorms in history hit the region, stranding many civilians. The "Damned 33rd" infantry battalion of the United States Army is sent in on relief duty, led by a famous Colonel named John Konrad. However, it appears he and his unit deserted; they disobeyed orders to abandon the city, and the sandstorms effectively create a 'wall' that prevents surveillance and communications, essentially making Dubai a 'no man's land' where no one knows what's going on. You play as Captain Martin Walker, who is sent alongside two fellow soldiers as Delta Force operators for reconaissance. The mission is simple: Confirm the statues of Konrad and any other survivors, then radio for extraction.\n\nAs officially stated by the game's advertisement/captions, the story is very rich and takes plenty of influence from the novel "Heart of Darkness", as well as the movie "Apocalypse Now". Without spoiling this game any further, I can say it lives up to the hype. Your progression throughout the game will have you feeling disgusted, but not in the same in way a bad game would. As you delve deeper, you will see things you rarely see in video games - Among the list includes horrific imagery, morality, questionable actions, tough decisions and more....\n\nIt starts off innocently enough, almost like every other shooter out there. America coming in to save the day, foreigners shooting at you, nothing you haven't seen before. Next thing you know, the line gets very blurry and there are no "good" or "bad" guys, no "good" or "bad" decisions. By the time you enter the credits, you're left looking at war in a different way, and thinking about the actions and consequences of people.\n\nIn addition, the little touches are pretty awesome. Be sure to take breaks frequently and see how the main menu has changed throughout your progression of the campaign. Take in the environmental storytelling (additional "stories" you observe by looking at things not necessarily important to the main plot). Pick up glowing objects ("Intel") to reveal additional story threads. And DEFINITELY pay attention to the loading screens - they are plenty of them and they...well, let's just say if you're too good at the game, it's worth purposely dying multiple times to see them.\n\nAlso among my favourites from this game are the creative decision-making you'll have to make. The decisions you make, aside from being very morally ambigious and "there is no good choice", are actually pretty creative in that the game does not tell you WHAT you can choose. In fact, it doesn't make it obvious at all - there are no buttons or signs pointing in a direction. Without spoiling much, it offers commentary both on the insanity of war and the characters themselves, but also how you as a player may have been trained to think or behave in video games.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's decent. It's a somewhat generic 3rd person shooter with a cover system. You take cover, shoot, reload, all that jazz. What makes the gameplay a tad more unique is their sand and tactical command mechanics. In various locations, sand can be used to your advantage - for example, shooting out windows behind enemies to break the glass and release a wave of sand that will blind or bury your foes. As for tactical commands, you learn how to use your squadmates more effectively by giving them simple orders. In most cases, all you can do is line up the reticle and tell them to target someone, and they'll focus fire him. However, the squad AI is fairly smart (and actually not invulnerable, which is nice) and will use grenades to take out entrenched foes, and sniper rifles for long ranged attacks. Various times the game will also allow you the option of telling them to throw flashbangs to stun foes.\n\nIn addition the game does come with co-op and multiplayer features, although these generally are not worth it. Co-op might be fun if people ever want to revisit Spec Ops, but these are limited to challenge modes, and not the campaign. A bit of a downer as I can see co-op gameplay working well in the story, but nevertheless it does make sense to exclude it. As for multiplayer, as you may have seen from other reviews it's pretty much not worth it. There are better games out there for multiplayer shooters, not to mention the population of Spec Ops multi-players is likely non-existent.\n\nTo conclude, play this game for the story. You won't regret it, although you'll certainly feel something by the end of the story. I do not recommend playing this so close to Christmas time like I did - it's kind of the opposite of happy feelings.\nThis is one of the most highly underrated gems in video games. I certainly do hope more games are made in a similar way, to further show that video games can be more than just violent entertainment for the sake of violent entertainment. Indeed, it is a game that I can definitely list as real "art".\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is different, and all the better for it. Few games leave you feeling like you didn't have 'fun', but instead 'experienced' something on an emotional scale...very drastically, at that too.\n\nDo you feel like a hero yet?","December 26, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My initial impression after completing the demo was a boring and generic third person cover based shooter with little that interested me. Now that I’ve sunk some hours into it, I can safely say my first impression was so wrong!\n\nSpec Ops: The Line is actually one of the most moving games I’ve ever played. The setting, the characters, the overall story and decisions, it all comes together to form such an unforgettable experience. Instead of mindless violence, the player sees the effect each enemy encounter has on the main characters. There’s a progression in the attitude of the characters towards both the enemies and each other. Few games manage to successfully pull this off without making it look outright cheesy.\nThe sandy Dubai setting and unique back story make Spec Ops: The Line even more interesting. No more generic military desert country with “insurgents” and mud huts. Dubai really does feel like Dubai and the problems that exist there feel genuine and make you want to find out more. It’s safe to say that there are plenty of decent twists throughout the story line.\nThe only problem I’ve noticed with Spec Ops is the gameplay which (although fun and addictive) could be improved upon. Enemies moving around and suddenly popping up from cover looks unnatural and the ballistic and particle effects look rubbish (when you shoot walls, fire your weapon). It’s still fun to use all the different weapons and basic squad tactics though. Seeing the look on the main character’s face as he gets shot at is priceless :D\nSpec Ops: The Line is one of the most surprising games I’ve ever played and I feel truly humbled to have found such a gem amongst a year of generic shooters that seriously lack story. The developers at Yager studios put their heart and soul into making The Line what it is and it shows (the same can’t be said for the absolutely terrible multiplayer, but that was made by another studio so who gives a ♥♥♥♥).\n","January 8, 2013","true","12.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

This is a game about games. It holds up a mirror to the player and questions their motivations. Why do you play military shooters? Why do you want to kill people? Why are you looking for excuses to kill people in these games? Do you think you're a hero? To go into more detail would be to spoil an experience that should not be spoiled. I may have given away too much already.\n\nOn the more mechanical front the game is a solid third person cover based shooter with some light tactical squad order mechanics. It plays well but within that genre but never steps into the realm of truly great gameplay. If you like cover based shooters you'll probably enjoy the gameplay.\n\nThe design and detail of the game is exceptional though. It looks lovely and makes great use of its setting in the environment design. Everything is highly detailed, even the voice lines. When giving orders Walker will say exactly where enemies are. "Under the bridge", "beside the statue", "on the staircase" and even, in the one area of the game where there is a T-Rex statue "next to the T-Rex". The tone and content of these lines changes as the game progresses, as do a lot of the details. This is a well crafted game and a lot of love has gone into it.

If it was advertised like AAA titles it'd be one of best games of 2012.\nThe story is good, giving choices and hcallanging (if played on highest difficulty). Some of moments that occur in the game are morally questionable. In real life they are considered war crime's. The game shows brutality of the war in small manner and complete lack of emotions from the oppressors.\nI recommend this game to everyone looking to have a great time in the game that is not casual! It can be completed within 7 hours.\n\n+ Interesting story with multiple choices at every occasion.\n+ Not boring with decent combat. Cover system reminds of Gears of War series.\n+Shows stuff that those pseudo-war games aka CoD and BF will never show.\n+ Not casual, it is easy to die.\n+ Low system requirements.\n+ Replayability value  (different choices throughout the game)\n+ Co-op\n+ Nice graphic quality...\n\n- ... textures could use higher resolution\n- too sensitive mouse controls, you need to set it to 1 ongame options at 2000DPi mouse to be playable\n- Linear story with choices. Yes, those choices are insignificant sometimes they are wrong.\n\nNeutral:\n\nGame lasts 6-7 hours.\n\nOut of all these advantages and disadvantages I recommend this game. Normally it costs 20€, it's good price but if you're saving money get it while on sale for 5€ ;) Regardless of which option you choose, it will be money well spent.","February 4, 2015","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I liked it. Different strokes for different folks.\n\nWere it to be judged purely on its design and mechanics, Spec Ops: The Line would be pretty forgettable, but it has an ace in the hole. And it's a bigg'un: a story so out of the blue in its direction and message that it's a miracle, a major publisher put this game out at all. What you think you're getting- particularly if you only play the demo- is another gung-ho gun-wielding slice of Americans saving the day by killing all the brown people. What you actually get is a slow, spiralling descent into madness of one man, that wears its Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now inspirations proudly and uses them to forge a modern-day commentary on the type of video game you thought you were going to play.\n\nCaptain Walker is no tiantic Call of Duty avatar who can murder a thousand people and walk away- he falls apart mentally, visually and audibly as the game continues, his professionalism is stripped away and raw ego left exposed. "Tango down" becomes a more chilling, "Kill is ♥♥♥♥ing confirmed" as the game confronts you with issues of culpability and responsibility. It's incredibly unsettling and so out of the ordinary for the modern gamer that to most people, this might be thrown aside in disgust.\n\nThis is no Gears Of War/Army Of Two clone. This is the story of one man who loses himself to the brutality of war.\n\nTo the open minded and for someone who wants a great story mixed with an unsettling message, this is a MUST OWN.\n\n","August 17, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While I didn't get that wave of "le feels" the simplistic reviews professed, this game was definitely heavy and deep. The story is brilliantly crafted and the characters are well voice-acted, ultimately resulting in a plot that does not make you question so much "morality" as some players have said, but breaking the fourth wall and questioning the validity of "choice", particularly in games.\n- Excellent shooting, guns feel weighty and effective. Ammo reserves are small forcing you to be tactically prudent and careful.\n- Graphics are artistically beautiful. On the technical side, they are aging a bit, but I got my 60 FPS.\n- Levels, albeit very linear, are designed very well. Absolutely beautiful with some destructable objects, some of which can be used to harm foes.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Arrays of unfriendly and abysmal checkpoints. This game was made in 2012 and there are still checkpoints before cutscenes and scripted events, making you sit through them until the "skip" option pops up about ten seconds later.\n- Multiplayer is a throwaway. This didn't bother me, but it might some. The devs did not intend on implementing multiplayer until the publisher forced them to, so don't let it rub off on your overall opinion.\n- Don't like turret sections? Too bad! About a dozen of these son'-guns in this game.\n- Some story elements seem shoe-horned, such as the unavoidable war crimes you commit perhaps intended to make the player feel remorseful.\n- Squad commanding is a rather two-dimensional feature. You didn't miss out on a lot, but it would have been nice to see something with a little more Republic Commando/Rainbow Six-esque depth.\n- Probably the biggest complaint of all is that this was obviously a console port. The mouse smoothing and acceleration can only be disabled by decrypting the .ini. Some buttons are annoyingly bound to a myriad of actions. Sprinting, taking cover, and reviving your buddies is all bound to the same button and you can't change that, trying to perform one action and performing another has gotten me killed dozens of times.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nHad it not been for the story, it's just another modern military FPS with all the guns you recognize in a pretty environment. With the story, it's fairly impactful, sort of a reflection on games in general. The six hours it took me to complete justifies the $6 it was purchased at, but definitely not the normal $30.","May 16, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, I got a solid TPS with a lot of action and an incredible scenery, packaged in an intriguing but ultimately disappointing story-telling.\n\nPros :- Amazing & original scenery : Dubai lost in a desert storm\n- Even better, the scenery is well exploited and brings a lot in the gameplay\n- Solid TPS gameplay ; nothing out of the ordinary, but all the basis are there and well implemented\n- Good story-telling, but...\n\nCons :- ... But the story doesn't make much sense (yup, I've read all the explanations and they still don't explain correctly a lot of things ; I guess it's just hard to fit what the authors wanted to do with the mechanisms of a shooter game)\n- Worst, the story setting isn't explained clearly, which made me know less than the protagonists and let me wondering what's the heck was going on during almost all the game\n- The story setting is actually some kind of Science-Fiction stuff ; it's not bad in itself, but it would have required some clear explanation (in very short : Dubai has been taken in a several months long desert storm and people are going to die soon)\n- We have to find some intelligence during the game that explains a bit more what happened in Dubai ; some of this stuff is hidden, which means I missed some and it made the story even more muddy... :-/\n- It is in no way tactical (not a con for me, but it's advertised otherwise, so better be clear on that)\n\nBonus Note :Major Spoiler : I'm going to explain why the moral concept completely failed for me.\nThere's no choice that matters, and worst, no choice I felt implicated into.\nStory-wise, the point of no return is when our character kills by mistake civilians. However, I had spotted these civilians and consciously did my best to avoid killing them by firing the mortar on the opposite side of where they were standing. The game still killed them all by making that particular mortar explosion much much bigger than the previous ones.

But no this game is a hidden gem, here is why.\n\nSpec Ops The Line is a 3rd person shooter, with a cover system. But Unlike the rest, this one is more story driven, this makes a massive difference to the way this game plays.\n\nGraphics, this game looked stunning when it first came out, and it still does now. The Devs really put alot of attension to detial and passion into this game..\nThe charators look good and they animate very well, voice sync is pretty much perfect to lip movement etc. The guns you can tell what they are, but remember this is a 3rd person shooter.\nFinally the envirment, just wow, however word of warning which comes with a spoiler alert...This game turns...Dark and sinister quite quickly, now I did warn you that this one is different.\n\nSounds, the weapons sound belivable, but when playing I m spending most of my time not getting shot than I am admiring the sound of the weapons. Explosions have a bassy smooth boom to them, the envirment itself when not in a fire fight is quite quiet all you can hear is the wind howling around the buildings and things moving about in the wind.\nMusic is quite unnoticable during quiet stages of the game, just your standard low intensity tranquil music, till later in the game were the music turns, darker... the firefights the music does pick up but its over showed by the firefight itself.\nLast, voice acting. These are fantasic I mean they would be, this is a story driven 3 rd person shooter. You can even hear the mood in the voices they are that well done.\n\nStory, without giving away too much, this game is based in a storm ridden dubia, you are leader of 3 Spec ops trying to find survers and the "dammed 31St"..But what you acturly find is..a place full of chaos, and civial war. This is all I m wanting to give away.\n\nGameplay, as I said this game is a 3rd person shooter. To that point it plays like any other, it does have a cover system and the controls are tight mostly( althrough they are simifyed for consles) so one button does 3 different things basicly..This can cause issues but I get that.\n\nAs for its gun play it is very tight, and when one knows how the game works and how to move and get the cover system to work with you, than you are in for a great time. I almost forgot to mention about the basic squad commands, but your AI ( and the enamy ai) is pretty good they can take care of themselves and take down thier foes.\n\nNow as I mentioned this game takes a turn, and turns very dark..What I mean is this you get some very odd choices, even through the gameplay is liner its not do this this this..It lets you chose. But in general the devs want you to see the choas and the darkness here, and its that which gives this game a personalilty.\n\nConclustion\n\nSpec Ops the line is a great 3 rd person, and it has a great story to back it up, and the way it delivers that story, with great voice acting..Its a great expierance and a joy to see it.\n\nThis 3rd person is going to be very hard to beat and has alot going for it I feel.\n\n8 out of 10","April 19, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Spec Ops: The Line is set in Dubai after the Country was destroyed by sandstorms. You are a 3 man Delta force unit sent in to find out what happened to a US army 33rd Battalion. Sooner rather than later you find dead American soldiers scattered around and are attacked by an unknown enemy foce that will be revealed later into the game.\n\nAfter the first encounter with the enemy insurgents you are met with a radio broadcast that signals you to US soldiers who have been captured by the enemy. You don't get there in time however and two of the soldiers are executed. One soldier remains who is slowly bleeding out and tells you about the 33rd battalion. Your unit moves into the city and it's all gone to hell.\n\nThe story of this game is absolutely magnificent and the way that the developers played it out made it even better. The length of the story was perfect and if they played it out anymore than they did it probably would have been boring and would have seemed to be dragged out. It's short, with about 6 hours play time but it has some replayability with the achievements and the unlockable difficulty.\n\nThere are multiple things to destroy in this game that makes sand smash everything which can be quite hilarious. There are also choices that the player needs to make which can effect what happens with the story and the direction the game is going in. There are also multiple endings which I will leave you to find out. When facing these decisions the player will go through and question themselves when choosing which one to do. There are also a lot of dead bodies in this game, a lot. There are also a lot of burning bodies and burned bodies.\n\nGraphics on this game are great, the scenery is very nice and even though most of it is sand and destroyed buildings it still looks great. Even though I played on medium settings it still looked good so if you have it on High with AA turned to the highest it would look amazing.\n\nOverall this game is a 9/10 and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes third person shooters which are different and want a bit of variety.","February 16, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game achieves through its single player campaign what games like Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield and countless other war games have tried to do. It puts you in the middle of a harsh war scenario where you have to think on your feet and make moral decisions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/recommended/50300/","8799644","Vegetarian Atheist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/","508 products in account","A nearly flawless third person shooter.\n\nLet's get the story out of the way. You play as Captain Walker who, along with the other two guys, is sent to the destroyed city of Dubai in order to investigate a distress signal by the missing Colonel Konrad. Pretty soon you discover that the city is not empty and is filled with some civilians as well as the AWOL U.S. 33rd Army battalion which was supposed to evacuate the city after being deployed in Kabul. You then quickly proceed to battling and killing your country-men. Neat. I'm surprised this German developer didn't get any heat from critics yet for giving you the ability to kill U.S. army men. Along the way, you unravel the mystery as to what exactly is happening.\n\nThe scenery is quite breathtaking. The Unreal 3.0 engine makes character models and distant vistas look crisp. The desert is so well made that it reminded me of the Uncharted 3 desert. You also get to leave foot prints in the sand. There are no texture pop ins and every texture is pre-rendered. However, the amount of video options is limited. The engine provides no DX10,11 or anti-aliasing for that matter.\n\nThe game itself plays like a solid A/B action flick. There are some grand action set pieces, there is plenty of dialogue, there are opportunities to sneak up on enemy and there are some grave choices to be made and alter game in the process.\n\nOne of the most essential components of the game is the A.I. and boy is it good, both friendly and A.I. The enemy soldiers will communicate with each other, they will give out orders, they will attempt to flank you and sometimes attack you from both sides at the same time, they WILL run away and jump away from your grenades, they will retreat, raise alarms, call for back ups, they will also throw grenades pretty accurately and they will do suppressing fire as well. However, some handpicked A.I. will just stand there without taking cover, just waiting to be shot. The reason is that if they are standing on the glass or next to a mountain of sand behind glass, they can be killed with the force of the surrounding environment.\n\nThis game forces you to think when dealing with the enemy. They aren't supermen and they aren't pushovers either.\n\nAs for the friendly A.I., well just about the only way that you can order your teammates around is by telling them to attack this guy or that guy or flash bang them. However, once you do give the order, your team mates will do their best to take out the indicated guy either with regular rifles, sniper fire or grenades. At times, I saw my team mates stand their own ground pretty effectively. This feature is unparalleled with many shooters, wherein even IF you are a part of the team, you are the one getting shot at most and you are the one having to kill every foe. (COD ahem)\n\nYou also get to collect intel and figure out what happened to the populace and Dubai in general after the biggest sand storms decimated the city.\n\nSomething about the gameplay feels right, I can't quite put my finger on it. You can only carry two weapons and a handful of grenades. The ammo is always scarce so the game forces you to not waste ammo. I also like how any assault rifle magazine will be out of ammo after just a few bursts - it's all pretty realistic. There is no evasion button and there is no prone button. The constant sand storm atmosphere creates a hostile and extreme environment and the sound of sand storms is quite deafening. Also, what's awesome is that once your frag grenade explodes, it also creates a collateral sand fog which stuns the surviving enemies which can be plucked one by one.\n\nAs far as the weapons are concerned, well, every other weapon has a secondary feature. The M-16 or whatever has a silencer, so does the pistol, the AK-47 has a three bullet burst feature, the sniper rifle has a 8x, 16x zoom feature, etc.\n\nThe thing that quite often DOES mess up the gameplay is the sprinting, that's right. When you go forward press "space" for sprinting (default) and then let go of "space", Walker will just keep sprinting for an indefinite amount of time. And if you want to stop immediately, you have to press "S", to back up. So I decided to switch to the good old "shift" for sprinting instead. It sorta helped but the running still feels consolish, especially when you try to make sharp turns and attempt to take cover while being shot at. What sucks again though is that the crappy consolized controls made "shift" stand for both sprinting AND melee. It's like, seriously devs? You could not allocate a separate action key for melee for us, PC gamers? we do have a keyboard, you know.\n\nOh about that, when you are running toward cover and getting shot at, your character will automatically slide towards cover for about 2-3 meters, which is pretty neat because the game does not force you to press the cover button again. That's what they should have done in Operation Raccoon City instead of just adding automatic cover that doesn't work half the time.\n\n\nI've also noticed that the devs put a lot of effort into level design which look as if they were taken from real locations. The flamboyant hotel rooms, the flashy lobbies, the elegant living quarters, the vanity statutes, the artifacts displaying wealth of the city now gone - all bring an engaging dystopian feeling. At times, there are also numerous ways of advancing and flanking your enemies.\n\nThe wobbly cross-hair is quite neat. The only time your aim is remotely steady is when you come out of cover, however if you sprint and then attempt to shoot, your aim will be all over the place. Thus, every other kill feels like a small accomplishment. If there only was no regenerative health. The good thing is that your team mates cannot revive you when you get shot up. However, you can pick them up and they can pick each other up.\n\nI should also add that voice acting in the game is quite exceptional.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, well, it delivers on many levels. The crappy sprinting is still there, so it's best to not run at all. You get to customize your character as you progress. You get to choose 15 perks as you progress. These range between being invisible on the minimap while sprinting, increasing your protection against explosives, reducing the cross-hair wobble, increasing your weapon damage, increasing your mini-map (radar) range, etc. As for the weapons, there are 5 SMGs, 9 Assault rifles, 4 shotguns, 4 sniper rifles, 6 handguns, 2 machine guns and RPG. The levels are pretty balanced too. Some levels feature active destruction and temporary sand storms that reduce your speed, visibility and accuracy. Sometimes these storms cause collapse of nearby structures so you better stay clear.\n\nHowever, if you are playing a 30 minute match and then all of a sudden "lose connection to server" all your progress is going to reset. Now this sucks big time because after playing for some time, I "lost connection to server" and reverted back to level 1. Now this is a certainly good feature to discourage rage quitters and quitters in generals but it sucks big time when you lose your experience points and perks.\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty solid M-rated (there is torture, mutilated bodes, up-close violence and executions) third person shooter with some new gameplay elements and addictive multiplayer that will keep your interested. Here are the minuses:\n\n1. Limited video options.\n2. No Co-Op campaign. (This could have easily been a 2-3 player co-op game).\n3. Medium-length campaign. 15 medium-length chapters.\n4. The pistol cross-hair sucks. And you can't turn it off.\n5. No way to turn off indicators when in cover. (Indicators that tell you if you can swap cover; it's cluttering the screen)\n6. Crappy consolish sprinting.\n7. Limited destruction.\n8. Bad grenade explosion animation.\n9. Having to press "space" for springing, taking cover and reviving team mates.","November 27, 2013","true","125.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

But the gameplay, to be honest, is mediocre if not horrible. Plus Multiplayer is dead. Graphics, let's say, mediocre again because it is really not impressive. The whole weight of the game goes to the narrative. It is really a anti-FPS shooter game. I even doubt if they actually made the other aspects of the game deliberately awful so as the player can focus on the "shock" of the narrative. Thus it is most fun to play this game with the expectation that this is just another shooter like GoW etc.\n\nThe choices (and how impotent they are) the player are asked to make reminded me of Mass Effect series particularly 3 and its ending. The psychological manipulation and guilt-driven portrayal of war all aims at making the player uncomfortable (possibly contemplating). The hero is the villain. It is not the usual "there is no clear cut between hero and villain" rehtorics, but the entire dichotomy is destroyed. There is no justice in a war and it does not matter which side you choose. When the soldier is bodily on the battlefield, the gore and brutality does permanent damage to him. It affects the protagonist to its core while the he strives to maintain his legitimacy through construction of himself as the hero regardless of what he had done to many lives.\n\nNow I am going to read that whole book, if I ever got the time.","July 9, 2014","true","5.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The combat is nothing special, but it is in the story that the true genius of this game is found.\n\nThe story is something that I would not have imagined from a game of this genre so that is a huge positive in my books.

However, this is somewhat deliberate due to the context of the game being a gritty, dark game in a unique setting that makes you question everything about shooters such as these.\nThis is a game that reminds you the reality of war compared to war in video games. In many games, you gun through loads of enemies because thee game told you to without thinking why. This game makes you think why.  In many games, you're a hero that saves the  day. This game makes you think what makes you that hero. The game beats you up for doing tthings that it common practice in shooters, and really makes you think differently about modern day shooters we see all so much of. This is helped by some great voice acting and script work along with both subtle and shocking story devices that make this game feel unique.

A few problems that I came across from the game were some fairly bad gun accuracies, covering is a bit clunky, and that some enemies still took a few bullets to the head to go down (not talking about elites or heavies, they're armored so understandably it's going to take more to kill them). Other than that, I liked this game.\n\nAll the weapons have weight to them, making it satisifying when you throw a flash or frag, even headshots slow time down to make it that little bit enjoyable. The story seemed like it's a patchwork of smaller stories with one, over-arching tale, not sure if this was intentional, but it was still really good compared to other FPSes.

The gameplay, the graphics, and the soundtrack helpt to carry the game well, but it's the story that will make you want to keep on going\n\nThe gameplay is well refined, with the 3rd person shooting mechanics working very well as you would expect from a game within the past few years.  Decent amounts of environmental disasters and interactions help to keep things fresh and enjoyable.  I was able to complete the game in about 7 hours, though to be honest it seemed like much longer, but in a positive way as I enjoyed my time with this game.\n\nThe multiplayer seems to be a bust and thats a shame because when there are others to play with it isn't half bad, especially considering the limited 3rd person shooter options for PC gamers.\n\nOverall I would absolutely recommend this game, it deserves a playthrough for anyone who enjoys 3rd person shooters and/or especially to those who like a good, thought provoking story.\n\nPlease upvote this if you agree with this review and enjoyed this game!

In the wake of other AAA titles like the Call of Duty, Battlefield, Gears of War, Just Cause, Resident Evil and countless other shooter based franchises, Spec Ops: The Line truly captures the essence of great gaming that is usually missed by other tripple A titles. A heart felt story with likable characters who go from clean-cut delta operators to rugged murderers with heavy conciouses. The story is truly beautiful with severeal different endings all of which prove to give the feeling of sorrow as you see how far Capitan Walker has fallen into darkness. Stellar voice acting that progresses as you move through the campaign and reacts to situations. Spec Ops: The Line take away the romanticised views of war that most war games have and open the player's eyes that in war you're going to make choices between outcomes that are wrong and wronger, there is no right in war. With beautiful writing and an action pack campaign Spec Ops delivers 110%.\n\nSome people complain that many of the choices you make don't have too much effect on the story but personally i belive the devs made it this way to show that in times of crisis a lot of the decisions you make are insignificant because in the end everyone dies in a blaze of glory and only the lucky can make it out alive and even then, they leave part of themselves behind.\n\nThe only things I can find wrong with the game are the ♥♥♥♥ multiplayer (so close to having the perfect game but sorry), and slightly wonky controls, however you get used to judging distance before hitting certian buttons (example: accidentally meleeing a car instead of going into cover because you were too far away when you hit the cover/melee key)\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game doesn't bring anything new to the shooter genre, some could even say it starts off as a generic shooter game but, it quickly shows that it did so deliberatly in order to show the true horrors of war. What it does is use everything the shooter genre does right and fix the one thing it does wrong: leave out the results of your actions and the true horrors of war.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to all fans of the shooter genre and those who are casual players of shooter games because this game is truly an experience that everyone need to experience once in their life.\n\nSingleplayer story: 11/10 absolutely perfect\n\nControls: 9.5/10 difficult at first with slightly unconventional key bindings but the game eases you in and you can quickly master the controls\n\nMultiplayer: 6/10 rushed, nothing special, kinda ♥♥♥♥, nobody plays the multiplayer anymore though so don't even worry about it. It has co-op though! But that is its only saving grace.\n\nOverall i'd give it a 10/10, its flaws are so insignificant that they are overshadowed by everything the game does right, get this game ASAP, you won't regret it.\n\nDo you feel like a hero yet Walker?","January 27, 2015","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Make sure you pay attention to the dialogues as the game progresses, as not fully understanding the backstory or one event in a chain may drastically hamper the feelings of what the story is trying to push onto you. In my opinion, it's far more important than the gameplay at times in order to get the most of this game because of so. The plot development is very well thought out and unpredictable, and the chain of events plus the sudden twist near the end will really make you think deeply once the game concludes. A lot of the cutscenes in the game are not like typical ones you'd find in modern shooters, as they were made to emphesize the emotions felt by the characters as well as passing it to you. A movie should be made based on the plot of this game, as there hasn't been much military movies made with plot that will make you feel emotional about what the mental torments the soldiers have to go through.","December 31, 2013","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While games like CoD and BF rule the millitary game market, a game that only view the "badass" part of war, that "glorifies" war. A more honest and factual game about war, that tells war as a one of the most horrible act that humans have ever done, a game that tells you the reality of war, especially from psychological, morality, and phillospical standpoint is heartbreakingly pretty much unknown.\n\nSpec Ops: The Line, despite its not that impressive name (oh, that "Spec Ops" give me an impression of a cliche'd and poorly made U.S soldier heroism-themed game, could've been better if they just named it "The Line") turns out to be a very emotional, memorable, and fantastic game of 2012, and the last 5 years, probably even for the next coming years. It's a rare game, especially in this oversaturated modern millitary game, that it so AWESOME it doesn't even need a sequel, and I'm not even being sarcastic.\n\nStory (10/10)\n\nThe Line (to shortened it, and because I like the name better) takes you to a story of Captain Walker and his Delta squad in a mission to Dubai to rescue and evacuate survivors and to search Walker's most honored comrade, John Konrad. Seems like just another day of run and gun mililtary game, right? Nope, not at all. It do have the basic premise, it do have a so-so, and even slow start (which actually help up to build the general feeling and atmosphere), but fortunately that slow start really pay off and feel like its necessary for the story progression. And that's all what you need to know.\n\nThe story is the ultimate driving force of this game, inspired by "Heart of Darkness", which is I don't read it myself yet (that's my longtime homework), that inspired a movie called "Apocalypse Now", having watched the Redux version of Apocalpse Now (and love it wholeheartedly) I know what to expect from this game, its not your typical modern millitary game, rather than pure soldier heroism, The Line tackle themes like morality of war, PTSD, and the darkest side of both war and human's nature. When morality and humnism collides with duty, obsession, and the will to survive, a man's  rational and sanity can be pushed to the very edge of madness and depression.\n\n"I thought we're here to rescue people"\n\nThe Line is a beautifully horrible experience, its like a surrealistic painting, it looks well...surreal and full of unexplained mind♥♥♥♥, but somehow it has magical spell that make you appreciate the art as something meaningful and beautiful depite its sometimes disturbing look. So does The Line, its surreal, full of twist and mind♥♥♥♥, disturbing, and even disgusting in a point, Yet, its still a brilliant and one of the most beautifully written game that will make you stop and think, about the consequences of war, consequences of every choices you made, and will raise a lot of question and interpretaion as you move along.\n\nThe Line is a game with extreme detail of storytelling, making sure there's no plot holes and illogical plot progression yet it still retain its surrelistic aspect and able to  raise a good amount of question and interpretaion for the players to evaluate and speculate. And the character, both cast and development is OUTSTANDING. They feel so alive, very emotional, much human. Wow. Well, yeah, I mean it. And once again, the subtle things is the greatest aspect of the game, and it applicable to the character.\n\n"I've saved so many lives Captain, but I've killed so much more".\n\nGameplay (8.7/10)\n\nThe weakest part of the game, but still the gameplay is incredibly tight, intense, and solid. It's just that, the control and default key binding is not the most confortable I've experienced so far. There's nothing really innovative or noteworthy about the gameplay, but it does the job very well. The Line is a third person, cover-based millitary game. Oh yea, firstly, the gameplay section, and even sound and graphic section will be filled with the element that could've belong to the Story section, because once again its the ULTIMATE driving force of The Line.\n\n"There must be another option, THERE IS another option"\n" No, there really isn't"\n\nThe "choice" system is the most unique and the probably the best I've ever seen in a game. One thing I can say, its war, when you faced by two (or more) chocies, the latter doesn't make the former any better, vice versa. Every action has its consequences, and I must say it again..this is war, the conseuquences are unsatisfactory and bitter, and will always be. Sometimes the choice do matter, sometimes doesn't. Sometimes we have to choose to sacrifice between yourself or the other, sometimes we faced an inevitable chocies, sometimes we don't really have any other choice.\n\nThe subtlety and the "smaller, more detailed" things in The Line is the more interesting part of the game, This is surprisngly where The Line shines through. As I said, this game is about extreme detail of storytelling, that affect the other aspect of the game like gameplay, sound and in a way, graphic. As for the gameplay, I can't really tell the "little detail", since I can't seem to word it out, and I might be spoiling something along the way. But, then again, The Line is a simple, action-packed, third person game, with enough intensity to keep you hooked to the game, with enough variety of weapons and enemies, and also a simple yet effective tactical commands.\n\nAnd for the A.I, they're  competent and smart enough to give me a good deal of challenge, and I must say that I get the "Max Payne 3" feeling, simple, action-packed run and gun with heavy emphasis of storytelling, a bit repetitive but.. (continues to graphic section)\n\nGraphic (9.2 / 10)\n\n...the level design and set pieces is  pretty amazing and well thought of, that it retain a sense of vairety and familliarity in the same time. It is varied, but you won't feel like you're moving to another place that is in another continent, you're still in Dubai from start to finsih, but you won't feel bored. The use of Unreal Engine 3 give me the "Bioshock Infinite" feel (which is another example of great storytelling in a game), no,no, not that UE3 games looks like BioShock Infinite, but its more like the atmosphere, the presentation of the game. While BioShock Infinite is a mixture of cinematic-fantasy, The Line is cinematic-reality. And the use of UE3 is the best choice, I like the rough look of UE3 (Rainbow Six Vegas is one example) gives you a sense of reality and believable atmosphere at the course of the game. The effects is done right, not underused nor overused, giving both realistic and dramatic feel in the same time. The animation is fluid and well done overall. I have nothing bad to say really\n\nSound (9.6/10)\n\nAMAZING, again.. this game fascinated me on how they blend in cinematic and realism. The gun sounds so intense, the voice acting easily put most games to shame, they're just lfielike. Not to mention the brilliantly written dialogue. One thing that caught me off guard is the dialogue between the enemy soldier, even the enemy soldier is very much human, at many occassion, I feel really bad for killing those soldiers who talks about gum, peace, and family. They're just group of soldiers that fights for their life, their people, their family. And I question myself, Do I really that of a monster to kill those people?\n\nOverall (9.8/10)\nThere's nothing call as perfection, but near pefect, there certainly is, and this is the game. The Line is a game that everyone has to experience, It's a game that ask us a serious question to reflect, a series of phillosophy worth noting, and it tell us the cause and effect, action and consequences of war in a 'disturbing' way.\n","January 29, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first, I could not believe another shoot-them-all game would change my view on the genre. So, feeling quite sceptically, I purchased it and prepared for another meaningless mix of violence and cursing.\n\nWell, there was a lot of violence and cursing indeed. However, it was flavoured with a great concept of a single man creating his own world. His own war. His own enemies. And, after all, sacrificing his people for the sake of his own illusions.\n\nFrankly, I find the Spec Ops relatively close to the Bioshock Infinite. It is far more than shooting. Both games are about seeking the truth and realising that there is no truth. There is reality. Or plenty (in case of Bioshock).\n\nBut let me get back to the matter of this particular game. Amongst all shooters that I have played, this one I doubtlessly call the #1. That I do for that the game possesses all of the following:\n1. Great storyline;\n2. High-quality graphics;\n3. Distinctive characters;\n4. Lots of shooting;\n5. Handy gameplay;\n6. Right of choice;\n7. Unexpected ending.\n\nWhat do I have to say for conclusion?

While it (like others have pointed out) has clunky controls which at times has made me say "grrrrr....", the story is nonetheless great -- it is thought provoking while depressing at the same time. The graphics are nice, and the audio/soundtrack is good. A non-so-classic take on a (classic?) genre. My total playtime was about 6 hours, which is in agreement with others' times. Hope this helps.\n\nOverall, I would recommend if you are looking for a great story, but not necessarily for gameplay. I have to think that the gameplay wasn't *that* bad though.

An interesting thing is that I sometimes felt like I was doing a little right, even when doing the wrong.

The cover-based, third-person combat is somewhat generic, but still fun.\n8.5/10","August 25, 2014","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get into cover.  You shoot guys with guns.  Run to the waypoint to continue getting into cover and shooting guys with guns.  It feels fairly clunky to actually get into cover.  I felt like I had to hit the space bar a specific way to actually get into cover.  There are a handful of weapons in different categories like rifles, shotguns, small arms, snipers and heavy weapons.  Everything feels fairly generic with a few exceptions like shooting a part of the environment to dump sand on your foes and that's about it.  You can give orders to your team, but some orders only pop up at specific times and I could never seem to be able to use the attack order.  I was able to beat the campaign on the hardest availible starting difficulty in under 7 hours.  Again, as a game, it's pretty generic.\n\nAs an experience, it's a completely different beast.  Never in my life have I played a military shooter that was this shocking.  If you thought the nuke scene and "no russian" from Call of Duty were hardcore, then you haven't seen anything yet.  It's really something you have to see for yourself and I wouldn't dare spoil it.  If I had to compare the story to anything, it feels a lot like the movie "Apocalypse Now" and if you've seen that movie then you should be aware of the levels of shock you are getting into...but even the story here goes above and beyond that.   Again, as an experience, it's quite unique.\n\nIf you can get it cheap, do not pass it up even if you don't like cover shooters.  This is one game you need to see to the end...","August 25, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't recommend reading too too much about the game before playing because the story is easily-spoiled once you're made aware of its inspirations (a certain piece of literature, and a certain film).","September 1, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While you get to kill everyone you see, you don't get to be a hero for it. At times though, it feels a bit artificial and i could not quite immerse in the story. This maybe because it is sometimes quite brutal in showing the consequences of... well, killing everyone. I really enjoyed the imagery used in the game and the composition of colors. It was just nice to look at (at least while it didn't show you burned corpses and the like). The level design itself was rather linear though. The music is really awesome and reminded me instantly of the game's inspiration, Apocalypse Now.\n\nWhat i really didn't like about the game were it's technical shortcomings (which mostly deduce from it being released on console aswell). The thing that annoyed me the most were the controls. I don't know how many times i was killed because the same button is used for cover and sprint. Actually even console controllers should have enough buttons, so why not just use different buttons ffs? Anti-aliasing would have been nice, but apparently consoles don't have it, so neither has the pc version. Last but not least, while the main character was high detail, everything else wasn't. The textures used on the environment were rather muddy, even for a 2012 title.","January 12, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Praised for the wrong reasons, bashed for the wrong reasons. As someone who took the time to complete all achievements in this game, I think I can safely say it has a special place in my heart. So maybe I'm biased. Oh well. Look, there's more to this game than the infamous scenes you probably know about by now. The game's so much more interesting in its subtle elements and references to previous works of literature or film. Look, just play The Line. Or don't. Some people played it and thought it was a pretentius piece of crap. Well, they're kind of right. It tries too hard sometimes. But for some reason, I can't keep forgetting about this little game. Something about it just feels... right to me. Maybe it's the 33rd's interesting personalities. Maybe it's the great music. Maybe it's the feeling of "what just happened?" you'll often experience.
