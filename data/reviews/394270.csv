"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muffthepuff/recommended/394270/","muffthepuff","Muffthepuff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muffthepuff/","41 products in account","Country Tales\n[Disclamer - I was provided a copy of by the publisher for review purposes]\n\nThe good\nAddictive gameplay\nGood difficulty curve\nThe not so good:\nAnnoying cinematics\nThe conclusion:\nIf you like time management games then Country Tales will keep you engaged for at least 10 to 20 hours. You build sawmills, then you buy wood, then you build houses, you feed your minions, collect rent and rinse and repeat, with each area adding a new type of building and a new challenge. And you pray time doesn’t run out on you.\nHonestly, the game doesn’t distinguish itself at all from similar titles. In the last 5 years I feel like the recipe for “time management games” hasn’t changed a bit and I played dozens, all of them so similar that I can’t even remember their names. They all feel like they were made in the same workshop and someone there just doesn’t wanna give up on the boring, cutesy “cinematics” that tell a boring, cutesy story.\nIn any case, there’s nothing actually wrong with Country Tales, it’s a very well done and relaxing game, I haven’t found any bugs and I really enjoyed hunting golden stars.\nYou can see me collecting resources and fixing up Indian tents here - https://youtu.be/EZJeD8p7dkE","September 24, 2015","true","11.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The characters are likable, the setting is appealing. I have played for a few hours and the game runs smoothly.","September 29, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

When playing on timed levels I found a few that were hard to get done, but it is possible.  The story is cute but corny and the finish is predictable, but over all I found it to be a fun game. I definately give it a thumbs up !","December 13, 2015","true","55.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
