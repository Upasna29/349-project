I purchased it on a whim, and having now played it for nearly 100 hours and all treasures collected, it has definitely turned out to be one of my wisest purchases (and heck, i'm actually writing a proper review for once, my first one on steam.)\n\nRE:IS is a roguelike in an Indiana Jones style - you and your crew will be having adventures all around the globe, from searching castles in the Scottish highlands to the tombs of  ancient pharoahs in Egypt in the hopes of finding treasures (and with over 100 treasures to find, there is plenty to see.) You'll run into a variety of characters such as bagpipe playing clansmen,  pirates suffering under a voodoo curse and a group of monkeys worshipping a giant fruit.\n\nThe game keeps a fairly lighthearted and humourous theme throughout, which is aided by its bright and colourful art style. Don't let this fool you however - there is a surprising amount of depth to be found in the games combat and exploration systems. Battles have three different approaches: you can befriend your enemy, offering them things such as compliments and peace treatires. Or you can take a straight up physical approach - hacking and slashing your way through hordes of your opponents. If you prefer a more devious approach, you can play mind games with your opponents, hurling insults towards them in such number that they run away from the battlefield sobbing.\n\nOverall, RE:IS takes a refreshing approach to the turn-based rogue-like genre. The developers are very active within the community and listen to feedback and suggestions from players. The game is frequently updated with new content, and more has been promised down the line. I highly recommend purchasing this game.","October 10, 2015","true","471.0"," 314 of 328 people (96%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","96","314","328","10","3"

It's radically different from the typical RPG or strategy games that I am family with.  Because it is so different, it took me a while to grasp and learn the basics of the game. In the end, after learning about the game, I begin to have great fun... and hundreds of hours on the game.\n\nThe nice thing about RE is that the entire game campaign consists of 5 expeditions, and you can play it over and over again with different team setups. Different team captains have different super powers, and so, each game with a different captain usually require different strategy and even different playstyle, making in intriguing and interesting.\n\nAnother nice thing about RE is that the development team offered to add additional contents and updates on a regular basis. So far they have already added quite a bit of new content. Such a commitment from a developing team is really commendable. Even with 276 hours played, I will still be playing this game whenever they add anything new.\n\nI am sure I will get MORE than my money's worth and highly recommend this game.\n","October 8, 2015","true","305.9"," 96 of 106 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","96","106","3","2"

I impressed them with my great intelligence, then insulted them.  They were confused by my mixed signals and ran away.  My most successful run was ended when a ghost pirate and his voodoo cultists were friendly and invited me to sit down for tea, and my crew felt that their vengeance against the Spanish was entirely reasonable and I should stop fighting.  My current game is more direct and is full of dashing gentlemen and fisticuffs.\n\nThis is absolutely amazing.  Yes, the overland map is a lot like FTL--random events that are influenced by your party skills.  Combat is your standard hex based tactics game (even though it's not really hex shaped, which is neat).  Physical attacks work like normal, but speech attacks are a major part of the game, and so is control of emotions and mood.  If your enemy is using devious speech attacks but you are being friendly (they all deplete Spirit just like physical attacks), then you get defense bonuses from being the good guys.  If both sides are friendly, then both sides get a bonus if they are the first ones to go to physical attacks, stuff like that.  Takes about an hour or two to really get used to it, but then it feels natural.\n\nThis game is pretty polished.  Not perfect, but it hits its mark pretty darn well.  Difficulty seems pretty well tuned, the first couple missions are easy but surviving to the end seems like a real challenge, much like FTL.  You can sit down for a couple hours and play a game or two and have them end in one sitting which is great, honestly...replayability seems high, and unlockables are present but a very minimal part of the experience.  Bugs are very minor and hard to spot.  It's really damn cool to be able to build a party that fights like something out of Monkey Island.\n\nAll in all, heavily recommended.","September 2, 2015","true","25.5"," 86 of 95 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","86","95","8","0"

I have played about 1.5 hour so far and enjoyed it a lot during this time. It is kept in nice lighthearted mood that will keep you smiling through most of a game. I enjoy tactical encounters a lot and the fact that i can resolve in different ways. It is no longer just a case of winning but winning in the way that will benefit our crew the most.\n\nGame keeps it short and composes of 5 expedition to finish one run. It is similar to FTL in that manner that it can be completed in one afternoon and then you go on pick a new crew and start new procedurally generated adventure. I think game has potential to give hours of fun.\n\nI also highly appreciate the tutorial in the game it teaches all the basics you need to know to complete first expedition.\n\nMy greatest concern is the price FTL legend that started it all is on sale for $ 9.99 and as much as I appreciate beautiful graphics of Renown explorers and more work put into the build I would prefer it to be slightly cheaper. For me it’s still worth it but it’s up to you to decide.\n\nI also have a video featuring first procedurally generated expedition in which I show the gameplay, talk about mechanics, and teach you how to play feel free to check it out and let me know what you think.

You lead a crew through a series of locations, some of which are just text-based choices, some of which are fighting encounters, many of which give you the opportunity to gather resources that you can later spend on upgrades and items that improve your crew. The game puts you in the shoes of a Dr. Livingstone-like explorer, going through the ruins of ancient civilizations looking for plunder. It's very good in this way. The art style is incredibly cute and a great asset to the game. Not only are the twenty different characters you can take on an expedition instantly recognisable, the character portraits in-game change when you affect their emotions, which is a lot of fun (making sheep sad is especially rewarding). The music is good as well, never distracting from the game, always adding to it.\n\nA game like this, however, lives and dies with its events. Such games throw a lot of text at you, and it needs to be enjoyable. This, the game succeeds at. There are quite a number of cute little unique responses that make you want to replay the game to see how different characters would interact (for example, a pair of Hungarian lumberjacks gave me some extra goods because they were impressed by my moustache). As such, the game is quite good. It falters a bit in the combat, though. You can use three types of attacks (friendly, devious, and aggressive) to solve encounters, and they affect what you get out of the encounter, but they do tend to play out the same way in an encounter. You can do some nice tricks with it, but it doesn't feel as deep as in FtL. Another negative in the comparison with FtL is that you never really feel pressured. You use up your supplies to move through the map, but there aren't a lot of events that mess with you, so you can usually plan your entire expedition and proceed unrushed. The events do seem to have a lot more variation than in FtL, and the perks that you can unlock for your characters throughout the game make for extra interactions and unique responses to events.\n\nAll in all, Renowned Explorers is a very good game. It's enjoyable and its humour makes it very replayable. The humour, graphics, and sheer variety of events makes up for some of its shortcomings and makes it a game that I would be more likely to pick up again than FtL, where I have kind of already seen everything it has to offer. It could do, however, with some more depth in its combat system.","September 2, 2015","true","92.2"," 58 of 66 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","58","66","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/recommended/296970/","sonoralax","Sonora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/","456 products in account","Renowned Explorers: International Society (RE:IS) has done it. It has captured my attention. From the very first run through of the game, to the second and third, I have been captivated, and rightfully so. The graphics, audio, and gameplay - all of it is absolutely stunning.\n\nWhen I first placed RE:IS on my wish list I knew I had discovered a gem. Turn-based strategy games were, however, never my forte and I was hesitant when I found out RE:IS was one. Plenty of other TBS games have sat in my Steam library - gone unnoticed - but somehow, this one screams for my attention.\n\n"Why?", do you ask? Well... let me try and answer that.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nGameplayVery basic in that you try to gain the most treasure within 5 explorations in ordered to be known as 'The Most Renowned Explorer'. You achieve all of this through a turn-based system, working with either a friendly, aggressive, or deceptive approach. Bonuses can either bolster or hinder your team, and it is up to you to determine what is best. With over ten characters to choose from, the possibilities are endless.\n\nGraphicsDon't let RE:IS' graphics deter you from playing this game, although I'm not sure why it would in the first place. While comical, they are what make this game unique, fresh, and complete. You honestly can't go wrong with this type of art style.\n\nEvery aspect has been paid attention to: from the facial expressions due to a failure or wealth of luck, or the different attack styles and use of abilities on opponents. I applaud the developer's for putting so much effort into this aspect.\n\nAudioThe sound effects for this game can be considered  "cutesy" and refreshing. There is a unique sound for everything and it all fits. From the whooshing of the ocean slapping the seashore, to the "ca-ching!" of coins being exchanged, RE:IS delivers quality sound effects and tracks.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPros+ High replayability value\n+ Great use of audio and music\n+ Graphics are great and unique\n+ Ability to take down a bully, make them cry, and wipe the smug smile off their face\n+ The sheep are darn stinkin' cute. They love you and your cause (as long as you're friendly)\n+ Weekly challenges offer something to do all the time with the RE:IS community (goes hand in hand with this game having a very friendly fan base)\n+ This can go both ways, but I appreciate that this game actually takes skills to play. You will have to think ahead - plan ahead - and adapt accordingly\n+ For the amount of content that is offered, the price is spot on. While I got this from a bundle, I would gladly pay full price knowing that this title is very enjoyable\n+ Extra content is provided for free, no charge at all; shows that the developer's care for their creation more than the money going into their pockets. That type of dedication is hard to find, so another plus one to the developer's for love of their product\n\nNeutral± For the achievement hunters: the achievements are both easy yet difficult to obtain. On one hand they'll be pouring in, on the other, it takes skills and perseverance to get the rest\n± Can become repetitive over time, but there are new treasures to be uncovered, dialogue to be said, and areas of the map to be explored. This is enough to keep me coming back, but I can understand others may feel differently\n\nCons- There are not enough places to explore! Rest assured though, the developers are currently working on this\n- Credit to another gamer: a character voiceover option would be great for those who prefer that! I would very much enjoy listening to each character's individual voice myself\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nThere are few titles that really catch and hold my attention for this long. RE:IS has done just that, however, and I'm glad to have been blessed enough to come across this game. While I still actively play to this day, I dread the day the expansion comes out... I will be too busy becoming a Renowned Explorer once again to care for anything else!\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with the comical style. Maybe even a little dash of charm, or the dedication and attention to detail and style that makes RE:IS what it is. Whatever the case, this game has won my heart, and I hope it does yours too.\n\nOverall9.5/10","May 10","true","22.6"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","43","49","4","4"

The combat is clever, challenging and fun. The encounters are well-written and full of flavor. The art and character design are lovely.\n\nThe problem is that this an RPG about collecting artifacts... in which there are no long-term benefits to character development or artifact collection. The game inexplicably adopts the neo-Roguelike model that has been popular since FTL, where each `playthrough' is short, brutal, and random. After a few hours, you'll have found a handful of artifacts, leveled your characters around max level, and (most likely) died at the hands of a sudden difficulty spike or a series of bad rolls. Then you are back at the main menu, with nothing to show for your trouble except a slightly better understanding of the (fundamentally random) nature of the game.\n\nI could make some other criticisms as well. The amount of content seemed fairly small (there may be less than a dozen campaign maps), and randomness was a bigger factor than I'd like. These could both be issues for anyone interested in undertaking the challenge of getting `good' at this game.\n\nYou may enjoy this game! If the idea of a cute archeaological FTL appeals to you, go for it!  If you want a casual adventure with any sense of accomplishment, do not buy this game.","September 8, 2015","false","4.5"," 181 of 277 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","181","277","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mozzillest/recommended/296970/","mozzillest","Mozzillest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mozzillest/","189 products in account","One of my favorite new games of the year. I've always been interested in all the Indiana Jones, old mythos, and 19th century history, so this, naturally was an easy fit. But seriously, the game would be great without it. You get pretty attached to the characters you choose and in a lot of ways it feels like old world XCOM  - and yet completely refreshing.\n\nThere are two legit cons you hear more than anything else:\n\n1) The game is too difficult\n2) It should be longer\n\nPersonally I think the first one is a little dumb. Yes, there is RNG, but there is also, again, brutal RNG in XCOM, and it's no more crazy than that. I feel like the problem with the RNG is that too many people think that this game is like FTL, when it's really more like XCOM. The RNG isn't in the encounter, it's in the success. If your soldier misses a 85% shot on a mutalisk, he will probably, brutally die, I think the adventure wheel is in the same vein. Even more than the combat, which again, feels very XCOM. I read Abbey Games saying that they were implementing a difficulty feature, which will probably help.\n\nThe second complaint I wholeheartedly agree with. I would love this game with more goofy characters (or maybe an option to make and name your own character?), more areas to explore, longer quests, more treasure, more leveling up and all of that. I don't know how feasible it is, but maybe even open the game to modders in the future, because the template is all there, I would just love more.\n\nBut overall the answer is, yes! You should absolutely purchase this game. It's very fun, it's got a lot to offer, and from what I've read, it sounds like Abbey is planning on adding more to the game over time. If you're a little hesistant now, I understand - but at least put it on your wishlist.\n\n","September 6, 2015","true","13.7"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","41","49","0","0"

Easy as that.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society (REIS) is a game where you command a crew of 3 explorers on a quest to unravel as many treasures, gain as much renown and eventually rise to the top of the explorer society by beating you top rival... um... Rivaleux. Wowzers, very creative, I know :) So does the game deliver? Let's take a look at the good and the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. Amazing replayability. No 2 groups are the same, they always yield different results in battle, and can be played in a plethora of ways.\n2. Good AI. NOTE: I mean good, not great. On classic, it will exploit some of your misakes and forgive you others.\n3. Unique locations with great art: the artwork of this game is great, the devs did am awesome job with it.\n4. Unique Characters: your Captain and your crew members all have unique capabilities, and you are free to mix and match them to your heart's content, discovering the best combos and finding out what works best for you.\n5. An innovative take on combat: combat can be won with friendship, deviousness, aggression and... guile. Why guile? Because you can mix and match all of those 3 combat approaches to achieve a combat status that best fits your next move at any given time, and thus win a battle more easily.\n6. A game over that barely feels like a game over. Your crew doesn't really die... they just have "stuff" happen to them. Like spend the remainder of their lives repenting in an all-nun monastery. Well, if that was a 3 man crew... they have their work cut out for them.\n7. Easy to roleplay: I am not a good roleplayer AT ALL. Yet I found myself putting lines in my toon's mouths. Say, my girl does an ew and shows some soiled undies to another female and I was like: "Geez girl, when was the last time you changed your knickers?!" - reaction: "Saddened". In another case she shows a snail and points at a guy and I was like "Sheesh, mate, even she knows that you are slow to get it up". And then I LOLED. And then I was happy.  And then I went to bed with a smile of my face. 'Bout that...\n8. This game easily puts a smile on your face through dialogues, the encounters (charming wolves and sheep FTW), and the combat. Yeah, even when you're losing...\n9. Tons of unlockables: the devs really went balls to the wall with this one. You have 20 unique characters, with every one of them available as a captain after you've played them a few times, over 100 achievements, treasures, and 4 difficulty levels with or without savescumming.\n10. Ironman if you want: many rogue-likes (Lites?) have an imposed ironman setting. Here you don't. All that the non-ironman game does is to lock you out are the achievements, and that is a small gripe, especially when it comes to a game as hard as this one. 'Bout that #2...\n11. The game is hard. It's brutal. It's so damn difficult to win. I love it. Even getting 2nd or 3rd place is an achievement. Hell, even surviving the whole ordeal is :D\n12. 12 procedurally generated maps with tons of stuff to unlock on them.\n13. Your experiences matter and the game teaches you as you go. I really like that about a game - it makes my subsequent playthroughs meaningful, and much more fun.\n14. Tooltips give you an idea what to expect and even let you turn back and back out of a possible challenge, encounter or opportunity, which is a rare thing in rogue-like (lite?) games. You just need to read, you know...\n15. The game gives you recommendations with your starting crew (every toon has 2 "best fits" so to speak), which saves you some trial and error time.\n16. Once you get the hang of the entire system, just like in FTL, the game feels great to play.\n\nAnd now, the bad:\n\n1. Only a limited number of maps. 12 is ultimately too little if you want to play this game over and over.\n2. The game is HARD. It will take you a good amount of hours to find a decent crew composition and make it work. And then you need to get used to the bosses... and then you need to get used to the levels... and then you need to learn which toons does what ability... and then you need to pick the proper maps to do it... and finally, you need to make it work. Yeah... that's a lot of info.\n3. You can lose missions through no fault of your own. The map can screw you, the RNG can screw you, the enemies can screw you, etc. I had runs where I was consistently losing high % rolls... not a pretty sight.\n4. Very high learning curve. Learning how every character, every enemy, every mood combo, every attack and so on and so forth works is a daunting challenge.\n5. Overpriced. While the game is good, 20€ is too much. I personally bought it on HumbleBundle for the US equivalent of Euro and even had a % of it donated some to charity, so I feel good about myself. On steam, however, 20€ is a lot.\n\nThe conclusion:\n\nThis game gets an easy recommendation from me, especially to the gamers of the rogue-like (lite?) genre. The game allows you to do pretty much everything with it - explore safely, savescum, challenge yourself, find tresures, go achievement crazy and so on and so forth. It never makes you feel bad about losing too. Your guys don't perish - they just get to live a different life or flee. This makes it a great game for people who are generally sensitive or don't like to lose their in-game crew. All of this is a grat selling point to this game. Its setbacks comprise of a high learning curve, limited maps and TIME. Yes, you need time, and you really need to take the game in and let it teach you. Not everyone is ready to do that.\n\nAny price reduction of 33% or more makes the game an easy purchase. It needs love in my opinion, because it does so much right, and it is a breath of fresh air to the genre, by letting you do whatever you feel like it with it. I have a ton of fun with it, and I will keep on doing so. 8.7 hours in, just a tad less than my play time in FTL, and this game still isn't getting old, and that is saying something.","October 9, 2015","true","21.5"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","38","48","3","0"

With that team, you go on semi-randomized expeditions to explore. The rewards you get depends on your team's talents.\n\nCombat in this game is fantastic. At first glance, it deceives you into thinking it's another tactical hex grid turn based combat. As you learn more, you will realize the combat involves multiple layers of strategy. It rewards skills and forward thinking. If you plan your moves ahead, you can put yourself into great positions. However, one fatal mistake can immediately punish you.\n\nAfter each expedition, using the rewards you recieved from your adventures, you can upgrade your team's equipments, research to gain bonuses, or hire an entourage of people to increase rewards for the future.\n\nAll of these intricate mechanics are tied together wonderfully with a storytelling process that fits naturally. Your journey is presented with brilliant artworks, animations, along with clever writings to bring the world and characters to life.\n\nIf you are interested in adventures, rogue-lite RPGs, turn based tactics or management simulations, this game should be right in your radar for your next purchase.","September 2, 2015","true","11.2"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","0"

I'd also point out that there's no persistent bonuses or character growth so each playthrough starts as a clean slate, this will be ok for some but others will be disappointed you have nothing to show or gain from your past adventures.\n\nAll things considered Renowned Explorers is a very good game and an easy recommendation for lovers of the genre that don't mind taking the time to learn its mechanics and its reliance on repeated playthroughs.\n\n\n","November 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","0"

Check\nNice visual style? Check\nInteresting theme? Check\n\nSounds promising right? Unfortunately I feel like Renowned Explorers is a case of almost but not quite, all of the elements of a great roguelike are here but it falls short in a number of different areas that ultimately resulted in the game leaving a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nI think my biggest issue with the game is the severe lack of content available to play with at the moment, in one playthrough you can visit the vast majority of explorable areas in one playthrough. The areas themselves are basically the same each playthrough except for a few minor RNG differnces. Seeing as one playthrough lasts for at most just under three hours there really isn't a lot to keep you coming back for more.\nIf the game was in early access or in open beta this might be excusable but with only one new piece of DLC available since it's "full release" I could never reccomened this game at full price and would do so cautiously when it is on sale.\n\nMy second issue with the game is that I feel it's a little to RNG heavy. I like a little randomness in my games as the next person but this game turns it up to eleven... the vast majority of your overworld interactions are going to be decided on the roll of a dice, and even the combat has fixed %chance to hit for some abilities. It's incredibly frustating to be completing the final expedition only for a 5% dice role to take away two resolve (basically life in this game) and end your playthrough.\n\nRenowned explorers does have a few interesting and well executed ideas though, for one thing whenever you click on a decision on the map with a percentage chance instead of just resolving, it brings up a spinner wheel. The simple addition of this spinner wheel adds a lot of tension into what is usually quite a mundane part of rougelikes. Another thing I thought was relatively well executed was the emotion combat system, which basically gave stat buffs or debuffs depending on how you chose to handle the encounter wether it be peacefully, deviously or agressively. This had it's own problems however, as to min-max in this game you basically have to optimise your encounters to one particular mood to get consistent benefits.\n\nI enjoyed my first couple of playthroughs of this game, but after I started to understand the game more and progress I became increasingly frustrated with the amount of luck compared to skill especially for someone not amasingly skilled at roguelikes. Overall I guess that's my overall opinion of this game, if you like the theme of this game and are really good at roguelikes and don't mind heavy RNG elements, great. For everyone else, go back to FTL or Dungeons of Dreadmore.","December 16, 2015","false","16.5"," 54 of 87 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","54","87","2","5"

Highly attractive and charming presentation, smart design, deep game systems, challenging encounters that reward mastery of these systems, put together with roguelike characteristics like map randomization and an Ironman save structure, and you've got a winner on your hands.\n\nEdit: I would like to briefly add that recent updates have smoothed out the previously mentioned difficulty spikes in a very satisfactory way. The game is now a true gem I would not hesitate to warmly recommend to anyone interested in turn-based tactical games or adventure roguelikes. Pick this one up!\n\nThere are currently some issues with game balance in the boss encounters, but the developers have communicated they're aware of them, and plan to support and expand the game in the future.

It has this nasty tablet game vibe and feels like it's catering to stupid kids, not even smart kids but plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children. Oh boy, can looks be deceiving! This game is so incredibly mature and deep while still being highly accessible.\n--------------\nGameplay:\nRE is a rare genre-mix and feels like an Indiana Jones movie. You select a team with 1 leader and 2 sidekicks out of 20 unique characters from four categories (scientist, scout, fighter, speaker).\nThis gives you the total number of possible combinations: (20!) / ((20-17)! * 3!) = 1140 party combinations!\n\nThen you pick between normal mode and the much better "iron man" mode. It's how every game of this kind should be played, no reloading. Once you're dead, you're dead. One playthrough only lasts a few hours anyways. In iron man mode it's much more tense and fun! Then you pick one out of 4 difficulty modes. Hint: always play iron man, just pick a lower difficulty setting if you want!\n\nOnce you have assembled your party, you will have 5 expeditions for your claim to fame. Every expedition takes you to a beautiful place around the globe. This is where the board game aspect kicks in. You move across the map from node to node with limited supplies (each node costs 1 supply). Each node offers different benefits. Sometimes you will get encounters. An encounter plays out on a hex based battle field. This is where the game becomes really complex.\n\nEncounters can be resolved in three ways: peaceful, devious, aggressive.\nThere is a rock-paper-scissor element to it, but it goes much deeper. Based on your team's skills and the opponent, there are many possible ways to solve an encounter. You can pistol-whip everything, you can charm your opponent or you can backstab them. Really cool stuff and really clever.\nEach expedition ends with a boss fight. Once that is mastered you return to the world map where the resource management unfolds. You can invest in research, items, entourage... again numerous choices, again very complex.\n\nAt the end of 5 expeditions (if you're still alive by then!) you get your final score. The devs are planning an online highscore list. The current limitation to 5 expeditions has been critiziced by some people, but let me say two things about that:\n1. the devs already announced longer game modes for future patches\n2. the idea behind the game is that each playthrough lasts only a few hours and the emphasis is on replay value with different teams (remember: 1140 different combinations!). After all you're unlocking new captains by playing the game. This is exactly what made FTL (Faster Than Light) such a modern classic. Quick playthroughs and a lot of incentive to start over.\n-------------\n\nTechnical aspect:\nGraphics are very good, but annoyingly childish (fake Disney-look). I don't like the over-the-top comical style, but objectively they are executed flawlessly.\nSound is okay, but nothing special. I turned off the music quickly, but I do that in every game.\nThe real beauty is the programming. So many Indie games suffer from poor to mediocre programming and you can tell immediately. Be it CTDs, clumsy interfaces and plain poor controls... RE truly shines here. This game is a smooth as any 200 million dollar production can be. Wonderful design and implementation. It's just a pleasure to play.\n__________________\n\nSummary:\nVery complex, yet easily accessible game. The looks are deceiving. It's a true PC game that looks like tablet garbage.\nHighly recommended for everyone... I can't think of a single person who wouldn't enjoy this one.\nMy biggest gripe (the cartoonish look) isn't even a real con. If you hate that like me, first thing you should do: turn off the action camera.\n\nRating: 9.5/10\n\n\n---------------------------------------\nUpdate: 23.09.2015\n11 hours and 5 campaigns (iron man, normal difficulty) thus far. I won 3 and lost 2 campaigns.\nStill extremely high fun factor. The replay value is enormous thanks to the sheer endless possible combinations of characters. I lost my first campaign with an all-out scientist crew. That emphasizes how important a versatile crew is.\n\nOne issue is beginning to bother me now. The number of expeditions is too low. It should take more than 11 hours to have seen everything. The devs announced 1 more free expedition and more to come via DLC. Depending on the price that can be good or bad.\nI would recommend to deliver 1-2 more free expeditions before moving on to DLC. The lack of content has been a major negative point in many reviews I've read and I have to agree with that.\nFor a $20+ game you should expect a bit more content.\nThis leads to a slight devaluation of my rating.\n\nRating: 9.0/10\n\n---------------------------------\nUpdate: 15.10.2015\nA brand new free DLC-expedition set in Mali will be released next week. This kind of post-launch support is highly commendable!\n\nRating: 9.5/10\n\n--------------------------------------------\nUpdate: 12.11.2015\nPicked up the game after a long time.\nThe devs have been extraordinarily active constantly improving the game. You can tell how much they love their product. Some characters used to be weak, they found perfect solutions for that. Every minor gripe I had is solved by now. Hell, I even love the graphics now. The tablet look put my old 1980s gamer genes off for quite a while, but I got used to it and finally see beauty in those loveable characters.\n\nThis game is absolutely fabulous now. I doubled my total playing time in this week alone. I'm hopelessly addicted now. For the first time ever I will rate a game with the highest possible score.\n\nRating: 10/10","September 21, 2015","true","112.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

Everytime you start you can choose different locations and even if you go to the same place, there is still much to be discovered. I think it was designed on purpose in a very elegant way, to keep players engaged and interested.\n\nBefore I bought the game I've heard it's way too hard. Because I like challenges I was glad.

Adventure! If you are fan of Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider, then Renowned Explorers is a game you're going to love. You will form a crew of dashing and clever adventurers and set out on a journey to become internationally famous. All that stands in your way is pirates, mummies, forgotten horrors, and other explorers. The game itself is broken up into three phases, planning, adventure, and occasional combat. Planning is where you gather your resources and research. Adventure is where you will face all sorts of random challenges and possible dangers. Combat itself is a battle of wits, brawn or hugs. Yes, I said hugs. You can be so friendly that they die. Renowned Explorers does quite a bit of genre blending, incorporation turned based strategy with RPG/adventure elements. The entire game has a wonderful style and theme. Making you feel like your adventuring throughout the world. This is what drew me in and I wanted more of. One thing that is important to note though is that the game is based on replay. You only have 5 adventures before you either win or lose, and start over again with a new crew of adventurers. So don't go getting too attached to your precious loot.

Started out loving it; it's charming, quirky and deeply engaging. Then I got wiped out several times by seemingly impossibly encounters, and became disheartened. Yes, boss fights can be horrible, and the RNG can be your worst enemy. But I stuck with it, and gradually learned how to be better at it. I've had a lot of fun trying different combinations of crew members and figuring out when to take risks, when to play safe, how to prepare the crew in between adventures and plan ahead, and how to be more effective in encounters.\n\nThere was a time that I found level 3 expeditions impossible, but I improved. There was a time I thought Shangri-la - the level 5 expedition - was literally impossible. It didn't matter; you can play the game to its conclusion and even 'win' without going there. But I finally beat it for the first time tonight - with a little luck along the way to be sure, but also because after 40+ hours of play I eventually had a fair idea of what I was doing. That moment when I beat the final boss after systematically defeating each of his annoying lieutenants was one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I've had for a very long time.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, there are a few minor bugs (mainly missing or incorrect text in a few places), some things that could be better explained, and I'd like some of the randomness to be toned down a little. Though, not too much, as it helps make each playthrough unique and not too predictable. But for the most part I love this game. It's a great idea, immersive and fun, and rewards putting in the effort to really learn how it works.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crateboxer/recommended/296970/","crateboxer","CrateBoxer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crateboxer/","1141 products in account","This game is actually incredible. Reus, the previous game from the same developers, was one of my favourites despite finding god games in general to be hit and miss. I loved the intricate systems of Reus, with a ton of different resources, strategy, depth and complexity, because it was handled in an intuitive way through tooltips and fun tutorials that never dragged the game to a screeching halt. Unlike some strategy games where you have no idea what resources go where to build whatever while advisors badger you incessantly, Reus gave you the notes and tips you needed to understand every system, but never shoved it into your face. Really, it was the pinnacle god game for me.\n\nRE:IS is like Reus, but instead of being a perfect game in a so-so genre for me, it's a perfect game that's also a mashup of my favourite mechanics, genres and themes. It's like this game was tailor made for me.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society is sort of a roguelike, but there's a lot more to it. It has the overland mechanics of a good old fashioned D&D hexcrawl, the battle systems and trinities of a Fire Emblem, random written events and challenges a la Eighty Days or Tales of the Arabian Nights (the best board game ever), Civ-like research trees, time management, RPG loot. Throw in a steampunky Indiana Jones aesthetic, and I'm so very very sold. It's so good.\n\nBetter yet, like Reus there are a ton of different systems. A elemental trinity of physical, diplomatic and taunting attacks. Status effects based on how cranky or cocky you are. Twenty unique characters to pull from. Tons and tons of traits and subtraits. A dozen tokens and currencies, each with a different purpose.\n\nBut also like Reus, the intricate web of synergy is completely demystified by the tooltops and the UI. Forget what a Discovery token does? Highlight over it, and it will break down the numbers based on your current stats and upgrades. Need a referesher on status effects in battle? Hover over the icon and get informed. Forget what to do between expeditions? The concise in game manual is only a click away. Combined with tutorials that a) don't treat you like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and b) are done within five minutes, RE:IS strikes the perfect balance between providing information and beating you over the head with it.\n\nOne great example is the way unlocks are done. In Sunless Sea, which is a fairly similar texty roguelike mashup I quite enjoy, you get thrown in the deep end with a ton of traits and unlocks and places to go and stats to pick from before you have any idea what they do. RE:IS purposely keeps your pool of captains small; every other character is unlocked, but only as a secondary assistant. They explain abilities, they suggest synergies, they outline strategies your captain excel at. But as you play, you get a better grasp on the rules, and your most used secondary characters are soon unlocked as new captains complete with their own traits and strategies.\n\nAnd despite all the tooltips and synergy help, it's still a challenge. I've yet to win on the classic difficulty, but it's never felt unfair when I've died. There are setbacks from dice rolls, sure, but I'm always in control and they always give me the odds, so it's up to me to build a better team and make better investments next time. And a complete game is five expeditions, which only takes two or three hours, so it's closer to a short game of Civ than, say, a long haul XCOM campaign.\n\nOne last point: when rolling percentile chances, your characters spin a giant Price is Right wheel. I don't know why I find this so deeply satisfying, but it blows the hell out of simulated dice rolls.","April 2","true","4.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

You assemble a trio of explorers from a range of options (scientists, scouts, fighters or diplomats) who all have different personalities (aggressive, deceptive or peaceful), animations, and a ton of different skills and talents. You then travel the globe going on adventures, encountering treasures and bizarre situations at every turn. You're constantly pushing your luck in the hope that your specialisations will lead to better results - leading to a really engaging risk/reward system, tense dilemmas, and hilarious deaths. Between explorations you can spend your gold, research, influence and renown on an in-depth party-wide upgrade system.\n\nOn top of all this, Renowned Explorers features a fully-fledged turn-based tactical 'combat' system...which doesn't always involve actual combat. Sure, sometimes you might be shooting nuns in the hopes of stealing their treasure, but more often than not, you're humiliating Scottish farmers or placating angry sheep. It's weird, it's wonderful, and it's very very stylish.\n\nWith a ton of achievements and unlockables, many random scenarios to explore, and a challenging leaderboard to top, I could see this one giving a *lot* of fun playtime.

Never has this been more true than for Renowned Explorers. Assemble a team, weigh up their pros and cons, and start making meaningful, important choices.\n\nI feel like some may bounce off Renowned Explorers due to its unusual and unique ''combat'' system. It's really more of an ''encounter'' system, where you're looking at the emotional mood of the encounter and weighing up how to approach it advantageously.  These african villagers are being friendly? Let's be aggressive and exploit their weaknesses! These Caribbean pirates have us at gunpoint? A devious approach will disarm them! You get the idea.\n\nWith a choice of 16 playable characters, I'm still discovering new combinations to exploit, new configurations of teams that work well in certain situations. Each character has their own unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses. It's up to you to decide which combination fits your play style.\n\nThis play style extends to the ''overworld'' where your expedition stakes a path across whatever far-flung wilderness you've found yourself in. Supplies are limited, so the choice lies with you as to how to proceed. The game is generous with information, and makes clear the risks you might be getting yourself into. A 98% chance is still a chance. And sometimes everything will go south on you. Wonderfully though, it never feels unfair.

Ever wanted to scurry ruins for ancient treasures?\nThen stop right there, I have to show you a piece that belongs in a Museum\n\nRenowed Explorers is a Roguelike-ish mix of Strategy RPG, Choose your own Adventure Book and planning sim from the Makers of Reus, a definitely wonderful god-Sim. But thats a different review for a different Day.\n\nYou pick a team of three archeologists from a roster of 24 people in 4 classes (Fighter, Scientist, Scout and Talker (Diplomat)) with yiur captian being limited to only a few people, but you unlock more as you play Expeditions with them.\n\nThe story is simple - Make it Big! Be the most renown Explorer in the Renown Explorers Guild, but you only have 5 months (say: expeditions) to do so!\n\nthe gameplay is pretty simple - When you start an expedition you are dropped on a fixed map of knots, like in for example FTL. Travelling between nodes takes provisions of which you start with a limit, which you cant surpass with restocks. As you traverse the map towards your goal you will see that some Nodes have Markers "There is Knowledge/Fame/Gold to be found here!","There might be an encounter here!", "There might be a XXX Challenge here. A YYY would be helpful". those nodes hold short events that will on success gain you some tokens or more information or on fail may cost you provisions, give your team debuffs or end up costing you Resolve (say: Lives). When you reach your destination, you will enter a bigger chain of events to ultimately resolve what you came for and finish the mission.\nUpon finishing any tokens you gained through events and battles will be converted into your 4 base resources: Fame, Knowledge, Money, Renown and a mission specific shop will open.\nOn the world map you can spend your resources as you wish - Knowledge to write thesises (say: give your team various buffs), Money to buy more and better equipment and Fame to either get better Items in Stores or to hire an enourage, that will boost the amount of resources you gain from tokens.\n\nRenown is your actal score, and you have to pass the renown of the Lists 1st to "win" the game.\n\nAs it was in Reus - the Graphics are beautiful, the characters and their animations are just gorgeous\nMusic and sound is nice to listen too and get you an an adventuring mood\nGameplaywise this game throws a few balls out there and manages to juggle them well. the combat system actually goes pretty deep with its Mood System - every character has Speech (say Magic) abilities that give certain buffs or debuffs (for example a flattered character will take more damage from Speech attacks while a confident character wil deal more physical damage) and based on the overall mood of your approach and the enemies approach (forceful, Devious or Friendly - yes, you can complement your enemies to "death") your team will get a global buff/debuff based on a rock-Paper-Scissors system. A Forceful approach against a peaceful enemy will leave you at an advantage while a devious enemy will have you gasping for air quickly\n\nI have a little beef with this game, since it is mostly luck based. the Skill checks require your explorers to have certain perks to better their odds, but most of the time you will be staring into 30 to 40% chances top if your perks dont match up well.\nThere also seem to be a few bugs still around, like a memory leak on long sessions or that a certainBosses healthbar was imprinted on every space he stopped.\nAlso if you dont immeadiately invest a few points into the first skill tree (thesises) you will find yourself short on supplies quickly. And if they run out you will get arandom until-the-end-of-the-exploration debuff that will stack and might cost your head.\nwith that the shortage of Resources might end up leaving you dry during the end if you splurge too much in the beginning.\n\nThe replayability is very high due to the many different possible combinations of teams.\n\nA Definite Must play for fans of Reus or the old Adventuring days in general","September 5, 2015","true","15.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The game really shines as a complex system of resources and synergies; it's a lot of fun to try out different ways of generating the ultimate ressource in the game - renown. Another element standing out is the combat mood system. Based on your actions and your opponents' actions, the encounters have a different mood, which gives your units certain buffs and debuffs. This really encourages you to use all abilities of your explorers, rather than just using the 'strongest' or 'juicest' (which you can also do and is a challenge of its own). I think in this sense, RE:IS is a great developmental step from REUS, the studio's previous game. REUS had bautiful synergistic mechanics, but the game played more like a simulation. In RE:IS, the devs managed to forge the synergies into a great interdependent game system that is very enjoyable and rewarding - especially if you're into building systems/resource engines.\n\nIn general, I think that the game is also a bit too short (many others have mentioned that as well). You're done after a handful of explorations; to compare it with a card game: it feels a bit like playing Race for the Galaxy -- you're taking some turns building a great resource engine, but there's not much time to actually see it run. This being said: The replay value is great, but I think some additional campaigns, or some sort of ongoing exploration with limited lives ("resolve") could be a great addition. (The good news is that the devs are still working on some additional content and modes.)\n\nAs much as I do like the mechanics and the complex resource system, I do think that the representations of different cultures and individuals are reinforcing problematic stereotypes. I do believe that 'exploration' type games do have a tendency to reinforce hegemonic world-views; in the case of RE:IS, I believe that the  "explorer" setting is indeed strongly reinforcing a eurocentric idea of exploration, and in fact, of cultural exploitation (and more than that: it refers to a style of colonialist exploration that actually did happen, and it romanticizes it).\n\nMany encounters involve helpless or fumbling natives that need the help of the explorers. In my opinion this does have an undertone of cultural inequality, and contains an imlicit message that suggests a cultural inferiority in the cultures we explore in the game. It is also important to note that  all of the places we explore are depicted as technologically, and culturally less advanced.\n\nOn one side, the game gives me the choice to resolve encounters agressively or via persuasion. But even if I use persuasion, or 'friendly' tactics, I am still taking something away from the culture (e.g. artifacts). In fact, there is no way to progress in the game without taking artifacts away from their originating culture.  For example, I talk myself into a monastery and convince the nuns to give me one of their relics. Cultural exchange is great - but in RE:IS, a classic colonialist (one-sided, and hegemonic) way of exploration is a constitutional part of the game setting, and game play.\n\n\nIn conclusion: The irony in RE:IS is that the game mechanics are so bautifully synergistic - but the setting is colonialist. Overall I think that this is a game worth playing, set in a game setting worth problematizing and talking about.\n\n\n","October 27, 2015","true","59.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","1"

It boils down to two things.\n\n1 - Many roguelike experiences are built around the question, "Will you live to cross the finish line?" It can get really depressing to die and fail over and over again. RE:IS (on its standard difficulties anyway) asks, "How cool will your adventuring career be?" I rarely straight up lose a run, but it isn't about winning or losing. It's about the first time you finish with 2500 Renown. Then 3000. Then 3500. You'll get a little better at squeezing more efficiency out of your runs each time you play, and you won't need an unbreakable spirit to want to keep trying.\n\n2 - Another factor hampering many roguelike experiences is that there's only one paradigm for interaction. The whole game is dungeon crawling. No single gameplay system can entertain you forever. RE:IS has three different types of play: Roleplaying as you travel from node to node and decide how to handle incidents, Combat on a turn based grid with a handful of subsystems that don't overwhelm, and Resource Management as you spend your hard earned gains on things that synergize with your strengths and shore up your weaknesses. You'll constantly rotate between these 3 activities, so none of them ever overstay their welcome.\n\nRE:IS is amazing.

I would really enjoy seeing this system adapted into different games as it is quite tactical, forcing you to choose your actions carefully and make compromises.\n\nThe encounters require you selecting different options which might have a different impact on your current adventure, or pretty much rolling the dice using your best characters in order to pass your current obstacle.\n\nThe hub world is mostly a place where you upgrade your items, stats and resource gain, not much is really to be said about it.

I also like the challenge and the overall cheerful tone, even though I can see why people may complain about RNG or the game not being serious.\nThe only real complaint I have is the lack of variety when it comes locations to explore (10 overall I think, you pick 5 each campaign). They are randomized, and you encounter different things each time, but after several playthroughs they feel samey, which hurts the overall feel of exploration and venturing into unknown. (That said the devs acknowledged this issue and more content is on the way).\n\nRE:IS is rather unique, but if you need to compare it to something, think Darkest Dungeon, but with totally opposite tone and gameplay split into short campaigns. Both are difficult games about weighing risk and reward, with unique art style, both I feel deliver what they try to achieve.\n\nAll in all, good game, worthy of your attention.","September 10, 2015","true","11.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I am happy I did, since I got a full weekend of hardcore exploring out of it. ^^\n\nAt first it was all fun and exciting, because of the  cute representation .\nThe graphics in comic look are just lovely, having very authentic animations for your characters and the enemies alike. You got a very diverse set of explorers to choose from, and often their personality also matters. Even the headshot pictures react to the moods characters get during the battles, and many of them were very amusing.\n\nMoods in battle? Yes, you read it well. The game has an authentic mix of simplicity and complexity, taking a basic stone-paper-scissors gameplay, and adding a lot of complexity to it by introducing battlefield moods. If you are peaceful, you will get a large bonus against devious opponents, while aggressive opponents will give you trouble. Those opponents however will have problems, if your party decides to react devious!\nDuring the battles, you will be able to change the battlefield mood of your party with your actions, but be aware, some  enemies will do the same!\n\nThe difficulty in Renowned Explorers is one of the most polarizing things in the discussion boards these days.\nI consider myself very happy with the difficulty settings, as they gave a real feeling of excitedness to the overall game. You always have to consider carefully if you want to move on, even though you ran out of food and your expedition is starving. It might give you more ressources, but adds very negative conditions to your party members, which might do a big impact on the challenging bosses.\nThe bosses are challenging. You will have to understand the game mechanics and change the battlefield moods carefully, if you want to stand a chance. Sometimes you will want to avoid a mood alltogether, or will have to plan ahead to change the mood fast, if it happens to go bad. Also you will have to use the positive friendly buffs, and the negative (mostly) devious debuffs well. If you want to go with aggressive physical combat, you might want to enrage your enemies to take additional damage, and your party might want to become excited for an increase in attack power. If your enemies dish out too much physical damage, you will also find a mood to weaken them.\nChecking the discussion boards, it seems like the creators are working on an easy mode for those which do not enjoy these well made and challenging boss battles. But until then, you may expect some real try and error puzzle solving on how to get through all the expeditions. Moreso if you play the (Ironman) Adventuring mode.\n\nThe last expedition is hardly beatable, if you didn't master the game and take some really well equipped explorer party with good Synergy with you. But thats absolutely allright, since you are never forced to beat those missions, to win the game! Just consider it an added challenge!\nWhenever you finish a Journey, you will get two new journeys to choose from, which have added difficulty. So after beating the initial Rank 1 journey, you will get 2 more Rank 2 journeys to choose from, and so on.\nFor your first games, you might want to skip on the Rank 4 and 5 journeys though, and might want to go 1-2-2-3-3. It is possible to get a high enough score for the score victory with it. But if you tackle the rank 4 journeys, you might want to expect a tough challenge, with the rank 5 journey checking your mastery of the game.\n\nIf you aren't battling, you are exploring semi-random journey maps, while trying to conserve your food, to get as many of the 3 ressources science, fame and wealth as possible. You might also find some treasure for additional game effects and to increase your Renown, basicaly your score. To win the game, you will want to gather a Renown of at least 2000, but the real challenge is to get the biggest Highscore and find the best hidden Treasures.\nYou also got the two secondary Ressources Insight and Resolve, where Insight is tradeable for more basic ressources in various ways during the game and Resolve basicaly resembles your life count.\nWhile collecting these ressources, you deal with well written and often funny  story situations , in which you decide to alter the outcome or if you want to take a risk, using the "adventure wheel". Basicaly it's a represantation of the dice rolls for your percentualy based chances on event outcomes. How much percent you got to get a certain result is based on which Adventurers you picked, and which perks you make avaiable for them.\nSo, will your risk one Resolve, to take a chance for some additional ressources at 63%?\nThe game is full of such decisions, and sometimes mean situations you might want to be prepared for or avoid, as you grow to know the game. But it's what creates a lot of the charm and replayability!\n\nThe game rewards getting to know it better, it rewards dealing with difficult situations, it rewards careful decisions ... it rewards Exploring!\nNot by throwing increasing amounts of goodies at you, but by making the experience authentic.","September 8, 2015","true","165.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It’s a strategy game with turn-based combat and resource management, great replayability and an active developer to boot, who’s working on a big update at the moment (January 2016).\n\nThe gameYou assemble a team of three explorers that you send on five expeditions in the quest of becoming the most renowned explorers. To become “renown” you need to find treasures but also resources that enable you to attract an entourage, conduct research, and buy equipment in between the expeditions. And of course, you also need to survive the encounters.\nYou can play in two modes; one lets you make saves, the other ends with your death. The latter is the way it is meant to be played and, in my opinion, the only way to play it. If you want to ruin the game for you, use save-scumming.\n\nYour team: The first step is to assemble your team. You can choose between 20 diverse characters with very unique skills and perks that belong to one of four classes (scientist, scout, fighter, speaker). The combination of classes, skills and perks that you have in your team can greatly influence your success in the game. There isn’t one character that is just better than the rest, one character can do great in one team and be a bit useless in the next, and depending on the strategy you want to follow during the main part of the game, you might need a different combination of classes anyway. Trying out new teams is a big part of what makes this game so much fun and adds a lot of replayability.\n\nThe expeditions: You can choose between a few destinations that all have their unique styles, events, treasures to find, and requirements. The destinations are procedurally generated, you move FTL-style from node to node, using supplies as “fuel”, and are confronted with different events or encounters. There is a big variety of events that are also influenced by which classes and perks you have in your team and the choices you’ve made, so it doesn’t get boring fast. I’ve played over 75 hours by now and I still get events I haven’t seen before and I’ve only found half of the unique treasures in the game, so there is a lot to keep you interested.\nSome events require luck, where you have a certain percentage to succeed based on the skills and perks of your characters. There’s also luck involved in the events that you get, some of the rare ones can be great if you find them, although they usually also involve a severe penalty if you fail.\n\nThe encounters: Turn-based combat that reminded me of X-Com. There’s a lot of depth to the combat system, much more than immediately obvious. Your characters and your enemies have three main classes of attacks, friendly, devious and aggressive. The type of attack you and your enemies use influence the overall mood during the fight, e.g. if you are both devious, the mood is tense, if they are friendly and you are aggressive, the mood is brutal.\nSome of these moods can be beneficial to you, e.g. give you more defence, while others can be negative. So, manipulating the mood by the attack-types you choose is very important.\nEqually important is mood management of your characters. A friendly attack can leave your character in an impressed mood, which lowers your defence against speech attacks. So you might need to use a friendly attack on your own team member to heal them and change their mood to confident, which adds 25% to their aggressive attack. Obviously, you can use the same principle against your enemies, by using attacks that put them in moods which provide debuffs.\nAnd finally, sometimes you want to end the fight in a specific mood because you’ll get a bonus if you do.\nAll of these effects are explained in excellent tooltips that you can access during the encounter, there are no hidden effects, very little luck is involved and a lot of strategy. Great!\nYou might “win” the game by just doing your thing and ignoring all these details but on higher difficulty and during the more difficult expeditions you will have a very hard time if you don’t use the moods to your advantage.\n\nIn-between expeditions: During an expedition you earn collect, campaign, and science tokens that you can exchange for gold, status and research points after the expedition and use to upgrade your equipment, conduct research and hire an entourage. Equipment can give you more perks and/or add defence or offence stats. Research lets you get more of the resource that you want to focus on, can give you more supplies, can give you extra bonuses if you end fights in a specific mood, etc. Status lets you hire an entourage which will let you get more out of your tokens and can also provide you with more perks.\nThe success of your overall strategy (which destinations do you want to visit, do you want to focus on a specific resource, ...) will be very much influenced by the choices you make here.\n\nConclusion: Fun game that requires a lot of strategy and a bit of luck (although it is very rare that you’re getting completely screwed over by RNG), with more depth to it than you’d think. You can easily finish one game in one evening, although if you’re like me you’ll likely want to start a new one immediately.\nThe only drawback is that there could be more destinations, but as the developers are already working on a big update, I'm hopeful that this will be fixed soon. And as I still haven't seen everything there is to see after 75 hours of gameplay, I can't really complain too much, anyway.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game.","January 9","true","129.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

To be honest, I like this part the least, but its fine and pretty complex as well. In fact, on the first few runs, it might appear overwhelming.\n\nThen, there are expeditions themselves, full of random encounters and adventures and witty dialogues. They're amazing, and so far I can't say that I have become bored even from visiting the same areas. The layout of the expedition changes each time you play, and the special locations present there vary from one run to another, and of course, the outcome of events is often different for different teams and runs.\n\nThe third layer is tactical battles. Well, you don't get too much of them to become tired, there is always a final encounter at the end of the expedition, and typically two to four aside of it, depending on whether you are looking for fight. At first, the battle mechanics might appear complex and TERRIFYING, but as you grasp the basics (it takes a few encounters) and become more CONFIDENT, it becomes quite EXCITING. I guess any tactical battle system that operates with terms like 'attitude', 'mood' and 'emotions' is definitely worth giving it a try. Oh, and I like the form of field grid too.\n\nSome people might say that the battle mechanics is not really a big deal and devious and friendly abilities can be replaced with say ice and nature magic, the notion that I don't exactly agree with. Even if technically that might be true, the path you choose to resolve encounters is reflected back onto the adventure level, and affects how your quest continues, which I find pretty cool.\n\nAs for drawbacks, the only thing I might think about is the number of available expeditions and well, their tight concentration in just few geographical areas. The game is great, but if it just had even more content it would be even greater.","January 13","true","103.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The destinations are procedurally generated, you move FTL-style from node to node, using supplies as “fuel”, and are confronted with different events or encounters. There is a big variety of events that are also influenced by which classes and perks you have in your team and the choices you’ve made, so it doesn’t get boring fast. I’ve played over 75 hours by now and I still get events I haven’t seen before and I’ve only found half of the unique treasures in the game, so there is a lot to keep you interested.\nSome events require luck, where you have a certain percentage to succeed based on the skills and perks of your characters. There’s also luck involved in the events that you get, some of the rare ones can be great if you find them, although they usually also involve a severe penalty if you fail.\n\nThe encounters: Turn-based combat that reminded me of X-Com. There’s a lot of depth to the combat system, much more than immediately obvious. Your characters and your enemies have three main classes of attacks, friendly, devious and aggressive. The type of attack you and your enemies use influence the overall mood during the fight, e.g. if you are both devious, the mood is tense, if they are friendly and you are aggressive, the mood is brutal.\nSome of these moods can be beneficial to you, e.g. give you more defence, while others can be negative. So, manipulating the mood by the attack-types you choose is very important.\nEqually important is mood management of your characters. A friendly attack can leave your character in an impressed mood, which lowers your defence against speech attacks. So you might need to use a friendly attack on your own team member to heal them and change their mood to confident, which adds 25% to their aggressive attack. Obviously, you can use the same principle against your enemies, by using attacks that put them in moods which provide debuffs.\nAnd finally, sometimes you want to end the fight in a specific mood because you’ll get a bonus if you do.\nAll of these effects are explained in excellent tooltips that you can access during the encounter, there are no hidden effects, very little luck is involved and a lot of strategy. Great!\nYou might “win” the game by just doing your thing and ignoring all these details but on higher difficulty and during the more difficult expeditions you will have a very hard time if you don’t use the moods to your advantage.\n\nIn-between expeditions: During an expedition you earn collect, campaign, and science tokens that you can exchange for gold, status and research points after the expedition and use to upgrade your equipment, conduct research and hire an entourage. Equipment can give you more perks and/or add defence or offence stats. Research lets you get more of the resource that you want to focus on, can give you more supplies, can give you extra bonuses if you end fights in a specific mood, etc. Status lets you hire an entourage which will let you get more out of your tokens and can also provide you with more perks.\nThe success of your overall strategy (which destinations do you want to visit, do you want to focus on a specific resource, ...) will be very much influenced by the choices you make here.\n\nConclusion: Fun game that requires a lot of strategy and a bit of luck (although it is very rare that you’re getting completely screwed over by RNG), with more depth to it than you’d think. You can easily finish one game in one evening, although if you’re like me you’ll likely want to start a new one immediately.\nThe only drawback is that there could be more destinations, but as the developers are already working on a big update, I'm hopeful that this will be fixed soon. And as I still haven't seen everything there is to see after 75 hours of gameplay, I can't really complain too much, anyway.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game.","January 9","true","129.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The premise of the game is that you belong to a group of scientists and explorers, and each game sees you setting out with a group of three explorers of your choice to travel the globe, visiting exotic locales and collecting treasures.  You've been sleighted by another member of the society, and over the course of 5 expeditions you have to collect more Renown than him in order to win.  During expeditions, you manage your resources as you travel from node to node, dealing with events and occasionally finding yourself battling strange locals and/or wildlife.\n\nEach game begins with you assembling your party, selecting 3 explorers from 20 available and electing one to be your Captain (Which provides a unique perk for the game).  Characters are broken up into 4 classes, and each character come with a unique mix of actions, skills, and upgrades.  The crew select screen is where the feel of each run will be decided, and there's a wide variety of party types available.  You want to befriend enemies to death while accumulating prodigious amounts of reasearch?  There's a crew for that.  Do you desire to do nothing more than smack your enemies until gold pops out?  There's a crew for that, too.\n\nFrom there, you're taken to the expedition.  On the expedition map, you travel from node to node to collect as many resources as possible, keeping an eye out for potential treasure.  The majority of nodes with resources available usually feature a challenge that you can choose to have an explorer attempt.  Challenges have percent chance to succeed/fail, often modified by the traits and class of the explorer chosen.  As you would expect, challenges offer greater rewards if successful, though often carry some sort of penalty if you fail (Anything from a minor stat loss for the rest of the expedition to losing resource tokens). You obviously want to maximize your resources gained by hitting many nodes, but your ability to do so is limited by supplies, so it's important to exercise judgment and figure out the optimal way to travel through an expedition (if you do run out, you being to incur rather large stat penalties).  Not all nodes have challenges, however. Some are empty, and some feature encounters.\n\nEncounters are where the meat of the game lies, and probably the most time consuming part of any run.  The overlying battle system is turn based, with each encounter utilizing a procedurally generated hex-based map.  You move your three units, and then the enemy moves theirs, etc. etc.   You obviously want to be as efficient as possible when dispatching the opponents (Who often outnumber you), and the best way to do this is through EMOTIONS!\n\nThis is the hook: the mood system.  You and your opponent each have a certain attitude in an encounter, which generates a mood that can be advantageous (or not) for you.  The three attitudes are Aggressive, Friendly, and Devious, and they exist in a rock-paper-scissors relationship.  For example, Aggressive beats Friendly but is weak to Devious.  So, if you are against a Friendly opponent, it is in your best to interest to generate and maintain an Aggressive attitude since it provides bonus Speech Defense.  However, if you generate a Devious attitude in contrast to their Friendly one, you'll take a Speech Defense penalty (which is bad).  You can generate a better attitude by utilizing attacks of that attitude, contributing points until it rolls over.  So in the case of a Friendly enemy, you want to use Friendly or Aggressive attacks until you switch to that attitude, generating a less disadvantageous attitude.\n\nFriendly/Devious attacks also have an emotion component to them, which can provide buffs or debuffs to a target enemy depending on their "state of mind", which is essentially a meter that goes up with Friendly attacks and down with Devious attacks.  There's a lot to manage and it's a ton of fun, and there's a surprising depth that doesn't come through in screenshots.\n\nI'm skipping over a lot in the interest of brevity, though I hope I've communicated the core mechanics.  I haven't even touched on the preparation stage, or how resources work, or skills.  This is very board game-like in the sense that the rules and mechanics are simple, but the way everything interacts creates a good amount of depth that never feels clunky or counter-intuitive.  While the game rewards good decision making and tactical acumen, the most important thing is developing mastery over the game.  You never fail because the game was unfair to you, or because you got unlucky.  Every failure will be your fault, even if you don't know it at that time, and the best way to improve is to learn something from your failures and carry it with you into the future.\n\nWhile the core mechanics are sound and fun, the package it comes in is incredibly charming.  The art is great and fits the overall feel of the game, the writing is funny through and through, and the music is enjoyable.  It look like a fun, light-hearted game about being an explorer in the late 19th century, and it certainly feels like it.\n\nI love this game, and for me it scratches an itch that only FTL has ever been able to.  Each run takes about 2-3 hours from start to finish, and it's incredibly easy to drop in, form a crew, and set out if you have a bit of time to kill.  I'd also like to give props to the dev team, who are active on the forum and communicate with the fans.  They're constantly tweaking and balancing stuff even now, which is massively appreciated.  The game is better than it was when I first bought it because of their efforts, and it was incredibly enjoyable even then.\n\nI suspect that people who enjoy board game sensibilities or solid turn based strategy will get the most out of this title, though I suspect anyone who just enjoys resource management games would find it enjoyable.\n\nWHAT I PAID FOR IT: $20.00\nWHAT I WOULD PAY FOR IT: $20.00\n\nAll these opinions were developed playing on Classic Adventure difficulty","December 23, 2015","true","43.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Each of these crew members can level up, gaining new abilities and allowing you to choose between two different upgrades to the character.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very narrative with special encounters to complete or things to find by moving between tiles on the map, with your goal in each expedition to find a special treasure. However there are also many smaller treasures to find .

Different teams with different skills and approaches means many encoutners and events will play out differently in multiple playthroughs.  And I don't mean easier versus harder.  I mean the difference of storming an abbey full of gun-toting nuns to having a charm off with them.  This all leads to quirky humor which is all good and fun.\n\n* That said, I am a bit disappointed in the amount of content.  I know there is a lot of content in that encounters and events are actually just one of many possible events because each event has to be coded differently depending on initial mood etc.  However, I felt my expectations were set high since there was three different tutorial islands, but after that the areas are the same.  I really expected maybe two of three possible expeditions opening for each star level.  I guess that is what expansions are for.\n\n* There has been a lot of comparison to FTL, but it is not as hard or as unforgiving as FTL.  You are not forced to press on to harder expeditions because you can win the game (2000 pts) by just doing lower level expeditions.  However, there really should be a scoreboard to track your points to keep you going after those high-point high-risk options.\n\n* There are a few bugs still. Nothing game breaking, just immersion breaking.\n\n* Different shops unlock after each expedition.  However, they are rewarded in a counter intuitive way and have the same things every play through.  I really wish there was more randomized variety in the gold/item shops versus knowing where the machete is every play through.\n\n* Boss battles can also be too rough because of endlessly spawning minions, but in gereanl a coutner strategy of nuking the boss ASAP works.\n\nI might have harped on some of the weaknesses of this game, but in reality when you put it all together it is still a great game and lots of fun.  Even though each play through is only 5 expeditions, you do learn about your crew and random events can even lead to character development.  Character development in the story sense not in the game stats sense.  Even though I have dinged the game on lack of content, I am still surprised by what situations my crew will find themselves in.\n\nIn reality, my critique is really picking the wings off a beautiful butterfly.  Sure one can do it but in the end you are just destroying something that should be appreciated on its own terms.  That said I am going back to play some more by beating up sheep and hugging mummies!","September 8, 2015","true","28.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I won't break the streak. This game is pure, unadulterated awesome. It's fun, interesting, challenging, amusing and very pretty.\n\n... Let's back up a bit. Renowned Explorers is a roguelike, clearly inspired by FTL. It has a similar "decide where to go, solve text-based encounters, fight occassionaly" structure, but it is so much better. If you got discouraged by FTL or couldn't get into it (like me: I bought FTL ages ago, but it just lost my interest each time I tried to play), RE:IS might just be the game for you.\n\nWhy is it better than FTL?\n- It is breathtakingly beautiful. The crew members and the opponents they encounter are wonderfully designed, well-animated and also exceedingly funny.\n- Your crew (three explorers) have so much personality. IT is coveyed by art (how much personality can there be in a simply attack animation) and by their reactions in an encounter. Say, if you have a very greedy crew member, they may just refuse to leave a treasure, even if it is risky.\n- The plot is much more fun, at least for me - I really feel annoyance at our heroes' opponents.\n- The encounter/fighting system is really interesting. It occurs on a tactical, hex based map, with varying terrain (e.g., some terrain heals characters standing on it) and interesting mood system. Every ability you use influences the mood of your team, and so does every opponent's action. The interplay between your mood and the opponent's mood can strengthen you or weaken, and furthermore most bosses have interesting reactions to a type of ability. For example, a Big Important Nun gets into her Condemn the Heretics mode if you try to use Aggression on her.\n- You can play it in hardcore (here: adventure) mode, without retrying failed ancounters, or you can choose a casual approach, with free saving and retrying failed encounters.\n- Very varied content: every expedition our explorers can go on is different.\n- Very funny writing.\n- Cheerful and happy. Even when you loose, you laugh.\n\nAll in all, 10/10, great impulsive purchase, can I get an expansion or two?","September 3, 2015","true","36.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

You can choose to either aggressively dominate your enemies, insult them into despair, or become best friends with them. however, diffrent attiudes can easily wipeout your whole team. e.g, if you try to be friendly with an enemy who is aggressive towards you, you will suffer a armour debuff, making it more likely for them to hit you for high damage.\n-The characters. With 20 playable characters who each have their own playstyle, strengths and weakness, every run is different\n-Traits. each character has a trait/s that determine your chances in certain situations, for example, if there is a gaint boulder blocking your way, a character who has an athlete trait has a greater chance of succeding in that situation than someone who does not. in addition to that, characters can learn more traits through leveling,allowing you to customize your team to what you think will suit you best.\n-The Challenge.  By moving throughout your expeditions, you use up your supplies. once they are all gone, your team will start getting debuffs like "-40% attack power". This will mean you have to think ahead of time if you should go straight to the final destination of the expdetition or explore some more to earn treasure at the cost of stats.\n-Skill will win the battle. almost every attack in the game will hit at hundred percent, this includes enemy attacks aswell. even though it is a rogue-like game, a good strategy and equipment layout will always beat out sheer luck\n\nDislikes:\n-Frame rate problems. Throughout playing RE:IS, frame rate seems to vary everywhere. you could be fighting at sixty frames one moment and have it drop to 30 the next. while this doesnt bother me to much, i can see how others who play   might find this irratating.\n-The expeditions. Overall, there are 9 different expdeitions to go on, 12 if you count the first three starting expeditons that you dont get to chose from. while that seems like a quite a bit, some are very similar, for instance,  the Carribean expdetition mainly features pirates and monkeys and "The Emerged Island" offers voodoo pirates and voodoo monkeys, bascially reskinned pirates and monkeys.\n\nOverall, I Highly recommend this game if your into rouge-like and strategy games. It has enough skill based combat, varity, and challenge to make it a game that deserves a spot in your steam library","January 3","true","64.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Boy is that a mouthful! I have never seen quite a game like this. RE:IS draws aspects from each of its genres and combines them into a unique experience.\n\nUpon first glance at this game it can be somewhat puzzling or appear glaring simple even. You take a team of three explorers, making one of them your captain who gets an extra perk to help you along the way, and conduct 5 expeditions across various regions around the world. Each playthrough will have its own ups and downs and no two will every be alike.\n\nAt first glance the game doesnt appear to have much content. But the replayability is so high that after ~80 hours of gameplay I am still finding new treasure or trying out different strategies. There are 20 different characters to choose from. Thats 6,840 different combinations! With over a hundred treasure to collect you will find yourself sinking countless hours and playthrough into this game to master every detail. Plus the devs are constantly improving the game and adding more content!\n\nThere is more than one way to play. Combat is its own unique formula utilizing a rock-paper-scissors weakness chart creating different moods that effect your team. But even this gives way to more depth after you master the basics. Perhaps that boss that is easy to defeat deviously gives a different reward if you are friendly, but becareful because friendly abilities only do half damage to him.\n\nThe art and the story are both fantastic and the events continue to be amusing even after you've gone through them before. With an active community and weekly challenges there is always more strategies to try and scores to improve.\n\nIf you like turn-based strategy and roguelikes this is a game for you.\nIt quickly became one of my favorite games to play and I am still learning more and more about the secrets of hidden treasures.","March 8","true","108.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not as brutal as your average rogue-like, with difficulty levels and even (gasp!) the option to enable normal saving, REIS seems more interested in entertaining than frustrating. Not that you can't make the game brutally hard, it just isn't required.\n\nCombat is rock-paper-scissors with an intriguing emotional system overlaid. You can kill enemies with kindness, deviousness, or just...you know...kill them. Depending on the enemy, the scenario, and your captain/crew, each approach can lead to a variety of outcomes.\n\nThe world map and island map both recall board games, in a positive way. Potential for strategic combinations and tactics is high. The animations, characters, and UI are well designed and appealing. Good stuff, dev!\n\nI bought it on sale, however, had I known what I was getting, I would have prolly paid full price.

Why? I just felt like it is. It's also a rogue-like type of game so keep note of that before buying it.\n\nPRO:\n\n- The battle mechanic is what makes this game unique! Why? Different action = Different outcome :)\n\n- Easy to learn the basic BUT the twist is that it's hard to master the game. That is what makes this game FUN!\n\n- If you rush throughout the game, you might be able to finish it in 1 to 2 hours BUT again, you can play it over and over and OVER again with different setup (Crew) which give different results which makes it interesting hence it's a rogue-like type of game.\n\n- Watch youtube videos or read the guide on how to understand more of the game and trust me, you will definetly love the game more if you understand the mechanic because there are a lot of possible ways to explore or battle the enemy like I previously said on my first PRO above.\n\n- Tons of setup (Crew which consist of a captain and two members) to choose from!\n\nCONS:\n\n- If you are the type of person who does not have the patience to learn deep in a game's mechanic, you won't be enjoying this game, Im pretty sure you won't.\n\n- Honestly, I found no cons tho... that is pretty much it..\n\nTL;DR\n\n> Love Rogue-like? Love learning a game mechanic to it's deepest so you can truly master it? Love random rewards based on your action in game? Then you might like or love this game!\n\nOh another important note, you may rage a lot at the beginning, but no worries, it's the normal process of learning from your own mistake.\n\nUPDATE @ 5TH JUNE 2016\n\n- Im back in the game after like 2 months of not playing and I just finished my FIRST expedition and damn! I can say that I am so enjoying this and will be playing more! And and! They have a DLC, not just a money grabbin' dlc but a worth the money kind of dlc!

There... is a surprising amount of depth in this game.  Crew have 4 basic stats (phsyical/speech offense and defense) as well favoring one-two of the three combat styles (Aggressive, Friendly, Devious).  Its an important choice to either stack all of these up or keep them well balance, as using abilities will change the mood of an encounter.  Both you and your opponent have a combat "stance/attitude," and the combination of them affects the fight.  If you are both friendly, then the first aggressive attack gets +50% damage! This will immediately change the mood giving you extra speec defense (agains their pansy words!), however they will often swap to aggressive themselves creating an attitude that favors devious damage... which continues the dance.  As moods flip, enemies will react differently and use different attacks/change moods themselves.  Bosses are particularly bad about gaining bonus stats when you flip to a mood that they are hte most vulnerable too.  Even worse, some ecounters are scripted to offer better rewards for completing them in a different mood.  If you aggressively defeat the bandits, you get more rewards.  If you aggressively beat up the crazed abbess, your conscientious members get wracked with guilt and suffer permament penalties!  So even if your party really sucks at deviously, you have to consider weighing the extra challenge of a predominantly devious fight against what you would give up ending it on your prefered attitude... You also normally build up "Extra ____ when ending a fight ___!" bonuses.  So is giving up your standard +3 coin tokens on an aggressive victory worth giving up the information/treasure/incuring the curse of ending it that way instead of another? Can you even finish this tough boss battle the "right" way? Again, this cutesy game has a mountain of depth!\n\nAnd that is just one half of the game! While all expeditions end in a boss "fight," that might be the only fight you actually perform on the entire hike.  The rest of the map has various loot and challenges that check against your parties "abilities."  However, even if you don't have the right ability (like beguiling or archeology), if a character has high enough stats and is the right class... the can "brute force" the check.  My last play through had a speaker class with ranks in beguiling and a -very- high speech score.  She was my main attacker, however she lacked any ranks in diplomacy.  When going through a latter expedition with several diplomacy checks, I found that her sky-high speech stat coupled with a natural bonus of being a "speaker" was enough to push those diplomacy checks into the 60-70+ range! Everyone else was easily below 20.  This is another level of balancing your party... you need to have a good spread of abilities.  Each of hte locations you can choose to embark on also favors certain abilities and resources.  Embarking into the carribean will grant a ton of research, mostly found through survivalist, naturalist, athletic challenges.  Don't expect to get much use out of an engineer or beguiler! Tactician will be of limited use... but you might find the odd ruined village to excavate.  In the transylvanian countryside, you'll need a skilled diplomat to talk down the superstitious natives and a sharp tactian to deal with all the ambushes by cultists, bandits, and wolves.  So if you lack a diplomat, you'll have to choose.  Do you go to the carribean and enjoy the easy challenges, or do you tough it out in Hungary because you need the renown it offers more than the science? On top of all of this... each cleared expedition unlocks places to spend resources.  Exploring the carribean opens up a shop in New Orleans that sells +speaking element books (extra terrify damage, extra impress damage, etc).  So again, even if you don't want that science or don't have abilities to easily traverse the place... do you still go to unlock those sweet, sweet, books?\n\nThere is definitely a steep learning curve here... the creators graciously added different difficulty modes to help beginners get into the game and learn how to properly balance a party to dance between moods in combat and navigate the world map better.  In no time you'll be unlocking new captains and finding new treasures to suit different play styles! I really can't recommend the game enough.  If you are willing to put up with the difficulty curve, there is a mountain of depth and replayability here.  Each "session" only lasts 5 expeditions that each last maybe 30 minutes? You'll often finish off in just a few hours (or less if you die XD) before going back to the drawing board, so its not like each campaign is a mammoth 10 hour ordeal.","September 12, 2015","true","34.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I regret nothing.\n\nIt is a very entertaining rougelite experience, with tactical turn based combat. There are similar games out there, but RE:IS has some features that make it stand out from the crowd.\n\nFirstly theme and aesthetics. Game is set in XIXth century from the pulp novels of the era. It is the world of high adventure, voodoo pirates, mummies rising from their sarcophagi, travels around the world and exploration. Characters are embodiments of the tropes associated with that genre and they are given decent personality through simple things like their visual design and animation, despite almost complete lack of dialogue.\n\nSecondly, combat. It is relatively simple, but uses a "mood" system to create interesting variations with each encounter. Video linked above explains it in more detail, but in short - each move in battle fits one of three moods: Friendly, Devious, Aggresive. Depending in each side's mood, party is affected by buffs or debufss. Add to it the fact, that ending encounter in certain ways may give different rewards and it creates a set of decisions going far past spamming the strongest available attacks.\n\nThirdly, the charming narrative. It strongly connects with the first point. Each encounter (in verty FTL-esque) manner has a short description (or set of descriptions) which capture the adventureous feeling of the whole thing.\n\nThere is one problem with the game, namely number of different adventures available. Within few hours it is possible to see every one of them (but not to see everything they offer - supplies acting as a time limit make it difficult to see everything on any map within one play). This is however prone to change since devs promised to keep content patches coming through the 2015 and in 2016, provided they can afford it.\n\nSo here's the selfish part - go buy and play RE:IS. You'll have fun and I'll get chance for more content :P.","October 26, 2015","true","17.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Looking at screenshots or even just one playthrough, you can be guiled into thinking you've seen all the game can offer. The game offers a high level of replayability as there are many possible combinations of explorers and exploration scenarios.\n\nIt's hard to describe RE because it doesnt quite fit into a conventional genre such as FPS, RTS, etc. You pick 3 explorers - these explorers are typified into classes (speaker, scientist, scout, fighter) that have their own strengths and weaknesses -and lead them across an exploration scenario collecting tokens. Through combat, diplomacy, or cunning, you resolve challenges across the exploration scenario - the makeup and stats of your explorers will determine your overall success.\n\nTokens earned can be spent on upgrading a research tech tree, attracting more followers, or purchasing loot.\n\nCombat in RE is especially well done. During combat, 'moods' can offer a significant bonus/penalty. Manipulating the mood of the combat situation is key to winning battles in harder difficulties. You can resolve a battle by being friendly, aggressive, or devious.\n\nOverall, RE is easy and fun to play but will take some learning and effort to master. The game offers alot of depth and replayability.\n","October 28, 2015","true","86.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Look beyond the anachronistically inclusive pastel Victoriana and the fact that you can win fights by hurting everyone's feelings. ♥♥♥♥ being "hard," this game is complicated. It is also just straight up hard though.\n\nThe combat is very deterministic. While there is some very minor variation in damage output, so that you can sometimes gamble on killing someone that might otherwise take two hits, the RNG is mostly living in the encounter layout. Once you've seen the board, you really do live and die by your decisions. Everything that matters, including aggro, is something you can manipulate once you know what you're doing. And it's always open to you to say "Hell with this" and burn long-term resources so that you don't have to really watch what you're doing in a given fight. Likewise, even if you're down to your last handful of reserve, if you know what you're doing and aren't up against the final boss, you can usually get through.\n\nWhile the tactical side is all good and everything, the strategic layers are where this thing sings. Every single node event is interesting, with a variety of possible solutions. But you can't build a party that can do everything, and you can't always choose what you need to do.  Even before you're picking your actual battles, you have to pick your battles. Throughout, the writing is solid and transparent. Figuring out how to milk a map, calculating how many debuffs you can handle before the boss is confronted, this is great fun.\n\nAnd then on top of that, your entire map behaviour is influenced by a complex of tech trees, stores, and social groups. Spending resources almost always makes the campaign at hand easier in the short term, but resources are almost always more valuable later in the campaign. Is it worth 200 gold for this guy to be great at archeology if it means I can't buy him the best armour later? Should I melt these tokens now to make sure I get through Mali, or gamble that I can beat it without them because the payout will be better after? These are meaningful choices, and you are obliged to make them constantly.\n\nThis whole game is just lousy with interlocking systems, and they all work extremely well together. It's possible there's some one optimal group and strategy that snaps the game open, but as far as I can tell this just is about the best-designed game of its kind since FTL. It's a bummer that because all its chrome screams "CASUAL" people are unlikely to give it the time of day, but it's genuinely balls hard as a game and the fluff is really entertaining. I would strongly recommend this game to literally anyone; you will find a difficulty setting that makes it fun for you.","February 13","true","99.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Though really its kind of a rocks paper scissors type mechanic between the three. The exploration is fun, limited by supplies, exploring got better the more I played it as several playthrough are required usually to understand how to get the most out of the various expeditions. Equipment buffs your team members who also level up and learn new skills which help in encounters. The music is not my favorite, art style is fun and cartooney. I recommend this game.

You're goal is to gather the most reknown that you possibly can in four separate missions into the unknown. And it is fun to just complete it as quickly as possible. But the real fun is in the RPG elements thrown in, and the fun style of comedy that is on display.\n\nIt's very neat to be able to assemble a tough, aggressive group only to have them battle a flock of sheep, and beat them with love.\n\nI would say this is worth the asking price. IF you missed out on the humble bundle and your curious what this is all about, give it a go. It's everything.

The devs helped me out on how to resolve the problem and I haven't had the time to say thanks because the game is just fantastic. It is a very niche game, combining the light-heartedness of indie games and the strategy elements of games like civ5 and Heroes, yet the result is fascinating when combined with the explorers theme. The fun thing is that you can choose to play any mode, depending on your level of concentration and time available. I even played it with my girlfriend, who hasn't any experience in turn-based strategies (or almost any games), and she enjoyed it a lot. We are doing ironman mode (no saves) on hard together now and it is going great.\n\nThe game is certainly in my top3 games I would recommend to anyone due to its vast spectrum of opportunities and possibilities. Another thing of note is that it very accessible by players with zero experience in the field, yet a lot of fun for players with experience in heavy games (EU4, CK2, Victoria2, Civ~).","February 11","true","74.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Comparison to FTL are fair, but I feel like I have more control when playing this game based on information about each node, overviews of the adventures ahead etc.\n\nAt this stage I feel more locations and captains would be a good addition, which I assume is being added in the coming expansion.

(Though the animations are great so it's kind of shame to do so)\n-Loads of different characters.\n-You are ALWAYS making decisions and the effects of them can really be felt through all aspects of the game.\n\nCons:\n-Once you run through all of the adventures available once or twice they can start to feel a little samey.\n\n\nSo, please please buy this game so they can start making more content!

It's all fair game on the way to fame and fortune.\n\nThis is the first time I've written a review on Steam.\n\nThat should give you some idea of how much of an impression Renowned Explorers has left me with in such a short amount of time. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anybody who is a fan of King of Dragon Pass, Faster Than Light, or roguelike games. It's hard to describe because this game really is a breath of fresh air for any gamer that's played pretty much everything over the years.\n\nIt's not really like most other games.\n\nThe combat system is easily the most interesting mechanic I've seen in years. The last time I was this impressed by a new idea like this was probably when I first played Civilization because it was that different and new ideas in games don't seem to come around all that often anymore. It all feels like more of the same, except for this game.\n\nYou pick your leader, recruit your crew, and set out on an adventure. You can build a party up of different characters, and there's a lot to choose from. You unlock them as leaders to lead your party later.\n\nThe super deep "combat" system. I can't rave about this enough.\n\nYou can resolve encounters through skill checks before they happen sometimes, or by using aggression, devious, or friendly moves during them. Or, you can walk around the areas where you know they'll happen if you want. I mean, there's probably even more ways to handle a single encounter than that, but that's off the top of my head. That doesn't even get into the numerous strategies you can use while you're in combat. You don't have to stick with an aggressive approach for an entire encounter. You can switch halfway through to resolve it in a friendly or devious manner.\n\nIt's hard to explain. You just have to play it.\n\nYou MUST play it.\n\nThe game really gives you the feeling that you're exploring the world like Indiana Jones, Nathan Drake, or Lara Croft. You have your crew members, and everybody has their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe art style is Adorable!\n\nIf you ever felt like all the wonder was gone in the world. Or like most games are too damn oppressively moody, then you'll really love the tone of the writing, the refreshing art style, and the humorous events that just seem to happen through the stupid decisions you make.\n\nThe cons:\n\nI'm not sure I've found any yet. One bug that resolved when I exited the game. There was an enemy that kept running around my screen like he was on crack after he died. It was more funny than anything.\n\nI solved it by saving and exiting the game.\n\n","January 4","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

By that I mean it's a node based exploration game with limited time (supply in this case), each node being an event. Could be a series naratively driven stats rolls or an encounter. Encounters use a turn based tactical system with a strange and interesting emotion component. There is also a solid gameplay layer between expeditions where you can spend your various resources.\n\nThere is a good amount of replayability, especially if you want to unlock all the captains. With a total of 20 characters for a party of 3, I have yet to try them all. The game is also pretty hard so that's another replayability aspect. I've kinda beaten the game after about 10-12 hours of gameplay (I'm not sure how many playthrough, probably 5+) but by "kinda" I mean that I only survived all 5 expeditions, I didn't succeed the real goal of beating the top explorer. Doing that took another 2-3 tries.\n\nThis is definitely one of the underated gems of 2015, I would highly recommend it to anyone who liked the FTL system.","January 3","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For many people, they don't have time to waste on big title open world rpgs that require long sessions, and RE:IS is a great rouge-likelike to play during that short one hour break between work, similar to BOI:Afterbirth or Downwell, and it is very good at that.\n\nWould love to have a DLC pack for this game, with more areas and maybe more characters.

Look beyond the anachronistically inclusive pastel Victoriana and the fact that you can win fights by hurting everyone's feelings. ♥♥♥♥ being "hard," this game is complicated. It is also just straight up hard though.\n\nThe combat is very deterministic. While there is some very minor variation in damage output, so that you can sometimes gamble on killing someone that might otherwise take two hits, the RNG is mostly living in the encounter layout. Once you've seen the board, you really do live and die by your decisions. Everything that matters, including aggro, is something you can manipulate once you know what you're doing. And it's always open to you to say "Hell with this" and burn long-term resources so that you don't have to really watch what you're doing in a given fight. Likewise, even if you're down to your last handful of reserve, if you know what you're doing and aren't up against the final boss, you can usually get through.\n\nWhile the tactical side is all good and everything, the strategic layers are where this thing sings. Every single node event is interesting, with a variety of possible solutions. But you can't build a party that can do everything, and you can't always choose what you need to do.  Even before you're picking your actual battles, you have to pick your battles. Throughout, the writing is solid and transparent. Figuring out how to milk a map, calculating how many debuffs you can handle before the boss is confronted, this is great fun.\n\nAnd then on top of that, your entire map behaviour is influenced by a complex of tech trees, stores, and social groups. Spending resources almost always makes the campaign at hand easier in the short term, but resources are almost always more valuable later in the campaign. Is it worth 200 gold for this guy to be great at archeology if it means I can't buy him the best armour later? Should I melt these tokens now to make sure I get through Mali, or gamble that I can beat it without them because the payout will be better after? These are meaningful choices, and you are obliged to make them constantly.\n\nThis whole game is just lousy with interlocking systems, and they all work extremely well together. It's possible there's some one optimal group and strategy that snaps the game open, but as far as I can tell this just is about the best-designed game of its kind since FTL. It's a bummer that because all its chrome screams "CASUAL" people are unlikely to give it the time of day, but it's genuinely balls hard as a game and the fluff is really entertaining. I would strongly recommend this game to literally anyone; you will find a difficulty setting that makes it fun for you.","February 13","true","99.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's very relaxed, humorously written, and has a fun turn-based "combat" system which has quite a bit of depth, once you get the hang of it. The word combat is in quotes because it could be that you're all hurling compliments at each other, or taunts, rather than bullets. Or usually some mixture of the three. I liked the game right off the bat, but after a little experience, when I got the hang of how everything relates, I like it even more.\n\nThe depth mainly comes from your crew, which come from a pool of available adventurers (you choose three out of I think 20), all with their own strengths and weaknesses. As they gain experience, you level them up with permanent perks and bonuses. It's a lot of fun to put together a crew, and I think it'll just get more fun as I play more (I'm only at around four hours right now), and learn more about the various crew members and level them up.","June 4","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

RE:IS is a very compelling , Refined , Well-paced and simply epic way of telling story using every mechanic to support the idea of upbeat adventure. Which might be praised  for a hundreds of time already.\n\nSo I am going to focus on presentation this game has to offer instead. First of all, I am pretty much a sucker for anything that has a strong theme. whatever it might sound weird , serious , stupid or unrealistic it is, If the game living in it's own world and take advantage on it's own theme then it's doing presentation right (example : Darkest Dungeon , Hunnie Pop, Don't Starve , Recettear)\n\nFor limited budget game like REIS to shine out,  It has to need every aspect of the game to help represent the theme of\nthe game and gladly they did almost everything right. the visual is bright and colorful in pop up book style , this might just look too simple on screenshots but when you playing it yourself it feel a hundred times more impressive. This is one of the game that design everything to support the theme itself. Characters design is vivid , a little goofy but they can be mixed together not just for create an efficient party but to change the story telling itself too. Also , to support the idea of combat system that based on "Friendly" , "Devious" and "Aggressive" ways, Every character has their own traits and personality fitting what they are. A small but important details like how they gain buffs or making facial expression on dialogue encounters helping a lot!  So even not in combat this game still keep getting interesting by well made story telling (which you have part of writing it too). It's not hard to find an epic funny story along the way and still this is not the end of how smart they using this system, Because the way they keep changing how encounters and event approach you. Eventually , You will find  most of them but it will hardly goes stale because you will still get different vibe with different party anyway. Even Combat system is created to compliment the theme , battle can be resolved in ways and it's really funny that you can even bully a giant monster until he cry and run away! (and that is A F**KING Brilliant way to make this game appealing).\n\nThe weakest point of presentation might be the soundtracks of the game, However it's not actually bad but comparing with all amazing aspect of this game, music in this game got a little off feeling (feel like it should be more upbeat and epic than this), And While it has a good feedback interface that giving most information you need to know. some of them are still lacking (like no tool-tips of unlock buildings in world map and some unclear combat tiles connection). Anyway these are just very tiny dot in this masterpiece.\n\nBottom line. Just shove money into this game as hard as you can! this game deserve more sale and attention than it is!\n(I don't know if pricing in USD maybe a bit higher but in Thailand it's about $10 which is a very good deal)","October 26, 2015","true","13.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its level of abstraction remains constant over all of its mechanics (except for shops, which are very simple mechanically, compared to the rest of the game's depth and breadth.) The art is done fantastically. Everything about this game oozes polish and makes the game more enjoyable. If you share my aesthetic biases, and you want to immerse yourself in a world slightly brighter and more fantastic than our own, with your own adventuring party, with each possible explorer being full of character and incredibly enjoyable to observe and interact with, and with every step along the way seeping with immersive little details, buy and play this game. It's obviously a labor of love.\nAnd if you do choose to buy the game and share my aesthetic biases, I reccomend Classic difficulty, on Adventurer mode. It adds a great deal of tension to your early games, and really gets you invested in the incredibly fragile lives and careers of these wonderfully simple and unique characters.

Truth be told, learning on the fly was probably more fun than a lengthy tutorial, but folks that don't usually play this sort of game may get a bit frustrated. Though I am still in the early going, I highly recommend this game.","September 6, 2015","true","24.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

RE:IS is a very compelling , Refined , Well-paced and simply epic way of telling story using every mechanic to support the idea of upbeat adventure. Which might be praised  for a hundreds of time already.\n\nSo I am going to focus on presentation this game has to offer instead. First of all, I am pretty much a sucker for anything that has a strong theme. whatever it might sound weird , serious , stupid or unrealistic it is, If the game living in it's own world and take advantage on it's own theme then it's doing presentation right (example : Darkest Dungeon , Hunnie Pop, Don't Starve , Recettear)\n\nFor limited budget game like REIS to shine out,  It has to need every aspect of the game to help represent the theme of\nthe game and gladly they did almost everything right. the visual is bright and colorful in pop up book style , this might just look too simple on screenshots but when you playing it yourself it feel a hundred times more impressive. This is one of the game that design everything to support the theme itself. Characters design is vivid , a little goofy but they can be mixed together not just for create an efficient party but to change the story telling itself too. Also , to support the idea of combat system that based on "Friendly" , "Devious" and "Aggressive" ways, Every character has their own traits and personality fitting what they are. A small but important details like how they gain buffs or making facial expression on dialogue encounters helping a lot!  So even not in combat this game still keep getting interesting by well made story telling (which you have part of writing it too). It's not hard to find an epic funny story along the way and still this is not the end of how smart they using this system, Because the way they keep changing how encounters and event approach you. Eventually , You will find  most of them but it will hardly goes stale because you will still get different vibe with different party anyway. Even Combat system is created to compliment the theme , battle can be resolved in ways and it's really funny that you can even bully a giant monster until he cry and run away! (and that is A F**KING Brilliant way to make this game appealing).\n\nThe weakest point of presentation might be the soundtracks of the game, However it's not actually bad but comparing with all amazing aspect of this game, music in this game got a little off feeling (feel like it should be more upbeat and epic than this), And While it has a good feedback interface that giving most information you need to know. some of them are still lacking (like no tool-tips of unlock buildings in world map and some unclear combat tiles connection). Anyway these are just very tiny dot in this masterpiece.\n\nBottom line. Just shove money into this game as hard as you can! this game deserve more sale and attention than it is!\n(I don't know if pricing in USD maybe a bit higher but in Thailand it's about $10 which is a very good deal)","October 26, 2015","true","13.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are more places to explore, tech is now no longer based on your team build, there are more events in locations and more interesting decisions to be made there along with tons of balancing patches.  You heard right BALANCE PATCHES IN A SINGLEPLAYER GAME to improve the play experience.  The Dev team is fan-freaking-tastic.  If you like rogue-likes, buy it, if you like turn based strategy, buy it, if you like adventure games buy it!  The only feature that might put people off is the learning curve.  You really do need to figure out the strategy elements in this game, which are a little weird at first, but after that the difficulty settings let you make this anything from hardcore score-attack to casual lunch-breaker game.  It's really flexible that way.\n\nThis game is great.  It has an awesome choose-your-own adventure style and a lot of replayability.  The mood and combat system is a bit confusing at first but it's not too hard to learn and it really makes things interesting.  There's a big FTL or Binding of Isaac kind of feel where it's a short experience that can turn out in different ways.  My only problem is that is simply doesn't have the unpredictability that those games do.  There are 10 different levels, 5 of which you explore in each playthrough, with their own strategies and secrets which are randomly placed on the map, but always present and always the same.  The characters abilities are slightly customizable over the course of the game but not a ton, this isn't much of a problem though as each 30 minute playthrough will use 3 out of the 20 characters.  However besides character selection there's little deviation between playthroughs.  In FTL or BoI finding the right weapon at the right time can swap your whole strategy, not so much here.  Your strategy is set by the characters and missions you chose, there's no evolution.  It may sound like I dislike the game here with this rant but really it's just that I love it so much and I see so clearly what it could be with more levels and more evolution.  If this gets steam workshop support or an expansion it could easily match the hundreds of hours Xcom, Isaac and FTL have gotten from me.  As it is now it's about 10-20 hours of great content, which was worth it to me but I can understand wanting more for your money.\n\nEdit: Based on their latest patch I am now completely sold on this game.  Abbey has demonstrated that they are interested in making their game better on a consistent basis and ensuring it doesn't turn into a stagnant, formulaic experience despite being singleplayer.  This is more than I can say for Binding of Isaac and FTL, who recieved only spotty support from developers.  This pushes me from 7/10 to 9/10.  If they release a few more levels I'll send it straight to 11/10.\n\nEdit 2: Well they released a new map.  I can think of no reason whatsoever not to recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based strategy.  My minor complaints and nitpicks have been blown into a fine red mist by the rocket launcher of amazing that Abbey is wielding.

It combines a relatively short playthrough (a full game of five expeditions takes about 2-4 hours) with large replayability through unexpected encounters and the variety of playable characters. And it uses simple but clever animation style with clever writing, being an an adventure that is for a considerable part text-based, giving it a lot of flavor, and yet has some good graphic context to help you be drawn into the stories. The environments of the various expeditions are varied, and yet the whole game has a clear consistent style.\n\nMy only negative point would be how this game is basically making colonialism fun. Yes, it does it with a wink, but also rewriting it in such a way that it somehow becomes ethnically inclusive. However, it makes it SO much fun, this is really just a minor complaint.

So what does this game bring to the table? What makes it replayable?\n\nIt is designed to be played multiple times so each session will only last a few hours at most. You form a three person team from a roster of 20 characters divided into four specializations. The catch being that only four are unlocked at the start to be in the captain roll. Simply playing the game and running with different characters in the other two positions permanently unlocks them for the captain position in future playthroughs. On top of this you can choose how you approach your encounters, be it friendly, devious or aggressively so playing for or against type can throw your opponents for a loop.\n\nNow the biggest drawback is the lack of locations to explore. Currently you have three possible starting locations and then choose from a handful of others. Your goal is to gain enough reknown to beat a rival explorer at a special party, but you only have time for a total of five explorations before the deadline hits and the most reknowned explorer is crowned. While I will freely admit to wanting more locations to explore there is a lot of replay value in what is currently available if you're determined to hunt down all the side quests or you want to nail a significant portion of the 100+ achievements currently available. Each currently available explorable location is stuffed full of interesting things to uncover. You can scour every spot on a playthrough only to discover a different event chain in that location in your next playthrough. The locations were definitely well thought out and had a lot of time and effort put into each one by the developers.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n\nYes. If nothing else, it's definitely worth a solid ten to fifteen hours of gameplay just to unlock all the captains and see a good chunk of the quest events. There are plenty more hours to be had if you want to find all the in game trophies and want to grab a good chunk of or even all the achievements. I just finished unlocking all 20 characters for captain use at nearly 13 hours and have only gotten about half of the in game treasure from various side quests and main quest chains and finding all of said side quests.\n\n\n\ntl;dr\n\n10/10 Would make sheep feel bad about their life choices again.","September 27, 2015","true","26.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The gameplay is quite unique (we rarely saw it before, only something similar in Curious Expedition but this one feels less 'indie'): you gather a party of three advanturers from 4 main casts, and you try to survive 5 advanture, find treasures of all kind - in the meantime you need to improve your brave party and buff them with various things like items, companions and new technologies.\n\nThe theme is lighthearted ; but I mean no wrong, the level of humour is absolutely acceptable, the game will makes you smile for sure.\n\nAlso, there is a great depth here and however I still do not understand the encounters (fights) fully it still fun. You will loose your first runs because it's pretty challenging stuff.\n\nIf you like FTL, Curious Expedition and/or boardgames it's a must have for you then.","September 3, 2015","true","196.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

My original suggestions still hold. I don't like the random addition of new enemies especially right on top of you, I'd like to see an option to fail in the expedition and move on and I think there needs to be more expeditions to choose from...BUT, the sheer potential, humor and exploration parts are too good to pass up.\n\nTwo additional suggestions. (1) A permanent list accessible from the main menu saving the final stats from each game including who your crew members were. If it already exists I didn't see it. (2) an undo move option during encounters.\n\nMy original review is below the line.\n\n---------THE LINE--------\n\nThis is the hardest "Not Recommended" review I've ever written. Most of this game is fun and a real hoot but it's ruined by the final encounters durring each expedition and the limited number of expeditions.\n\nThe final encounters are just too random and they violate a pet peeve of mine. They randomly introduce additional enemies during the fight. This means that maneuver strategies don't work since new enemies can be dropped in right on top of you. The other problem is sometimes you'll find that your current crew just doesn't do well against the final encounter and there's no way to simply give up on the current expedition and move on to the next one.\n\nEven if you don't get to the top of the leader board seeing how well you can do with different crews would be fun.\n\nAnother problem is while the individual expeditions are generated each time there doesn't seem to be very many of them and that makes the gameplay, or at least the final encounters, become very repetitive very quickly. There just aren't that many expeditions to choose from so you're pretty much repeating the same ones game after game.\n\nGet rid of the random addition of new enemies or add the option to just run back to London with what you've earned so far and move on to the next expedition even if it means not getting to the top of the explorer board and add more expeditions to choose from and this game could be a classic. Right now it's just too little and too depedent upon being lucky in the final encounters.","September 3, 2015","true","177.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

The art-style and atmosphere is colorful, light-hearted and varied. It has a DnD kind of system during exploration of different stage maps, meaning your characters' stats, skills, and items determine their chance of succeeding at different tasks. There's also an element of choice and risk assessment. You find resources and treasures and fight a boss at the end of each stage.\n\nThe combat is turn-based strategy, with an interesting "mood" system. You can dynamically change the mood of the battle between aggressive, friendly and devious, which gives your team an advantage or disatvantage in a rock-paper-scissors-type of system. In addition to dealing "damage" (or...convincing people of your good intentions I guess) you can also change characters' status by affecting their feelings.

Your characters level up and learn more useful active skills by resolving conflicts (and certain events).\n\nBetween stages you can spend the resources you've gathered.

I'm sure you get more and better powers later on with which to come up with more advanced strategies but I'm not really motivated by anything in the game to make me play further to unlock those things.\n\nI'm sure this game will be very fun for some people - as it already has based on most of the other reviews - but I'm going to spend what little free time I have playing something else.","June 5","false","2.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Because of that I'm reommending the game to everyone. Once that happens, the game will truly be great. The premature end was really the only thing holding it back in my book. Everything else was fantastic.\n\n***End Edit***\n\nThis game has a lot going for it. Nice sense of humor, fun art style, it does not take itself too seriously. I really like the combat system as well, where the player has to pay attention to the mood of the battlefield and use it to their advantage. I really want to recomend it, I really do, but I just can't.\n\nThe main reason for this is because I went in expecting to put together a team of loveable misfits and go on a great epic adventure, and the game does allow that to a certian extent. The problem is that it just ends so abruptly. You only get to go on five adventures and then you are forced to go back to the main menu and put together a new crew and start all over again. As soon as you grow attached to your crew, the game ends.\n\nI just wish it was a bit more like X-com where it really does feel like you are taking part in a great story, but instead this game ends right at the moment I go "man, I can't wait to upgrade my crew and explore even more of the world."","September 5, 2015","true","10.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/april6e/recommended/296970/","april6e","april6e","http://steamcommunity.com/id/april6e/","145 products in account","There are already many reviews that explain the game mechanics. My review, rather focuses on what is important to me, which is replay value. For the lazy who don't like to read, I have condensed all my points below (Pros, Cons and Warnings). My final verdict is that I love the game. It's a must try if you like turn based strategy, rogue-likes, high score games and high replayability.\n\n-Pros-\n+Wonderful Artwork\n+Deceptively deep and challenging turn based combat system\n+Strong replay value due to treasure collection system, a large amount of characters and good variety of different strategies you can employ to win the game\n+Developer is active on the message board, talking to and getting ideas from the fanbase. Free patches and content are constantly released to improve the game.\n+Very easy to pick up and play. "One more turn syndrome" is very easy to catch.\n\n-Cons-\n+Game is constantly being rebalanced which may alienate people who hate change. Some characters are overpowered and some are underpowered. At a high level of play, players may discover a lack of choice because of the balancing. There is little reason to go on certain expeditions because they don't offer as much score as the "meta" ones.\n+Most of the replay value comes from the wealth of different character combinations and strategies. The expeditions, after playing them a few times become predictable despite the fact that they are randomly generated as you'll see the same events often.\n\n-Warnings-\n+Stubborn players may become disillusioned with the difficulty of the game. On the default settings, the turn based combat becomes difficult in the late game unless you learn the deep combat system. This can easily be solved by lowering the difficulty but this will not matter to prideful gamers who refuse to lower it.\n+Like any rogue-like, there is a healthy amount of RNG (your success is around 40% luck). If this bothers you, this may not be the genre for you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis game consists of choosing a three person team of explorers and going on 5 expeditions (you get to choose different locations around the world) in a bid to survive, find treasure and ultimately beat your rival by outscoring him by the end of the game. The amount of treasures and resources you gain during a playthrough are converted into a overall score called Renown.\n\nDuring an expeditions, there are nodes that you move along that have random events on them. A resource called Supplies is reduced by 1-2 everytime you move with heavy penalties if you run out forcing you to make strategic decisions on how much loot you want to collect before you go to the final node which results in a boss fight and ends the expedition. Combat is surprisingly deep with a rock, paper, scissors system where you can defeat your opponents with aggression, friendliness or deviousness. Massive buffs or debuffs can be applied to the entire battlefield depending on whether you are winning or losing the rock, paper, system system, making combat challenging. Simply rushing in and attacking will not go well in the later expeditions and boss fights.\n\nOutside of expeditions, you can use resources you gained to purchase items to improve the stats of your party, buy items and followers with perks and more.\n\nThis game was a giant hidden gem to me. I was randomly browsing Steam for roguelikes and found it deep within the dark depths of Gaben's labyrinth. I purchased it just to try it and next thing you know, I had nearly 25 hours of gameplay in a few days. There are a ton of different carrots to keep you playing for dozens of hours. Unlocking all the captains, beating the game, beating the two secret endings and finding every single one of the treasure hidden in the game.\n\nThe game feels very rewarding with many layers to master. "My run is average and I'm not sure I'm going to get enough score to beat my rival. Do I go to a 4 or 5 star difficulty expedition which has great rewards but risk dying? Or do I just do another 3 star expedition which is easy but I may not get enough score to win the game?"\n\n"This boss is weak to aggression so I could physically attack it to do massive damage. But it also has a perk that causes it to transform into a more powerful form if it gets physically attacked which will put my party at risk."\n\n"One of my party members has a greedy personality. Do I risk visiting a ruins where I know there is alot of treasure? It'll drastically increase my score but my party members who has a greedy personality may grab all the treasure and set off a nasty trap risking the run".\n\nIf these sorts of scenarios and choices excite you, then I think you'll enjoy the game alot.\n\n\n\n","January 22","true","41.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although it has only minor gameplay similarities, the feeling I get while playing is most similar to FTL. I HIGHLY recommend playing on adventure mode for intense, consequence driven, rogue-lite gaming.\n\nCombat is turn-based on a hex map. Strategy revolves around changing your team's attitude between friendly, devious, and aggresive to match or beat your opponent's. Emotions are applied on a per charcter basis for additional buffs/debuffs.\n\nEach expedition plays out similarly to a sector of FTL. Limited supplies and fog-of-war create difficult decisions while exploring. Collect wealth, status, and research to spend later, while also seeking treasures to increase your renown as the world's greates explorer.\n\nBetween expeditions, spend the resources you gathered to specialize your crew with better equipment, an entourage to increase your resource gains, and research papers to focus on your victory condition.\n\nThe RNG aspects of the game are clearly laid out (you are told what % chance you have at passing a test, plus the rewards/punishments) which means your risks are calculated and you have nobody to blame but yourself for the outcome.\n\nDevs like Abbey are why gaming today is so great.

A fun mix of exploration (of course!), stat-based challenges (that roulette wheel mechanic is GREAT alternative to dice rolling), X-COM style tactical combat, balanced with resource management, party-building, and skill tree advancement.\nWell-crafted world-building. Just the right mix of borrowed historical elements, genre tropes, imperial archetypes, and self-aware humor, all presented with genuine love for the setting.\nImpressive pan-global character designs. The devs take advantage of the gleeful anachronism to present a more diverse cast, with the bad-♥♥♥ female luchadore and distaff Greek resistance fighter being just as credible and important as the grizzled sea captain and stiff-upper-lipped aristocrat. For a game where the fluff is so closely integrated with the mechanics, that's a big deal.\n\nThe Bad\nFor a game that doesn't seem particularly complex, it sure is buggy.

First of all its short. You can complete a full run in under 2 hours. The replay value is decent. You will want to run it a few times on each difficulty and try to find all the things, or get the highest score. Is it worth $20? probably not. I got it on sale for $12 and think it was a fair deal. The explore map is quite similar to FTL, but the combat is a bit more like Blackguards. Then throw in a bit of party management and youve got this game.\n\nAt first things seem a little confusing, but the tutorials help a lot on the combat but not so much on the city screen.

That being said, I was super into these books in my childhood, so as I played through the game it often time made me feel as if each choice mattered dearly making the game that much more immersive to me.\n\nSo, if you dislike the theme of the game is there any other reason to buy it? Yes, the combat system of the game is not just shooting and killing your opponents. This game has a mood system, both for the characters and for the entire battle. The three moods, aggressive, devious, and friendly are absolutely vital to your success on any particular adventure. That being said, on the higher difficulties event the most mundane encounters can threaten your entire expedition, so learning to master moods and the various ways to influence it is vital to winning the game.\n\nAn average playthrough takes around 2-4 hours on classic difficulty, but this doesn't mean that the game lacks replayability, in fact there are well over 16 explorers to chose from all with unique abilities and traits. There are also 6-7 expeditions in the game, and as others have pointed out, the lack of variety in that sense can make the game rather dull to run through after you've sunk in around 10 hours.\n\nDespite all of this, as the game currently stands I absolutely recommend buying the game at full price or otherwise!","December 27, 2015","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love how the combat and non-combat mechanics are integrated here, with both being potentially extremely important for your playstyle.  The skills and types of exploreres you take with you can make major changes in how you play the game.\n\nI'm not going to go into too many details because lots of people have beat me to it with much better reviews.  However I'm going to emphasize that A)  the devs are wonderful and continue to tweak and put out new content and changes, making the game even better.

If you like either of those things, I highly recommend it.\n\nThe good:\n- Transparent dice rolls. You're given your exact change to succeed and a breakdown of why you have that chance, along with (most of) the consequences of success or failure.\n- Depth discovery. The tutorial does a good job of introducing you to the main mechanics, but doesn't attempt to give you strategies for winning. You'll understand how to play immediately, but winning strategies will take a few games to really understand on the suggested difficulty.\n- Progression. 4 different resource currencies to spend after every expedition on at least a dozen options each and 5 levels per character with two choices each. There are a massive number of different ways to play even with the same crew.\n- Choices. Most characters can play two of the three styles well, and there are 20 characters across four classes. You get three per game, and while not all combinations are viable, hundreds are. You'll also make meaningful choices at almost every exploration node.\n\nThe bad:\n- Could use more skills. Most of the combat skills are shared with other characters, which somewhat takes away from their uniqueness.\n- Massive final boss difficulty spike. Like FTL, the final area is exponentially harder than anything preceeding it. Unlike FTL, you can win (but not the best way) without going there. I'd still like to see a smoother transition.\n- Typos and grammar mistakes galore. English is clearly not the devs first language, and it really could've used a pass from a native speaker to fix some of the mistakes. You'll always know what they meant, but it can be distracting.\n\nOverall recommended at full price or otherwise. I got my first "win" after 17 hours, but I did it without fighting the final boss and still have half the treasures to find and several captains to unlock. There's way more than $20 of entertainment here.","April 7","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is AWESOME!\nThis is an absolute GEM!\n\nPROs:\n+ Very good gameplay. The combat, RPG and management systems are very nice. Simple to use yet hard to master. My 1st campaign was good but once i reached end game it was not enough. Which pushed me to think harder and plan more on my next one. (recommend doing the tutorial 1st time)\n+ Great Cartoon Art\n+ Tons of characters and team combinations. Which lets you experiment and try different styles of play.\n+ Very interesting emotion (rock-paper-sccisor) combat.\n+ REPLAYABILITY! Not only do you have different styles and many characters but the randomized maps and expeditions allow for tons of replayability. Theres hundreds of treasures to uncover so you can safely play the game many times and enjoy it.\n+ The random generation of levels keeps each map fresh.\n+ Alot of achievements if you wanna challenge yourself more.\n+ As far as i can tell developer working on more content <3 <3 <3\n\n\nCons\n- A bit overwhelming at the begining. I was lucky to decide and do the tutorial. Took me 1 campaign to get my head around things.\n-Too early to tell but i feel like the base locations are too few. Ive done 2 campaigns and my early and mid game expeditions were the same i just chose different places to go. But as i said earlier the developers are working on new content so i think this game will keep getting bigger and better. And to be fair even though im listing this as a con by the time all the current expeditions start to feel boring i think i would have easily clocked about 40/50 hours and thats AMAZING value for $$$.\n\n\nEnd Verdict:\n9/10\nIts almost perfect in my opinion.

It makes you think, design your own stategy & test it on the map. You will fail miserably at times, just to retry and enjoy Epic victories\nSo what's not to like ? well it's just personal, but the reason I didn't buy it sooner was because of the heroe's portrait design, it could use some improvement, after all they are the heroes of this game and they should deserve extra care, the rest of the design is well done, the music complements well the feeling of being part of a great adventure.\n\nI really look forward to extensions and improvements to get my team on another epic adventures.\n","February 14","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although it has only minor gameplay similarities, the feeling I get while playing is most similar to FTL. I HIGHLY recommend playing on adventure mode for intense, consequence driven, rogue-lite gaming.\n\nCombat is turn-based on a hex map. Strategy revolves around changing your team's attitude between friendly, devious, and aggresive to match or beat your opponent's. Emotions are applied on a per charcter basis for additional buffs/debuffs.\n\nEach expedition plays out similarly to a sector of FTL. Limited supplies and fog-of-war create difficult decisions while exploring. Collect wealth, status, and research to spend later, while also seeking treasures to increase your renown as the world's greates explorer.\n\nBetween expeditions, spend the resources you gathered to specialize your crew with better equipment, an entourage to increase your resource gains, and research papers to focus on your victory condition.\n\nThe RNG aspects of the game are clearly laid out (you are told what % chance you have at passing a test, plus the rewards/punishments) which means your risks are calculated and you have nobody to blame but yourself for the outcome.\n\nDevs like Abbey are why gaming today is so great.

There are a lot of parallels to FTL, from the semi randomly generated maps, to the resources collected, to the semi random upgrades, but I feel that RE:IS has a lot more depth than FTL does - both are enjoyable in their own way, and both will take a while to master the tactics, but RE:IS just feels like there's more there.  The different combat powers, the way you can affect your crew and the enemy based on mood and how you 'attack' is very nice.  I like the different options you've got for upgrading between expeditions and how there are plenty of different paths to follow.  The game isn't perfect, but it's got plenty of enjoyment in it, and I'm definitely looking forward to more content.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice, gentle difficulty curve, it seems like it might be there, if you pick the right crew and know the right order to take the expeditions in, but it seems to win, you're going to have to hit some of those nasty, RNG difficulty spikes and let fate have a big hand in the final decision.  I like the fact that you can 'finish' the game without winning, but there are also situations where you end up in a fight where you very quickly realize you're over your head, and unlike FTL, there's no way to run away and have the chance to lick your wounds, your game is over (assuming you play adventure mode).  This does seem a little harsh, even in a roguelike with permadeath, being locked in a fight where you know you can't win, which will end the game, but you still have plenty of resources if you could run away and try something else is more than a little frustrating.  I wish there was a 'run away!' option from encounters, but that's pretty minor.\n\nIf I have any complaints about RE:IS it's that there's very little map content - there only seem to be a few of each 'difficulty' map, and within those maps, the variability is somewhat limited, so you're going to be playing the same mini adventures over and over again.  FTL has so many different encounters, this seems to be less of an issue there.\n\nAdditionally, the only ongoing 'unlocks' that you can obtain in RE:IS are getting crew members to the point they can be captains - though this is similar to FTL's unlocking of new ship layouts and new ships, since you start with all the crew, this somehow, to me anyway, feels less like an accomplishment, but it doesn't take anything away from the enjoyability of the game.","January 8","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game includes aspects of grand strategy, every treasure you find, every item you buy and every skill your crew learns has an enormous effect on what expeditions you can and cannot do, recognising this is one of the key aspects to the strategy. As well is this there is an excellent combat system, that rewards forward planning and tactical plays.\n\nFurthermore the humor and art style of this game is absuloutely excellent. And with twenty different characters to choose from to make up your team, as well as a massive amount of hidden secrets this game has massive replay value.

The explore map is quite similar to FTL, but the combat is a bit more like Blackguards. Then throw in a bit of party management and youve got this game.\n\nAt first things seem a little confusing, but the tutorials help a lot on the combat but not so much on the city screen.

If you like either of those things, I highly recommend it.\n\nThe good:\n- Transparent dice rolls. You're given your exact change to succeed and a breakdown of why you have that chance, along with (most of) the consequences of success or failure.\n- Depth discovery. The tutorial does a good job of introducing you to the main mechanics, but doesn't attempt to give you strategies for winning. You'll understand how to play immediately, but winning strategies will take a few games to really understand on the suggested difficulty.\n- Progression. 4 different resource currencies to spend after every expedition on at least a dozen options each and 5 levels per character with two choices each. There are a massive number of different ways to play even with the same crew.\n- Choices. Most characters can play two of the three styles well, and there are 20 characters across four classes. You get three per game, and while not all combinations are viable, hundreds are. You'll also make meaningful choices at almost every exploration node.\n\nThe bad:\n- Could use more skills. Most of the combat skills are shared with other characters, which somewhat takes away from their uniqueness.\n- Massive final boss difficulty spike. Like FTL, the final area is exponentially harder than anything preceeding it. Unlike FTL, you can win (but not the best way) without going there. I'd still like to see a smoother transition.\n- Typos and grammar mistakes galore. English is clearly not the devs first language, and it really could've used a pass from a native speaker to fix some of the mistakes. You'll always know what they meant, but it can be distracting.\n\nOverall recommended at full price or otherwise. I got my first "win" after 17 hours, but I did it without fighting the final boss and still have half the treasures to find and several captains to unlock. There's way more than $20 of entertainment here.","April 7","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pirates!  Sheep?  Welcome to the world of Renowned Explorers!  I'll start by saying I bought this game on a whim.  I was looking for something fun and challenging, but that wouldn't take a vast amount of time to complete. I would have settled for a "Meh" time killer, but I bought this and now I'm hopelessly addicted.  I can honestly say my first thought after an hour of playing was that I'd gladly pay for any future DLC to expand the game.  And that was after I'd lost five times.  It's a unique game that can be a bit difficult to describe, but rather than just shouting, "I love it!", I'll give it a try.   Basically you start by selecting a team of 3 characters from pools of 4 different types of explorers.  Each explorer is unique (some attacks abilities are repeated but the characters all have their own animations and it goes a long way to giving them the feeling of individual personalities) and has Skills, that effect how they play and their success rate on events that can occur while on an adventure.  After selecting your team, you start working your way through Adventures you want to undertake.  While on Adventures,  you explore locations on the Adventure Map searching for resources (used to upgrade your team) and events.  Events fall into three basic categories:  Adventure Wheel challenges (think The Price is Right), combat instances and story challenges (like choose your own adventure books). Lots of  events contain elements of all three.  Combat is tactical and features a unique system in which attacks are divided into Friendly (charm), Devious (psychological) and Aggressive (physical violence).  This ties into the flavor of your team.  Now at this point, we need to jump back to character selection.  Certain characters complement each other better when teamed together.  I've read some comments criticising the combat system as confusing and certain adventures as too hard.  The truth is, what team you put together determines which expeditions you're best suited to undertake and what tactics are best to use in combat.  *The game gives you all this information, you just need to read it.* When you select your crew, it tells you what types of team (Friendly, Devious or Aggressive) the character works best with.  It even gives examples in the character discription of the types of charcters they'd work well with.  It will even show you the type of team (Friendly, Devious, Aggressive) you're putting together at the top of the team selection screen.  The descriptions of Adventures tell you what type of team or what character skills are best suited for those adventures.  I imagine a lot of those people complaining did what I did at first, which is skim this information and go, "These three look cool together, I'll use them!"  Team Super Awesome may be the coolest looking group of explorers around, but it doesn't mean they'll work that well  together or that they have any hope of  making it out of Transylvannia alive.   This is a roguelike.  I recommend sticking fairly close to the recommended teams until you have the chance to get a feel for the Adventures and different characters.  For the combat system, it's one of my personal favorite things about the game.  You can overwhelm pirates with charm, beat the living daylights out of evil cultists, or even make an ancient goddess cry and run away.  The types of attacks you use (your Atttitude) versus the type of attacks your opponent is using (their Attitude) create a Mood (displayed in the top center of the tactical map) that grants various buffs/debuffs.  As a tip, next to the Mood display are little indicators showing how many of the other types of attacks you can use before your Attitude changes, which changes the Mood.  You can mix and match attacks, managing and manipulating the Mood to your advantage is part of the challenge.  Be aware, the AI can do the same.  Pros:  A wide cast of playable characters that feel like individuals (not just reskinned clones).  A fun art style that goes very well with the game's sense of humour.  The combat system is unique and challenging.  Tons of content and an enormous amount of replayability.  While there is some violence, most of it is slapstick or cartoonish, and  I'd say it's one of the safer games out here for younger players.  It's fun, which I know sounds rather simple, but I can honestly say at no point have I been bored or felt gameplay was tedious.  Stability (I haven't had a single bug or crash).  Cons:  A playthrough only consists of 5 Adventures.  You won't understand why that would qualify as a con until you play it and realize how much you wish you could squeeze in just one more  :)","October 9, 2015","true","127.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

How did they do? Well, in a word, amgyes.\n\nUpon playing this everyone will notice the cleverness, smoothness and fun-ness of it all. When the loading screen animations still crack you up after 20+ times, you know they pulled something off.\n\nThis game is all replay value, to an extent that will make some gamers feel awkward (I may be referring to the type of players who specifically enjoy cinematic RPG's with many cutscenes and after each and every corner go F5, try this, die, F9, try that, die, F9, etc). Replaying this game is integral to the whole experience, and makes you tweak your tactics bit by bit until you have a formula that works well. Because this game is so appetizing and creative, the whole tactical puzzle becomes something wonderful. Instead of "oh snap I died again, NOOOO", it makes one go "oh yeah? well how about I do it THIS way". In any case, as a gamer you're being challenged to be EXPERIMENTAL, and try numerous combinations of tactics until you're beefed up enough to gain special items and level-ups.\n\nThe most bizarre thing is that after Reus, a godgame in an arena devoid of godgames, they have pulled off their magic trick again of creating a game that is so original and flamboyant that it can only become a niche in itself.","October 15, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I think it's because it's a well executed roguelike that finds fun in the format with short well-constructed campaigns. Although I didn’t feel like an explorer that much really, it is a delightfully fresh theme (one can take only so many dungeons), and has a great progression of unlocks and content discovery. I think it has some occasionally troubling representations of the non-Western locales you explore, and I really wish it had taken an approach to the era more like 80 days did. On the other hand, it has a great diverse cast of characters, with more playable women than men (all of whom are awesome).

It’s a fun little premise based on running a team of three explorers through a handful of expeditions to exotic locations (pirate-infested isles, Count Dracula’s castle, the mysterious Shangri-Lai), exploring and gathering rare treasures.  Your time is split basically between three screens – the planning screen where you use the resources you’ve gathered to buy new equipment, unlock scientific advancements to improve your abilities, and gather an entourage of followers to increase the value of future resources.  It’s a nice little balance that allows you to take different approaches in how you improve your team.  Easy to use but requires some time and thought to really master and make the most of your choices.\n\nThe other two screens are the game itself.  The first is a map of the area where you pick what locale on the map to explore, trying to match your characters’ diverse skills to what the region is likely to yield.  IE, don’t send your party of fighters to spots where expertise in engineering or science is needed.  Finally the third, where you’ll spend a bulk of your time, is in the turn-based combat screen in which you resolve encounters according to your characters’ abilities in a kind of fun paper-rock-scissors dynamic that can see a friendly argument rapidly turn into fisticuffs.  The challenge of course being to balance it so that your own characters stay one step ahead of the fight by leveraging the skills their best at.\n\nAltogether it’s a diverse little game that allows for a lot of play-throughs with different teams and styles.   It’s also the rare RPG where skills actually mean something more than just an alternative way to kill enemies.  The right mix of skills on your team can have your characters gathering tremendous amounts of renown (the way the game is scored) while a poorly selected and equipped team may end up just scraping by or eventually outmatched in the later stages.  It’s even possible to go through the game without technically ever getting into a physical fight – defeating enemies purely through the persuasive powers of your speech skill, a real rarity in any kind of adventure game.\n\nI’d say it’s definitely worth a try if anything about the premise appeals to you.  The developers did a pretty excellent job of bringing the world to life and offering something a little different, and they’ve continued to tweak an already well-developed game in response to the community’s wants and suggestions.  And if it’s the art that’s maybe giving you pause, I’d advise you don’t let that dissuade you – it’s actually a pretty nice looking game when it’s running and while the cartoony style fits the sometimes humorous tone, this is a serious game that takes a level of skill and dedication to really master.\n","September 24, 2015","true","113.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

My video impressions review is available here.\n\nClick here to view this review with images.\n\nOverview of the game\nRenowned Explorers by Abbey Games is an adventure strategy game set in a fictitious 19th century where the aim is to become the most famous adventurer! A playthrough in RE consists of your team embarking on 5 expeditions, upgrading your team, and gathering renown to beat your rival, the French clown, Rivaleux.\n\nI’ve played the tutorial twice, and in my second playthrough we were defeated during the final mission. I would expect a playthrough to be between 3 - 5 hours, but this game can be replayed due to randomised encounters and a large variety of ways to adapt your team.\n\nFlow of the game\nA game starts with you picking your team of three characters. Each character has unique skills, traits, abilities, stats. I didn’t pay too much attention to the numbers, but I now understand the implications of skills from playing the game, so would spend more time creating a team that suits my tastes. The great thing the game does is recommend crew members from a given character. There are 20 characters to pick from.\n\nCharacters will affect how well suited the entire crew is for different attitudes, so it is worth explaining the mood system the game uses.\n\nMood and Spirit SystemThe game represents character’s (both friend and foe) health as spirit which symbolises both physical and mental health. When dealing with an encounter, you can defeat an enemy’s spirit by being so friendly that they wish to stop fighting you, or by being devious and upsetting them (essentially destroying their soul), or by standard physical aggressive attacks.\n\nEach character also has an attitude which describes the state of the character. For example, an enemy character might encourage me with a friendly attack that hurts my spirit, but increases my mood to be confident, which gives me a bonus so my next aggressive attack will do 25% more damage.\n\nEach team also has a attitude describing the team’s approach, and can be handled using the rock-paper-scissors approach to exploit weaknesses.\n\nOn top of this (and my favourite feature) is the mood system which describes the battlefield based off you and your enemies actions. The mood changes after one or more strikes from the same attitude reach a certain threshold. Friendly moods are generally more fragile to maintain than devious or aggressive ones. Moods may empower your team, or weaken you.\n\nFor example, if everyone is friendly to each other, you may enter the ‘Pleasant’ mood.\n\nIn this mood, it gives a major boost to physical attacks but only takes one aggressive attack to turn the mood to ‘Brutal’ (if you imagine a group of people encouraging one another and then someone throwing a punch, it would be brutal!). There are about 9 moods in the game, depending on the attitudes of the two teams.\n\nI have found the mood system to be fresh and surprising deep when dealing with encounters, and I’m now finding more creative ways to deal with certain characters.\nWhen you have selected your team you are sent to your first expedition on an island which serves as a tutorial. The tutorial does a great job at covering everything, and is about 30 minutes long (each expedition is generally longer due to the rising difficulty).\n\nYour team has two major resources, resolve and supplies. Run out of supplies and your team with have major issues. Run out of resolve and you lose the game!\n\nYou move around the island, much like a board game, and each ‘stop’ on the map may have different outcomes.\nYou may find some resources\nYou may need to pick a team member to handle a situation (think events in FTL). Each character’s chances are shown for success, and the game does a great job of explaining the breakdown of the chance, plus all the possible outcomes. A dice is rolled for the outcome based off the chances.\nYou may have an encounter (which is their term for a battle).\nEncounters are playing on a grid battlefield (think XCOM) using a variety of skills (each character has an skill for each mood to begin with). Each battle has a dominant attitude (based off the number of attacks you used of each type) which may give you greater rewards or change the way an encounter plays out. For example, if you were dealing with some aggressive locals, being friendly with them might encourage them to spread the word about you afterwards.\n\nAs you move around the map you gather tokens that are cashed in for certain resources after the mission. There are also extra special tokens which give bigger bonuses. These resources are:\nGold - Which is used to buy items in shops.\nStatus (reputation) - Which is used to acquire an Entourage, which can give your team bonuses (like more resources from tokens). Also used to upgrade shops.\nResearch - Used to unlock technologies (similar approach is the Policy tree in Civilization V).\nInsight - Used to get more of the above resources.\nAfter completing an expedition, you are returned to the world map where you can spend your resources, upgrade your crew, and gain your bearings for the next expedition. Different stores are available to spend your resources, and new stores are added depending on which expeditions are taken.\n\nThere are still a few other mechanics (like character leveling) but I believe this highlights all major features of the game.\n\nWhy I enjoy this gameI have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game, here are a collection of my thoughts on why:\n\n- The game is very satisfying, as you built up your massive collection of tokens on your expedition to cash in later. It helps you feel like you have achieved something on your quest.\n- The game universe is fun and creative (think Indiana Jones + Tintin).\n- Beautiful artwork for a very diverse set of characters and locations.\n- Nice music to set the scene.\n- It seems impossible to unlock everything in one playthrough. For example, I only unlocked 8 out of 36 possible research items, so there are many strategies to try.\n- Variety of expedition locations to take, with it’s events being procedurally generated. You probably could visit all the locations in 2 - 3 playthroughs, but it’s nice to see it’s not the same places every time.\n- Game can be played with save/load states, or in ironman mode where all decisions are final.\n- Game has great help♥♥♥♥♥♥ence guide.\n\nThings that may be disappointing\n- It can be frustrating if all your random rolls fail (but there are upgrades to help this).\n- Mood system can take a while to figure out (but it's worth it).\n- Each location is essentially the same if you strip away it’s character. Though I do feel like that character is enough to make each location interesting and different (think how in FTL that sectors were different types, and while they were basically the same it does still influence your decisions and the situations you encounter there).\n- Some simple UI features missing, like end turn once all characters have taken their actions.\n- A playthrough can be quite short at 3 - 5 hours.\n\nOverall impressions\nI was thoroughly impressed with Renowned Explorers. It has been great fun to play, and surprising with how easy it was to get into, but also contain a lot of depth at the same time. Also it is great value for it’s release price if the game interests you. A solid 4 out of 5 stars from me (possibly 4 ½ with more playtime and UI fixes).\n\n★★★★☆\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, you can tweet me on Twitter at @JackAttackNZ","September 8, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I absolutely and completely enjoy the concept of picking a team of explorers and going out exploring the world trying to discover as many secrets of the world as I can before the most renowned explorer award is given, trying to out due the pompous arch-rival, Matthieu Rivaleux. This game is very much like a board game in its systems, and that is a great thing. It tells you for the most part a different story each time you play given the different makeup of the team you put together and the semi-random elements of the location map.\nThe graphics are made of the typical Abbey Games design of very colorful, playful 2D graphics. There is a lot of character put into the drawings and combat aminations. It would have been nice for the graphics to have a little more animation besides the very fun and personable nature of the animations during encounters, but that is a very small criticism to the overall package.  The graphic design is outstanding, it is clean and clear what you should be doing with all the information the game can throw at you in its tooltips as well as a very subtle color coded system based on the different moods. The music matches the game perfectly being exciting and fun.\nThere is no voice acting which can make one feel a little lonely on these adventures, but again the rest of the game quickly makes you forget you are sitting in front of a computer. The rest of the sound effects are standard click feedback, nothing special but done well so you don’t notice them; which should be the praise for click feedback sounds.\nThe gameplay is really what makes this game standout for me. There are two main phases of the game; The World Map is where you buy upgrades and equipment to prepare for you next adventure, and the Location Map where the other half of the game spends most of its time.\nThe World Map gives you different locations(shops) to go around and spend your different tokens you have gained in your last adventure. You have research from your study tokens that works like a standard tech tree in most other games, giving you bonuses that lets you specialize and get more tokens and supplies so you can explore more efficiently and longer. You can also spend renown to gain tokens based on what city and character you have (I would recommend doing this first before spending any tokens but after you spend your research). You can then spend status tokens to buy helpers that will make those tokens worth a bit more. Finally, you want to spend your gold on items to improve your characters. After you finish with all of your upgrading you pick your next destination based on the one you think you can handle then rinse and repeat until hopefully you complete the four trips to complete the game or you run out of resolve and lose.\nThe other half of the game involves going on adventures. These happen in two parts, the location map where you run into narrative effects collecting tokens, gold or taking part in encounters, where the interesting part of the game takes place. The map events are often reading the event then choosing what to do next. Most of the choices are based on what skills the event is looking for and how good a character you have is at it. The game gives you all the information you need to make a good decision including the percentage chance of success along with what you might get and what may happen if you fail. Most of the time it’s an easy choice, other times do you really want to risk a resolve on a 50% roll?\nThe encounters take you to a strategy combat map, where you move your characters around and choose an attack for them to use on enemies. The attacks are mostly linked to one of the three different moods in the game; aggressive, devious, and friendly. There are bonuses linked to if you win the encounter by keeping the overall mood to one of these. But you also need to keep in mind that each character is good at curtain moods while being weak in others. There is also a paper, rock, scissors kind of thing going on with each character’s mood that can weaken or strengthen their play. I’m slightly mixed with this part of the game, I understand this allows the “non-combat” characters to be useful in battle and sometimes even better if going against curtain enemies. It makes sense but requires you to stop trying to make sense of a battle that is emulating diplomatic conversations; it’s the weakest of the gameplay, but it’s still good.\nThat is the gameplay overall, it’s a great game in my opinion. It’s fast and has plenty of meaningful decisions with a good level of difficulty with the high score “good” winning condition. There are plenty of characters and enough locations and events to keep you playing for some time before it might become a bit repetitive (good thing there is an expansion in the works!).\n\nStory/Theme – For me it’s an outstanding theme with a good story that keeps me interested through multiple playthroughs.\nGraphics – Very attractive graphic style that is playful and sets up the rest of the game beautifully.\nSound/Music – Great music, gets you in the mood, but not much else.\nGameplay – Great mix of menu driven adventure with a mix of strategic battles.\nPros – Theme and Graphics\nCons – Battles could use a bit more work\n\nShould you buy it? – Yes, for the price you will easily get your money worth.\n","May 24","true","11.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

This game is not the most complex, but its fun. This game takes a genre I love (pulp adventure and exploration, like the RPG's Spirit of the Century and Hollow Earth Expedition) and turns it into a short and heavily replayable strategy game for the ages.\n\nPros: The characters: While this game may not have a Bioware dialogue tree, this game still gives each of the possible party members a unique personality. The moves, the skills, the speech bubbles all give each character a different feel and a different strategy going in.\nThe comedy: Your rivals are as over the top as Gaston. Your characters get into rediculous situations where you have to going into a conflict because the locals are too friendly, or where you accidentally drop a safe from a treehouse. Even the expressions can be funny.\nThe Replayablity: Why not try a different location? A different party? A different strategy? Get different treasures this time? There are a lot fo reasons to replay the game.\n\nCons: Minor gameplay issues: Sometimes movement grids don't show up until you start and cancel an attack. Sometimes targeting can be misjudged by a few pixels (an issue even Shadowrun has). Its unfortunate, but doesn't always ruin the gameplay.\nAchievement Hunters: As much as I love the stories that can be told with this game, one of the major calls of this game is the achievements. Complete the game with a certain personality, complete the game with every character as a leader, get a bunch of treasures, do it all on iron man mode. If that's not your thing, you might not get as much enjoyment from this game.","December 9, 2015","true","56.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Set in a 19th century vaguely steampunkish setting, the world has a lot of charisma and each expedition stage has its own quirks and charms.  I especially enjoyed the wide variety of crew members and I hope one of the things the developers release is more of them, as they add a real splash of color to the proceedings, especially as you realize that each explorer has hidden traits and abilities as well.\n\nThe goal is to become the most renowned explorer in the world, racing against a rival and his own crew of explorers.  You gain renown by, well, exploring and the fun is deciding what path you will take to both explore and to deal with the variety of challenges before you.  There are both choose-your-own-adventure moments, the random outcomes decided by the Adventure Wheel and influenced by the skills and stats of your explorers (sometimes also with those hidden character influences coming up), and tactical encounters.  Though simpler than something like the X-COM games, it still has engaging strategin elements, helped along by the emotion and three-part attitude systems.\n\nConflicts can be resolved by Agressive (straight up combat), Devious (trickery or intimidation), or by Friendly (diplomacy and enthusiasm) means.  Resolving encounters with different attitudes leads to different rewards, told to you on the battle screen.  Also, the emotions of characters can shift through different states, both positive and negative, each with added buffs and debuffs based on the emotion.  Performing repeated actions of a particular attiude can shift the overall attitude of the battle, which ALSO has a variety of buffs and debuffs.  Even blending some of one attitude during a round can shift the attitude to a different style of the current one.  There's a lot to discover and understand here, especially early on.\n\nWhile I love the encounter system, it does have its flaws.  My biggest gripe is that there is only one 'health bar', Spirit, meaning that all forms of influence take from that bar.  It's not usually a problem, but it feels just a little off that both insults and gunfire do the same harm and are healed the same way.  When it comes to the Adventure Wheel, it can be a bit rough early on, especially as you are learning the system and the kinds of challenges, and sometimes the rogue-lite elements can bite you on the ♥♥♥, throwing you into hard-to-handle situations just because of the arrangement of an expedition.\n\nOverall, though, I greatly enjoy the game and look forward to many more playthroughs.  So many more teams to try and Captains to unlock!\n\nPros:\n+ Interesting tactical encounter system\n+ Bright and colorful art style\n+ Charismatic cast of playable characters and plenty of things to unlock\n+ Rogue-lite elements lead to lots of variety in playthroughs\n+ Variety of expeditions to undertake, multiplied by the rogue-lite elements\n\nCons\n- One health bar for all kinds of attacks feels funny\n- Rogue-lite elements sometimes bite you on the ♥♥♥\n- Might be a bit overwhelming at first to completely grasp the emotion/attitude systems\n\n","October 25, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game was solid, but far too random, frustrating, and unrewarding an experience for me to recommend.\n\nRenowned Explorers is, in my opinion, FTL done right.  Instead of space, you are in the age of exploration with a crew of allies looking for treasure all around the world, so if that setting doesn't do it for you, I don't blame you for giving the game a pass, but everything else is great.  It's a turn based tactical combat game focusing on using both strength and speech to win the day, with the option to hit, insult, or chat with enemies to win them over to your side, each with benefits and drawbacks.  Say, you meet a nasty pirate captain.  Maybe, after you talk nice to him and win him over, he decides to go with you as a lobbyist, to bolster your rep...or maybe you pound him into the dirt and turn him in for an extra bounty...different solutions lead to different outcomes here.\n\nAlongside the interesting combat mechanics, the game uses a spinner to determine success in many randomly generated actions, such as studying plants, climbing perilous cliffs, searching for treasure, dashing out of a collapsing tomb, etc. and this spinner uses your inherent % for success to give you a visual representation for these challenges, which is much more satisfying than a basic pass/fail.\n\nYou begin the game choosing a team of 3 explorers out of a total of 20, with one captain and two subordinates.  The captain perks and the synergy with certain people allow for some really interesting ways to play and combinations and this is aided further by a robust upgrade system which gives bonuses for research, which can affect all or some of your crew.\n\nOverall, what I love most about this game though is how approachable it is.  FTL has a cripplingly high difficulty at times, making it easy for anyone to give up on it in frustration.  Explorers though, has multiple difficulty settings, each scaling well and allowing you to cater your experience, along with two modes, one which lets you retry encounters you fail and another which ends your game, allowing for another layer of challenge.  I feel in control when I play.  And while I haven't been Classic difficulty, which is on par with FTL, normal has been very good to me.  This is a game which, when jacked up in challenge, will make hardcore min maxers cry, but when played on easy or normal is easily approachable by kids or families.  It's a game which I think suits all ages, especially with the charming art style.\n\nExplorers is, in my opinion, a great game.  It's fun and approachable, has a lot of variety, and there's many teams to try out and treasures to collect, with the devs adding new, free expeditions to go through all the time.  This game rocks.  Give it a look.","November 2, 2015","true","20.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Renowned Explorers is the type of game that's a little tough to pick up because you need to learn what you're doing or you won't get far. Once you get in the saddle the game kicks off with great plots,  annoying   lovable    pyschotic  eccentric, individuals, and the general desire to bodily harm a rude frenchman.\n\nThe game's still in development, so while there is a good chunk of things to do it feels like a few things are missing. But there is enough content for people to spend dozens of hours trying to find ALL the events, secrets, captains, reactions, and more. Combat itself can be tough. There's only a few ways to effectivley heal and sometimes I want to bang my head against a wall when my party gets wiped out AGAIN. And on some expeditions everything goes wrong and if you don't plan things out, you will lose the boss fight, and any chance at regognition for sure. But there's nothing like the sound of sweet sweet loot, glory, and achivement to make up for it.

The gameplay is engaging, highlights being the exploration of the different areas. It can sometimes be difficult, but the more you play it, the easier it gets imo. The sound design is great, love the atmospheric sound in the stages and the goofy sounds that the characters make. Seems to have quite a lot of replayability to it with the team customization and with the unlocking of other characters as captains.\n\nThough, I do have a slight issues with this game.\n\nWhile the visuals are good, they, in combat, look a bit too blurry and have barely any detail. I also think the sprite animations need a few more frames during the attacks to make it a bit smoother, and maybe add a reaction to the characters/enemies being damaged when attacked. I also noticed that there was no sound to the mummies attack. Tiny issues, but they do make a difference.\n\nBesides those slight problems, I ran into a few glitches. One where my character attacked the enemy, went the other way (away from the enemy, not towards it) and attacked. Then there was some random lines of codes popping up on my screen after I had made a purchase in one of the stores.\n","October 22, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Renowned Explorers is the type of game that's a little tough to pick up because you need to learn what you're doing or you won't get far. Once you get in the saddle the game kicks off with great plots,  annoying   lovable    pyschotic  eccentric, individuals, and the general desire to bodily harm a rude frenchman.\n\nThe game's still in development, so while there is a good chunk of things to do it feels like a few things are missing. But there is enough content for people to spend dozens of hours trying to find ALL the events, secrets, captains, reactions, and more. Combat itself can be tough. There's only a few ways to effectivley heal and sometimes I want to bang my head against a wall when my party gets wiped out AGAIN. And on some expeditions everything goes wrong and if you don't plan things out, you will lose the boss fight, and any chance at regognition for sure. But there's nothing like the sound of sweet sweet loot, glory, and achivement to make up for it.

You have 3 options as to how you handle encounters: You can be Agressive, Friendly or Devious. These work in a rock paper scissors style system. As you complete these expeditions you find different types of currency, which can be spent on upgrading your crew in various ways. The in-game tutorials do an excellent job of explaining this to you, and prevent any confusion you may have at first.\nThe encounters themselves are fun and unique, even if you play through the same encounters again and again they always go a little differently, though they can be a a little cheap (and borderline unfair) at times (I'm looking at you, Vladimir). Unfortunately there are very little encounters currently in the game, so you WILL be playing the same ones again and again.\nOverall I'd say it's an excellent game and well worth the price, with frequent updates adding more content. If you're at all interested in strategy or turn based combat I'd say this game is a must-have, as it's a nice blend of combat and RNG (generally to determine how many resources you manage to gather) with a lot of replayability and quirky, interesting and  generally adorable characters.\nI highly reccomend it and would give it a 9/10.","October 10, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game consists of short, challenging play-throughs that build familiarity with the game levels and concepts. As you improve, the game provides re-playability through selection of different combinations of party members and/or attempts to refine your strategy for high score. Not only is the game already fun, but the developers are very active in the steam community to fix bugs and implement suggestions for improvement.\n\nRead on for a description of the game play elements.\n\nParty Selection: The first challenge is picking a captain and two crew members from a selection of 12 characters with a variety of strengths and weaknesses. The characters are divided into 4 classes, each with 2 of 9 traits, a variety of attacks, and semi-hidden personality traits with hints in the character description. The game provides plenty of advice for selecting your team, including description of a character’s strengths and weaknesses, recommended party members, and symbols for a party’s relative strength in each of the three offensive areas – allowing you to quickly select a balanced or specialized party. There is plenty to appeal to min-maxers, challenge runs, or leisure players that just want to select a quick party and go exploring.\n\nExpeditions: After choosing a party you are cast into your 1st of 5 expeditions, in which you explore a location for resources (gold, campaign and research) and renown (victory points). The map shows the location of the final boss and a couple of nearby locations. Each location gives a hint of the challenges and rewards you may find. Some spaces give rewards automatically, some required the roll on a an adventure wheel, where your chance of success is determined by your party’s class, traits and stats. Some challenges provide an opportunity to avoid the roll for a lesser reward, others impose penalties for failure, including a loss of resolve (game over at 0). Your goal is to choose the route that will provide the most reward on the way to the final boss. You can take as long a path as you like, but if you run out of supplies, your team starts suffering stat penalties.\n\nEncounters: Encounters are brief tactical combats that occur during expeditions. During combat, your characters can use aggressive attacks (physical), devious speech (insults) or friendly speech (compliments) to reduce your opponents’ spirit (hit points). Speech abilities also have 4 debuffs and 2 buffs (friendly speech) that can be applied to a target. Friendly abilities can be used on your own party to heal or remove debuffs. The debuffs/buffs only apply when a character has a positive or negative state of mind, which can be manipulated through use of devious or friendly speech. Also, using aggressive, devious, or friendly abilities will affect the mood of which is how the enemy perceives your actions. The enemy also has its own mood showing their preferred method of attack. The game applies bonuses in a RPS format based on your and your opponents’ mood, where aggressive > friendly > devious > aggressive. If your mood matches your opponent, you receive a bonus to abilities in the superior mood. If your mood is superior to your opponent, you receive a defensive bonus. If your mood is inferior, you receive a defensive penalty. If your characters die in combat, you lose one resolve. Characters can also be revived in lieu of attacking your opponents.\n\nPreparation: After each successful expedition, you are given the chance to spend your resources to improve your characters. Research can be spent to improve your ability to earn rewards, or to make combat easier. Campaign is used to upgrade your shops or hire an entourage, which can improve the value of future reward tokens or increase the number of reward tokens you receive for certain events. Gold is spent on items. Each character can hold one offensive item, one defensive item and one trinket that provides unique bonuses. Will you buy quality armor for a single character, or spread the wealth for small improvements for all of your characters? Finding treasure during expeditions also earns insight, which can be spent during preparation to earn more research, campaign, or gold tokens – you decide.\n\nEnding the Game: You win the game if you successfully complete 5 expeditions AND finish with more renown than your arch rival. You lose if your party is wiped out during combat, loses all of its resolve during expedition or combat, or if you complete 5 expeditions but don’t earn enough renown to be the top explorer.\n\nIf you like strategy and tactics, this game is for you.\n","October 12, 2015","true","97.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Easily worth $20 if you like rogue-lite and tactical combat. If you get it for less than that it's a no-brainer. After nearly a hundred hours played, I want to write my first-ever Steam review to hopefully make a few more people aware it's out there.\n\nWhile the artwork makes Renowned Explorers look cutesy and light, it's really anything but. There's an impressive amount of depth here, and on many levels. I love the tactical challenges of games like xcom and Invisible, inc. (which was previously my favorite game of the year). This game is in many ways similar to those games but I think it's quite possibly better.\n\nIn the beginning you put together a team of three explorers and then guide them through a series of perilous expeditions spent hunting for treasure. The expeditions are made up of a series of (usually optional) stat rolls for in-game currency, fame and research, along with combat encounters that also reward you. The stat rolls are nerve-wracking and sometimes you have to make the choice to gamble your entire game on a roll.\n\nThe combat is a modified rock-paper-scissors style where you have to control which abilities you use based on enemy weaknesses, range of abilities and overall "mood," which will give combat-wide buffs or debuffs based on the past series of moves you've used. You can get by in the beginning based on the tutorial info but once you've put in maybe 30-40 hours in the game you really start to master the depth and can use things like delayed starts to combat, stacked AoEs and predictive shop buys to get items for specific encounters in advance that can really sway battles in a huge way.\n\nThe Abbey games team is also doing one of the best jobs I've seen of offering regular updates that reinforce the diversity of options while adding content and balancing existing strategies. They added an entire new encounter with the completely free Mali DLC and just today released a modification to captain perks that were previously merely passable. Now they're interesting and powerful. They also post regularly to discussions in the steam forums.\n\nThere are a few bugs that pop up with new content from time to time but they get stomped out pretty quickly and with the speed and regularity of updates I can't complain.\n\nI'll probably try and buy their previous game Reus too, just because I love this one so much.\n\n10/10 favorite game of the year.","November 12, 2015","true","161.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However, the characters have a lot of overlap in abilities and the available equipment is constant across runs, leading to very few distinct-feeling characters. And one of the three characters in your party has to either be one of the 5 starting captains or a character that you have already used a lot. Still, there's enough variety to keep things interesting at the start.\n\nThe combat works in emotions and diplomacy in addition to violence, which is interesting and innovative at first. Ultimately, though, it's just a rock-paper-scissors elemental system by another name. It's also frustrating that each character has one style of combat that they suck at, meaning that you're essentially playing rock-scissors and just having to grind things out whenever your enemy picks rock. The splash-damage abilities are a little disappointing, too. Since regular attacks often one-shot weak enemies, a splash attack that hits multiple enemies for a third of their health is frequently useless. Once the novelty of winning a battle with kindness or insults wears off, what's left behind is underwhelming.\n\nThere are actually very few adventure paths in this game. You get one of three random ones at the start, then three new options open up (same each game), then three new ones (same each game), then two more (same each game), then one more (again, same each game), and that's it. The unique treasures, events, and dialogues are quite cool. That is, of course, until you discover that they aren't unique. You get the same ones each time, on each adventure, on each run-through.\n\nI guess I'm being pretty negative about the game. And there's a good bit to be negative about. But that's only because I've played it too much. The game is great when you first start playing, and will remain great if you have the sense to stop. Buy this on sale, run through each of the adventures once, and never touch it again. You'll have good memories of a novelty game that didn't overstay its welcome.","January 5","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, the characters have a lot of overlap in abilities and the available equipment is constant across runs, leading to very few distinct-feeling characters. And one of the three characters in your party has to either be one of the 5 starting captains or a character that you have already used a lot. Still, there's enough variety to keep things interesting at the start.\n\nThe combat works in emotions and diplomacy in addition to violence, which is interesting and innovative at first. Ultimately, though, it's just a rock-paper-scissors elemental system by another name. It's also frustrating that each character has one style of combat that they suck at, meaning that you're essentially playing rock-scissors and just having to grind things out whenever your enemy picks rock. The splash-damage abilities are a little disappointing, too. Since regular attacks often one-shot weak enemies, a splash attack that hits multiple enemies for a third of their health is frequently useless. Once the novelty of winning a battle with kindness or insults wears off, what's left behind is underwhelming.\n\nThere are actually very few adventure paths in this game. You get one of three random ones at the start, then three new options open up (same each game), then three new ones (same each game), then two more (same each game), then one more (again, same each game), and that's it. The unique treasures, events, and dialogues are quite cool. That is, of course, until you discover that they aren't unique. You get the same ones each time, on each adventure, on each run-through.\n\nI guess I'm being pretty negative about the game. And there's a good bit to be negative about. But that's only because I've played it too much. The game is great when you first start playing, and will remain great if you have the sense to stop. Buy this on sale, run through each of the adventures once, and never touch it again. You'll have good memories of a novelty game that didn't overstay its welcome.","January 5","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Luckily I got it on sale, but even at half off retail I think I paid too much and am disappointed.)\n\nThis game has a lot going for it, but it's terribly important to know certain things about it before spending money on it.  With that in mind, I'm putting the CONS list first.\n\nCONS:\n... Staggeringly short.  I tend to take my time, but in less than 10 hours I've started four playthroughs and beaten the game twice on the standard difficulty (classic difficulty, no saves, permadeath).  You get to go on 5 expeditions, most of which are limited by supplies to about 10-12 moves.  (I'm generalizing; there are ways to make individual expeditions last SLIGHTLY longer.)  The first of the five is chosen for you, and is also shorter than the rest (about 7 moves).\n... Repetitive.  There are very few expedition options.  They prompt you what sort of things you can expect to face and find, and it frequently happens that there are no good options for a party's strengths or an expedition's needs.  Also, while each one is partially randomized, the draw pool is small and I got the same "random" scenarios multiple times.  The network of possible moves changes, the rewards change, but the bulk of each expedition stays the same each playthrough.\n... Limited.  You pick three explorers from the provided 20.  There's a degree of diversity between them, but most of it is in hidden features that may or may not even matter.  (My wrestler was devout, which mattered in exactly one conversation option.)  My friendly gold obsessed party with the Scout captain was functionally identical to my aggressive research obsessed party with the Scientist captain.  There are obvious gaps, like characters who are glass cannons and fit in a certain sort of party, but without sturdy characters to defend them who also fit in that sort of party.  Each character has a couple of options in encounters, but it's pretty common for disimilar characters to have exactly the same attacks, so everyone plays pretty close to the same.  Each character can also be upgraded slightly (you get one of two options at each level, and I commonly finished with character at level 4), but a lot of the options are minor and there's no way to level up in the field.  There's a research tree with six small branches, but you can only choose from two of them at first, so most of the "options" won't have time to affect much, assuming you devote enough time to Research to unlock any of them at all.  There's equipment to buy, and its very important, but there aren't real choices about it, so gold is mostly the illusion of a mechanic.  There are followers to hire, but they do minor things that you may not even notice unless you invest a lot in them, at which point they only provide their marginal effect on your last expedition.  In short, so much of the game felt like discovering that a lake is really a puddle.  It's broad and looks refreshing, but it's too shallow to do much in.\n...Vague.  A lot of information could be useful, but isn't available anywhere.  Monster attacks are the most typical example of this.  Fights involve a lot of splashy (and whimsical) pictures that mean nearly nothing, combined with wildly unpredictable attack strength and a bevy of ignorably irrelevant status effects.  Perks are similar.  It isn't uncommon that you'll get to choose new perks, not knowing if or how those perks will help you.  My favorite is choosing between two perks of the same type, each with a stylish but vapid name.  How are they different?  They probably aren't.\n\nPROS:\n... Interesting concept implemented well.  I really liked the entire exploration idea, and the game is built on it from top to bottom.  Everything works together to point back to that central conceit: stepping out on adventures into the mysterious unknown.\n... Interesting mechanics.  The game has some really unique combat mechanics--(attack types, approach types, moods, feelings)--which are challenging but rewarding to manage.  The best of these is the encounter outcomes, trying to resolve an encounter in a friendly, devious, or aggressive manner to achieve different rewards.\n... Solid platform.  I haven't encountered a single bug.\n... Whimsical atmosphere.  Everything from the art design to the quests is pretty lighthearted.\n\n","June 5","false","14.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. There are a lot of neat concepts but the combination of which doesn't really work. This is due to the huge dependency on dice rolls rather than mini-games and the end product just wasn't satisfying to play. I think the randomness of dice rolls in getting loot, and just plain getting stuff done was too frustrating. Even the starting map is random and there are definitely way better ones to start with than others.\n\nThe character, captain bonuses, and skills are also very poorly balanced so you can end up with some very crappy teams on maps that don't use any of your relevant skills even though the vague descriptions imply they do.\n\nThe battles are also sometimes very unfair with huge neverending waves of enemies. The battle map, obstacles, and starting positions are also completely random so getting a good or bad start can make or break your battle.\n\nI feel like there are a lot of good cocepts here but they took away too much player choice with the design. This feels less like a strattegic game and more like dice roll gambling on most everything. I think this game would be a lot more fun if players got more choice in choosing loot, mini-games affecting events, and battle positions. Right now, it's not really fun to just watch bad stuff happen to your team due to bad RNG.","January 7","false","35.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","3"

Looks simplistic at first glance, but the combat mechanics are a little deeper. The rock-paper-scissors thing is nothing new, but its interesting to see how they interperet it as aggression-trickery-niceness (and sometimes funny. Attacked by wolves? Scaring them works pretty well, but its far funnier and just as effective to make them SAD They leave and state they just want to be alone. You couldve just killed the wolves, but no, you made them need THERAPY). True one has an advantage over the other, but they have effects based on whats actually being done, which in turn is affected by what party members you went with. The reward for each approach can be different as well, not just affecting the story but your loot tokens recieved. The buff/debuff based on your party's tactics can be helpful or annoying, but nonetheless can swing the battle either way. However it does mean you have to coordinate your team's tactics, since if you use a different tactic too much it will switch to that buff/debuff, but if you use a tactic that matches the current battle mood the counter resets, so it can be managed.\n\nBut every stat has tooltips if you hover over them and there are clearly displayed meters for the tactic switching, all the information you could want is on screen during battle and you're given percentages for success on non-combat choices. You'll probably still fail your first expedition, but it's pretty easy to find out why and there's loads more team combinations to try.\n\nChoices given to you in the story are relatively interesting, even if the results sometimes aren't *You impress the villagers.* "Wow! You're so great!" .....yeah it mustve taken them a whole day to write that exchange. On the other hand, some do give you a tough choice and interesting things to discover, if not an explanation as to why. Stole painting, painting makes my party member more devious, activating a debuff until the expedition is over, but I somehow wrest the painting away and sell it later for loot. Dunno why it happened, how I got the painting away from them or why we sold a mind-altering artifact with zero consequences, but whatever.\n\nSo there's some ups and downs, but most of it is pretty interesting. I was just gonna do one expedition to give the game a shot and according to Steam I've nearly played five hours. Several teambuilds and expeditions later and I'm still playing. Make of that what you will.\n\nI do wish the tactical elements came into play more or were better defined. Flank and Shank is a nice ability, too bad it's sometimes hard to tell who's being flanked at first because of the strange pentagonal spaces. I also wish some of the character's personalities showed up more in the decision results, but it seems to be the same for whatever role the person fufilled.\n\nI mean Molly the austrialian scout has it in her bio that she got in trouble for offending people with off-color language, it'd be a nice touch to add some sort of dialect based cursing. Or have other character's cut her off mid-sentence and force her to put loot tokens in the swear jar. Just a little more personailty on display would make this a bit more fun.","September 3, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Well after 30 some hours of entertainment I have to agree with TB that this is a really great game with an amazing amount of combat depth.

I'll start you guys off with a quick and dirty comparison and then go into the nitty-gritty later.\n\ntl;dr- This game is FTL meets Fire Emblem and it rocks.\n\nI feel like a lot of strategy games get into the pitfall of bogging the game down with turns that take far too long. This game keeps everything short and sweet- combat encounters are usually resolved in 3-4 turns, while individual maps can be done in 10-20 minutes. Usually a session of the game lasts about an hour if you make it all the way through to the end.\n\nI've been playing through with some of the recommended adventurers, but as I'm getting more of a feel for the weapon triangle I'm more excited to play more groups with different characters (and try for achievements like winning with a group of all scientists and the like.) and trying out some of the more tougher captains (Ivan and Molly have been tough to get runs through.)\n\nThe rules and mechanics are simple enough to understand while being diverse enough to keep things interesting and adding variety to the strategies you employ.\n\nThat all being said, the game does suffer from a lack of content. The difficulty and randomization do a lot to curb that. Over time I can imagine the game getting better due to more options for players going on a certain build path, but as it is right now I find myself replaying for self-imposed challenges rather than discovering new content.\n\nA+++ would buy again.","November 1, 2015","true","38.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The Friendly/Devious/Aggressive system of resolution is interesting in theory but the execution leaves a lot to be desired, since their end effects are hardly distinguishable. Moving around in each campaign feels less like exploration and more like playing a slot machine with a very limited number of quarters. It often does not feel like you have very much control over how much of the game's victory point resource you get, and so ultimately it comes down more to luck than anything else whether you can even approach winning or not. The music and encounters are extremely repetitive after a few playthroughs, with enemy types, map types, and win conditions having little to no variation.","April 10","false","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/296970/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].\nThere is treasure somewhere on this island, I am certain of it, and my team of would-be explorers is determined to find it. But getting to it will not be that easy and there are surprises around every turn. As we make our way through the jungle, we encounter a group of monkeys being berated by another, rather mean group of monkeys led by a peculiar blue monkey. We could simply ignore the incident and be on our way, but that is not who we are. We decide to step in and a fight ensues. The blue monkey is relentless in slinging insults towards us, which depletes our spirit and makes us want to run away in tears, but we persevere. We could beat them up or be mean to them in return in order to teach them a lesson, but we decide on a different approach. We are being super nice to them, which catches them off-guard and convinces them that we are pretty cool people. Both groups of monkeys end up being influenced by our friendly approach.\n\nThis is the kind of decision-making that permeates throughout Renowned Explorers: International Society, a vibrant and entertaining mash-up of various genres, including adventure, turn-based strategy, and role-playing. You begin by making a party of three explorers, each with their own unique abilities. Some are friendly diplomats, some are aggressive warriors, whereas others are devious scientists. There are a lot more characters to choose from with a nice amount of variety in traits and abilities. Once you choose your party, you set out to explore exotic locations around the world in an effort to become the most renowned international explorer. Each location acts as its own separate expedition on which you can gather gold, status, research, and insight. After a successful expedition, you return to your headquarters in London and spend the accrued resources on equipment that increases your stats, entourage that enables you to collect more resources, and technologies that give you an edge on the following expeditions.\n\nYou can usually choose between two new locations to serve as your next expedition. Once you arrive, you will be presented with a point of interest. How you get there is up to you. You travel from point to point on a small map. Most points will provide a short story, some resources, or an encounter as described in the opening paragraph. Depending on your crew and the challenge, you will usually be able to choose from a variety of options. Chances of success will depend on the traits of your characters. The outcome will be determined on the adventure wheel (like the one on The Price Is Right). For example, you may choose to break down a door with a fighter or talk your way in with a diplomat. The more advanced your character is in a particular trait, the higher are the chances of success.\n\nThere will be times when you’ll be able to get out of a fight, but sometimes that will simply not be possible. Battles take place on hex-based grids. Renowned Explorers uses a very interesting combat system, which enables you to be friendly, devious, or aggressive to beat your foes. This acts as a sort of rock-paper-scissors system. Friendly is very effective against devious, devious against aggressive, and aggressive against friendly. But the opposite is true as well. For example, being aggressive against devious will either penalize your team or provide bonuses to the enemy. But if both parties use the same attacks, there will be no bonuses or penalties for anyone. All characters can use a combination of two attacks, never three. The combat system is definitely interesting and entertaining (a battle between your devious crew and a herd of super friendly sheep can be pretty funny), but it’s not particularly deep.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to become the top explorer, and beat your rival Riveleux to the top spot. You have five expeditions to gather as much renown as possible. After that, that particular playthrough will end whether you have managed to beat him or not. The adventure mode features rogue-like elements. If you lose all of your characters in battle, it’s game over. If you lose just one or two, you can still win the battle and carry on (you also have the ability to revive them in battle), but you lose resolve every time a character goes down. If your resolve drops down to zero, it’s game over. You can sometimes also lose resolve on the adventure wheel. If you’re not into rogue-likes, there is a separate mode where you can save the game anywhere you want. The game is designed to be replayed over and over again using different play styles. It is also not possible to see all locations in a single playthrough. There are 11 locations in the game, but their map layout is procedurally generated, which adds a level of unpredictability during exploration, even if it is a location that you have already visited on previous playthroughs.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society uses a very nice, colorful art style and a charming, lighthearted way of storytelling. This approach gives it quite a bit of personality and simply makes it a joy to play and experience. On the other hand, the soundtrack and sound effects are not particularly involving and don’t stand out in any way. I felt as if the same exact tune just kept looping over and over. Also, the game does not do enough in order to explain its systems very well. In the beginning, it all seems pretty convoluted and it takes a while to figure out the systems in place. The biggest issue with this game is that the design perhaps isn’t strong enough to support many playthroughs, which is what rogue-likes strive for. After you’ve tried out all three play styles and seen all the locations (of which there are not that many), there is simply not that much incentive to go on. I also think that the combat system, while unique and fun, is not deep enough to keep you engaged once the novelty wears off.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for something a bit different. It successfully manages to combine gameplay elements from several genres into a single, cohesive whole. It is a colorful, lighthearted romp that feels like a mash-up of Monkey Island and XCOM, which is definitely worth playing, in my opinion. However, it does not quite deliver the depth and replay value synonymous with the best rogue-likes out there.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)","November 15, 2015","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And I have had tremendous fun with it. I have only played in the brutal "no reload" difficulty, and I have refused to reload, despite dying nearly constantly with every step up in difficulty. I can now succeed three star missions roughly 1/2 the time, and I have yet to succeed at the most difficult of the missions. As a result, my highest ranking after the missions so far is 3rd.\n\nSome players complain about the fact that enemy reinforcements "appear randomly", and that does make the game more difficult, but if you have played some seriously difficult tactical RPGs, this is nothing new to you. If you haven't, then you can count this among the difficult tactical RPGs. If there's a way to avoid a fight, even if it's just a 5% chance, you take it, because fighting is hard in almost all cases.\n\nThe best part of the game is assembling your team. You start with four possible Captains, and by recruiting other folks onto your team, you can unlock them as possible Captains, assuming you can make it past two missions alive. (The tutorial mission counts.) Speaking of the tutorial, this is a big negative for me. The game has no manual, and the tutorial is very incomplete. You can read up more on how things work as you go, but you'll be assembling your first team of explorers with absolutely no clue as to what anything writen means. If you play on the ironman difficulty, you will almost certainly lose on your first REAL mission, and winning the game will be nigh-on impossible.\n\nThat said, a full session takes maybe two hours, and the game is terribly fun. And it does get easier as you start to understand it.","September 3, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has many novel and interesting systems well covered elsewhere, most of which work quite well. However it has one gaping flaw:\n\nThe hex based tactical engine simply doesn't work with the other systems.\n\nYou control three units. Maps are relatively open. Many attacks are ranged and characters of any side don't block line of sight. It is therefor impossible to reliably protect someone from getting hit. You lose the game by losing all your resolve points, and you lose one resolve every time someone is incapacitated in the tactical map. Thus bringing anyone who can't survive reasonably on the tactical map is a recipe for failure.\n\nApart from the occasional area that heals anyone on it at the start of their turn, terrain is either passable, impassable and blocks LOS, or impassable and doesn't.\n\nAll of this combined means that save the rare AOE ability, positioning barely matters. So why have it?\n\nA Radical Fix\nScrap the hexes and simply have lines of units on each side of the screen like the old Final Fantasy games. You can still play with AOE effects, all the other systems remain in place, the only thing you lose is range. and tedium.\n\nThe Rest\nI have some other minor quibbles but they're all picking nits. It's a charming presentation, the exploration is good, the between expedition stuff is okay but nothing special. I really want to like this game. But the tactical side is tedius, about 40 percent of the gameplay time, and where you always lose. I hold out no hope it will be changed, and unless it is I can't recommend this game.","December 30, 2015","false","7.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","3"

I want to, I really do, but it is unbalanced in a few, yet crucial, ways that transforms a charming and novel experience with a lot of promise into sheer frustration, or, more frequently, shock and disbelief. Make sure you've made your sacrifices to the random number generator gods before playing this one. There are (at least) two things that need to be re-worked: 1) the Resolve mechanic, and 2) the attack power of minions. You start each expedition with barely enough Resolve to survive it. The early expeditions are easy enough, but then sometimes you die on the first encounter of your first expedition. Even hardcore rogue-likes are more balanced than that. Failure is often so unavoidable mainly because Resolve is reduced for each character that falls, and once you hit zero Resolve, it's 'game over'. This is also due to minions doing nearly as much "damage" as bosses, and respawning at a considerable rate with no perceivable limit to their quantity. Because some encounters railroad you into certain strategies, and because your party might only be really good at other strategies, you can end up with a highly skilled and decked-out party who is just up ♥♥♥♥ creek in some encounters. And that wouldn't be so bad occasionally, but since the result is 'game over' and you really had no chance, it's more than a little confusing and frustrating. So to save yourself from this fate, you'll find yourself just doing whatever your party is best at, regardless of whether it's appropriate to the situation.\n\nIMO, the worst kind of gaming experience you can have is really wanting to like a game that has some genuinely great ideas and a lot of potential, but not being able to because of the despair it engenders via meaningless "are you feaking kidding me?" and "I'm not even mad anymore, this is just ridiculous" moments, in spite of your level of mastery. That's what happens here w/ RE:IS. Maybe it's worth a purchase on sale, but not at full price.","June 1","false","9.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","5"

This is a talented group, and there is definitely an audience for this game, but I think the audience is too "niche" to warrant the sweeping positive reviews.\n\nStylistically, I think the campiness was a weird choice. After playing the tutorial and seeing the evil "rival" I was thinking, "Hey, this would be a fun thing to show to my 7 year old nephew" but then I realized there's way too much reading for someone of that age and the difficulty is too high for him to enjoy... so... I don't know, I thought it was silly. Let's go plunder a native tribe by telling them jokes... :|\n\nThe bonuses are fun. You get LOTS of shiny throughout the game. It doesn't pay off unless you complete a whole level, though, and the boss fights were the deal breakers for me. I think in the last fight I did there were 4x as many enemies as my I had in my party. Challenging fights are fun... but I hadn't even really completed a full level (past the tutorial), so it seems like it just ramped up too fast. And while the game is technically a 'tactics' game, in that it has a grid and you walk around, there seemed to be less tactical decisions focused on positioning, movement, cover, etc... and more so just their 'mood' system.","April 1","false","6.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I just want to enjoy playing the game and I want something that keeps me coming back to relax. This isn't it.\n\nI think my biggest problem with this game is that there isn't enough variety. I keep seeing the same encounters over and over again. In every play through I fight the same bosses, I see the same treasures, and then different characters don't really provide me with that much varied game play. It feels like I'm playing the same hour and a half campaign over and over again. The mechanics of this game aren't all that interesting if I already know how to win every fight and I'm esentially playing the same characters. I like tactics games, but the combat in this game is so simple and so unvaried that it ends up being completely uncompelling.\n\nOverall I am disappointed with this game. It's still a cute little game that I recommend people try when it's on sale. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this game.","January 1","false","18.6"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","1"

The game downloaded reasonably quickly and launched fine. I got through the little intro and crew selection and was embarking on the first expedition when I had my first encounter (A MAJOR part of the game mechanics where all combat happens). While on the load screen for the encounter the game crashed at 5%. I thought maybe it was a one-time thing, after all the first time launching games isn't always perfect, so I tried again. I went through the intro and related process again only to have the game crash once more upon entering the loading screen for an encounter at 5%. I did this a few more times with similar results. Encounter loading screen crashes at 5%. Every. Time. At this point I'm convinced it just won't work on my PC and I can't for the life of me figure out why. It looks like a really fun game so it's a real shame I can't play it. I've seen on the support forums other people having the exact same "5% Crash" issue and the only response from the developer that I've seen was a sincere apology but no real solution.

The game is supposed to be about an intrepid band of explorers venturing into the unknown and discovering lost lands, lost peoples, and lost treasures, but ultimately, it fails to deliver on that.\n\nFor example, you're supposed to be exploring the unknown, but in reality the path you're taking is fairly predictable. You know exactly how long your supplies will last, exactly what kind of challenge you'll run into, and exactly how best to deal with that challenge. There is certainy random chance involved, which is good, but it's in the wrong place. Instead of throwing you into the unknown and making you figure out how to get out of the mess you're in, you are instead encouraged to look forward, figure out what lies in store for you, and then meticulously plan out where you go and in what order to have the best chance of success. This isn't a bad mechanic per se, and in a different game it could make for some great gameplay, but for a game about exploring the unknown, it just doesn't click.\n\nThe combat is another example this. While I like the idea of using a combination of weapons, words, and trickery to defeat your enemies, the way it was done just makes everything feel gamey and contrived. Everything is boiled down to an attack on the enemy's HP, and at best you might get something that inflicts an unreliable status effect or changes the "mood" of the combat. Trying to be diplomatic or sneaky just ends up feeling the same as any other combat, rather than being it's own, interesting way to tackle challenges.","October 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","0"

It turns out that there isn't much going for the combat other than a rock-paper-scissors sort of thing with three attack types. Of course, the game suggests building your team around one or two types, so you're going into a RPS contest without one of those choices. Each character has a small number of attacks to choose from, and they were mostly the same between the characters I tried. If there's some way to switch team members between expeditions, I didn't find it.\n\nBetween combats, the game has a dull board game feel, like playing Monopoly. Sometimes you roll on a wheel to see if something good or bad happens. There are different skills that influence this, but there's not much way to prepare for a particular type of area where different skills might apply, unless I missed that, too. I should note that the UI for this game is often confusing.\n\nAlso, there's some bug for unusual resolutions that makes the mouse cursor not line up with whatever position it's using for selecting buttons. I played this game on my TV, which obscures some of the edge of a standard resolution, so I clipped it a little in the video settings.

Originally, I lfelt like it wasn't a full game yet. There are still somethings I'd like to see fixed, but most of what bothred me about the game initially is fixed, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nI'd still love to see an option to have it auto-end a turn when you have no more possible actions. Not only does this feel like a time waster, when you realize you need to hit the end turn button, or when you hit it, but because the mood of the battle changed, it didn’t read the input and you have to hit it again, but everyone and then you think you’re done and you skip over someone who still could have acted a moment to late.\n\nThe latter hasn’t happened to me often, but there are some issues in how the encounters are drawn that can lead to it. First off, everyone and then I’ve lost a character behind a bush or a tree, this is especially bad if the character has been knocked out, and you are trying to find them to revive them, but there is a blurriness to encounters that sometimes makes it hard to tell on the characters that don’t have vibrant colors if they have acted or not.\n\nThere are a few other interface issues that also make the game frustrating. The arrow that shows you when your character has leveled up isn’t that noticeable, especially with all the other buffs and debuts that sometimes show near the portrait. If you don’t notice before you move to a new location, you can no longer level the character until after that encounter. Also, I was almost 20 hours into the game before I noticed the very subtile tool icon, that allows you to use tools to help your chances on skill tests.\n\nIt would also be nice if you got to carry over something from a previous game. As it is, you do unlock the option to make more and more of the characters ‘Captains’ which give you various bonuses,  but you get nothing for doing better on one game than another. If you could maybe choose one treasure to carry over with you, that would be great. Especially since the treasures are slightly randomized, and so sometimes you get a treasure that would benefit a Tactician, but if you didn’t create your crew with one, you can never take advantage of it. It would be lots of fun if you got a treasure that your current crew couldn’t use, but you could keep, and then design your next crew around it.\n\nBut aside from those nitpicks it’s a lot of fun. The characters are great. You have 20 to choose from, and they are extremely diverse. The characters come from all over the world and they each have a flavor to them that makes them exciting. They all feel like they really do have personalities, and in fact, in certain encounters you will suddenly discover that one of your crew has a ‘hidden’ characteristic like being vain or a glutton, that changes your options.\n\nThe battle, or encounter animations are great. I love that two out of the three play styles are based around talking not fighting, and they’ve put some real thought into it. It’s more complex than a simple rock paper scissors mechanic. For instance if both sides in a battle are friendly, there is a huge bonus to being the first to physically attack. However, actual attacks swing the encounter radically towards the aggressive side, and if you had been hoping for a friendly resolution, you’re going to have to do a lot of work to make up for whoever did the attack. That means that if you’re trying to play friendly, it’s beneficial to keep playing friendly. However, more aggressive groups can sometimes get a one time big bonus by pretending to be friendly and then attacking.","September 7, 2015","true","57.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

There are a large number of party combinations to try, and for casual gamers you can set the difficulty somewhat low and just explore around.\n\nHowever, this review is aimed at the more serious gamers.\n\nThis game, at higher difficulty levels, has a lot of strategic depth. It is a rogue-lite (with the only progression unlocking new captains--you start at lvl 1 explorers each game, with no new equipment). So essentially a pure rogue-like.\n\n\nThere are several different parts to this game.\n\n1) [Non-expedition] Resource management. You never have enough to do everything, even with full focus on one of them.\nGold for equipment.\nStatus to hire followers and specialists. Give new perks (see below) and improve # of resources gained on expeditions.\nResearch to write papers (which give various bonuses; there are multiple research trees focused on different things).\n\nFully focusing on gold, for instance, will never get you enough for the best equipment for all your characters.\nFull on research? MAYBE you'll get half the trees unlocked.\nEtc.\n(And you'll still get other resources; just where you focus your bonuses can matter a lot.)\n\n2) Character development\n\na) Your captain perk matters a lot. Each captain has a different perk that can make a big difference (or not, depending on the captain, but its all in how you use it). Hard to explain without going into horrible amounts of detail, but different captains are better at some strategies than others; lots to explore.\n\nb) Perks: each character starts with 2 perks and gets at least 2 more during level-ups (choice between 2 different perk groups for each character). You can also gain them during exploration and from equipping trinkets.\nPerks give you more options during exploration (e.g., with enough Archeology you get might get unique options when exploring a pyramid, or with enough Athlete perks maybe you can do some crazy stuff when running from natives across a bridge).\nPerks give you bonuses on the 'adventure wheel'--a %-based spin that resolves various non-combat encounters. (Different perk "groups" give bonuses, and specific perks can too. E.g., if you have 5 "naturalist" perks, maybe you get a big bonus on identifying some new species of animal you find, giving bonus research. If one of those perks is 'biology', maybe you get a separate, additional bonus.)\nPerks also give combat stats.\n\nc) Attacks\nEach character starts with 3 regular "attacks": A physical attack of some sort, a deceitful talking action, and a friendly talking action.\nAll of these damage enemy "spirit". (And the friendly one can be used on allies too, will heal them.)\n\nThe talking attacks generally inflict a status too: saddened, excited, etc. (These give bonuses or penalties to combat stats.)\n\nIt can be really interesting if you are trying to be friendly; you may end up buffing the enemy! Careful...\n\nEach character also unlocks 2 unique attacks as they level up (AoE, line attacks, single target, and all sorts of other stuff).\n\nd) Equipment: Each character can equip a trinket (perks, resists), offense item (offensive combat stats, maybe buffs too), defensive item (defensive stats).\n\ne) Special things. Sometimes you may get a permanent non-perk thingie that stays with the character either for the rest of the current expedition (each game is 5 expeditions) or for the rest of the game.\n\n\nThe different classes of character have typical perk groups they unlock and typical types of builds. (E.g., scouts tend to be glass cannon with long range attacks and quick thinking/rogueish perks. Fighters tend to be melee with athletic or tactical perks.)\n\nUtilizing different combinations of characters is fun--it can play very differently.\n\n3) Combat\n\nSo there are 3 different flavors of attack: “aggressive”, “deceitful”, and “friendly”\n\nThey interact in different ways depending on the overall mood of the fight. (9 total combos. E.g., if enemy is aggressive, it is ok for you to be aggressive (small bonus) or deceitful (bigger bonus), but if you are friendly you get a debuff.)\n\nEach of the 9 combos has a different threshold for changing, and changes when enough abilities of a different flavor are used. (E.g., when both sides are ‘friendly’, using a single aggressive ability will change the mood. But when both sides are aggressive, it takes a lot of friendly abilities to change the mood.)\n\nFurther, you can have specific abilities, items, artifacts, research, or other stuff that gives bonuses or penalties when in a certain mood.\n\nThere are buffs and debuffs; deceitful talking abilities can give Enraged, Saddened, Terrified (all of which give different penalties, and also can have interactions with items & other abilities/research/etc), and friendly can give mostly buffs (and one debuff): Confident, Excited, and I forget what the debuff is called (makes you more vulnerable to speech attacks).\n\nEach character has an attack rating, a speech rating, armor, and speech defense. (And ‘grit’, which dodges all attack types.)\n\n\nSo on top of all that, the way you win a combat also matters. If you mostly used one ability type, that is how the combat will resolve. (E.g., mostly used friendly abilities.)\nThis affects what bonuses you get (if any)--different abilities, research unlocks, and the specifics of the encounter can all affect what the bonuses are for different combat endings.\nFurther, your overall reputation is affected by how you typically resolve combats, and this overall reputation can affect how things go when you run into people during your explorations.\n\n\n4) [Expedition] Resource management & exploration: Don’t run out of food or resolve (lives).\n\nYou can trade resolve for stuff sometimes, but probably shouldn’t. If you run out of food you start getting horrible penalties (like -40% to your attack stat, or to a defense stat).\n\nYou have to balance how hard you think an encounter will be (and what type of challenges your team is able to overcome) with gaining resources. You want as many resources as you can, but if you have no scientist on your team (there are 4 classes and only 3 characters per team…) then you should probably avoid challenges that will require naturalist/engineer/archeologist perks (though engineer & archeologist can be gotten a bit from other classes).\n\n\n(There are 4 challenge categories, each corresponding to different groups of perks; you can see what challenges there are at a node before you go there.)\n\nYou can base a strategy around buffing up the resources you gain for overcoming certain types of challenges, then seeking those out. All sorts of stuff you can try :).\n\n\n\nAnyway, the game is fun and challenging. You should give it a shot.\n\n\nBTW, as to the cons in the most helpful negative review:\n\n- Adventurer wheel screwing you over: You have a ton of control over this.\na) Avoid nodes where you know your perks don't line up with the challenge type\nb) Unlock tools in the preparation research tree (gives a big boost to your % chance to get through)\nc) Choose perks wisely, equip trinkets to fill in some gaps\n\n(BTW, adventure wheel is essentially a %-based way of resolving non-combat stuff. You get a base % chance modified by perks and various other things.)\n\n- Boss fights: they can be very difficult if you aren't prepared. But once you know what you are doing I think they are challenging but not unfair/impossible.\n\n\n- Lack of content: Yeah there aren't that many islands yet. But there are so many different events... I'm 8 hours in and I've barely scratched the surface I think. I could replay this a ton.\nAND they are planning to release more content.\n\n\nI usually buy a game and give it a 2 hour shot, then give it a hard look for whether to refund or not. I hit the 2 hour mark and knew there was no way I could refund this.\nGive it a shot, its worth the try.","September 11, 2015","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In Renowned Explorers, your words are treated as attacks and can end the fight as quickly as any blow. Someday we'll look back at this game and realize how important it is for changing how we view conflict - and how those conflicts are resolved.\n\nEverything about this game is enjoyable. I only wish there was more to it. There are actually very few maps to play through and while the game encourages you to play through its campaign multiple times (and it is indeed fun to do so...to a point), it can get stale. A sandbox mode would have been nice...though only if there were another dozen maps and a bunch more treasures to find.

You have time pressure to compleat the game, after 5 expeditions your points are tallied up and you win or run out of resources or resolve on the way and end up losing.\n\nThere are 2 modes; which is basically save-load version thats highly flawed and the Ironman mode that only keeps one save and if you die or lose in another way well.... then you are out.\n\nAs for the save load version of the game: You can save and load sure, BUT you lose any and all experience point you might have had between the saving and loading. I had 10 of 11 xp entering a map, i saved then i did an event with success my captain gained experience point enough to level up, i saved before hitting the next map only to fail and being forced to load, when i loaded my game I had "De-leveled" and had 10 of 11 xp. This is most likly a bug they plan to fix.\n\nSecondly\nI would love a Story mode where you had no time pressure, and could change out party members as you played a endless run of the game. The game ended not from how many expeditions you had but when you had found enough treasure to humiliate the opponent. Having the option to re-visit allready explored areas to grab what you can of materials would be fun, basically more RPG than what it allready is. Could also make it so that finding and acquiring more members is also done in city event.\n\nSimply put as the game is now, it is a single player game of Settlers of Catan, or thats as close as I can place it. You run around acquiring points until you win. It is funny but flawed, worth the money? Sure, I laughed while I played it so yeah. not a compleat waste of money at least there are much much worse games out there.","September 10, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally, I lfelt like it wasn't a full game yet. There are still somethings I'd like to see fixed, but most of what bothred me about the game initially is fixed, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nI'd still love to see an option to have it auto-end a turn when you have no more possible actions. Not only does this feel like a time waster, when you realize you need to hit the end turn button, or when you hit it, but because the mood of the battle changed, it didn’t read the input and you have to hit it again, but everyone and then you think you’re done and you skip over someone who still could have acted a moment to late.\n\nThe latter hasn’t happened to me often, but there are some issues in how the encounters are drawn that can lead to it. First off, everyone and then I’ve lost a character behind a bush or a tree, this is especially bad if the character has been knocked out, and you are trying to find them to revive them, but there is a blurriness to encounters that sometimes makes it hard to tell on the characters that don’t have vibrant colors if they have acted or not.\n\nThere are a few other interface issues that also make the game frustrating. The arrow that shows you when your character has leveled up isn’t that noticeable, especially with all the other buffs and debuts that sometimes show near the portrait. If you don’t notice before you move to a new location, you can no longer level the character until after that encounter. Also, I was almost 20 hours into the game before I noticed the very subtile tool icon, that allows you to use tools to help your chances on skill tests.\n\nIt would also be nice if you got to carry over something from a previous game. As it is, you do unlock the option to make more and more of the characters ‘Captains’ which give you various bonuses,  but you get nothing for doing better on one game than another. If you could maybe choose one treasure to carry over with you, that would be great. Especially since the treasures are slightly randomized, and so sometimes you get a treasure that would benefit a Tactician, but if you didn’t create your crew with one, you can never take advantage of it. It would be lots of fun if you got a treasure that your current crew couldn’t use, but you could keep, and then design your next crew around it.\n\nBut aside from those nitpicks it’s a lot of fun. The characters are great. You have 20 to choose from, and they are extremely diverse. The characters come from all over the world and they each have a flavor to them that makes them exciting. They all feel like they really do have personalities, and in fact, in certain encounters you will suddenly discover that one of your crew has a ‘hidden’ characteristic like being vain or a glutton, that changes your options.\n\nThe battle, or encounter animations are great. I love that two out of the three play styles are based around talking not fighting, and they’ve put some real thought into it. It’s more complex than a simple rock paper scissors mechanic. For instance if both sides in a battle are friendly, there is a huge bonus to being the first to physically attack. However, actual attacks swing the encounter radically towards the aggressive side, and if you had been hoping for a friendly resolution, you’re going to have to do a lot of work to make up for whoever did the attack. That means that if you’re trying to play friendly, it’s beneficial to keep playing friendly. However, more aggressive groups can sometimes get a one time big bonus by pretending to be friendly and then attacking.","September 7, 2015","true","57.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Rewriting it now, just shows how much I think of this game :P\n\nThe game plays out a lot like FTL with your characters moving through nodes and finding encounters or just picking up the various resources you can use to upgrade things in between expeditions. I find this much more engaging than FTL however as the encounters that you'll find aren't simply based on the roll of a die, but have a Fallout New Vegas style chance to succeed that depends on your party members skills and ability scores adding a bit of depth to how you choose and level up your characters. The types of encounters are widely varied and you probably won't see them all within a couple playthroughs. At 11 hours I still haven't beaten a few of the levels and even within the levels I can breeze through there's still some secrets I haven't been able to figure out (whats the gargoyle statue for o_O)\n\nCombat has been mentioned a lot, with a lot of notice given to its presentation. Basically there are 2 types of attack (Speech/Attack) that are in turn seperated into 3 Attack styles (Speech = Friendly/Devious and Attack) The 3 styles have a rock paper scissor effect on each other in that if you're consistently using a style that beats the opponents style you get a global buff or a debuff if you're on the losing side. Neutral means a buff to the winning style although I've not yet seen opponents take advantage of this. Additionally the way you win battles will give different rewards and potentially different outcomes. Attacks also have the ability to buff and debuff your opponents in various ways and I think that' s the general meat of the combat strategy. Overall its a pretty simple system which actually works to the games favor as it keeps the game flowing as combat encounters are just part of the general exploration ecosystem.\n\nA couple of nitpicks that I have with the game, visually I love the animations and graphical style. In most cases. In some places its oddly old style flash looking with flat colors and overly simplistic layout like the title screen. The lack of polish extends to other places like when you finish an expedition and you count your rewards, skipping ahead will cause it to pause for a long while, and some of the character suggestions are strange. Like Hildegard being suggested for Friendly and Aggressive despite have no attack skills and a poor regular attack. One larger one is that the combat system has the aforementioned buff debuffs attached to attacks, but enemies can be IMMUNE a buff or debuff and take no dmg from the attack. This can render a char ineffective in whats usually the effective strat. You can still go neutral, but it seems like a weird thing to have.\n\nOverall: I find this game reallllllly compelling. like, I should be studying for finals but I'm not, compelling.","January 2","true","47.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it can be a bit repetative.\n\nA great family game. No scary or inappropriate things.\n\nWas a bit too easy. But then the whole idea is to push your explorers as far as you can to collect as much treasure from a map. It took the deaths of 6 parties before I understood how to maximise. The point of the game is to push and make the game harder as you go and challenge yourself and your explorers.\n\nThere is some luck involved so if you hate that don't get it.\n\nSupplies is the most important currency. This buys you more time to mess around on a given map and get more treasures. Once supplies run out each step starts penalizing your party huge, til they do the final mission to exit the map and they are super gimpy and end up dead.","June 6","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
