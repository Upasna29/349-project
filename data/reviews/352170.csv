There's no objectives, tracks are extremely linear and bland, the cars handle like shopping carts and the weapons don't really do anything at all.\n\nAll the advertized visual settings don't do anything for the game because even maxed out it's painful to look at. Mind you most of the sceenshots and even the trailer video are heavily post processed, for a good reason.\n\nMadOut needs a complete rework in order to justify any kind of pricetag.\nDo not buy this; it's ♥♥♥♥.","June 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","53","64","7","1"

There are translation errors and text overlapping in the menus. It feels like mobile game more. if it was 3x cheaper it would be acceptable i guess.","June 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","32","42","3","0"

This game has nice graphics, a good  soundtrack, nice cars and nice speed effects, but suffers with boring racing tracks and has some erros that you just don't believe how the developers do not correct before release it on Steam (like the position counter, which is wrong for most of the time).  It is like 70/100.","December 6, 2015","true","6.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","2"

Being 1st means you were lucky btw.\n\nOnly 1 mode.\nAll maps feel same.\nGame of luck.\nBoring menus.\nSome things aren't really translated.\nPretty bad handling, making driving boring.\nNo punishment on dying or on others being killed by you.\nUnfair combat system (impossible to dodge and almost impossible to miss anything. Only shield will protect you, but with it you can't win. Then again not having it means losing. Try to quickly get to 1st then take shields and a little ammo in case someone gets past you)\n\nI won once, check my screenshot. I broke the game.","July 10, 2015","false","9.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","10","14","3","0"

Victories feel largely left to chance due to poor AI and a punishing combat system. My main issue, however, is that the game cannot be played offline and save data is stored on the company's servers as opposed to your local system. In summary, this is a cool Blur like racing game, especially for those of us on Linux since Blur isn't available to us at this point. If the aforementioned issues are fixed then I would even call this a great game.","July 28, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
