Doom & Destiny: Advanced looks to raise the bar and add another insane adventure for you to feast upon. With all new features including classes, revamped abilities, cross platform play, and more! At the heart of the game though, what matters most is the humor and joyous spirit that was so perfectly captured in the first game. Does Do&De2 capture that? I believe so, with the theme being multi-dimensional versions of our main heroes. From the combat system to item management, everything has been streamlined for ease of use and getting to the fun and adventure. The game still does feature quite a bit of customization; stats, classes, and even appearance are yours to tinker with and change. Making a version of the party that is truly unique to your play style is one of the key focuses of Do&De2. The best part is that there is more to come, with new features being cooked up and added all the time. There is still some bumps on the road mind you, some grammar fixes, lack of start up menu, repetitive music. None of the former really stop the game from being an enjoyable experience. So gather your swords, staffs, and spatulas?\nDamn Francis.\nAhem... Its time to kick ♥♥♥ and get some sweet loot in Doom & Destiny: Advanced\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/dpsfvFf1fEg\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","June 18, 2015","true","2.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","0"

And even still it's not always a negative as some of the dialouge is equally hilarious for it's grammar errors.\n\nDoom and Destiny the first was an outstanding throwback to the classic top down rpg with, what I thought, great system for character development and a simply entertaining plot. The oppurtunity to get back into Doom and Destiny with a new installment is simply awesome.\n\nIt's an early access game so obviously a ways to go to the finished product but heres my list:\n\nPros:\n- Cross platform saves: Love being able to go from my laptop to my phone seamlessly\n- Neat class system\n- Same comedic element I enjoyed in the first Do&De (though needs some help in the grammar/spelling department still)\n- Arena feature is a nice change from the conventional method of grinding levels, though I seemed to power through leveling a little too fast\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer arena duels have a ways to go I think. Right now, you are only fighting AI controlled replica's of other players parties. Given the wide range of diversity in group builds the class system allows, would look forward to live battles with other players\n- Early access so a little short on the play time but impressively diverse world and content so far\n\nBased on my experience playing the first Do&De, I expect this will turn out to be a great second installment in the series!","August 9, 2015","true","5.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Now they added Ways to torment over Co-Op.. Via Robbers( to torment)  and Mercs ( to help)...  My wifes so going to hate me... This game is worth buying.

The graphics are on point, the story from my view is enjoyable and the humour is hilariously funny with tons of relatable references. The combat system + leveling system is really in depth. I like the fact the developers added classes for characters it reminds me of the FFX-II class system. The other thing I enjoyed when playing this game is I constantly feel like I'm playing dungeons and dragons the game really gives off that vibe even though it has jrpg style combat. If I were to reccomend improving anything so far it would just be to maybe make the game a little tougher so that the enemies take longer to kill. I think at the present it is a little too easy and making the enemies a little tougher would make the game time longer to. I say that because I don't want the game to end I just wanna keep playing though haha.","April 29","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a must for every oldschool RPGs fan, not a very must for everyone. But believe me, you will get good laughs out of it.\n\nJust like Do&De, Advanced is crazy fun. It now has more features than the previous one, which indeed is a new breath to the game. Classes become important as you can switch between them for more strategies, they might be a thing when it comes to PvP as well. Yes! You heard me right.\n\nAll in all, the game is unique and most of its parts are original. Need me to say more? Just start playing it then!

Bugs everywhere and it's to be expected.\n\nI played the first game to completion and loved every bit of it dearly, from the humor to the battles, the personality of each character, the easter eggs, pop culture references, and the awesome devs. All those are back in this 2nd game. I've been having a blast with my band of nerdy bros so far and can't wait for the game to be finished.\n\nDo&DeAdv is more of a parallel universe than a sequel to the original. Many things will be familiar to those who played the first but it's an entirely different story. 17 hours including thorough exploration for secrets, puzzle solving, moderate exp grinding, unlocking and upgrading classes, online matchmaking, party optimisation for online battles, game bug hunting (to help flesh out the game) and I'm just past the half way mark through the game. There is a lot going for Do&DeAdv, though the english translation needs a lot of improvement (it's made by a group of Italians). I'm very forgiving when it comes to this but it may be enough to give others fluent in English a headache every now and then.\n\nThe devs are quite active in the community and are gladly and willingly accepting feedback and suggestions, as they were with the first game for years.\n\nShould you get it? As with every Early Access, not everything is in the game yet and there's a lot of polishing that needs to be done. The main story is complete and every essential location is accessible. A couple of classes still need to be implemented as well as various locations and features such as New Game+, Steam cards/achievements. I recommend getting it now if you loved the first and are willing to spend time helping to build the game to its completion. Otherwise, follow the game and put it in your wishlist or buy it now and support the awesome devs!","June 8, 2015","true","17.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/recommended/361040/","ARANimate","ARANimate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/","214 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDoom and Destiny Advanced is a kind of sequel to Doom and Destiny: Spaghetti Fantasy RPG. Never having played the first Doom and Destiny I couldn't tell you what the similarities are. What I can tell you are my first impressions.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Bi7QI6U4OAk\n\nYou and a group of your friends awaken in a burning castle. As you try to escape you are then teleported back to the real world where you are heading to play Do&De (essentially Dungeons and Dragons).\n\nWhat this game does well is the humor. From the characters dialogue to the enemies you face there's constantly little things to have a good chuckle. For instance one of the first enemies you face is a giant poop monsters. I mean come on, how stupid is that (It's delightfully stupid that's how much).\n\nThe beginning of the game does a good job of taking you through a tutorial without making you feel like that's what it is. Woven into the first parts of the game are npc you can interact with that tell you what different things do. It's an effective way to get you started.\n\nThe rpg parts are typical of a top down rpg. You cast spells, level up, heal up and murder ♥♥♥♥♥es. What really sets this game apart is the humor and charm. The story seems deep and enjoyable. Not without it's faults I've seen others report bugs, I personally didn't run into any. It is an early access game so I'm sure there are plenty of bugs. Even their updates point to bug fixes.\n\nFor more Indie Game, Movie and Music Reviews and Indie Game Podcast - EarlyAccessMedia.com, EarlyAccessPodcast.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","June 14, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It feels like the game is only halfway finished, and while it's still under developement it is still a continuation of the first game and thecore elements are expected to be just as good.\n\nAnd getting a total party kill during the tuttorial on a rendom encounter, while at full health, really is evidence of a bad combat system.","March 20","false","6.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I initially bought the game because i really liked the first Do&De (have free version on android) and wanted to buy a copy of it, but 2 friends of mine told it was better not to (one had problems on android and the other on pc), so i at least bought this one, to "make up" for the missed purchase on the first.\nAfter 2 hours my first thoughts are:\nCons:\n-different graphics are kinda weird, but no biggy\n-english translation isn't that good, but passable\n-first kinda sad poop joke (not a fan of "potty humor)\n-different levelling system (not necessarily bad, just different and more "complex") (note: i've not read anything about this game, so i don't know ny existing builds or max-level or anything, i bought it because i wanted to support the team)\nPros:\n-i love flashbacks, having one at the beginning of the game was wonderful\n-same character can play more than one class (awesome)\n-funny jokes\n-story gets you curious\n-HP and MP recharge a small amount after every battle (yay)\n-one unique "currency" for objects (ex: they are now "food" and "alchemy stuff" instead of "sandwich, pizza, chips, etc" and "beer, wine, coke, etc")\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game: it's still in early access, but i expect great things from the team, and they deserve a reward of some sort...at least it's cash and not some rusty sword they'd throw away anyways.\nIn time I might modify this review and update it with new thoughts as i play through the game, hopefully with happy and good results.","October 24, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
