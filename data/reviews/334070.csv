It has a nonsensical story that is neither as sophisticated as it thinks it is, nor as interesting as it tries to be.  Its music and art assets are frequently recycled throughout the entire game. It currently has barely 2 hours of game content, which is encased in a platform that seeks to draw out the experience over 3-4 hours through the use of confusing level design.Then there's the glitches, like being unable to interact with in-game items that are necessary for you to proceed further, causing you to have to reload your game.\n\nThe worst part, and perhaps the most insulting thing about Hektor, is that it isn't scary at all. Outlast was scary, Alien Isolation was a stressful and harrowing experience. Hektor? Hektor is a complete disgrace to the horror genre of games. Watch any of the lets-plays that are currently on Youtube. Not a single one of them is enthralling, immersive, or in the least bit frightening. Many claim that the game's atmosphere is intensely creepy, and that they would prefer a game like Hektor to one filled with jump scares. Sure, jump scares alone do not make a horror game. Neither do games that are all about the long drawn out creepy atmospheres that eventually amount to nothing.\n\nYou can only play so much of Hektor before you feel cheated and violated, like the boy who is strung along by a candy man with all the promises of a sweet future, only to end up in the back of a windowless van. No, there is nothing causing that sound that appears to be made by the wheels of hospital beds rolling across the corridor. Its just one of the many sound assets that the game randomly plays every now and then to build up 'atmosphere'. In fact, I haven't seen a single hospital bed move in this game. How about those creaks and groans and that squeaky violin sound you hear as the background music reaches its crescendo? Yup, just more of the same. Sounds with no force of a credible threat behind them. And do you know why there is no hiding in this game? Because there is no need to - the game is a bloody walking simulator. The only threats in Hektor reside in the creatures that you will encounter in this game, and what a disappointment they are.\n\nThe developers advertise this game as having a horrific monster that tirelessly pursues you. Yes there is only one monster in the game capable of killing you. But the only times you experience being chased by this presence is halfway through the game when you first come across it, and towards the end when the game artificially ramps up its difficulty level by putting the creature in your path. Beyond those two occasions, you almost never encounter the creature, much less get 'pursued' by it. Additionally, it is difficult to be afraid of a monster that has pathing issues. There was one occasion when the monster ran continuously into a box that was in front of me as it tried to get at me.\n\nBesides this monster, the game scatters, with no logical rhyme or reason, half naked deathly pale people around the map. These death-camp prisoner of war lookalikes cannot hurt you physically, but are capable of reducing your character's sanity level if you are near them when they scream. The first time you encounter one of these people is a decently shocking experience, but towards the later part of the game, their presence is at best an irritating encounter as the game uses the same audio asset for their screams, and at worst you might end up laughing in their face, especially when you see their ridiculous transition from person into a reddish spectre.\n\nWho are these people-like things? What is that monster that chases you? What is the Hektor program? Who are you? Why are you at the facility? How did you come to develop your psychosis? Why do you guzzle antipsychotic medications like M&Ms? You'd probably have a better chance of getting that information from God than this game. In fact, Hektor hardly explains anything properly. The game conveys its tale singularly through badly written journal or diary entries that are randomly distributed throughout the entire level in a humdrum and erratic manner.  Walk into the intelligence room for the first time, pick up a journal entry. Walk into the intelligence room again at a later time, great there are 2 more journal entries to pick up. What the ♥♥♥♥ is this? Shouldn't the intelligence room be empty now given that I have just explored it earlier? The entire attempt feels so lazy, so half-hearted. It destroys any remaining immersion that one might have in the game up to this point.\n\nThe main story is simplistic. It is also full of boring cliches. How many times can we pretend to be interested in the stories told by the people who eventually develop the 'crazies', or some aggravated form of 'stockholm' syndrome? Leave that for the bad movies, it is their rightful domain. You are supposed to be making a horror game that scares us, unnerves us, that makes the hairs on our skin stand as we uncover the story bit by bit. And this is the best you can come up with?\n\n$14.99 is too much money to spend on this utter filth and garbage. $14.99 is too much money to spend to be insulted by the developers, who think they can masquerade this bad cashgrab as a 'psychological horror game'. The only thing that is horrifying about this game is our ridiculously low expectations when it comes to paying for and hyping garbage like this on Steam.\n\nIf you enjoyed 'Daylight', which is another horror game with procedurally generated levels, you might enjoy Hektor. They are both equally bad. Another option is to skip both games, and simply watch a let's play from one of the better youtubers out there. It will require a considerable amount of good acting skills on the part of the youtuber to beat some life into this dead dog's body.\n\nOtherwise, FASTER FASTER... avoid Hektor. You have been warned.","March 14, 2015","false","3.1"," 571 of 732 people (78%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","78","571","732","53","31"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/334070/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Playing Hektor is like walking through an M.C. Escher print if M.C. Escher was a sadistic psychopath. I wake up in the bowels of what is either an abandoned medical facility, prison, insane asylum, or some disturbing amalgamation of the three. The trick is that, as I wander through the dark, claustrophobic halls with nothing to light my way but the world's longest-lasting lighter and least battery efficient flashlight, Hektor folds the environment in on itself and opens it back up according to some mysterious logic.\n\nIt's subtle at first. The facility is pretty bare, with only a few boxes, desks, hospital beds, and maybe a sheet covering a human shape. It's easy to get lost, as it often is in first-person horror games, but it didn't take long before I walked around a corner only to find myself in the same room I just left behind me. Other times, I'd walk around in circles, not sure how to proceed, only to suddenly find a door that was previously locked wide open, or a familiar hallway leading me to a completely new location.\n\nThe best thing about Hektor's spatial trick is that it does it seamlessly. I could never tell when it opened doors, closed them, led me in circles, or allowed me to move on. At some point, I learned that, unlike every other first-person game I play, there's no point in trying to keep a mental map of my environment. Instead, it was best to just keep moving forward, quickly, and have faith that the rooms and hallways would align when Hektor was ready to let me proceed.\n\nIt's not the first time I've seen the geometry of a level rearrange itself radically when I turned my head in a first-person game. I remember it was quite a novelty in the first FEAR, and The Stanley Parable used similar tricks more recently in really effective ways. The problem with Hektor is that its tricky level design is the only interesting thing about it.\n\nCool as it is, the mind games wore thin long before I finished Hektor. There is nothing to do but move forward, choosing to go right or left arbitrarily. It's dark, so it was easier to keep moving if I had batteries for my flashlight, but Hektor is generous with them, so I rarely ran out. I suppose that the impossible, confusing level-design is meant to reflect the main character's mind, which through a vaguely told story, I understand is a screw or two loose. It's an interesting idea, but madness here is just relentless confusion. All Hektor knows how to do is rearrange hallways, so that's all it does.\n\nThere are creepy monsters, too, of course, but they don't add much. The first and more common, a zombie of sorts, did nothing but appear at random to make scary noises. With the caveat that I am a scaredy-cat, this did actually make my heart skip a beat almost every time. It's late at night, it's dark, there's scary music, and something came out at me out of nowhere and yelled "boo!" You got me Hektor, I jumped, congratulations at meeting the minimum requirements for being a horror game.\n\nStartling as it is, this monster isn't interesting to interact with. It doesn't force me to rethink how I move through the environment as, say, Alien: Isolation's alien. Hektor morphed my vision at times, making the image sway, wobble, and twist, and it seems like this monster may have made that effect even more severe. At the beginning, I was told never to forget to take my pills, which are also scattered around the environment, but these didn't seem to have an effect on the wobbly vision, so it's not like I had to manage my pills supply in relation to monsters. Even after finishing Hektor, I have no idea what the pills did, and all the wobbliness did is make me a little queasy.\n\nThe other type of monster, a zombie with big sharp appendages jutting out of its back, just walked up to me clumsily and hit me three or four times before I died. I could run, but why should I? When I died, I just respawned at a random location, and since the environment is abstract, I didn’t lose a measurable amount of progress. Actually, dying seemed to move me forward faster, and it also reset the wobble-vision, so I learned to embrace death, hugging monsters as soon as I saw them.\n\nThese monsters animate horribly, by the way. It was a comic relief to watch this supposedly nightmarish creature come to take my life in awkward, stiff little half steps. He was ugly too, and not in a disturbing way. He just seemed like a 3D model you'd get for free from the "spooky" section of the Unity 3D asset store.\n\nHektor doesn't look horrible overall. Most of the time I was looking at very dark, bare rooms, which is not a tall order technically or artistically. Some assets, and in particular one out-of-character poster that jokes about tweets, repeat way to often, but I don't mind that too much. Have you ever been in a hospital or a prison? They recycle art assets in real life too.\n\nI'd tell you more about Hektor but there's nothing else to it. You're in a dark facility, you keep moving forward, and scary things happen.

It is far from deaf-friendly! When the game was first released, it was shown on the store page that the game had English subtitles available. Sure enough, there was an option to turn on subtitles within the game. The problem? It didn't work at all, the settings would reset themselves once you actually started playing the game. Even after trying several proposed fixes, it did not come anywhere close to working.\n\nThen I found out that despite the option being there, the subtitles were actually not implemented yet. Emphasis on the word "yet." I asked for an ETA on the subtitles, never got a response.\n\nA few weeks later, I decide to give the game another shot, see if it had actually been completed as per the game's store page. I checked the game's options and was confused to find that the subtitles option had vanished. There was an announcement stating they had updated the options to properly work but no mention of the subtitles. Checking the store page revealed to me that the developers had quietly removed the check under "Subtitles" section under the "Languages" header.\n\nDo not buy the game unless you want to go into the game without subtitles and not knowing what the hell to do besides wander around like an idiot suffering from constant vertigo.\n\nShame on the developers for not sticking to their word.\n\nEDIT: I accidentally a word.","May 12, 2015","false","1.0"," 263 of 380 people (69%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","69","263","380","19","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/334070/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","The hallways of a mysteriously decrepit and deranged research facility beckon your escape, but the weakening of your mental state refuses to make navigating your way to freedom an easy task. The voice of a mysterious girl describes to the player acts of unspeakable injustices from within the confines, and your descent into the sanity depleting design of this strange complex leads you on the hunt for more information. Why are you here, what is the purpose of this wretched place, and who is this girl leaving you notes telling of a sketchy employment situation gone horribly afoul?\n\nHektor is a rare breed of psychological horror gaming, one with impeccable pacing and constant flow. Never feeling slow, never sluggish, tedious or breaking the pace, it keeps you one-hundred-percent on your toes and pressing ahead without the will to ever look back.\n\nThe story and the mystery surrounding the fates of the facilities inhabitants is told through the discovery of notes left behind by past workers, and cryptic visions from elements of this bleak environment. The voice acting is fantastically done and part of what keeps the player so immersed in the harrowing events unfolding through the snippets of writings uncovered and a real sense of urgency, confusion and terror can be heard with each increasingly dire development of the story.\n\nMoving through the story of Hektor takes you through a range of odd environments and surreal imagery. Starting with the harsh reality of the trashed and abandoned research complex and slowly evolving into more vibrantly obscured visions of lush red curtains and fancy tiled floors as if you've stepped right into an episode of Twin Peaks, but which of these surroundings are merely a figment of your imagination?\n\nThe beautifully orchestrated soundtrack is instantly chilling and ominous, worming its way through your ears and into your mind where you can feel every sharp note of the violin effecting your psyche. The echoing of unnerving metal scrapes in the distance, the buzz and crackle of old and failing light fixtures all work together to create a heavy atmosphere that constantly builds tension only to all explode in your face with every twist of the plot and your pysche.\n\nHallucinatory visual effects that plague our character creates a chaotic and fittingly confusing effect, and your only solace is the scarce Benzodiazepine pills scattered throughout the facility. This in part is what gives Hektor such a uniquely bizarre and frantic situation for a horror game, and a unique concept not seen since the likes of the legendary Eternal Darkness in terms of how much your mind is being screwed with. The wavy and twisting effect of your ravaged mental state making you feel as though you are losing your vision, causing you to squint and focus your attention on the distortion of the screen even harder until that one disturbing/shocking moment takes you off guard.\n\nNot only does neglecting to take your pills bring about the mind altering hallucinatory effects, but stirs the vengeful and twisted souls of past test subjects of this cruel place. Always ahead of you if you rush and forget to scavenge for pills but never too far behind if you lose your way and slow down, the threat of seeing one of these sanity depleting and terrifying creatures is what drives your carefully paced search for escape and answers.\n\nThe random and deliberately confusing nature of the ever-changing hallways around you and the constant transformation of the mysterious facility is an incredibly innovative mechanic for the genre. The straight-forward and almost repetitive nature that plagues most modern horror games gets a much needed spicing up and the cold, gray, lifeless hallways we're so used to from the genre now feel much more alive, more sinister and unpredictable.\n\nHektor is one of those elusive and unforgettable horror titles that manages to keep me consistently glued to the screen, only to severely regret my undying attention at the harrowing realization that I'm not alone in these dark and desolate hallways. The creepiness is in full force thanks to a genuinely mind-bending atmosphere, nothing ever feels forced and the scares are all derived from the mysterious unknown factors and macabre questions swimming around your mind. Even more impressive is that this elegant and disturbing journey into a twisted facility was hand crafted and coordinated by a team of five very dedicated people working from various locations across the globe.\n\nAmongst the droves of same-y horror titles and their cheap thrills, Hektor stands out as one of the few sublimely twisted experiences with a hallucinatory touch and just the right amount of mind♥♥♥♥ery causing you to question the reality of every last step you took. Where have you really been and what really happened, where are you going and will you ever get there?","March 27, 2015","true","12.8"," 61 of 76 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","61","76","3","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grgoljblaster/recommended/334070/","grgoljblaster","GrgoljBlaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grgoljblaster/","697 products in account","The premise sounded intriguing - psychological horror adventure with constantly shifting hallways.\nToo bad the execution is subpar.\n\nHektor is an underground military base/lab where the scientists conducted experiments on people, making them chug pills like crazy. You, an unnamed "subject", are sedated and sent into the depths of Hektor which is now abandoned. What follows is a 2-3 hour slog through some of the most nauseating and depressing enviroments in the last decade.\n\nThe game follows the trend of many indie Penumbra-wannabe games with story told through notes scattered around the corridors and innabillity to defend from monsters. I said Hektor was abandoned? Sorry, I lied. You will encounter either the scream-in-your-face-but-no-real-threat ghasts or the vicious Predator that can hunt you and kill you. Death is not a problem in this game, as you'll be sent to the last checkpoint with your inventory intact. The real problem comes from the so called JIGSAW system. It's pretty much a randomized/algorythmic system of world portal that sends you running around in loops until you figure out the way to progress the game. It's intriguing for the first 10-15 minutes after which becomes tedious as there's no real indicator to the JIGSAW's pattern. Another bothersome thing about it is that it may give the Predator an advantage when it's chasing you, sometimes even teleporting it right in your path.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Hektor is its insanity system. Yes, we've seen that in a bazillion games ever since Frictional Games' successfull Penumbra and Amnesia series, so I was normally expecting some blurring of vision when my character's sanity drops low. Instead, what the devs did is adding another layer of nauseating effects like swirl and color shift (thankfuly, these can now be toned down). Combined with claustrophobic hallways and narrow FOV, the game can cause massive headaches and motion sickness. I don't consider myself prone to motion sickness but I had to turn off the game a couple of times and get some fresh air because it made me feel ill and once I almost vomited.\n\nAfter that's said and done, one can wonder what's in the game at all. Barely no puzzles (if you can even call casual scavenging a puzzle), paper-thin story and no real value for the games as a medium. The price of 15 euros (reduced from ludicrous 20!) is an insult to the injury, the value is terribly low especially considering some of the greatest indie games sold for less than that. Seems like copying Frictional Games' formula isn't so easy after all.","March 18, 2015","false","5.8"," 78 of 108 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","78","108","3","5"

Most of them saying that the game is too short, and that there really isn't a huge threat because the monster doesn't really chase you and rarely shows up.

And for 5 people to create this type of horror game that goes on for 2 hours (only if you know EXACTLY what you're doing) is impressive.

I still don't know exactly what's going on in this game after 2 playthroughs but I think it has something to do with brainwashing experiments being carried out at a secret, underground facility called, yep you guessed it, Hektor.\n\nInitially it was very atmospheric and scary and I was literally holding my breath while creeping along darkened hallways with nothing more to light my way than a ye olden times zippo and some random, faulty lighting.  I definitely dropped many OFB's while playing this (TRANSLATION: the word 'OH' followed closely by a commonly used word for copulation and then finished off with 'BOMB').  The first time I saw the emaciated, floaty ghost that's rockin' some hardcore denim was merely the first of many OFB moments.  After that, those moments were basically only used for when the Predator showed up (no, not the good kind that keeps your skull as a keepsake) but a cracked out version of the emaciated, floaty denim ghost.\n\nThe use of sound and music is effective, though I have to say that the trippy, tilting screen effect throughout the entirety  of the game gets a little annoying.  Oh yeah, then there's the profusion of doors....so many doors, so little time!\n\nAnywho, Hektor was a creepy surprise for me and I can't wait to see what the devs do for their next game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/334070/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3111 products in account","The first 5 minutes of Hektor really draws you in. Straight away from the title screen to the excellent intro sequence and the very first dead end you realise things in this world are not always what they seem.\n\nI have played a lot of FPS horror adventures recently and Hektor definitely stands out as something a little different. The game is marketed as a psychological horror game and the debut title developed by the five-man team Rubycone. Set in an “abandoned” military black site, the player must escape this nightmarish facility while being pursued by monsters and battling their own psychosis brought about by apparent years of testing and abuse.\n\nThis brings about one of the game's key mechanics and that is the psychosis level. As you progress you must take pills you find to keep everything on the straight and narrow. Failure to find these pills sees the world shape and warp around you, a mechanic that reminded me slightly of the excellent Eternal Darkness on the GameCube but without the fourth wall breaking that came with it. The mechanic works well and adds to the atmosphere although I must admit it did make me feel a little bit nauseous when playing so those of you with motion sickness may have to be wary.\n\nYou start the game with a lighter progressing onto a torch which makes things a little easier as you navigate the corridors. The visuals in the game are great and while I totally appreciate the lack of lighting makes things scarier I can’t help but feel I would have liked to have seen a little further than a few feet in front of my face.\n\nProgression in Hektor is unusual. As you progress the game seems to always want you to advance at the same speed. At times I felt like the game was deliberately slowing me down by moving things around or making things less obvious. Equally though at other times the game would whisper to me how to progress in amongst the voices in my head or move the scenery around to the point where I seemed to automatically arrive at the new area. I guess it’s actually kind of neat that I am starting to question my own sanity and if this was the case or if I was just imagining it but sometimes I did not feel the exploration side of the game was truly down to me (although there is an under 1 hour achievement so it must be doable).\n\nSections of the game are split up with dream like sequences. These add some contrast to the game and provide a fun distraction from the dank corridors of the facility. As you reach the later parts of the game you encounter the Predator, a creature not dissimilar to the Nemesis in Resident Evil whose sole purpose seems to be to hunt you down. Interacting with the Predator is frantic and tended to make my heart race much like a rollercoaster would rather than being creepy scary. I enjoyed this part of the game and feel this could have been included earlier than it was. There are other creatures that call out to the predator as you navigate the corridors but these provide simply the forewarning that the main beast is coming and I feel the inclusion of these was possibly unneeded.\n\nThe game’s story is told through audio logs and much like the rest of the sound in the game these are excellent. While I am not usually a fan of this type of storytelling they are brilliantly voice acted and really make you care about the story and feel for the characters behind these notes. I would even go so far as to say these are the best audio logs I have come across.\n\nThe sound design is also wonderful and creepy and the mutterings and noises that accompany the main score are a key element of the games atmospheric success.\n\nI finished the game in about 4 hours and while I enjoyed it I felt it could have been longer. The predator could have arrived earlier and been fleshed out a little more and I equally had a few unanswered questions related to the story.\n\nWhile not perfect for a debut indie title Hektor is a fantastic horror game that I would easily recommend. At £14.99 the game is a little on the expensive side and I could imagine a slight price drop helping to persuade fence sitters. A unique experience that’s worth checking out and fun for all the family… well maybe not.\n\nI originally posted this review at http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/articles/150317_hektor-mind-bending-game-review.\n\nIf you have enjoyed this review and found it informative please join our Curator group to get more recommendations http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gametutor#curation","March 17, 2015","true","6.6"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/334070/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Let me say this up front: I probably should not be trusted with first-person horror games. I'm a very jumpy person and tend to get very immersed in games, so first-person horror is like a waking nightmare for me no matter the quality. Keep that in mind when I say that Hektor creates a palpable sense of isolation and dread, and despite that I still hated it.\n\nHonestly I was all set to review Hektor after about 20 minutes. In that time I never saw a monster or moved the plot forward in any way. Instead, I encountered three things that made me never want to play it ever again. The first was the intense, unshakable nausea that the game's sanity effects inflicted on me. Your character has some sort of dementia that causes their vision to constantly swirl and lose focus, and only a few minutes of fighting that in cramped, darkened hallways was enough to make me want to hurl. There are pills you're supposed to take regularly, ostensibly for your sanity, but they have no effect on the visual agony you are constantly exposed to.\n\nThe second was the layout of the game. Which is to say, there isn't any. Hektor's big gimmick is that the levels are procedurally generated on the fly, changing the places you just came from. This means you can walk down a hallway, poke your head in an office, go back down the hallway, and end up in a completely new place. This might sound cool to fans of House of Leaves or Grave Encounters, but think about what that means in terms of game flow. There is no way for you to get to a specific place in a level. Every time you round a corner, there's no way to know where you're going to end up. And this is bad because you need to reach certain rooms in a certain order to progress. So that means a lot of running down the same halls over and over until the game decides to cycle you into the area you need to be. I won't deny that it's an unsettling effect at first, and there's more than one good setpiece using it, but it really saps the appeal of exploration and makes progressing needlessly bloated.\n\nThe third was the ♥♥♥♥ hallway. There are fully voice-acted notes to be found from the different inhabitants of the Hektor complex. Some of these are pretty banal, like a guy wondering where his buddy is or a secretary commenting on the guy that always stares at her in the office. Then you end up in the dormitory wing, and find a note from the secretary about being ♥♥♥♥♥ every night. So you're listening to this girl describe her fear and discomfort whilst being ♥♥♥♥♥, and then you realize that YOU CAN HEAR HER BEING ♥♥♥♥♥ in that very hallway at that very moment. Hektor, being a spooky game, has spooky voices that say things like "Run" or "I'll find you", but in this case it's a lot of "No please stop" and "Why are you doing this" between choked sobbing. There's even a cherry on this ♥♥♥♥ sundae, which is that the procedural level generation might make you run through the dorm wing multiple times. And yes, every time you pass through, she's being ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI don't know what the point of Hektor is, and after all the physical and mental discomfort, I don't really care to know. There are plenty of first-person horror games that don't make me want to throw up or force me to listen to endless ♥♥♥♥ being acted out. They might not be as graphically impressive or well voice-acted, but at least they won't make me sick in nearly every sense of the word.","October 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","24","35","4","0"

I'm an avid horror reader and writer, and personally I really wasn't all that drawn into Amnesia, and Outlast kinda did it for me but still not all that much.\n\nHektor is a totally different beast.  It might be my personal taste, but I love the surreal, psychological horror experience that Hektor gives you.  Right off the bat, the game feels like you're playing through a schizophrenic person's really bad acid trip, and everything that happens throughout the game reinforces that feeling.\n\nNothing makes a whole lot of sense, but it all has its own surreal consistency that starts to make sense, especially given the acid-trip context of the game.  ("What the hell am I doing at this place?  Where have I been going?  What the hell is this thing in my hand?  What have I even been doing for the last twenty minutes?")\n\nAlso, IMO the game's greatest strength is its pacing and subtlety.  There are a lot of details in the game to take in, which can be kinda hard given the acid visual obstructing everything, but as a psychological horror fan it's really a great experience discovering everything the game has to throw at you.  That's not to say everything's perfect--I personally didn't like the sexual assault sub-plot going on with the patients at the facility, I felt like that was maybe a bit forced in to try and make you feel shocked about what's going on.  Honestly though, I don't feel that this detracts from the overall experience of the game in any way, as long as you don't have personal issues with the inclusion of this story element.  To me though, the game's not really about the sub-plots of what went on at the facility, and more about the main character's schizophrenic acid-trip and his mental reactions when he finds out all this ♥♥♥♥ that went on.\n\nDefinitely highly recommended for fans of surreal horror, acid, and getting mind-♥♥♥♥ed by a game that's sick in many ways ;)\n\n(Also, as a complete aside to all this, I would like to mention that the devs of this game are really cool guys who love making ♥♥♥♥ed-up horror games, and they definitely deserve your support if you're into this kind of game.)","March 21, 2015","true","4.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The lighting is spot on and when the corridor opens up a bit into a larger area, you get a slight sense of agoraphobia. The whole environment's level of decay and dereliction provide the right level of repulsion and attraction whilst the addition of certain areas (the red-curtained area for example) offer a great juxtaposition with the 'mental hospital' vibe. The insanity and overdose effects can be a little overwhelming at times, but those can now be toned down in the options. However, it adds much more to the experience when you keep them on. Creature design is really good with the antagonists resembling something human, but having that sense of having something wrong with them. The environment twists and changes causing a large amount of disorientation and it gets incredibly tense when you turn a corner and realise that you have just passed that section...\n\nGameplay:\nThe door mechanics were slightly annoying to start with, but these were patched and work a lot better now. It took a while to figure out exactly what the benzo pills were doing and why they were needed, but you kind of get a feel for them after, although levelling off the insanity sometimes takes too many and you quickly run out. The mechanics of having a lighter with unlimited fuel and a torch with limited battery create a great dilemma... Do you stay with a very short range of vision and end up running into a creature or do you use the torch to see further ahead? Leaning around corners can be pretty handy, but normally end up scaring the hell out of you when something actually is there. Lacking a real tutorial or introduction to the game, you will have to figure out a lot for yourself, but that just adds to your investment in the way the story plays out.\n\nSound:\nThe sound design is genius. We bought the soundtrack as well. From the lights popping to the voices in your head and the auditory hallucinations the player seems to experience regularly, everything just gels together. We genuinely believe that the only other person to have gotten the sound design right on a game like this was Akira Yamaoka on Silent Hill 2. There's a few moments where there is just total silence. After having the orchestrated music playing and then to stop, it really creeps you out. It's also not overused, either. All the effects and voice acting fit in perfectly. Even down to the typewriter noises or scribbling sounds on the notes. The appearance of the creatures are accompanied by a very stressful orchestral stab and really increase the tension for the player.\n\nVerdict:\nThis game has done a fantastic job at creating a truly creepy atmosphere. The pacing and timing of the creature appearances are perfect and are not overdone. The sound makes you jump and build tension like no other recent horror title available. For something created by just five guys, it is a great venture into the genre and the mainstream games world in general. We can't wait to see more from Rubycone in the future.\n\nFinal score: 9 out of 10","March 22, 2015","true","3.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But when you finish the game and start all over... well for me it has no replay value. Except maybe try to hunt for those achiements, but I'm not much of a ''achiement hunter''. Sometimes I do hunt those too :> but these days I don't have much time, nor do I care much of that stuff anymore. I was just looking for a good horror game. And it was at first, but after the first run, it stops being scary. Because it offers nothing new :/\n\nFor that reason I think 20 bucks for this game is a bit too much.

Hektor is like a mix of Amnesia and The Stanley Parable.  Amnesia because no weapons and you find items and it's like The Stanley Parable because you'll walk down a corridor to a dead end then turn around and find your path completely changed.  One time I kept walking through a looping sequence and didn't know where to go so I decided to turn around and walk the other direction...only to find the path changed and was able to go to a new area!  Another interesting fear factor to this game is that unlike most horror games that drive the fear and jump scares right from the beginning, Hektor sort of toys with you for a while.  It leaves you wondering when it's going to do it.  Dark corridors, lights blowing out, whispers in the dark...at one point I was nearly begging for the game to just come get me so I'd have some form of closure, LOL!  Play this game at night with headphones on, if you dare!\n\nPros\nVery creepy!\nIrregular paths, changing environment.\nUnpredictable scare moments.\nFind items to proceed - sense of quest.\nThings will come get you...but when?\n\nCons\nNo real storyline.\nSometimes hard to figure out what to do to proceed.\nEnding - I was left scratching my head.\nPills - you take them to keep your sanity but they don't seem to do very much.\nSanity effect - as your character looses sanity the screen twists and changes color.  The twisting and swaying is a bit too much and if you have motion sickness sensitivity that may be a big issue for some gamers.  By default it's set to 100%.  Do yourself a favor and turn it down in settings.\nRare glitch - toward the end of the game I encountered a glitch where the area kept looping.  Normally this can happen if you require an item but not in my case.  There was no way out of this loop.  If this occurs just restart the game and it should get back on track.","July 2, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I think that in terms of a framework for the game, there is something to be said about the way it is structured. Yes, the environments are repetitive, but it actually makes sense as the plot unveils itself. Where this game goes wrong is in execution, lack of interaction and just plain laughable aping of the genre.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Good enough story to keep you entertained\n+ Interesting twist to the effects on your vision as you move through the game, makes it very difficult to concentrate if left unchecked\n+ Plenty of opportunities for good old jump scares!\n\nCONS:\n\n- Terrible enemy design... I stood behind a box and watched the 'predator' run straight at me with no regard for the obstacle for about a minute straight. Basically, he couldn't make a decision to go around the box. Also, the sound effects for when he gets close are really bad\n- M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist that kind of smothers the build up\n- Feels way too much like a bad Outlast\n- Achievements are glitched, how do I get all the ones for dying AND not dying or taking damage in one run?\n\nOverall, you can spend $10 in many ways that would leave you worse off. However, this game is not as polished or fleshed out as its peers, leaving you disappointed at what could have been. Maybe worth a sale purchase if you are burning money in your wallet, but otherwise, I'd steer clear unless the game sees some major upgrades.\n\n5/10\n\nPS - (SPOILERS)\n\nAnyone else get Twin Peaks vibes from the dream sections?","April 30","false","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a Great Game!\n\nPros / Cons / Long Version:\nPros:Story is... intruiging? ...confusing? ...well, no mater what, I loved it untill the end!\nNarrating of the letters is really great!\nWhispers and speach that help you along the way is good.\nMusic really fits and sets the mood of the game.\nSound effects are good.\nGraphics are... OK. Defenatly more a Pro than a Con.\nReally loving the randomness and the confusion the procedural map generation creates!\nAnd even though there is no level design and the layout is procedurally generated, the same rooms you've been in are cycled trough; so doors etc you've opened are still open and the most important thing: You can learn the escape routes trough those rooms cause you're gonna need to know when one of them horriffic things catches your scent.\nSometimes the monsters are sneaky, creeping up all the way to you if you don't pay attention.\nSometimes they make quite a bit of noice so you'd better hurry away from there before they find you!\nNot much hand holding... your'e just confused and scared all the time! Awesome!\nCons:Some glitches... some freezes (only when I tried to view the journal though)...\nSome walking to close to an object and you seems to try and jump on top of them... (even though you can't jump in this game)\nOnce I was so scared I fell trough the world; pretty much at the begining when you start off in the isolation cell. I walked out, saw a monster, ran like a scaredy-cat back to the cell and noticed missing walls, floor but with furniture in the rooms and hoped 'graphical glitch I can hide in there!'...I couldn't, there was no floor... I fell... and fell... and fell... and...[\spoiler]\nIt's can be a little hard to open/close doors.\nYou end up going to the same place to pick up things a little to frequently due to the recycling of rooms.\nI can understand why people say they get 'carsick' from this game (it seems to be a rather drunk driver).\nAI ain't the best... although you better bring your swift pair of legs, them claws and jaws sure are sharp and hungry!\n...what about all those drugs? Never really got the hang of'em...\nConnclusion:OK, some things may be better with a bit of polish... It always will no matter how much polishing you do!\n\nSo with that said I will go on stating this:\n\nAwesome atmosphere!\nThrilling and Scary with an intriguing story!\nAnd also... really darn confusing at times!\nI really liked it. It's a great game!\n\nAs for replayability;\nNot super high (even though levels are 'procedurally generated').\nI really enjoyed the notes and their narrating and wanted em all for story purposes.\nAfter that you can go achievement hunting.\nSome might be quite a pain if you're not lucky since... well it's all random!\nAlso when you get to know all the monsters and have explored quite a bit it get's a tiny tad less scary.\nTo me however it never completley lost it's touch like alot of other games tend to do.\nI never lost the feeling that I defenatley still needed to keep those swift legs of mine in shape.\n\nBut is it worth the 20€...\nIt's really dangling on the edge but I'll go ahead and say:\nMmmyesh, but barley due to it being rather short.\nIf you happen to catch it for less than this though, it's a steal!\n\nSo now time for a tiny anekdote:...what is that faint sound?\nThat wasn't there the last time i had to quit and now I've just started this level and there's not much but dead ends behind me...?\n*Turns around to face horrific shimmering shadow creature who's clowly creeping up on me from behind but lets out a horrific shriek when I notice it's presence*\n*Heart pounding while trying to climb the walls to escape and don't know whom of us screams the most!*\n...I finally got passed it and while trying to hide in the worst place possible thinking *it's coming, it's coming, it's coming...*.\nThen when I finally manage to calm down just a bit to dare look out the door... it's gone!\nI FRIGGI'N WON THAT SCREAMING CONTEST!\n...or...is it...standing right behind me again?!\n*spins around* and...\nPHEW!!!

Horror, scary, achievments, finding notes from different people, all notes have soundtracks which are all voice acted very well. There are supposed to be 40 notes, so far I have found 22 in 7 Hours of Play. There are other collectables; Food, Anxiety Pills, Batteries, etc. There are different types of scares, music, lights, jump scares.  There are some puzzles to solve.  Sometimes you have to look twice before a clue will appear. Lots of doors to try to open, some of them will actually open. I couldn't stand the wavy visuals, so every time I returned to the game, I turned the strange effects down to minimum, which is 30 %.  I would suggest doing the same. Its on the Video control. Sound Control: I turned the music down to 60% and had the voices and other sounds at 100 %. I always had to uncheck the reverse axis box in the game controls. All the controls are quite easy, with a light learning curve. You can crouch, run, walk.

It's not perfect, but it is a wonderful achievement. I found myself at first a bit baffled and lost, though it quickly became apparent that those were the intentions of the developers. I'm really looking forward to them getting controller support down (mostly let me invert my camera stick please) but as it stands, Hektor is one for all those who have been let down by so many horror games of late. Thank you, and well done.\n\nEDIT: Just to add a note here, not only do i still recommend this game, but the developers are super friendly and hard working and quickly respond to their community as well as own up to and attempt to fix any issues the game has. To all the people complaining about "nauseating" effects (I didn't have that problem) they actually added multiple sliders in the options menu to tone it down.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/recommended/334070/","CrazyCanuck84","CrazyCanuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/","859 products in account","What's there to say about Hektor?\n\nFor starters, it's actually a well done horror title. While not entirely unique, it does enough right, and does it differently, to stand out from what is an overcrowded genre.\n\nHektor casts you as a patient of some sort, exploring and trying to figure out just what is going on. As you visit different rooms, the game literally does change the environment around you. Running around a corner only to hit a dead end, you'll see a room has appeared where you just came from, or a hallway leading to various other rooms. It's quite jarring, and works well to keep you guessing.\n\nBecause it is a horror game, there are a few jump scares. Nothing too crazy, and most you won't expect, but they're not overdone. Where Hektor shines is its tension, or rather, the tension it puts on you. There may not be a jump scare around every corner, but you will wonder what's going on for the entire game, especially when you hit the dream sequences. There's quite a lot of 'wtf' moments, for sure.\n\nGraphically, Hektor looks nice. There aren't a lot of effects (smoke, particles, etc.), but the environments are nicely done. The acting is also good, whether it's the voices you hear throughout the game, or the notes you find scattered about.\n\nOn the flipside, Hektor is relatively short. You can finish it in about two hours, give or take a few minutes (or underwear changing breaks). There is no replay value to the game, as once you've beaten it and figured out what's going on (as best you can), there's no incentive to play through again. Perhaps to clean up the achivements you may have missed, if you care about those, but otherwise, no.\n\nSUMMARY\nA worthy purchase, when it's on sale. For the normal retail price ($21.99 CDN), it's a little pricy for the length of the game. Jump scares are good, but not overdone, and the overall being on the edge of your seat makes it a good experience.","June 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nothing is what it seems.\n\nOne more big plus is that I only needed to consult a walkthrough video once. The puzzles and situations are eventually solved by common sense. And then there is the coolest thing about this game, I won’t spoil it for you guys, so read on. But they’ve done something with the way you walk through the maps that’s really really cool!!\n\nThere eventually is a flashlight, but I only used my zippo because it lit more ahead of you.

Any title boasting even a whiff of creepy atmosphere, sign me up. Cardboard-creaky monsters, cliched storylines, monumentally dumb protagonists? I don't care, sign me up. I also regularly champion indie games. I've played my fair share and count several of them among my absolute favorites. I've played, and loved, so many "bad" games, I even write a blog as testament:\n\nhttps://wkduffy.wordpress.com/\n\nNow that's done, you can probably see what I'm about to say from a mile away: I'm going to have to give Hektor an enthusiastic thumbs down. Ouch! It's hurts me more than it hurts you.\n\nThe main problem here is the translation from idea to actual gameplay, in my opinion. Hektor is (or was, at launch) much touted as "that game where the environment keeps changing all around you like a big head trip." Well, this is true; hallways twist and turn, sometimes evaporating into thin air behind you when you're not looking. Familiar doors appear in front of you, and suddenly you find yourself walking through a deja-vu loop of hallway-room-hallway-room, straight out of some Twilight Zone episode. I'm trapped inside a room, that's inside a room, that's inside a room! AHH!! Or do a 180 to reveal that the path you just traversed has turned into a dead end brick wall.\n\nOK, cool. But when the environments are all incredibly samey (I mean, you pretty much have identical sets of dirty white concrete hallways, closets, wooden desks and doors ad nauseum here--you will NOT find any smidge of variety in this game whatsoever), the long-term effect of this constantly shifting environment...lands with a thud. Who cares? It all looks the same anyway--what does it matter if it's shifting about willy nilly? It ends up not being interesting nor creating any real sense of confusion, tension, mystery, or horror. Darn it.\n\nIn fact, it engenders the opposite...a nagging feeling of ennui. I literally found myself saying out loud:\n\n"Clearly, it doesn't matter which hallway or door I choose, which direction I turn, or what I do. The game ends up sending me where it needs to in order for me to progress. I don't need to memorize locations or anything. All I really need to do is just push the thumbstick forward and the game will build itself around me until I get to the end." Yup, pretty much sums it up.\n\nI'm surprised the developers didn't consider this possible effect before committing to this questionable design decision. Talk about alienating your player.\n\nNext, if you take that effect and add to it the fact that the "predator" stalking you throughout the game can kill you upon sight (you have no way to defend yourself; nor can you outrun it; nor can you even effectively hide from it--seriously, there's nothing you can do but stand there and wait for the game to kill you and restart)...well, you end up having absolutely no connection to what is happening, no sense of agency, no sense that any of your actions matter at all. And the puppet-like predator loses all sense of horror the second time you see it--and you will see it repeatedly as it hacks away at you robotically before the screen goes dark. I try not to play the "comparison game" too often honestly, but in this case for some reason, I couldn't help but think how far, far, far away Hektor is in quality from anything Frictional has ever created (for instance). These developers don't have "it," and I don't see them finding "it" any time soon.\n\nAs a note-picking-up simulator that attempts to tell a shadowy covert-government-sponsored-brainwashing story (I guess?), it has some pretty well done voice acting. And the music is so suitably depressing (and professionally recorded), I assumed it was simply canned music from some licensed collection. But it appears the sounds were recorded specifically for the game. Kudos on that.\n\nBut it's not compelling enough (or properly fleshed out enough) as a narrative to make you care about it or the poor souls inhabiting this world. Hektor tries to do some interesting things, but it's a weak, weak indie. And what the heck does Hektor mean, anyway? That's the flavor which was left in my mouth after the final cutscene played followed by the credits. A weak, meandering fog of...nothing, really.","February 22","false","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

HEKTOR is about the memory of a political assassination and more the process to extract such memory. The introduction of mind control apparatus rings a bell to MK Ultra in Black Ops, or real world scenario, the whatsup of the matter shrouded in myth.\n\nI have to say there were quite many arts, and in this case games, conceived by the Nordic people, though with so far very limited exposure to me and still have left very positive impression from my standing point.\n\nDark, Functional, Deep, Cold, Not One Ounce Deadweight. But full of thoughts and life.\n\nIt is that kind of rapture that I have long since forgotten, which struck me when I suddenly see the ending credits, and that's where I confirmed one of the names, actually the 1st must have been Nordic.\n\nBe sure to check out a Nordic movie called "Valhalla Rising", starring Mads Mikkelsen, an epic that's both calm and violent to the extremes.\n\nThanks for the read.\n\nWIsh I had mead.\n\n=)\n\n\nAnd thank taz for the nice ideas in post editing.","August 20, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

After the credits, I didn't ahave anything : no diginity, nor hope. Except the urge of forgetting this painful experience.\n\nThe gameplay is boring, the game design repetitive and boring, the week-ends at my grandmma are more epic and interesting. The story's lame. So lame it doesn't even exist.\n\nSome ghosts screaming. YAY. I'll have to change my underwear.\n\nThe Predator ? The first time it's an effective jumpscare. The 30th time you just can't wait to finish the level and you don't even try to avoid it anymore. Double punishment here : it's not frightening and it's very annoying to get back at a random place each time you get caught by this thing.\n\nIt's still an absolutely astonishing Door Opener Simulator. I didn't even thought that opening door could be so difficult, but it was without a doubt my favourite part of the game <3\n\nSo, let's talk about bugs : the achievments are popping randomly (I got killed an infinite number of time and got the achievment where you're supposed to never have been injured and I spend litterally all my time eating hundreds of pills and got the achievment of not taking any pill...), the objects sometimes just fly in the air, the notes are colectible any number of times, which is very stupid. And, the most annoying one I think, the fullscreen is not properly made so any click will bring you back to the desktop. A must-have in order to definitely kill the potential beginning of living the game.\nThe sound design and the cheap graphics only have one motto : cheap jumpscares. YAY again. It's vomitive and ugly.\n\nDon't buy this game, keep your money. You really just should go out and grab a pizza with some friends or buy some disguises I don't know. But really, REALLY don't buy this game. Keep your money for buying a real good game, Dear Esther, Gone Home, The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter, Everybody's Gone To The Rapture, SOMA, etc...\nYou'll thank me one day.","February 26","false","2.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The voice acting on the other hand is interesting, a bit less imersive than the audio but for the fact that a small team made this with limited time and money its great.\n\nGraphics:\n\nIts good, the quality can be a bit un-even, but that is okay. There are a few glitches like decals which appear to have inverted normals, or flickering sometimes. Some flares leak through doors ect. Though these are very small gripes.\n\nScary Factor:\n\nWhile initially this game didn't seem that scary as you go along and the story elements start to make the whole place seem way worse than before, things get pretty tense pretty quick. I feel like any moment I may be physically ♥♥♥♥♥. good job guys!\n\nStorytelling:\n\nIts good, but a little indirect at times, they did take the time to do some hinting in the level design and audio but some things are easy to miss, keep a close eye on everything. From what I can tell so far im completely mistified as to what the story of the place is, but as I go on it gets more and more creepy.

Most of them saying that the game is too short, and that there really isn't a huge threat because the monster doesn't really chase you and rarely shows up.\n\nThat being said, it's still a great horror game, and keep in mind that it was developed by only 5 people. And for 5 people to create this type of horror game that goes on for 2 hours (only if you know EXACTLY what you're doing) is impressive. Furthermore, eventhough the monster might not be chasing you all the type, the eerie and terrifying atmosphere and sound effects makes it seem like they're behind every corner, which frankly scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.

The trailer looked great and gave me this feeling like " man this game is going to be good", but sadly i was dissapointed.\nWhat are the reasons for playing a horror game like this? The story? The jumpscares? The atmosphere? Whatever your reason may be, this game provides none of those in a acceptable way.\nIt feels like everything that this game has, was just touched on the very surface and then thought to be enough. Some more, some less. For example the jumpscares: Of course you will be ready for them at some point like in any other game, however in Hektor it was just horrible. The first time you might get scared, afterwards it just repeats the same jumpscare over and over again, nothing, absolutely nothing different aftwards.\nThe story was almost non-existent. The notes you find just don't say anything interesting at all or even provide enough information for something that somehow might look like a story. I took my time playing this game and even then i didn't know nothing about the story and the things i DID know where so minimal that i already forgot about them.\nOf course i thought "maybe i just missed lots of notes" but i seriously can't believe that. It took me 2 hours to finish this game while looking around, trying to find notes, trying to find out what the hell happens in this game and yet, nothing.\n\nI honestly think this game could've been one of the best games i played lately, it looks like it has much potential, but as it is now i can't recommend this game at all. Especially not for that horrendous price for a game that doesnt even last longer than the generall dlc for any game nowdays.\n","April 8, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU SUFFER FROM MOTION SICKNESS. YOU MORE THAN LIKELY WILL VOMIT***\n\n=======\n\nCONS:\n\n- Movement/Game Machanics/Headache in a box: The motion sickness + headache inducing combo of the visual aspects (a la "psychosis") are terrible. Trying to navigate my way through the game, I found myself more aggravated at the fact that I couldn't see anything well enough to properly grasp the scope of the game than being scared, frightened, or slightly immersed. I was just frustrated, dizzy, slightly nauseous, and disappointed.\n\n- Scares: I really didn't find this game scary in any aspect. Why? See above.\n\n- Puzzle-solving: It's a drunken scavenger hunt with a shifting hedge-maze thrown into the mix.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Good atmosphere: ...when you actually notice the atmosphere. (Hard to understand? You haven't played Hektor..)\n\n+ Audio/visual: For what is present in the game, it's not bad. I get an "Amnesia" or "Penumbra" vibe from it big-time, and it does it well enough that it could be a good game, overall. It COULD be. It just needs to lose the "psychosis"/"pill-popping" mechanic. It's terrible.\n\n+ Shifting Areas: I really enjoy the feeling of having the world shift around me as I move through it. It's really unique, in a sense, as most games don't do this sort of thing, and it impressed me for a moment when I was playing. However, that feeling quickly fell to frustration as I desperately tried to cling to my senses of perception as I played, and not feel the need to avert my eyes. Again, the swooping mechanic draws my attention away from the positive, and all I could focus on was my frustration at having to fight to get anything done :/\n\n=======\n\nIn the video on the Store Page, it shows segments where the character is walking around and exploring as if he's totally fine, and there's no blur~! What, were my characters pills defective?

Spoilers. Duh.\n\nLet me start this review off by saying this game has wonderful atmosphere and music. The graphics are crisp and clean, I was never confused about what anything was appearance wise with the exception of the can-shaped objects.\n\nThis game did manage to scare me quite a few times (big screams too, not a piddly whimper if you've ever seen my LPs), and the lighting and psychosis wavyness was very well executed.\n\nThe company that makes this game is small and new, and as a first polished title, it's really well done.\n\nNow let me cover the negatives. - Doors are easier after a patch update but can still be finicky. Notes can flicker to show they need to be picked up, but you can't reach them, or you try to pick them up but it's impossible to do so. The main monster can glitch through doors (or maybe he's designed that way, but it made it feel unfair.) The sound effects play randomly which is good for jump-scares, but one some of the voice clips can be annoying when repeated too often. (Stop the water, start the fire!)\n\nThese few negatives are personal and may not be everyone's experience - I found myself lost often, looking for one specific but undisclosed item. This tended to drag the chapters (?) on longer than they would have been if you knew (remotely) what you were doing, and that long exposure to things like the monster can kill some of the creepyness. It also gives me (at least) the sensation of artificial difficulty and longevity to the game. I found myself becoming more annoyed and frustrated than scared.\n\nAll that being said, I think this company definately deserve your support so they can grow and pump out even better games. While the concept is nothing revolutionary, the execution, especially in the mental-only-moments (red curtains) where not only engrossing but attractive to the eye.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n+Music\n+Atmosphere\n+Graphics\n+Psychosis Gimmick (-TAKE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING PILLS o_o-  DON'T TAKE TOO MANY PILLS.. Monster takes your pills :< )\n+Most scares are very well executed\n+When the monster DOES appear, you will probably ♥♥♥♥ bricks.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Slow Paced/ Backtracking/Easily Lost/Lots of looping if you are confused on the objective/aimless searching\n-Can cause motion sickness in some -NEW SLIDER in options to address this issue!\n-Frames started to suddenly drop after a continuous 10 - 15 minutes of play- FIXED? Happened again during this latest patch after not happening in the patch before..\n-Sound: Can't tell what direction monster comes from, I'm in Astro's A-40s using optical out for Dolby surround sound.. so that could be problematic for it?\n-Sound bytes get repeated often\n-Ending felt a bit shoe-horned/rushed/anti-climatic.\n\n\n----Final Update-----","March 13, 2015","true","2.9"," 16 of 45 people (36%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","36","16","45","4","2"
