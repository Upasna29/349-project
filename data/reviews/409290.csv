Hearding dog is a game that is meant for a younger audience. Being myself as a 17 Year old male, probably didnt reflect to the fullest due to my age, BUT I knew that would be an issue so I brought in my brother to play the game a bit. Il get into that later.\n\nWelcome to the dog life, where you catch birds. Chase pigs around and stop those pesky Fox's and Wolf's from harming your animal friends! Your dog has no name, this is where the creativity comes in for you or your child. Name your dog as you play. Make sure its something with meaning. If your kid cant remember what they named it write it down. Better yet, take an ingame screenshot from the pause menu and print it out for your child to hang on the fridge. As you or your child progreses through the game they will learn to bond with it. Even for me, I needed to make sure that I got all the tasks done and done right.\n\nI played through it and enjoyed it very well. So since I knew this was meant for a younger audience, I called my little brother over, sat him on my lap and watched him learn how the game mechanics worked. We plugged in his xbox controller and it worked like a charm. His eyes bounced on the screen as his mind conquered the little tasks that the game asked for him to do. As the joysticks clicked, so did his mind! The ingame tips helped him here and there as he did'nt fully understand why the other animals were running away from him. I had to explain to him that you were supposed to put them there and so on. Then the in-game tip showed up and he understood immediatly, After beating his first level that required and used this game mechanic he squeeled with excitment and continued to play. Thanks to the easy and basic menu layout, he was able to travel to the next level with ease. Did he care that the map was a little wonky  here and there? Not at all. He just wanted to play with spud (Thats what he named him after catching his first bird) again. He knew that spud needed him to complete the task, and (What I told him) spud needs my little bro to complete his task. The perfect duo.He completed multiple levels before I went up and made supper, when I came back down he was 2 level farther then before. Almost to the end I knew, so I got him off to eat. While we ate he talked about him and spud were able to get passed certain obsticles, and how spud was chasing the pigs around the house for awhile ( Level 5 I believe ). He honestly enjoyed this game I can tell. He asked to play more and I simply said " I need to tell more people about this buddy, maybe after if it isn't close to your bedtime"\n\nSo, from a childs perspective he loved it. Found it brilliant for his mind, and it definatly told him about loyalty and teamwork.\n\nOf course I did not have this experience as a teenager at the age of 17, but it was good enough for me to play to the end right?\n\nPros  CHILDREN WILL LOVE THIS GAME\nTeach kids about teamwork and self being\nA fun and simple game meant for a younger audience, not many on steam!\nGood gameplay and works well with a microsoft liscenced controller\nYou dont need a heavy PC to play this. I belive all the settings are auto configured for your PC\nAbility to in-game screenshot\nSimple yet affective game menu. Little bro whipped past it with ease\nSpark convorsation with family, along with possibly getting a real dog for the adventures to continue!\nFun music that fits perfectly with what your playing\nAchievements GALORE. Kids love seeing that pop up after completing a level!\nCons  Will lag a bit here and there, nothing to serious but may be something fixable\nThe world map when changing levels is a bit wonky\nChasing pigs and the other animals can become a pain due to them not going the right way, maybe have some sort of auto-lead to the objective or a closer pull in radious of some sort\nUsing the WASD keys has ALOT of input lag, would recommend only using mouse or gamepad\nAs I find more for the review I will add it in!\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a PRE-RELEASE review and does not condone the full end game. When the game releases hopefully most of the bugs and issues here and there are fixed. Not many have been found!\n\nI would also like to personnaly thank Juan ( The creator of the game ) for giving myself and my little bro the chance to play this game. He gave me the chance to review the game along with giving away a few copies for my group that can be found  here\n\nIt turned out to be much better then expected and I hope to see some DLC come out of it!\n\nThanks alot for reading this ENTIRE review, as I hope to bring in more sales to this amazing Dev!","January 15","true","1.9"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","26","31","3","2"

You control a dog who has to help a farmer after he became sick. You control this dog with the mouse. Left click to set a location for the dog or hold to have it follow the cursor. Right click to make the dog bark. Barking at the farm animals that you are supposed to corral will cause them to spew chunks of poo while farting. The levels are very much the same with a variety of what seems to be 3 objectives: corral an animal, scare away a predator, and/or collect an item. In the time I have played I have visited 2/3 of the levels and received 10/13 achievements.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/409290/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros\nGood for teaching mouse skills to young children\nColor palette for the game is appealing\nCan scare the crap out of animals by barking\nGraphics are very simple\nCons\nWhile it is a short game, the lack of level variety works against the overall game\nIntermittent bugs: immediately closing when hitting escape, animals run out of bounds\nTwo songs in current soundtrack, only one song will repeat for duration of level\nDialogue boxes pop up and take up considerable screen real estate which must be manually closed in time sensitive levels\nAchievements are semi-bugged and will activate when conditions were not actually met\nTwo separate breaking bugs stopped me from progressing on two different attempts of the highest level I reached, at which point I gave up\nGraphics are very simple\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThe parent part of me would recommend this game for teaching a young child to use a mouse. There is no violence and the game mechanics are very simple and predictable from level to level. The gamer part of me would recommend against this game because it largely feels incomplete and several bugs exist, some of which stopped my progress. The developer seems to be still updating this game and this review represents the game state as of February 13, 2016.\n\n3/10\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here !","February 13","false","0.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

It's relaxing and fun. While game is in active development new patches are coming from developer regularly, bugs are fixed, new features introduced and that is very good. I've been playing this game on mobile before and it looks really good over there too.\n\nMusic is fun, but repetitive although in the newest update now you can choose what to listen. I'm sure more and more tracks will be introduced, and may be ability to "randomize" playlist.\n\nAs the game is in early access, so reviews like mine are not good representation of the current status of the game as more and more bugs are eliminated, reviews are outdated quickly, that why I'd recommend this game but not white about bugs :D","February 10","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/409290/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","To put it blunt and to the point, Herding Dog is absolutely abysmal. This is one of the worst games I've ever played, not only on Steam but on any platform whatsoever. It's incredibly obvious that no true love or dedication went into this game on the part of the developer. This game is nothing but a cash grab that boasts itself as "relaxational" and "casual". What Herding Dog truly is, is broken and unfinished. That being said, I do give the artist some kudos.\n\nThe game looks like a mobile port, or that it is laid out to be a mobile/touch screen game. It has various bubble style pop-ups that are exceedingly annoying. These pop-ups act as tutorials, however they not only pop in the middle of your screen, right over what you're doing, but they also appear in the top portion of the screen. I do not understand why these "tutorials" must show themselves twice each time, or why the developer would choose to put them right in the middle of the screen; generally when this happens in other titles, the gameplay is paused for a brief period, but not here.\n\nFrom the beginning, I had no clue what I was doing except for running around, chasing away birds and collecting dog food. It wasn't until the 3rd or 4th level while herding that the aforementioned obnoxious "tutorials" told me that I could bark to help herd an animal in the right direction. Even then, it told me after I'd herded the animals without the use of the bark mechanic. You can herd various animals, such as goats, chickens, pigs, piglets and sheep, and each of them are supposed to react differently, although I saw no difference. The animals habitually got stuck up against rocks and trees, or in the corner of the map as I was herding them, which caused the game to become immensely frustrating. Another frustrating factor is you never know exactly where you should herd the animals to, it's not indicated anywhere except on a specific spot on the level. There's no map or guide system to point you in the right direction, and herding an animal is already bothersome enough without having to chase it all over the map to finally find the "safe zone" it should stay in. As I said earlier, this game is anything but "relaxational".\n\nGlitches, this game is full of them. In fact, as I was playing the last level I was tasked to scare birds, herd animals and fight wolves. Well, I managed to scare away the birds, as I attempted to herd an animal they glitched out with the wolves and disappeared from the entire map, rendering the entire level broken and it forced me to restart. The achievements unlock in the game, but they don't even stay unlocked after you exit the game. I have no idea how that happens, but it does, and it's the first time I've ever seen anything like it.\n\nThe Steam store states "Herding Dog is a delightfully fun game which is guaranteed to make you have a barking good time!" If there were ever a case to sue for false advertising, it would be here. This game is frustrating, annoying, broken beyond belief, unfinished, unpolished and abysmally amateurish. The repetitive music even gets irritating. Stay as far away from Herding Dog as you possibly can. If a friend gifts it to you, unfriend them. Play Bad Rats instead. Watch paint dry. Whatever you do, just do not support this wretched, unfinished title. I've asked for a refund of this game.\n\nPATCH UPDATE:\nFine, fine. You people just like to see me in misery.\n\n+ Herding still sucks, but doesn't suck as bad. Not as frustrating.\n+ Achievements finally unlock.\n+ No more annoying tutorial pop-ups mid screen.\n\n- No tutorial pop-ups whatsoever. Couldn't fix it I guess, so just removed it.\n- Still glitchy. Beating level 3 takes you back to level 1, and it still says "Scare the Birds" but you're catching bunnies.\n- Still the same damn music track for the entire damn game.\n- What new sound effects? One I could count, when the animal you're herding is being selected. Which doesn't always work.\n- The "danger cam" is nice, but it doesn't indicate where the danger IS. You have to still find the fox/wolf.\n- Level 21 is still broken beyond belief. I collected apples, the animals disappeared.\n\nRating: 0.5/5.0 - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","January 16","false","0.6"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","12"

That's all.\nMr. Fox: I understand what you're saying, and your comments are valuable, but I'm gonna ignore your advice.\n\nDon't ignore Badger's advice, Foxy.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nUHG! I don't know why I couldn't post my full review. It seems like "fart" is an okay word, but who knows. Here are my full thoughts, as I wish to share them with the dev and with other gamers.\n\nThe UI is not pretty, but much worse of a flaw, it is not informative. We need a *working* HUD with objectives on the screen - ALWAYS - with real time updates as we progress through them. Sometimes I had 0%, or 0/0 HUDs. Sometimes I had nothing on my screen. Sometimes I would pen the sheep and the game wouldn't end. I needed to get a bucket of "Item +1" that was off on the far corner of the map. How did I know this? Only because the game didn't end when I penned the sheep and I started running around. This is not good. I shouldn't have to guess what I need to do. Add a minimap or directional markers to let me know where my sheep are, my home is and maybe - or maybe not - where the predators are. Make your buttons say Play! not "paw shape". Buttons, HUDs, minimaps-- every UI element should be clear as to what it is telling the player. The world map - it looked okayish in the screenshots, but my map was of a view where all I could see was the dog and the "level" he was at. I couldn't see the next levels. I had no idea what I was doing - or should do - and then I pressed in a few places. One worked and he ran a long way off to level two. It's not a world map if I don't see the world. And all I saw was one level at a time with no context. Again. Make things clear to the player, every level, every objective, every update to the objectives and the rating they might be getting. I mean, aliens - I think - abducted one of my pigs, but I have no idea, honestly. There were coyotes there, too. I didn't see it happen. I was not told ALIENS ABDSUCTED YOUR PIGLET OH NO! Which could be something funny, as well as informative. Because of the bad UI I have no idea why I would get a "D" score when I got 3/5 pigs but a "C" score when I rescued only 1 sheep. Makes no sense and I have no visual feedback as to WHY that is the case. The in-game HUD should tell me what is going on and the scoreboard should be a recap.\n\nThere is very little AI. I mostly found myself trying to be between the sheep and the wolf. The wolves never stopped or ran away when I barked. The sheep never stopped, or ran, when I barked. But they did fart blood! Which makes no sense. I wasn't near them. Or biting them. I certainly couldn't bite wolves or make them fart blood. But sheeps fart blood when I bark and it doesn't kill them or do anything but make em fart blood. TOOT TOOT TOOT! I mean, I guess it's funny, but uh... yea. I run around between the wolves and sheep. The wolves never stop trying to get the sheep, running directly at them in a constant b-line, and only turn away when I turn towards them. But they instantly turn back to run at the sheep the moment I turn away. Barking doesn't scare them. It doesn't call the farmer. It seems pointless except for the farting sheep joke aspect. The stock could be dopey but the predators shouldn't be. And even though sheep are a little fluffy-brained, they don't stand there to get mauled by a wolf. I mean, if they run away from me - farting blood at my barks - then they should run from the wolves, too. It's just common sense. I don't know where you wanna go with this but it seems like something needs to be done to make it more realistic or more interesting, with more depth. Right now I am just mousing between A and B. An A that wants to eat B, and a B that is afraid of me, but not of A, who wants to eat him.\n\nMr. Dev: You are asking people to buy this game and it's not finished, and you don't say that. It sounds like your friend wrote a long review for you, calling you by name and adding a lot of imagined depth to the game that I am just not seeing. It sounds like he knows exactly what you want this game to be, but that seems to actually further highlight what the game isn't yet.\n\nYou need to let people who are paying money for this game know it's not finished, or they are just going to be annoyed with you, downvote your game and/or ask for a refund. You may say "Well this game is for kids!" but like the unfinished alpha game info-- you don't say that anywhere on your store page! And I like kid's things. I love cartoons, kid's books and kid's games. Just because a game is for children does not excuse poor UI design, poor gameplay direction, etc.\n\nI hope you make this game what you invision, because I love dogs, especially Border Collies (hint hint) and Babe. See? I love childish things, and this game has potential, but right now it's not worth as much time as I've spent playing and reviewing it. Best of luck, and hope you can update this game to meet your dream's potential.","January 15","false","0.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Awesomedux/recommended/409290/","Awesomedux","Patbeard the sky bad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Awesomedux/","150 products in account","Herding Dog, is by far the best game of 2016. The charming and viseral art style only hightens the the endorphin rush of being a dog, that herds. From pigs to sheep, even the occasional cameo from a rabbit, this game truly has it all.\n\nThe level of social commentary this game provides is also staggering, never have my views been left in such upheaval from any piece of media. "Herding dog" is a damning representation of "the German Volk" under the Nazi regime, who are without appropriate moral justification, manipulated into "herding" minority groups into ghettos through social stigma. With commands being shouted down from on high from their fascistic society’s prejudices and pressures, they follow the mechanics (or state) into the bloodiest conflict the world has ever seen. Fighting off Wolves and Foxes, (The Allied Powers) whilst doing their duty for the motherland, we see an alternative timeline, with all the "animals" in their places. An Illusion, a pipedream if you will, that all the “work” had been done in the name of the greater good, casting a suspensions on our own reality and raising the question, were we any better?\n\nCannot recommend highly enough, true master piece 6/10\n","January 15","true","0.6"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","25","3","12","5","1"

It makes it hard to have some simple, zen doggy fun when the basic game mechanics don't work as they should (i.e., issues keeping count of the number of rabbits I've caught, forcing me to restart the level over and over again). Also having problems with the game crashing. Furthermore, at least one of the pop-up game tips was cut off, leaving the sentence incomplete; I don't know how that one made it past quality control. Bark-bark woof-woof sad puppy is sad. **EDIT: I did return the game, so some or all of these issues may have been fixed.**","January 15","false","0.4"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","1"

Herding Dog is a colorful game with a cute block-like style. However, the downfall of this game is the controls. I play using an Xbox One controller and the controls are far from responsive. I could not find a button for run which makes it hard to play on the fourth level. The fox/wolf is too fast to keep up with and it got frustrating.\nDespite that it is a cheap, time killer.\n\nI would not recommend this game as of current but if the controls were fixed I would highly recommend this game.","January 15","true","0.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","1"
