But with the launch of this new Ace of Spades came the closing of classic, now Ace fans where forced to either buy this, or never play again.\n\nThe problem is, this game isn't the same as classic Ace, now you might be saying "Oh of course it isn't! It's new and improved!" the thing is, it's really not. The game is poorly optimized where as classic could run on a potatoe, this left out a large chunk of the original playerbase. The game also has a much diferen't weapon balance and it includes classes, it really doesn't feel like the glory that classic was.\n\nBut now, the amazing Ace of Spades community has started a project, a free game on gamejolt called OpenSpades.\n\nOpen spades is almost exactly like classic and honestly better! The sad thing is that this free game is what most classic players imagined Battle Builder would be like, where as this game is $15, OpenSpades is comepletely free!","September 8, 2015","false","2.7"," 652 of 696 people (94%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","94","652","696","31","22"

This game used to be the ♥♥♥♥. I played it before it came to Steam, and it was a simple, yet addicting mix if Team Fortress and Minecraft, and had touches of Battlefield and Roblox. So when it came to Steam, I was understandibly excited. They had greatly improved the gameplay, and had added a plethera of maps, gamemodes, weapons, and 4 classes. The gameplay was tight, the graphics greatly improved, and each class was pretty balanced (Except for the Sniper).\n\nAnd then came the updates. First they added a new DLC, which was 1930's Chicago themed, (No idea why they chose that theme), and for me and many other people, the game would crash instantly when you played it for the next few months. That was the begiining of the end. People could only play the DLC maps if you owned the DLC, and the gamemodes were exclusive to those 2 maps. (People can probably agree with me that City of Chicago would  have been an awesome Zombie map.\n\nThen they changed the skin of the commando to look more "Rambo-y", which looked awful, then they nerfed the Rocketeer class, and turned it into the "Engineer". I actually stopped playing then, 'cause everything that was fun about the Rocketeer (verstile, hit-and-run tactics, great in zombies), and nerfed it. Instead, the Enginner had very low health, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jetpack that ran out of fuel almost instantly, weaker weapons, and weaker items. About half the community, said "♥♥♥♥ this" and walked away. This just left the new players, and the whiny 12 year olds who spammed sniper. This completly ruined the game. Then as if they hadn't done enough damage, they removed the ability to browse servers, and added a lazer module to the Sniper, so whenever you zoomed in, your position would be revealed to everyone on the map. Then they just went ahead and added the Chicago DLC to the game, so people had essentaily wasted 5 dollars on buying it before-hand. The final straw was when they added the "Battle Builder" element. Sounds pretty fun right? No. No it wasn't. The game would lag when ever you tried to put down a larger model, and often the maps were so big that the game would crash. Also nobody played the user-made content. People can't even host their own games.\n\nRight now I can unfortunetly not reccomend Ace of Spades to you.  If Jagex (who has a long history of runing games) decides to patch the game, and remove all of these mistakes, then play it again. But right now, the game is broken, the achivements are unattainable, the community is awful, and filled with griefers and hackers, and the gameplay has been completely ruined. So, with great sadness, I say that this game is unplayable currently, and I would not advise buying it.","April 16, 2014","false","70.7"," 1,076 of 1,216 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","076","1","0","33"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ohayoubaka/recommended/224540/","ohayoubaka","Trump's Lil' Fuckdoll","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ohayoubaka/","76 products in account","UPDATE: Holy shiat this dead game got a new update. Oh wait, most of it is locked away behind a paywall! Hahahahahahahahaha-*gasp*-hahahahhaahaha.\n\nLong read ahead, but worth it!\n\nAs someone who has played Ace of Spades for way too long, let me introduce the history of it to you first:\n\nIn April 2011, somebody called Ben Aksoy released a pretty decent and free FPS with voxel mechanics called Ace of Spades. This was a game that people mostly played on a randomly-generated map similar to Minecraft's randomly-generated maps (only without the trees, only grass, some rivers and more hills). The default and only gamemode at the time was Capture The Flag. All of these in combination allowed for some fun gameplay that required some strategy. Dig tunnels to capture the enemy's intel, or build a fort to defend your own intel. Every man only had a rifle, spade, grenades and some blocks (unlike most FPSes there were no newby spray-and-pray weapons).\n\nAs this game rised in popularity, a certain company called Jagex was interested in purchasing Ace of Spades. As Ben needed some money to keep updating his game, he agreed. At first, Jagex kept this a secret as to not interfere with the growing progress of the game, and its community with all of the mods/maps/gamemodes/scripts that they were producing.\n\nAnd so the game kept updating, but since Jagex's buyout of the game the direction of Ace of Spades had taken a different turn from the old trench-warfare, stragetical FPS it was to a more typical, faster-paced, almost Call of Duty like FPS (SMGs and Shotguns were added, sprinting added, etc). Coupled with new maps such as Hallway and Pinpoint which abondoned some of Ace of Spades' most important features (Hallway doesn't allow you to build a tunnel underground, people usually battle in a very narrow hallway just a few blocks wide, and it's quite easy to just spawncamp if you're at the top, Pinpoint does not allow any tunnels at all, and the whole map is at the same height), and Ace of Spades became not much more than a free Call of Duty + Minecraft game.\n\nAnd then without much warning, development on Ace of Spades almost halted. Only 1 new version was made that was a beta and was not approved to be an update to the main version of Ace of Spades. And then Jagex had announced that Ace of Spades was to be scrapped to make way for their version of Ace of Spades, almost a completely new game, pretty much alienating almost all of the current Ace of Spades community at that time. At first Jagex's Ace of Spades had some popularity, but as people realised how much the game just sucked in general (lack of timely updates, bugs and glitches, game-balancing issues, etc), and the fact that the game was made by Jagex itself (Jagex do not really have the best reputation of a game company) led to the downfall of the game. Although there have been a few great updates (Classic CTF update, Map Editor update, KV6 modding update), it still doesn't excuse the lack of timely updates, especially if almost all if not all of them brought along some bad features or some bugs.\n\nThe new Ace of Spades turned that CoD aspect all the way up to 11, and added some Team Fortress 2 into the mix (while Team Fortress 2 is a very good game by itself, the way it was implemented wasn't). Stuff like Rocket Launchers, Jetpacks, classes were introduced. While some fun could be had in this new game (especially the '30s Gangster game modes, and Classic CTF), it was mostly just a mess. In a typical Ace of Spades match it would not be suprising for you to be accused of "hacking" and getting votekicked for it, people griefing away every block that you build, a lot of spawncamping (but which since has been reduced with a new update that added and changed spawn positions) and just a lot of kids who play the game in general.\n\nIf you really want to buy this game, buy it on a seasonal Steam Sale (Ace of Spades usually, if not always are one of the games that is affected by the sales). Classic CTF (basically what Ace of Spades was before the SMG and Shotgun were added and before the game approached a faster-paced gameplay but with better graphics) and the '30s Gangster game modes (VIP, Territory Control) are really the only modes worth playing, maybe with the occasional normal CTF and Diamond Mine too. You should stay away from playing TDM or Zombies (these are the 2 gamemodes which suck the most, and where most of the kids are at in Ace of Spades).\n\nOtherwise if you're not willing to pay, you can try the classic, free version of Ace of Spades at buildandshoot.com, if you like the same, crappy overplayed maps (Hallway, Pinpoint), spray and pray SMGs, playing with a lot of Brazillians who don't speak a single letter of English and people who need to use aimbots/wallhacks to play well.\n\nTL;DR: Both the Jagex's Ace of Spades and the "classic", free version of Ace of Spades that can be found at Build & Shoot suck, but suprisingly it's the Jagex version that sucks less, because at least it has some kind of variety in gameplay.","November 1, 2014","false","108.3"," 882 of 1,022 people (86%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","86","882","1","40","47"

But due to the nature of the engine and the fact that there's no such thing as a Cython developer (not a typo!) with 5 years' experience I seriously doubt they will ever get this game out of its constant state of disrepair.\n\nThe official streams on Twitch don't happen anymore, the game keeps crashing, the balance needs fixing (I'm talking about how there's no good counter against a Miner, so stop crying about the "noob snipers" or "noobtube" or asking for an SMG buff), and to be blunt everyone's moved to Block 'n' Load so the forums are just filled with Lincent talking out of his shared speech and excretion orrifice saying the same thing over and over again and thinking that he is even remotely funny.\n\nThis project has simply not been managed at all ever since Jagex started work on the original AoS (I'm talking around about 0.61, where the updates were starting to slow down horrendously), and it's a miracle they managed to bring some coherence out of what I hear was at release a huge griefing simulator with just about every sense of user content stripped away, user content that was creatable in the original AoS.\n\nAnd they have constantly farted around with the issue of dedicated servers, trying really hard to slightly misunderstand us every step of the way. Even when they released their "dedicated servers", it was via a Multiplay panel, which was never what we asked for anyway, and having actually used the admin tools I can tell you right now that they are absolutely pathetic - the only redeeming thing really was that they forgot to remove the IRC bot, which is absolutely vital when adminning AoS 0.x. It's just too damn impractical to ban someone properly - you have to download the log file, look up the Steam ID, add it to the banned Steam IDs list, and then RESTART THE SERVER.\n\nThat's pretty much what's wrong with it. It's a sad tragedy of what happens when management just outright sucks, and what you end up with is a game that's broken and stays broken and doesn't get updated properly.\n\nThere's actually some really good ideas in this, but due to the things I stated in the second paragraph, and the fact that if this ever gets any more updates at all it'll be months before that happens, I cannot recommend this game.\n\nAnd due to the fact that AoS 0.75 is generally terrible, I can't recommend that, either.

Ace of Spades began as a cult-classic browser shooter that garnered a small, but loyal community. Ever since Jagex, however, picked up the rights to the title, it's all gone downhill. A drastically redesigned class system, terribly-designed maps, and a by-the-numbers list of gamemodes seems to complete the new Ace of Spades. The only "plus" to this mess is the mining and terrain destruction. Prolonged carnage on certain maps leave the land radically changed, forcing players to adjust their tactics. Another good use of the mechanic is as the Engineer, blasting your way through fort walls and bases with your Drill Cannon and your dynamite charges.\n\nUnfortunately, that's as far as the fun goes. The rest of the classes are either terribly overpowered, or too weak to overcome their opposition. You're better off trying to find a website hosting the original browser-based version, because the "new and improved" Ace of Spades just isn't enough fun to warrant prolonged use.","July 13, 2013","false","11.1"," 377 of 551 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","377","551","0","0"

That's my basic summary of this game.\n\n38/100\n\nNow let me make an edit and give a more detailed review about this game.\nFirst of all, the maps are simply way too large. To reach from 1 end of the map to another in Zombie nearly takes forever and the terrain is complicated to navigate through except for a few maps. Most of the servers are empty anyways.\n\nIn Zombie, players can simply build a stairs into the middle of the sky and destroy it's path to get up there. Zombies only get a hand and a pillar which you will find impossible to scale/climb in order to reach higher. And I mean, Zombies only get melee and players can simply overpower them with their guns like that.\n\nThen later on, you don't get spawn protection. Snipers camping in their own little towers that can be built within a click and climbed within seconds will find you in their scopes in no time and shoot you as soon as you spawn. Completely fair, right?\n\nDespite spawn camping, they have to make a respawn time that lasts 10-12 seconds so basically if you die within a second of spawning you might just as well wait another 12 secs for it.\n\nThen the player movement, sigh. So while walking is extremely slow, running makes you too quick. If you try to stop at 1 point you simply keep on going for a while. Fell of a cliff once because of this. Would be great if there was a "brake" function. And players who played minecraft before, just a note for you guys. Players can jump TWO blocks high and simply walk over 1 blocks as if it was stairs. They also get infinite blocks to build with. Breaking blocks would take a short period of time yet a whole load of them to break through.\n\nAnd lastly, graphics is definitely a thing that can improve.\n\nEverything I wanted to say.

My friends and I had tons of fun playing the original (FYI can still be played online if you look hard enough.) When I heard Jagex... JAGEX! bought the rights off the original dev, I was worried. And then I see what they did to the game, i just couldn't believe it.They ruined the fun tactical gameplay we used to have, and replaced it with this piece of crap. They put in jetpacks and miniguns and made it this generic over the top game, ruining the whole concept of the original. Don't even look at this game, or any game developed by Jagex.\n\nEDIT: I would also like to say there are not as many lag issues now as there were at launch, and votekick has been improved. It's sad how they took so long to fix these issues.\n\nEDIT 2: They added a 'classic' mode aswell. It is similar to the original beta, but still not as fun. No one plays it, and the amazing maps and large scale battles are not to be found here. It's a nice addition, but is still not worth buying if you were looking for something even remotely similar to what the original offered.","November 25, 2013","false","2.4"," 434 of 693 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","434","693","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherofducklings/recommended/224540/","motherofducklings","lastly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherofducklings/","842 products in account","DON'T BUY THIS GAME. IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL ACE OF SPADES (BETA), AND JAGEX HAS RUINED IT COMPLETELY.\n\nAfter the main dev bcoolface sold his game over to Jagex Studios (a.k.a the company best known for "Runescape"), they've flipped the game around, essentially it is incomparable.\n\nAoS used to be a slow-paced shooter, where it was more of a build-your-own-cover-first type game (or "build and shoot") then what it is now: a run-and-gun, CoD-like style shooter. There are even pre-fabricated voxel structures because of its "fast-paced" nature, but guess what? Near zero building in ANY gamemode or ANY maps.\n\nTo be honest, it feels like one of CS:GO's Lego maps, where the map feels voxelized in a sense, but it's just another environment. Like I said, nothing impressive is worth building anymore due to the destructive nature of the new Miner class (yes, they actually added combat classes you can choose from), and Satchel Charges will easily blow up anything you build. Bridges aren't worth building anymore, holding Sprint while Jumping will clear at a distance of 6 blocks. In the old Voxlap version, water physics would drag and slow you down. In Jagex's version? Doesn't feel like it at all.\n\nRemember the cliché 'cahirs'? They don't even have those in pre-fabs.\n\nAlso, the game is labelled as "indie", I can guarantee it should not be under such category.\n\n\nIf you'd like to save your $10 (it's not worth getting, trust me), you can play our original, Voxlap client version at:\n\nhttp://buildandshoot.com or http://minecraftwithguns.com\n\nIt's free and open-source. We will never charge you a single penny, though donations are welcomed.\n\n\nTL;DR - Same name, but different game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rusticsaxon/recommended/224540/","rusticsaxon","Saxonaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rusticsaxon/","130 products in account","Do not waste your money. Sometime ago, a game was created by Ben Aksoy (the original creator) based off of World War I that slowly evolved into what is now the old Ace of Spades. The game at the time was free to play, and although it had its quirks -- built on the voxel engine, occassional hackers, and so on -- it was routinely updated, simplistic, and took the FPS genre on a new, exciting, and unexplored path.\n\nFor a game of its stature at the time, it was quite entertaining and many of these quirks could be forgiven. Players were able to build structures, destroy structures, and the game struck a unique balance that was perfectly calibrated between the two. Fortifications, trenches, castles and towers -- the original Ace of Spades had it all, and beautifully made landscapes slowly turned into grotesque warzones of battered walls, crumbling buildings, gunfire, and holes from grenades.\n\nVast networks of tunnels made sure you were always on edge; never sure where the enemy would come up, yet constantly haunted by the sound of their digging beneath your feet. War in the old Ace of Spades was raged across towers and peaks, on the ground in trenches and fortifications, and the crowded blown-out tunnels that fed one's claustrophobia.\n\nThere was much work to be done about this game, graphically it was very basic. Gameplay, it was painlessly simple, and it had a direction that it was going, but it didn't lie to you about what kind of game it was. Then Jagex, the makers of Rune Scape, had bought the game from Aksoy. At first, many people within the community watched to see if Jagex would take the game and continue developing it further, exploring this unique and unwandered path of the genre. Up until this point, Aksoy had worked on the game alone; the possibilities of what a team of developers could do with such a game had many excited, and some nervous.\n\nThe result of what you have here, is the biggest joke a gaming company has ever committed alongside the likes of the E.T. fiasco that has long faded from memory. Rumours surfaced that Jagex had constricted Aksoy to NDAs, especially after he tried to get the game back. (Pay in mind, unconfirmed rumours) The company then went back on promises it made to the Ace of Spades community, migrated it to a new engine, and took the game away from its potential. They built it around classes, changed things, and made it feel more familiar (though they couldn't even do this right) to the arcade FPS genre styles we've seen in places like Team Fortress. The game quickly became sniper-haven, and the community who had enjoyed the old Aos was outraged.\n\nJagex's Ace of Spades died out within a year, with the servers becoming vacant and the game no longer interesting. It became nothing more than a rotting, putrified carcass horribly butchered by Jagex's developers; and then left out in the open without so much as a courtesy to bury the poor thing. Ace of Spades died with Jagex, and what was an amazing potential for a game to explore was cut short by a parasitic company. Aksoy has subsequently disappeared, his social media accounts, website -- all of it has been taken down.\n\nI played the original Ace of Spades not long after it was first created. And I was one of the hopefuls that were excited when Jagex purchased the game, and I had to fight for a refund from Steam in a process that took about a month thereafter. Many did the same, and Jagex received tons of refunds. The game turned into such a cookie-cutter disappointment, that I've now eternally labelled Jagex as nothing more than a failed, parasitic company with no ounce of creativity. I've resigned myself to never purchasing a Jagex game in the future, and as we've seen with Rune Scape, and now the recent rumours of them being bought out, they're nothing more than a failed company.\n\nWhat Jagex has brought to light, however, is a growing problem among the gaming market over overbearing companies -- such as Jagex -- that have eyed indie-games like parasites. Companies that see these indev games as being quick money makers; who prey on these starting out or independent developers to fix their financial, marketing, or creative woes because of their poor management and inability to run a gaming company effectively. Jagex has gone down the road of other publishers such as Electronic Arts and Ubisoft, that have become nothing more than jokes to be laughed at, and companies to be gazed at with suspicion for their tendency to screw over the markets.\n\nAnd this isn't the only problem the gaming market is facing by these companies. People look at Early Access sales with more apprehension, because of developers that have been successful at wooing the community, raking in cash, and then abandoning the projects (Star Citizen has been pulling people's legs for years now). We've seen companies release games that are nothing more than hollow husks, and all of the actual content is in DLCs priced almost as much as the original game. (Elite Dangerous, Civilisation, Age of Mythology)\n\nWe've seen parasitic companies, who have no other intention but to bleed consumers dry and destroy a game as much as possible. (Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Microsoft, and Jagex) This has, unfortunately, made people more hesitant towards those developers that are actually trying to produce not only quality but original content, and are just trying to break into the market without having to worry about the market titans breathing down their neck. We've seen this now with both Electronic Arts and Ubisoft attempting to drag people away from Steam's platform with Uplay and Origin, because they want to monopolise on the market. So, if you want to ask what is killing the gaming market, and what murdered Ace of Spades -- you may settle your eyes on the grotesque vultures such as Jagex.\n\nWhat is left of the old Ace of Spades community has recreated the original game. You can play the original voxel-based version now called Build and Shoot, or you can search for the graphically upgraded version called OpenSpades. Both are free and access the same servers. It's unfortunate that what Ace of Spades was meant to be will never come to fruition, and these two community based versions will never be further developed, but they are still very fun to play and still have populated servers.\n\nI understand this review has come out more as a rant, especially against these companies, but it is especially frustrating to see this happen. The best thing that could ever happen to the gaming market is if some of these cancerous companies went bankrupt, that's about all they're worth. However, such a possibility doesn't seem likely, and instead we'll be forever graced by their disappointments.","April 17","false","1.7"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","0"

I'm kind of 50/50 about it, to be honest. It's what I play for anywhere from 10 minutes to hours at random.\n\nI'll start by naming off the PROS:\nFun game to grief play when there's nothing else you'd rather be doing.\n\nGoes on sale occasionally for anywhere from $1-$5.\n\nGame mechanics are somewhere between Team Fortress 2, Minecraft and Call of Duty.\n\nFun, childish graphics that can run on any crapass computer. (Though I suggest running on a computer with decent specs so that you can set draw distance wide open.)\n\nVery small download.\n\nAfter you start playing a better different game, you can hop on AoS for a few minutes to warm up your sniping skills.\n\nFairly active community that loves this game. Also, many people talking online if that's your thing.\n\nFinally, the CONS of this game:\nAs much as I personally hate updates, I believe this game could use more of them. I mean, this game is very small, the maps can be made in-game and take all of 5 seconds to download on a dialup connection. What gives, Jagex? Update this game, have seasonal events, make it fun.\n\nCan be somewhat janky if you don't have a pro MLG fiber optic connection at your house, which should built right next door to the DSLAM.\n\nThose people that I mentioned that are on in-game chat can often be mildly autistic very spammy, quite hostile and will ragequit if you so much as land a single headshot on them.\n\nIf you land a headshot on anyone else, even after several clips worth of misses and bodyshots, you're a hacker.\n\nYou'll get rekt until you have 150+ hours of gameplay invested.\n\nWhen you finally have that much invested, you're a hacker.\n\nYou WILL be griefed. Just chill out. The griefer will get bored and either leave or get vote kicked.\n\nYou WILL be votekicked even if you didn't grief or hack. Do not chill out. Demand a refund from Jagex and uninstall this game after leaving a bad and vague review.\nThat about wraps it up. In my opinion, only buy this game if you see it on sale, unless you are eager to play it. If you'd like to try  an old, watered-down piece of ♥♥♥♥ that only people who played this game in beta still prefer  a free, older version of this game, then feel free to download Openspades.\n\nEDIT:Jagex did a Halloween 2014 event. Right on, Jagex.\n\nEDIT:It appears that this review may have rekt offended certain people. Please refer to the comment section of this review to voice your concerns on why you disagree with this review.

Firstly this game has ZERO SINGLEPLAYER FUNCTIONAILTY, it is purely an online experience. This used to be a great thing that allowed for the developers to focus on the portion of the game that truely mattered to them. Now however the multiplayer UI (User Interface)and matchmaking service is simple unusable, the old UI allowed for easy access to every single active Ace of Spades game on the internet and had filters based on region. The newer UI forces you to use the "quickmatch" feature, this feature is neither quick nor effective, 9/10 times it will drop you in a game with no players other than yourself. Also it is now no longer possible to join other Steam users games, as me and my friends discovered to our surprise, this means you are entirely reliant on the broken matchmaking system. When you do eventualy get into a playable match the game is fun until you notice the extrrmely unbalanced weaponry such as the double barrel shotgun on the Engineer class. The shotgun has an effective range (one shot kill) of roughly 10 blocks, it will also two shot kill at roughly 20 blocks. For comparison the SMG does roughly 10-15% damage per hit and is effective when within a 30 blocks radius of an opposing player. This game used to be great, but now due to the broken matchmaking, and the inability to reliably find a game I cannot recomend this title to anyone.","December 2, 2013","false","53.3"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","36","53","0","1"

I remember for a long time being in constant fear when ever I hopped on a server of randomly falling over dead because of stealthy marksman, or having the ground fall out from under my feet so that I can land on a bomb in case the fall wasn't enough to take me out. There was even a chance that if someone sat still too long, a Miner would sneak up on you and smite you where you stood. The rocketeer (engineer for the new players) was hated for his ability to quickly get ouf out of a slippery situation. There were some unique game modes that each provided a new experience every time you played. The game was balanced. The game was hard. The game was fun.\n\nBut of course it didn't last.\n\nIt all started back in late spring, with what I refer to as "The Great NERF." Jagex published the game, and when they took over development they did what they normally do: listen to the complaints of the people who die because they can't figure out how to play properly. The game lost its balance when the sniper had a beam attached to it. No more suspense about "where are the Marksmen hiding?" Then, miner's weapons were decreased in power so that someone sitting around doing nothing would have a chance to fight back when he's attacked. The rocketeer was changed to the engineer and had his jetpack and glide pack removed from the game entirely. No more escapes. now that class is useless with nothing but the weak SMG to fight with. Then, last but not least: They buffed the commando. The commando class was originally no better or worse than anyone else. He could either hold the rocket launcher or the minigun. The minigun, while a powerful and reliable weapon, formerly took forever to charge. Now, not only does the minigun charge faster, the commando can carry it and a rocket launcher at the same time!\n\nEverything that made the game fun and challenging was removed. The balanced characters all shifted in favor of the Commando.\n\nBut it doesn't end there!\n\nAfter The Great Nerf, there was yet one more infuriating change: The St. Valentine's Day Massacre DLC. Back when I bought the game, it was listed as DLC. Several of my friends bought it and I felt like I was being left out on soemthing important based off of what they told me. Then, not too long ago, it was patched into everyone's game! There was nothing offered to the people who had already purchased the DLC. I was excited to play it, but it didn't matter because there weren't enough fans left who were brave enough to try out the more challenging game modes.\n\nUnless you are a 12-year-old, don't buy it\n","January 8, 2014","false","33.8"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","3"

Nope.\nThere is a lot of good things about this game. There is a fine level editor, but you are limited to the default "prebuilded models". The color picker is also VERY limited, as you can paint with colors not on the color picker, but you can't pick the colors. You might be confused what i mean xD. I mean, there is a paint tool, which can paint with noise (random variations of a color). So that means, that you can paint colors, that isn't on the color picker.\nBut if you see by that, the editor is actually pretty fine.\n\nNow to the game mechanics. You can start with different classes, like TF2. Each class has some weapons you need to chose for preference. The sniper is the only i really used, and he is very over powered, if he is in the other side of the map. The enemies can just pull down a castle of stuff, if they use a lot of bombs and breaks stuff. Well, gravity in this game is fine ;).\nSo, when you have played a match in all the gamemodes, and tried all clases, you are pretty much bored... Your only chance of playing the rest of this game is making maps in the level editor. And since there is very few player hosted servers, your maps will be more or less useless.\nI also need to mention, that there are no tactics at all, you just run around and YOLO all the time. The only tactic could be to take down the enemies base and stuff, since players actually can build while the match is live. And therefor, there is no variation, it's like TF2, but without trades and stuff, so nothing to go for or do while bored. There is also no updates at all... Just the same game over and over, day after day...\n\nNow to the community: 8 years old kids... Basically. I have stopped playing this game for various reasons mentioned above, but the community is very boring. I got a friend because i joined one of the 3 online map editor servers hosted by players. He were 10 i think, from GB. So be prepared for a very VERY boring community.\n\nSo, the conclusion of this game, is that it's a downvote. It's not a special game at all. It was ruined by Jagex, who bought the game from some people who actually managed to get the game on the charts.","October 16, 2014","false","6.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Uncharacteristically, I picked it up without any real question and immediatley downloaded it.  The game looked fun, but when I launched it, I found that it could barely run on my laptop, which is surprising for a game that uses small blocks so frequently.  The game was slow and felt unbalanced.  I had a hard time taking the entire experience seriously.  The gameplay is sound (and by that, I mean you're able to walk around the map), but very unbalanced.  A simple minigun is by far more powerful than a sniper rifle at LONG RANGE.  Also, when I wanted to play some gamemodes, my pc literally laughed in my face and sat there frozen for a couple minutes to finally report that it couldn't find a server and had timed out.  Also, the idea of destructable terrain is a pretty big joke in my mind.  I'd find myself watching people getting spawncamped among other things, or trying to build their little fort with such a finite number of blocks.  By the mid point of their building, there would be a nice minigun straight through him.\n\nThe "style" of this game seems to bug me.  As far as the blocks, I feel as though they wanted to do something similar to Minecraft (duh) and I'd guess COD simply because of how poorly everything is thrown together.  It frankly reminds me of a generic shooter at this point.  Anyway, the blocky characters and terrain feel like it was taken too seriously for this game.  They tried to pixelate literally EVERYTHING.  It'd be nice to look down, say, the crosshairs of a sniper rifle and not see small blocks guiding my shot.  Also while I mention snipers, I feel as though they're unbalanced because you can get a perfect headshot and the enemy barely notices.  Also he has almost no range, I mean maybe you can aim down a small bridge or from hill to hill, but this is nothing compared to other snipers.  Especially if you do such little damage after an aimed shot.\n\nI'm sure this game was expected to have great potential, but it was an utter dissapointment.  Looking at the concept, the game had a ton of potential, but was terribly executed almost to the point of me forgetting that potential and looking at the crap heap it is.\n\nEDIT: Also... why have destructable terrain when you have a class that can litterally fly?","December 28, 2013","false","3.2"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

Think of all the things you can buy with $15 dollars. Like, a different game that is actually good and won't make you want to kill yourself. This game takes the worst elements of multiplayer first person shooters and combines them into one. One of the biggest problems is no spawn pretection. The enemy can just walk up to your spawn and kill you over and over without giving you an chance to fight back. There aren't multiple spawn points or spawn protection so just don't even bother trying to win. The original Ace of Spades had you building giant walls to protect against enemies while they had to dig through it to get to you. This version, however, throws that ♥♥♥♥ out the window and gives you a class that has a jetpack to fly over the giant wall you built, making all that time and effort you put into it useless.\n\nDon't get this.

I am leaving this as a positive review because the game itself isnt bad. It really is a blast. But the community is dead, and the developers are dead... at least it seems that way. Stay away if, unless you just want to have a good time building castles and stuff for people to blow up in the construction mode. Good luck finding a similar game to play, because this has its own unique experience that is very hard to replicate. Thanks for reading! Have a good day, friend. Yes youre my friend now, get used to it.","November 1, 2015","true","120.2"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","58","42","72","16","3"

I support this company heavily, they made a great game, but in the inevitable backfire, get trolls and little angry kids saying its too much like minecraft. Even if you dont like the game, just support them at least, its the best you can do. In conclusion, this game is great (besides the lack of players on multiplayer, but that can be fixed) and you should support the developers.\n\nUpdate: Ive been reading the reviews a lot and people have been making some good points.

The game was known for its simple gameplay, building, mods, and, the most important thing, you could run it in a potato.\nBut the project was sold to jagex. Shortly after they released the payed version of the game 1.0. This version removed all the glamour of the version before, by adding weird classes, premade buildings(that nobody uses by the way) and you could destroy the blocks really easyly...I could spend the rest of the day talking about it. And you couldn't run in your potato anymore!\n\nBut the old community(just like myself) didn't like all these changes, and created a new website that hosts the old version of the game(0.75 and 0.76) called buildandshoot.com. At first it was great! But there was no more development of the game, and most game modes are not played anymore(mainly CTF, which was an hour round trying to protect and capture enemy flag. The tricky part here is that you could build tunnels, walk around the map, destroy enemy defenses, create traps, stealth to the enemy flag and come back in one piece, not to mention the maps were huge) and slowly the community started to die.\n\nNow there is no more of what it used to be.\n\nThe best game I ever played now there is no more of it.\nHow sad.","September 22, 2014","false","4.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The trailer outlined a game that would be ever so popular with gamer and player alike. This is not that game. A bland surface of my expectations, this has let me down to the point of regret. With a bland combat system and elements of blocks that just don't seem to fit, the combination of Minecraft and CoD almost couldn't have been done worse.\n\n3/10\n\nAn absolutely fantastic concept with elements, that if improved, would have been fantastic. The idea of creating an enviroment that you can play in is a wonderful idea, especially if used during a First Person Shooter like this were the landscape is so interactive. I only wish this was a better game.\n\nAll these variables seemed like they were taped together, it seems like the developers put more money in the trailer than the game. The elements of this game are a fantastic match, but rather being wed in a wonderful flurry of passion they are merely going for coffee for the rest of their lives. So much potential, just no effort put into execution, similar to CoD all the developers cared about was money.\n\nA counter recommendation I have would be Brick Force, a game where these pieces are put together in a format that is much more streamline that this. It has many elements of pay-to-play, but as a free to play player I have successfully achieved very high ranks against people a much higher level than me","July 8, 2014","false","1.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Maps are un-balanced, most servers host Zombie games, and you usually end up as a zombie anyway, since they are always active.\n\nGriefers everywhere, you can either blow up your own base or blow up the enemy teams, most of the people you are with lag terrifically and are sitting ducks if you have a excellent computer.\n\nAchievements unobtainable. Fufilled requirements of most and I didn't get a single damn one.\n\nUseless leveling system. Get random awards for doing nothing. Where do Reload kills, distraction and other things come in when all I'm doing is walking through a gamebreaking tunnel?\n\nTeams that are strategic ALWAYS LOSE. Teams full of Marksmen ALWAYS WIN.\n\nMany game breaking paths are included in maps, London has a subway tunnel that leads to the enemy base, all you have to do is go miner, take some ammo and use the MPG to rip apart the base, and then you win the match.\n\nAmmo, Medkits and Block refill crates are always put in inconvienet places, you have to walk through a field of snipers before you can even try to touch it.\n\nLandmines kill everyone, so often times, teammates will set up landmines in front of the base, blowing the whole base up.\n\nEngineers are the weakest and worst class EVER. The only thing good about them is their huge block limit and their huge array of instant structures.\n\nTurrets self destruct after 10 seconds, and when used, blow a HUGE hole into the floor, leaving a huge crater. Engies will often place turrets in the base and then ruin the base so you can get picked off by the 400,000 snipers every 12 seconds.\n\nMiner's TNT doesn't really do much damage to blocks at all, the miners tunnel cannon is nifty for wiping out snipers and bases.\n\nIf you want to win against snipers, go miner, get double barrel shotgun and take out an entire team by sneaking up behind everyone, since they're all most likely going to be marksmen targeting your team mates.\n\nDon't bother with this game, go play Build and Shoot (Ace of spades Classic)","July 24, 2014","false","2.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Ace Of Spades, in its infancy, was a rougher, uglier, and all-around funner game that ran on the already-old VoxLap engine (by Ken Silverman, the same mastermind behind Duke 3D's Build Engine), so simple and resource-light that even a crummy Pentium 4 could play any map at full speed. It was a cult-classic, and a smash hit with many internet communities of all sizes.\nIt was developed mostly by a single hobbyist, one Ben Aksoy, who developed it as freeware and updated it, not to cash in on gimmicks or appeal to unfunny children, but because it was his passion to improve the game wherever possible. There were no classes, only a selection of two– later three– primary weapons, along with a shovel, grenade, and pickaxe to reshape or collapse the world.\nThis isn't a review of that game from 2011, this is a synopsis of what a nightmare it became after it was picked up by a bad publisher. The game was acquired by the extremely reputable Jagex Ltd., a publisher and developer with absolutely no past reputation of taking any popular games and ruining them for fast cash. The result took the planned OpenGL engine for the original game, intended to provide sharper graphics and shading, made it sluggish (It initially didn't even work on most AMD graphics solutions) and added a slapdashed class system with grating, corny voice lines worse than a manchild cartoon reviewer doing impressions on YouTube. The ability to procedurally generate a map was also absent from the "final" payware release on Steam, in favor of some amateurish prefab maps.\nAt this point, I purchased the game at full price at launch, naîvely expecting that it would be mostly a rehash of the original with some visuals and polish on top to attract new users. It was quite a while before Jagex finally "added" a [worse] version of the original game mode to the product, to compliment the diamond mine mode, and obligatory "zombie" mode. The game is not early-access, nor has it ever been, but it has always felt unfinished, even compared to its prerelease forerunner. Version 0.75 felt more like an old PC game from the heyday of CS 1.6 or Quake III. It never got stale between the little updates, maps could be edited, characters and weapons could be skinned, and you could play against new people again and again.\nThis proprietary release has barely improved after more than three years, despite generating revenue, in contrast to the original freeware version by Ben Aksoy. Jagex's three improvements I can testify for are: Fixing the issue where the game was a blank screen on many GPUs, adding a dumbed-down "Classic" mode that's still a shell of the former game, and finally adding a way to make maps during the "Battle Builder" rebrand, a feature that the 2011 beta ALREADY HAD.\n\nThe good news is, you, as a consumer, can just ignore this slaughter of intellectual property. Just go search for "Build & Shoot", or if GNU is your thing, try "OpenSpades".","June 1","false","5.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It truly was an ace, once, believe it or not. It was free, buggy, and hackers were sure to get banned. Back before it was on Steam.\nNow, I played it on free weekend. It deserves to be on free weekend, eternally, as it's buggy. I can run the classic AoS on my computer, no doubt. This one, seems to focus on graphics, instead of gameplay or engine. It's laggy, even with all the graphics set to low. I have a very new computer, and it should run fine. Haha, no.\nThe servers are swarming with hackers. All the classes are over powered in one way, and severely underpowered in another. In fact, they're all rip-offs of them- Sniper/Marksman, Soldier/Commando, Engineer/Engineer, and the only original class is Miner. Back in the old days, no classes. Smooth. And now it's slow moving and you can't even run without getting nauseas. All the old gamemodes are gone or renamed, and severely nurfed. I used to love the old gamemodes, but now there's basically only two gamemodes, zombies/deathmatch and capture the something. Construction is severely edited, in that it's too complex and unlike the old strictly cube it was in classic. There's also the fact that the servers seem to be runned on potatoes, even the ones based where I live.\nSo, would I buy it? For 2.99, probably, if you like cheap, crappy games like me. 14.99? Pha! Just add it to the pile of taboo games in the corner- WarZ, 2066, and all the other knock-offs sold at unbelievably high price. Yes, fifteen bucks is far, far overpriced for this Team Fortress 2/Minecraft knockoff.

I really like the idea of building and setting up your own barricades and brigdes on the battle field, but this plus isn't even tied into the gameplay. While you try to build your barricades you can and will be shot from all directions, because the building is so sloooow (not even enough o's in here to show how slow-going this process is). In the end we got good snipers, many Rambo-style equipped players with miniguns and rocket launchers and you, dead slow builder or miner, pick one of those. To win you will have to throw away the promising idea of being tactically better (by building stuff) than your opponents and pick another class: either commando or marksman. Oh, you still want to build?

This looks cool!\n\nAfter i played it:\nYea its actually not that great.\n\nTo the point.\nThe game is good up to a certain point. And that point doesnt start with the game. It starts with the players. The game itself is very nice and runs smoothly. It functions properly and the controls are easy to understand. The concept of building is easier than in some other 3D games i saw so far especially because these buildingblocks are mostly big structures you can place. The gamemodes are funny and also easy. It can be frustrating sometimes though because the maps are fully destructable. Even though i have to say that you can kill the entire enemy team as a zombie when you go and break the tower below them apart.\n\nNow why would i say i wouldnt like the game that much?\nBecause of the community of this game.\nWhen you begin to play this game you begin to understand that its normal people, dip♥♥♥♥♥ or 9 year old trolls that think everything stupid is funny that play this game. The first time i played something different than Zombie mode i went on a gamemode where you wouldnt respawn. I dont know the name currently but it wasnt the Zombie mode. Maybe it even was but i havent played the game for a long time so who cares. What happened was that i told this one guy to step out of my way because i was trying to snipe. And he began to use explosives on me where i took damage from. Maybe it was from the fall to the ground or from the explosions itself but in the end i died from a guy that thought teamkilling is fun. A pure troll in the end that got me to leave to game instantly because i dont like playing with people like that.\n\nIn a different game, VIP mode, the entire team went everywhere but noone stayed with the VIP. The VIP who actually ran at the enemy as well and got killed instantly. Its not like the game is telling you in bigass letters that you are the VIP, Nooooooo. [Yes Sarcasm]. Upon asking him wtf he was doing he began to speak russian... I really dont care where people are from. But if you play an international game then speak atleast english.

Now that i said the gravity is slow, you might think (Oh good no fall damage) well you are WRONG, the fall damage is like 40, even when falling slowly and if the fall damage would be 80 your character will always make the same noise ("Uhh") yep thats the sound the voice actors found passionate to appoint to retrieving 80 fall damage which would equal to breaking both your fricking legs in real life.\n\n>Solid's/Liquids (3/10)\nThe game's water is a solid, like, i could be raging right now but this is fricking ridiculous. I Had a choice ingame, either fall into water and survive i thought, or die on the side of the port. Ofcourse i picked water not realising in this game it's solid water, so i fell to my death...\n\n>Fluidity (1/10)\nThe biggest turn-off of this game must be fluidity, something FPS's need the most is crap in this game. The game is continuously lagging so first off i blamed it on my connection until i realised when i rejoined the ping was 22 and my dl connection is 150mb/ps and my upload 100mb/ps. I shot someone in their face with a shotty, no damage and the game generates the player as a ghost (bullets do destroy the wall behind..) So i thought ''Hey if i cant kill him, he cant kill me right? This game isnt in beta so it must be fair out'' Well i was completely wrong and i got hit in my face with a hammer or whatever, the textures aren't particularly appealing.\n\n>Spawn Protection (-10000000)\nIf something should be fixed its the spawn protection, idgaf if the game HAS IT or HASNT BUT ITS NEEDED FOR A FPS LIKE THIS. I spawn, get sniped, im okay its the first time but if this happens like a thousand games then you must understand this is BS IN ITS ULTIMATE FORM.\n\ntl;dr, this game is utter crap and doesn't deserve a title of ''full game'' but rather ''pre-alpha''\n\nCause trust me, ive seen games that are in BETA that could demolish this one...\n\nI will never recommend this game to anyone, not even to my worst enemies..\n\nFIX THOSE THINGS AND I MIGHT RECONSIDER, ALSO, WORK MORE ON WEAPONS & OPTIONS, like take a look on Team Fortress 2 does it.\n\n-Juan Hans","July 25, 2014","false","7.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But every update things got worse, and worse, and WORSE.\n\nThe movement feels bad, the building is basic, everyone goes marksman because he's so OP, the list goes on.\n\nThe DLC which I payed for became free, and the people who bought it got jack s*** for paying them.\n\nThe last enjoyment I had from Ace of Spades was creating skins. But shortly after that, they removed the ability to put those skins into the game. That kind of made all my effort seem more like a waste of time.\n\nDo not buy this game. The developers seem to have no interest in listening to the community, the game has about as much personality as a shoe in a dumpster, and it's just so booooring!","July 26, 2014","false","6.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I used to hop on whenever I had some time to spare and play all different types of game modes. But then update after update it got ruined. They added to many weapons and tried to make classes balanced (but just made every gun do less damage) and then they saw it was a problem so they tried to get it back to how it was. It didn’t work, instead pistols one shot, miniguns take about 4 shots to kill(making them very op), machine guns take 2 shots and overall it’s a mess. So over all you should check it out but you may not like it.

The playerbase was great, friendly, fun and creative. Sometimes everyone would come together and mine under the map to make it all break down, then fight in the water left behind.\n\nNow it's full of 10 year old children who constantly reference memes, with very cocky attitudes. They also think they are the best, and anyone who is better is hacking. I have almost been banned several times for getting consistent headshots in very quick succession.\n\nNow, apart from that, Ima do some pros and cons\n\nPros:\n+A fun way to shape the warzone to your choosing\n+Building during fights, like barricades and such\n+Fun classes\n+Blocks are not unlimited, you must get an airdrop or break other blocks to get more\n+Classes weapons are balanced\n+Fun gamemodes, all very different from eachother\n+No battle is ever the same\n\nCons:\n-Poor playerbase\n-Movement is poor\n-Shooting feels weak\n-The updates to the classes made them feel a lot less special\n-They made the soldier look more like rambo. Kindof annoying\n-Constant whining and arguing through chat\n-Pretty much everyone plays sniper now\n-Lasers coming from snipers. Kindof ruined the concept of using the sniper to be sneaky\n-Friendly players often think it's funny to mine down you constructs you made to reach an objective\n-Apparently "Trolling" is popular here. Goddammit.\n\nI can NOT reccomend the game any longer.\nHowever, I want to acknowledge that the updates ruined it, so I will rate how it was before/after updates.\n\nBefore updates [No longer current game] : 9/10\n\nAfter updates [THIS IS THE NUMBER YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT] : 2/10\n\nShocking, Jagex. Can't believe you ruined this game.\n\nEDIT: Classic CTF is a decent game mode because it has no classes, but you will be kicked from the game if you play well. Seriously. I got kicked for getting 3 headshots in a row.

And to make the commando class worse, the community is a bunch of screaming kids and spoiled rich ♥♥♥♥♥. Probably the only thing they did right in this game was the sniping. The rifles had adequate warning to get away from and the damage was just right as to cause 2 shots to the body to kill and 1 straight to the head.\n\nOverall, its not worth your money for ♥♥♥♥.

Not sure why its called that after a game or two. I got completly confussed to what to do when I first loaded the game and not sure what to expect. First I love the idea of it, bringing building into the world of war is a nice touch but it is also disapointing. When I first tried it out I made a small hole in the ground that i called Base and never used it, finding out where or what your Base is difficult because of the blocks having no sort of texture just colour. The fighting was new and sort of fun but ruined by the lag, I can blame my internet for it but everyone on the servers had high ping. The placing the blocks was a good idea untill people on the server starting constructing small bases picking us off one by one. The map building is a great idea but you would only do it if you were hugely into the game and so far im disapointed. This would be a good free game but a waste of money if you spent £9.99 on this which I believe a rather high price for what i thought a limited game. No imagination can be put into this game because your so fixed with wanting the kill the other team, so block building was a waste of the devolpers time. I would not recomend this game to a friend, I dont believe its worth £9.99.","July 26, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Knock buildings down by cutting out the base, cut the bottom block out of a tree to destroy the whole thing, simple destruction. The building system was extremely confusing and I never did learn to use it, and other players also seemed to not fully understand the build and destroy system. I'd see players build a tower into the sky to be safe, and enemies would run at him rather than cut down his tower. I couldn't build structures over people and turrets, but when I placed turrets they'd be built over to destroy them and I'd be burried to become easy prey.\n\nGraphics: Not much was expected, being a blocky build and shoot game, but it was actually decently done. The characters animations seemed to work around structures (no legs clipping through stairs) and explosions through out debris to bounce around.\n\nClasses: The four classes in the game were well explained and each unique. For each game mode there was a clear superiority in a class. Open fields made sniper the best, defensive made the engineer the best (except for building over turrets being sometimes a thing), offense was the commando, and the miner was just sort of a for fun character who lacked a real strong point.\n\nWeapons: There are few choices for each class, and then spaces that look liked locked choices, but with no explanation how to unlock them or if they are just unadded things to keep the menu aligned since some slots fill across and others don't. With such limited weapon choices, picking a class kind of locks in weapon choices and doesn't allow you to really make the character work your way.\n\n\nNeeds to be a little more clear on how things work, and then I might upvote it.","May 17, 2014","false","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The characters had real weight and didn't feel like spacemen. I will admit, this game brings many new weapons to the table. However the entire character of the original is destroyed in favor of this tf2 voxel remake. The original was so much more enjoyable for me. A HUGE factor was the usefulness of planning and base building. It was so worthwhile digging a tunnel to the front lines and trenches to cover your movements. This new version COMPLETELY disregards building incentives. There is NO REASON to build when every class can destroy your base in 5 seconds. Even the quick build options are worthless. The old game had elements of stealth and trench warefare, digging into your surroundings and slowly chipping away at the enemy across the valley. The fog of war really conveyed tension and uncertainty when crossing an open area, especially alone. All in all, the old version was extremely groundbreaking with it's suprisingly deep metagame and it's simple mechanics. Although the "real" game has smoother edges, it's fast paced gameplay completely did away with any strategic thinking and building for a run and gun voxel shooter. I'm truly disapointed with the direction the developers took.","May 21, 2014","false","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Sure, this game is a Minecraft, TF2-inspired FPS combat that feels relatively new in a genre that is completely overrated...\n\nit's fast-paced combat certainly sets it away from a crowded FPS genre, and its Zombie mode is surprisingly the best mode in terms of balance and fun.  Another positive is that it offers map editing and the ability to share custom maps.\n\nSadly, each of Ace of Spades' four classes certainly have their pros and cons, which significantly imbalance the game depending on gamemode.  For example, the Rocketeer jetpacks across the map with an SMG in Capture the Flag which seems unforgivably lopsided.  Furthermore, the 'Minecraft' building aspect seems untouched and is hardly used which is also hampered by a bugged reticule...","July 12, 2015","false","23.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You had one weapon, pistol and the bomb and you needed to geather intel to your base, also you needed to build your own base to protect your intel.\nOther gamemodes are true destruction of the map, if you like to destroy map just go on and play for example deathmatch.

We needed more.  The announcment came that the game would be on steam.  We pretty much died.  In celebration of this monumental event we created a PC we would call- THE ACE OF SPADES.  This monster was the most amazing on edge gaming device any of us had ever laid eyes upon.  Now it was complete.  We began selling these computers on the market, making a steady profit of 500 dollars.  Eventually there was a higher demand.  We. Were. Going. Places.  Due to the high depand and influx of requests for the computer, we officially started a company.  This new brand of PC was called Ace-Ware electronics.  The company was instantly a sucess.  Being deemed the greatest gaming pc of all time, we quickly shot up into the spotlight.  Whole articles were written about us in great tech and gaming magazines such as Gameinformer, Wired, and National Geographic.  But there was one magazine unlike any other that published our companies name.  This magazine was Cosmo.  Cosmo, naturally being the number one gaming magazine out there, got the most views.  There was only one problem about this article.  THEY MISS-SPELLED OUR COMPANY NAME.  NOW INSTEAD OF ACE WARE ELECTRONICS EVERYONE CALLS US SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT\nTHAT ARTICLE IN COSMO MAGAZINE MISS SPELLED OUR NAME TO BE\nALIEN WARE COMPUTERS\nNOW TO THIS DAY OUR GENIUS IDEA OF A COMPUTER IS CALLED ALIENWARE. TO US IT IS NOW WORTH NOTHING BECAUSE IT IS NOT RELATED TO OUR SACRED GAME.  ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES PEOPLE STILL BUY ALIENWARE LAPTOPS IT MEANS NOTHING TO US\nABSOULUTLY NOTHING\nI WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND THIS GAME","January 12, 2014","false","19.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

The US is still fairly well populated and Europe has a lot of people playing much of the time, but if you are from Australia, buy Block N Load instead. It's a similar game that is heavy on strategy, though you won't be able to play the epic Zombie survival or VIP modes.]\n\nRecommend? YES! 99% I have played Beta for a long time when I was younger and I've always wanted this game. I finally got it after a while, it's brilliant. I have to admit, while VIP and Zombie are good modes, this game needs more work done. More weapon choice, more and upgraded game modes with higher level of strategy.\n\nI'm sure this game stopped being worked on last year because of not selling but overall, It's highly addictive to a lover of shooting zombies and saving friends :3\n\nIn Zombie, at the start, 2 random players get chosen to be zombie, (1 if there are only 2 in the game), the rest have to stay safe, if they don't and get ripped apart, they transform into a zombie themselves, a creature with heightened agility and speed, especially in water.\n\nIn VIP, 1 player is chosen as VIP, if he dies, your team has 1 minute to obliterate the enemies' whole team . When the VIP dies, you start getting hurt and block crates will save you a lot.\n\nHopefully more updates will be done, and when they do, TF2/Dota2 will no longer be very popular.\nTF2 is about 13 GB and AoS is only 500 MB, and yet it is still epic, this game is definitely worth a few dollars.","July 28, 2014","true","168.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It's plenty worth the 2.99$ price tag! 10hours and I'm going in for round 3 :D Then I'm buying it once my guest pass gets out of the way :P I loved the first version which was only for PC platform unless someone ported it or wrapped it with Wineskin but those versions aren't a guarantee unless you've done it yourself ;) -But anyway aside from there only being four classes, you can't go wrong with any of them although my biggest scores are from the marksman and my headshotting capabilities- I don't mind the other characters. Basic view on the characters is, Commando for when you need to break things or when your spawn is over run or there's just too many marksman. Marksman for when you're going long range... Jetpack Engineer for Zaaambies because Zaaambies are tricky little buggers are the Jetpack makes for a nice escape. Miner for Making entrances ;) and for building/secret tunnels and such... Useless character classes and great combat little iffy on requiring your scope to be used for sniper shooting because I've personally shot things without using the scope on many a rifle while still holding it correctly and still hitting my target.

This game lacks everything from gameplay to players.\n\nI launched the game up once after the free week, during that time, I saw more servers than people on the game. This goes to show that a game as terrible as that will have a huge amount of people playing it during the free week, but no one will actually buy it due to it's repetative gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is basically all TDM there was no building aspect to it. It wasn't as if you could build gigantic structures and it would take a while for the enemy to get through, nope, the building aspect was simply putting a block down. No repairing it, no recovery time, if it was going to break, it was going to break. The game was fairly one sided, if they broke in your base, they could camp you forever. And the repetativity of the game was just unbearable.\n\nThe servers itself were lacking players, I found myself jumping from empty room to empty room.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kentucky101/recommended/224540/","Kentucky101","Ghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kentucky101/","71 products in account","Ah, Ace of Spades, where to start. This game used to be the ♥♥♥♥. I played it before it came to Steam, and it was a simple, yet addicting mix if Team Fortress and Minecraft, and had touches of Battlefield and Roblox. So when it came to Steam, I was understandibly excited. They had greatly improved the gameplay, and had added a plethera of maps, gamemodes, weapons, and 4 classes. The gameplay was tight, the graphics greatly improved, and each class was pretty balanced (Except for the Sniper).\n\nAnd then came the updates. First they added a new DLC, which was 1930's Chicago themed, (No idea why they chose that theme), and for me and many other people, the game would crash instantly when you played it for the next few months. That was the begiining of the end. People could only play the DLC maps if you owned the DLC, and the gamemodes were exclusive to those 2 maps. (People can probably agree with me that City of Chicago would have been an awesome Zombie map.\n\nThen they changed the skin of the commando to look more "Rambo-y", which looked awful, then they nerfed the Rocketeer class, and turned it into the "Engineer". I actually stopped playing then, 'cause everything that was fun about the Rocketeer (verstile, hit-and-run tactics, great in zombies), and nerfed it. Instead, the Enginner had very low health, a ♥♥♥♥ty jetpack that ran out of fuel almost instantly, weaker weapons, and weaker items. About half the community, said "♥♥♥♥ this" and walked away. This just left the new players, and the whiny 12 year olds who spammed sniper. This completly ruined the game. Then as if they hadn't done enough damage, they removed the ability to browse servers, and added a lazer module to the Sniper, so whenever you zoomed in, your position would be revealed to everyone on the map. Then they just went ahead and added the Chicago DLC to the game, so people had essentaily wasted 5 dollars on buying it before-hand. The final straw was when they added the "Battle Builder" element. Sounds pretty fun right? No. No it wasn't. The game would lag when ever you tried to put down a larger model, and often the maps were so big that the game would crash. Also nobody played the user-made content. People can't even host their own games.\n\nRight now I can unfortunetly not reccomend Ace of Spades to you. If Jagex (who has a long history of runing games) decides to patch the game, and remove all of these mistakes, then play it again. But right now, the game is broken, the achivements are unattainable, the community is awful, and filled with griefers and hackers, and the gameplay has been completely ruined. So, with great sadness, I say that this game is unplayable currently, and I would not advise buying it.","August 24, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In Ace of Spades, you get 4 classes ( technically 8 classes with other modes, ) like in TF2, where you get 9 classes. Pretty cool,  not one class is overpowered or underpowered. The minecraft aspect comes in because the entire game is made of blocks. You can build things, or dominate your enemies.

But another company bought it so it was put on steam as a paid game rather than a free one. Okay, I can deal with that. Then things started to change. It seemed to constantly update, with each update making the game progressively less fun. But I kept playing anyway. FInally, they added a laser for when you are being aimed at by a sniper, not just a dot, a laser sometimes crossing half the map. Sure, that makes it easier to avoid snipers, but the whole purpose of sniping someon is to not be seen. At that point I gave up on the game. I checked on it a few times afterwards to see if it was fixed later. It wasn't. It amazes me that one company single-handedly turned a fun interesting game into a total piece of crap. The only gamemode that is still somewhat decent is capture the flag on the WWII settings and map. If I could get this game out of my library so it stops reminding of it's downfall, I would in a heartbeat, even if it costed me even more money.","December 24, 2014","false","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a rushed and buggy release (somewhat improved by the last update), probably done so because the company releasing it are close to going under. The lack of community-hosted servers is bad enough on its own, but combine this with the fact that the company could be gone in 3 months, it makes purchasing it a bit of a risk.\nDevelopers of the game have also said several times that it will be impossible (yes, impossible) to hack and that there will be 24/7 player support. Neither of these are true, with it being even easier to hack than the classic version (which you can still play at buildandshoot.com), with the initial version still having a debug console that let you run arbitrary Python code (the language the game is written in).\nAlso, while listed as an indie game, it is far from it. While, yes, it was originally an indie game, it was bought by Jagex over a year ago (who is owned mainly by venture capitalists) and was completely rewritten.\n\ntl;dr Rude, not reading my words, but yes, don't buy this game.","January 6, 2013","false","63.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You are the Ace of Spades, and you have to shoot all of the Blue Man Group.  Your team has a snowman, and a cool castle, and stuff, and Blue Team wants to take it from you.  Call them a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥ Sucking ♥♥♥ Sticks, and shoot all of the rockets at them.  You can play as the Rocket or Minigun Lemmy, a Sniper who thinks he's Luigi (Complete with crazy legs jumping action), an engineer who has a big shovel, and a sweet rocket drill, and Tom Cruise from Top Gun.  The game features many modes, like TDM, CTF, and others.  There's also a Zombies mode where a random player becomes a lego Alice Cooper, and has to try to kill all of the Lemmys to feed his Frankenstein.","December 30, 2012","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The biggest problem of this game. Like 8/10 of all players play with a sniper and there is no way you can avoid them. The lasers the developers implemented helped for spotting snipers but after all it can't be helped, you have to face them no matter what.\n\nSnipers are actually part of a vicious circle: Killing people with a sniper is pretty easy since most of the maps are vast and open and making headshots isn't that hard. All the other weapons can hardly kill a sniper from medium to long distance but the sniper can, so you almost always have the disadvantage when not using a sniper. In order to kill those snipers and get a chance to kill others too those people also take the sniper. This results in more people using the sniper and also more people not being able to play properly due to all the snipers, so they take the sniper too. And so on...\n\nFurthermore:\n\n- Decent amount of maps although none of them are sniper-proof since most of the maps are very vast and open.\n- Low amount of weapons and tools, even after 2½ years no new ones are implemented. You will mostly play with a sniper since most of the other weapons are useless against your sniper enemies, combined with the many vast open maps you literally have no other choice.\n- Good amount of game modes but team deathmatch and zombie are overrepresented and the others are barely played.\n- Lots of griefers, literally everything gets demolished. Some people only seem to play this game for the sake of screwing around and ruining the gameplay for others. They preferably destroy spawns, the enemies' and yours.\n- The team balancing is awful. Everytime you're in the bad losing team your spawn gets destroyed and everyone gets spawn killed resulting in people quitting, your team gets worse and spawn destroying and killing gets even easier for the enemy team and from there the vicious circle starts again while nothing gets balanced.\n- The map builder is ok but not all that special. It has a decent amount of settings and prefabs to use but I personally don't find it a builder to make perfect maps with.\n- Kinda low amount of players. I definently think this will continue to drop since the developers are not improving the game.\n- Almost no new updates and improvements.\n\nSummarized: Lots of snipers and griefers, low amount of weapons of which the sniper is mostly used, decent amount of maps only most are too open and vast, good amount of game modes but lots of them are barely played, awful team balancing, decent map builder, kinda low amount of players & almost no new updates and improvements.\n\n4/10.","April 9, 2014","false","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nxmc/recommended/224540/","nxmc","mox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nxmc/","120 products in account","After watching one of the videos, this game looked like so much fun. I waited a bit till the thanksgiving sale, and bought it cuz why not?\n\nI tried playing a couple rounds, and honestly everything had the worst aesthetics I have ever used. All of the animations were broken and all of these ugly colors popping out from nowhere.\n\nThe shooting is completely intangible, there's no blastback or even good sound effects. The animation is perhaps a 20 degree rotation and maybe a pixel hand popping out from somewhere.\n\nAnd BEING shooted? I have played many first person shooters, and in all of them, the developers actually wanted you to realize your organs are being teared out. Either the weapons are way to OP, (if you are complaining that I was just getting snipered, then that proves my point), or Jagex simply cannot create a good way to alert you that you're being shot at besides a few moments of red lines before you're dead. And spotting enemy characters are impossible when the hues of their overalls match the surrounding lighting and scenery.\n\nJagex makes running speed slow as hell to allow people to "innovate" and make trenches. But if you're gonna call this excuse for a game a first person shooter, you've gotta have fast movement and a good gun experience if you're gonna decide you're gonna have classes and snipers with OP guns. The engineers are completely ignored, because where are you gonna find them if theres a staggered respawn rate, or any respawn at all.

I waited a bit till the thanksgiving sale, and bought it cuz why not?\n\nI tried playing a couple rounds, and honestly everything had the worst aesthetics I have ever used. All of the animations were broken and all of these ugly colors popping out from nowhere.\n\nThe shooting is completely intangible, there's no blastback or even good sound effects. The animation is perhaps a 20 degree rotation and maybe a pixel hand popping out from somewhere.\n\nAnd BEING shooted? I have played many first person shooters, and in all of them, the developers actually wanted you to realize your organs are being teared out. Either the weapons are way to OP, (if you are complaining that I was just getting snipered, then that proves my point), or Jagex simply cannot create a good way to alert you that you're being shot at besides a few moments of red lines before you're dead. And spotting enemy characters are impossible when the hues of their overalls match the surrounding lighting and scenery.\n\nJagex makes running speed slow as hell to allow people to "innovate" and make trenches. But if you're gonna call this excuse for a game a first person shooter, you've gotta have fast movement and a good gun experience if you're gonna decide you're gonna have classes and snipers with OP guns. The engineers are completely ignored, because where are you gonna find them if theres a staggered respawn rate, or any respawn at all. The video I watched shows each class working together as a team, instead of a bunch of snipers running around on a map that takes 15 minutes to walk across.\n\nThere are tons of players whose overall goal is to shoot each other, instead of building cool things and strategize to win.\n\nOverall, this is a terribly designed game which needs lots and lots of work.

The main features in a nutshell is that the terrain is destructable and you can build bunkers and bases or sniper towers and so forth. The game is very fun, especially when you get good at it and change a few of the controls but it does have some problems like that some maps have the issue of one side clearly having the upper hand and that there will almost always be a camper on a server. There are no classes that are over-powered or unbalanced and you have to train with them for them to be any good on the battlefield.\n\nIt is practically a multiplayer-only game but servers are far from empty and there are a lot of game modes to try out and you can create your own maps. The Steam workshop for this is very basic but still good and fun to try out fans' maps. As every game has, the game suffers from bugs but the game-breaking ones have been removed. Graphics can be altered as well for better frame rates.\n\nOverall, this game is a must buy if you want a FPS with a interesting twist and I give it a 7.5/10.","March 22, 2014","true","68.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Apparently Jagex decided the game wasn't traffic, or at least that's what it came across as. So they tried to make it better. But they made it a despicable game.

Wszystkich zapaleńców, którym marzy się możliwość budowy własnych fortów oraz walki na śmierć i życie z przeciwną drużyną na własnych mapach – muszę z przykrością rozczarować. Gra jest po prostu średnią strzelanką, a jej jedyne podobieństwo do wspomnianego wcześniej Minecrafta, to świat zrobiony z sześcianów.\n\n\n\nJak zacząć?\n\nAce of Spades jest nietypową produkcją i szczerze powiedziawszy, nie mam pojęcia od której strony ją ugryźć, żeby rozpocząć recenzję. Z jednaj strony mamy świetny pomysł, bo któż z tych, co Minecraft przypadł do gustu, nie marzył o możliwości epickich starć z innymi graczami na zaprojektowanych przez siebie mapach? Z drugiej strony, mamy tutaj masę zmarnowanego potencjału, gdyż budowa nie jest nawet w połowie tak precyzyjna, jak być powinna, a i czasu na nią w ogóle nie mamy.\nNachodzi mnie uczucie, że sami twórcy nie do końca wiedzieli, od której strony mają się za swoją grę zabrać, gdyż w żadnym swoim aspekcie nie osiąga mistrzostwa, przez co świetny pomysł skończył jako zwyczajny przeciętniak.\nCzym jednak tak naprawdę jest Ace of Spades i jak się w to gra? Weźmy więc dla porównania dowolną strzelankę online i już jesteśmy w domu – przynajmniej na początek. Wybieramy z listy serwer, bądź pozwalamy wrzucić się na losowy (co odradzam, gdyż zazwyczaj kończyłem na pustych serwerach), czekamy chwilę na załadowanie mapy. Te są z reguły sporych rozmiarów i pozwalają na swobodne przemieszczanie się po całym terenie w poszukiwaniu wroga lub innych celów, które różnią się w zależności od trybów rozgrywki. Tak jak każdy szanujący się dzisiaj FPS, tak i Ace of Spades daje nam możliwość wyboru klasy, a nawet umożliwia w bardzo ograniczony sposób wybór broni. Profesje są cztery – Commando, Miner, Marksman i Rocketeer. Każdy z nich ma swój zestaw oręża, tak więc Commando biega z bazooką lub minigunem. Miner dostaje w swoje ręce ładunki wybuchowe, shotguna i coś w rodzaju połączenia wiertła z bazooką, Marksman prowadzić powinien ostrzał z daleka za sprawą swojej snajperki. Rocketeer natomiast potrafi szybko przemieszczać się po mapie za sprawą jetpacka i sprowadzać na wrogów śmierć z wysoka swoim wiernym karabinkiem. To jednak nie wszystko, każda z klas ma do swojej dyspozycji łopatę, służącą nie tylko do walki wręcz, ale również do kopania (o czym więcej za chwilę), klocek do budowy oraz zestaw kilku przygotowanych struktur.\nStruktury te różnią się w zależności od klasy, którą wybierzemy. Znajdziemy między nimi schody, bunkry, platformy, zasieki, itp. Bardzo łatwo jest je zniszczyć, tak jak i resztę terenu, jednakże, dobrze rozplanowane, potrafią dać drużynie nieznaczną chwilę przewagi.\n\n\n\nBuduj i niszcz\n\nJedną z największych różnić, które sprawiają, że Ace of Spades ma szansę zaistnienia na rynku Battlefieldów i CoD-ów jest możliwość wpływania na otoczenie. Wszystko, na co padną nasze oczy, możemy zniszczyć czy zabudować. Podstawowym narzędziem destrukcji jest saperka – składana łopatka, która służy również do zabijania wrogów wręcz. Kopanie nią jest dosyć chaotyczne i trudno mówić tutaj o jakiejkolwiek precyzji, jednak do szybkiego przebicia się przez ścianę nadaje się idealnie. Jeśli jednak nasza żądza zniszczenia nie zostanie zaspokojona małą łopatką, klasa Minera powinna dać upust destrukcyjnym zapędom. Garść dynamitów i wspomniane wcześniej wiertło, potrafią w kilka sekund stworzyć tunel lub wyrwę w najgrubszej ścianie.\nNiestety, nie ma tutaj podziału na materiały, z jakich świat jest zrobiony. Każdy klocek rozpada się równie szybko, niezależnie czy jest to ściana, piasek czy wrak metra. Budowanie z pojedynczych bloków natomiast jest przydatne jedynie w momencie zablokowania dziury w murze, gdyż budowa czegoś większego mija się zwyczajnie z celem. Z pomocą przychodzą tutaj predefiniowane struktury, które postawić możemy jednym kliknięciem, jednak bazy operacyjnej z ich pomocą nie postawimy.\n\n\nWalcz i giń\n\nArsenał jest dosyć oklepany i jego niuanse opisałem już wcześniej. W tym rozdziale recenzji postaram się opisać najważniejszy aspekt FPS-ów, czyli jaką frajdę daje w tej grze strzelanie. Osobiście przyznam, że małą. Amunicja kończy się strasznie szybko, więc warowanie się nie ma najmniejszego sensu, gdyż udać musimy się w takim wypadku do paczki z amunicją, która wraz z apteczką spawni się w wybranym miejscu mapy. Większość czasu grałem jako Rocketeer, gdyż uzależniłem się od jetpacka i zwyczajnie uciążliwym stało się bieganie po mapie za sprawą własnych nóg. Do dyspozycji miałem więc karabin, który dużą celnością pochwalić się nie mógł, tak samo zresztą jak i zadawanymi obrażeniami, przez co musiałem wystrzelać nie raz dwa (celne!) magazynki, żeby wroga ubić.\nTo jedynie moje odczucia, jednak wydaje mi się, że walka, co jest kluczowym elementem gry, nie została do końca dopracowana. Strzelanie do wroga po prostu przyprawiło mi więcej frustracji niż radochy.\n\n\n\nKwadratem być\n\nOprawa graficzna jest dosyć szczególna i czy będzie się podobać, zależy wyłącznie od gustu. Wszystko zbudowane zostało z sześcianów, jednakże, w przeciwieństwie do Minecrafta, są one dużo mniejsze, przez co twórcy uzyskali znacznie większą szczegółowość modeli postaci czy broni. Sam świat natomiast, nie potrafi wprawić w zachwyt, tak jak wyżej wymieniona produkcja od Mojang, gdyż tekstury nałożone na kwadraty są jednolite, przez co wszystko wygląda szaroburo. Samo niebo niestety jest obrazem o niskiej rozdzielczości, co tylko potęguje uczucie brzydoty otaczającego świata. Sytuacje ratują niektóre mapy, ukazujące majestatyczne katedry czy wzgórza, udowadniając nam, że odrobina pracy mogłaby zmienić cały wystrój gry na dużo atrakcyjniejszy.\nDo udźwiękowienia nie mam natomiast najmniejszych zastrzeżeń. Dźwięki broni są solidne, każdy strzał, każdy wybuch brzmi tak, jak brzmieć powinien. W tle przygrywa radosna muzyczka, swoim stylem nawiązująca do produkcji z automatów. Niekoniecznie musi się ona podobać, nie można jej jednak odmówić swoistego klimatu pasującego do całej gry.\n\n\n\nMinecraft FPS-ów, czy przeciętny shooter?\n\nZdecydowanie, Ace of Spades nie powinno być tak ostentacyjnie porównywane do Minecrafta. Pomimo drobnych podobieństw, różnice są tak wielkie, że nie ma mowy o jakimkolwiek zestawianiu tych gier ze sobą. Recenzowana przeze mnie produkcja jest wykonana solidnie, jednak wiele jej aspektów powinno jeszcze zostać dopracowanych. Uważam, że wielu graczy z przyjemnością przywitałoby jakiś system rozwoju postaci, odblokowania nowych broni czy możliwości zaprojektowania własnych budynków. Gra ma jednak wiele silnych atutów, takich jak całkowicie modyfikowalna strefa walki, możliwość stawiania obiektów czy kilka zróżnicowanych trybów gry. Jeśli więc to, co napisałem, nie zniechęciło nikogo, a wręcz przeciwnie – ma ochotę na demolkę wszystkiego – jak najbardziej powinien się grą zainteresować.\nPlusy\n•	Możliwość niszczenia\n•	Dobry pomysł\n•	Zróżnicowane tryby gry\nMinusy\n•	Kiepskie budowanie\n•	Zmarnowany potencjał\n","January 3, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can construct defensive structures, dig trenches or drill underground tunnels.\nMoreover, Ace of Spades allows you to create and download Steam Workshop maps. The map editor is complex, but easy to use. A wide selection of objects and  effortless terrain modelling will help you design an ideal map.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to any Steam user.

There are 4 main classes each with special abilities and weapons in Aos; The Marksman, Engineer, Commando, and Miner. In this team based shooter it is important to utilize the classes correctly to actually work as a team. There is such a diverse way of the playing the game that there will not be session where you will play the same map the same way. For example you need to capture a flag within a castle. Instead of generically storming the front door, you can fly to the top, break the walls down, dig underneath it, or even build a tower to get inside. The way of taking of objectives are really up to the imagination of the player and his or her team. Also in AoS, boring maps are not a thing. The maps included in AoS is extremely varied, everything from defending a castle from invading ships, Moonbase, to a map with a huge dinosaur in the middle! and the inclusion of the Steam Workshop allows users to create&post  their own maps, so there is basically endless possibilities for maps. The game modes include Capture the Flag, Demolition, Team Deathmatch, King of the hill and much much more. But by far the Zombie mode was my favorite.

Also I noticed that finding a nearly full game was difficult. I would click the ranked or player matches and it would load me into a empty lobby. Fortunately they recently added a server browser.

The animations are terrible and ontop of it all there feels like there is no action like the game devs throw at you in the gameplay trailers. I personally thought this game had a lot of potential before I bought it. The game feels cheaply made and really doesn't feel like a good first person shooter at all. Thats why I really didn't give this game a good rating to begin with. Just another Minecraft rip off with weapons thrown in it to attract an audience. Take out the guns and this game would have no buyers.","August 18, 2014","false","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ronaldmcdeadald/recommended/224540/","ronaldmcdeadald","♫ dewi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ronaldmcdeadald/","218 products in account","This game tries to be a combination of Minecraft and Team Fortress 2, but fails to be either. Almost every server is laggy and unplayable. The hit detection barely works, so an enemy in the middle of your crosshairs will not get hit while you are killed with an SMG from across the map. The store page claims that there are seven different classes when there are only 4 in the game. The building is barely functional and very difficult to use. You won't be doing too much building, though, as the Rocketeer class can use his jetpack to bypass any defenses you have. Actually, all of the classes are terribly balanced. Very rarely are you killed and feel like your killer deserved it. The animations are laughable, and the fact that the game tries so hard to make everything blocky makes it look terrible. Minecraft's visuals have a charm to them. They are simple. The models in this game look awful and complicated, as if the developers couldn't decide between having the game look nice or looking blocky. When you join a game, it asks which team you want to join, although you will always be moved to the team with less players. What's the point of giving a choice if it is undone? Another weird part of the game is that the class selection screen includes multiple weapons and gadgets that you can use. There are at most two options in each category, although there are many empty boxes for each class, as if they were planning on adding weapon variety to the game.\nTo sum up, Ace of Spades is a badly made game that is going through an identity crisis, not sure whether it is a sandbox building game or a terribly balanced class-based shooter. 3/10","February 7, 2014","false","26.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nodwar/recommended/224540/","nodwar","[LP] Nodwar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nodwar/","48 products in account","Ace of Spades is a multiplayer combat game combining Minecraft style physics with Cod/TF2 gameplay. This leads to an interesting style of combat that rewards people for their skill and ingenuity in crafting the landscape and building structures to their tactical advantage.\n\nI have spent nearly 300 hours playing this game and the main thing that keeps me playing is the fun factor.  There are always people online obviously not as many as with some fps games but you can always get a match by using the server browser. The gameplay itself is also a main factor in its durability. As the environment is buildable you can create buildings and mould the landscape into something that allows you to outwit your opponents.\n\nWith it being in the steam workshop you can download user –created maps for use which adds endless variety.\n\nWhile the graphics may not be for everyone, people that have played games such as Minecraft or more indie style games probably won’t mind.  I guess a bonus of this is that it runs smoothly . I only experience the odd, very occasional bit of lag.\n\nPro’s:\n-	Great for lovers of first person shooters.\n-	 Multiple classes to use to your advantage.\n-	Tactical gameplay.\n-	Plenty of games available and a good range of maps that come as standard.\n-	Custom Maps.\n-	Range of game modes spanning from Team Deathmatch to Capture the Flag and ‘Zombie’.\n\nCon’s:\n-	Lots of trolls and people that try and kick you for hacking if you are much better than them.\n-	Small infrequent DLC.\n-	No skill tree/ weapon advancement.\n-	A few bugs which aren’t too big a deal.\n-	Not a large emphasis on teamwork.\n\n\nI don’t usually put this many hours into a game so with that in mind (and its low price tag) I’d definitely recommend Ace of Spades!    8.5/10\n","December 1, 2013","true","451.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game as a whole is not as fun as the original Ace of Spades (named Build and Shoot), which is free on the internet. The only real good gamemode in this game is Classic CTF, mainly because it is reminiscent of the original Ace of Spades by Ben Aksoy.","November 29, 2013","false","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They scrapped the game and rebuilt it from the ground up - and not very well. At this point, it's a sub-par FPS which awkwardly integrates building into much-too-short games filled with unbalanced, unrealistic, and frankly unfun classes. The maps are highly limited in number and not creative nor interesting. The graphics were created to vaguely resemble the style of the real game, but in the end, are frankly just weird-looking.  I tried to like the new version, I really did, but after several hours of play, I would not reccomend it.","December 6, 2013","false","16.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"
