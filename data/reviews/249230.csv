"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morgannin09/recommended/249230/","morgannin09","Morgannin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morgannin09/","237 products in account","This is a long review, so just read the bottom paragraph for a simple summary of my thoughts.\n\nIt surprises me that the general consensus for this game is worse than Risen 2: Dark Waters. To be fair, if you hated Risen 2, there likely are not enough redeeming factors about the end of the trilogy to be worth your while. But nevertheless, some substantial improvements to the overall experience have made this a promising step in the right direction for Piranha Bytes as a developer.\n\nRisen 2: Dark Waters was ultimately a failure as an open world, engrossing RPG. It was extremely shallow, overall having one of their smallest and most lackluster world designs to date, with most of the islands consisting of winding pathways with few interesting landmarks leading between major locations. These locations were greatly devoid of life, as the characters were as dull and two-dimensional as wooden boards. The combat wasn't the worst I've ever seen in a game, but it took forever to get the necessary skills to stay on top of combat, and by then you just got used to button mashing between prayers. Beyond combat, half the skills in the game were worthless or used in only scripted situations that were easy enough to do without.\n\nAt first glance, or maybe even for the first couple hours, Risen 3 hardly seems any different. But if you put some effort into it, you'll find much more in store here. The combat system is widely criticized for the wrong reasons. To be fair, the easiest way to fail at Risen 3 was the only way to WIN in Risen 2: button mashing is heavily discouraged in Risen 3, as timing your combos poorly results in substantially slower attacks. Instead, the game encourages you to time your attacks with precision, and focus your efforts between multiple foes instead of trying to spam them to death one at a time. It also has a dodge maneuver, which Risen 2 lacked on release (and when they patched it in, it was hardly any more useful). In fact, the dodge led to quite the opposite criticism: that combat was too easy, since dodging made you invulnerable during the animation. (A patched-in "Ultra" difficulty removes these invincibility frames, if you dare - as well as forcing a cooldown between potion uses.) Beyond that, skills you can learn from instructors give you a parry ability, faster combos, additional combo attacks, and further stat increases to make you unstoppable by the end of the game. It's still not a flawless combat system overall, but this is a world where Skyrim's dreadful DPS-focused combat dodges any ounce of criticism while a game like this is torn to pieces over a moderately tactical system.\n\nThe magic system is a bit unique, and certainly much more appealing than the lame voodoo system of Risen 2. Combat magic is available to all three factions, but much more varied to the Guardian faction. Some spells are equipped as a primary weapon and used in place of a sword - these spells can be used as a moderately-ranged attack in melee, or aimed as a projectile. Support magic can be placed in your quickbar for a single rapid cast, after which it requires a cooldown. Each faction has their unique spells which can only be acquired through the faction, but single-use versions (scrolls, voodoo dolls, runestones) can be found and used by any class as a disposable magical support with no cooldown.\nThe only thing that truly disappointed me about the magic was that there was hardly any difference between the different types of offensive magic. Fire and Ice did the same amount of damage, for example, and had no unique effects, such as freezing enemies or igniting them. You only switched between them if you found an enemy who was immune to one and not the other.\n\nThe world design is notably improved. The game does re-use two islands from Risen 2, and scales them down considerably, but the new locations are significantly larger, have more to explore, and have areas of the map that open up as you complete more of the story. The maps themselves are a bit more open, but still tend toward a frustratingly path-focused design that makes most of the locations seem more linear than they really are. Thankfully, they've expanded the game in a vertical direction, allowing you a BIT more freedom in climbing. It's still obvious where you can and cannot climb, for the most part, but ambitious explorers may find rewards hidden in unexpected places if you can find a way. A large assortment of books can be found throughout, attempting to expand the game's lore or close some of the plotholes left between the previous titles.\n\nI can't say the characters have improved significantly - there are plenty of fodder characters who just seem cut and paste from the previous game, and are often indistinguishable from others, but they've greatly increased in number, and the dialog has vastly increased as well. Many of the characters are still cringe-worthy or dull as dishwater, but a few still made a note with me as I played, such as the woeful Mortimer on Fog Island, the quiet yet stoic demon hunter Kane, and the misforunate Burke, many of whom have interesting quests or even just stories to tell.\n\nYou know what to expect with the questing - most RPG's these days have the same number of fetch or exterminate quests, but even in this regard, I'd say Risen 3 at least makes some of them more interesting. If you're feeling adventurous, make sure you disable quest markers - otherwise, if you're getting bored, use them to wrap up sidequests quickly. At least Risen 3's questgivers will tell you what to do and where to go, so you don't HAVE to depend on floating arrows to guide you if you don't want them.\n\nThe number of items in the game has increased, with more variety to melee weapons, magic, and firearms. Some of the weapons are mechanically indistinguisable from each other (crossbows vs. pistols, for example) yet require different skills to use. The "legendary items" quests from Risen 2 make a return, and number slightly higher, providing potent stat increases. Unique weapons can be found in two pieces, to be reforged at a smithy - but with no clues on how to find these weapons, it's quite possible you'll have better ones by the time you find both pieces.\n\nUnfortunately, the game again shipped with day-one DLC, with two story DLC's and one item-only one. Needless to say, developing gameplay content prior to release and charging separately for it is not a practice that consumers should ever endorse, but at least each DLC is slightly larger than Risen 2's, with a smaller price tag.\n\nFinal consensus: this game does not do enough to change the most vitriolic opinions about Risen 2. Nevertheless, Piranha Bytes appears to have taken some of the largest points of contention into consideration with Risen 3. Not everything got done that fans wanted, but in the shorter development time, dealing with internal restructuring and losing major designers, I think Piranha Bytes was able to focus on their most egregious sins and provide a substantial package that I don't regret paying for.","February 22, 2015","true","81.3"," 289 of 312 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","289","312","5","9"

Probably the best fire I've seen in a game.\n- Goofy as usual. Piranha Bytes hasn't changed a bit, and I like it.\n- Great open world gameplay. There's a lot to explore and find.\n- Magic is back, and it's satisfying.\n\nCons\n- Awkward sword combat--things just don't feel quite right, but with time, you get used to it.\n- Companions aren't as helpful as they are capable.\n- Story is decent, but unmemorable.\n- Astral vision ability could have been a lot cooler if there were puzzles or areas where it was required. I found I never really used it.\n\nVerdict\nIf you're looking for a decent, challenging RPG with a sense of humor, definitely get this game. The whole series is fun. Don't expect a Witcher game, but don't let the Metacritic score scare you off either.\n\n(Take the Witcher comment with a grain of salt.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedSatiin/recommended/249230/","RedSatiin","RedSatiin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedSatiin/","42 products in account","I recommend this game for those who enjoy a challenge.  NOT for players seeking the details.  READ the CONS, if these truly matter to you, DO NOT BUY. If you can live without those for a challenge, then this is a game for you.\n\nI do NOT feel this game is worth the $50.00, so if you feel this is for you, be sure to follow it and wait for a sale.\n\nThe only problems I've had, none game breaking thus far, are\n\n1. Purchase points:\na. I chose this game after reading the reviews of those who had 50+ game hours, ensuring that I was getting information and recommendations from payers who not only take time to truly evaluate a game, but also enjoy the same challenge that I do and really try to learn.\nb.  I also choose it after viewing the acheivments and seeing the acheivements 'Perfectionist: complete 300 quests", and kill ### so and so monster or animal. Many of the other acheivments are to complete specific quests, or that is how it appeared to me, So this part made my decision a touch more difficult.\n\nThe Purchase point that disappointed me most was B.  I have yet to join a faction, I only have mages up to the joining ceremony and yet it shows I have completed 146 quests.  I've completed almost half of the game before I even join a faction??? By the time I do join a faction I will have completed over half of the entire game.  ( Unless I am understanding the acheivment incorrectly, and 'Perfectionist" does NOT mean that you complete all quests in the game. )  Mind you, There are EXTREMELY important ..... abilities / items not obtainable until you do join a faction.\n\nAnd the reason I have completed so many quests is where they placed Quests.  What I mean by this is what actions or goals are considered quests.  An example is when you begin the game, you start on a ship, your woken up and told to come top side to join your 'mate' ( I will do my best to give away the absolute least regarding story or spoilers. ) and literally you only need exit the room to complete your first quest,  " Find so and so island"  When did I 'FIND' it?  In truth someone else found it.  I only woke up and moved my ♥♥♥♥.\n\n2.  The combat:\na. CON:  Combat is difficult, so far every monster I have met is able to attack without so much as a wind up or a way to tell they are about to strike, thus not giving you a chance to dodge or block, my attacks are however all wind ups, meaning all monster seem to break my attacks over and over. If I am attacked by 2 or 3 monsters I have had to run because one will complete attacking and as I wind up my attack the next one interupts me, and another attacks after that. Basically meaning I can't get a single hit in on them as they pummel me.  Also they get 2 to 3 consecutive attacks without my being able to interupt with my own attacks, I am only able to dodge like mad or pray they dont break my block. While every one of my attack is interuptable.\nb. PRO:  OMG the challenge to perfect this is amazing.  I've never played a game that has started with such a combat system that forces you to learn mechanics so quickly.\n\n3.  Dialog:\na. CON:  Dialog is a bit lame, when reporting a quest complete, if the quest has more then one objective you have to select each objective as completed, then after you go through the "I finished this part, I finished this part, I finished this part, I finished this part, you have to then click "I did everything you asked me to."  As if clicking 4 times for 4 objectives isn't enough to prove you completed all tasks.\nCON:  Some dialog choices are out of order, Your only available selection will be "I'll take you there."  and their responce will be "Ohh thank you."  " I did this, and the monsters are everywhere."  "How will I get home?"  Giving me the 'Will you help me' statement AFTER the 'yea, I'll help ya."\nCON:  Voice overs,Just before you leave the first island an important event occurs, and a party member joins you When you speak to this member they have a specific tone, and way of speaking. After speaking with them regarding several different things as you travel, their voice will change, suddenly as if they fired the voice over actor and were to lazy to fix the previous voice over recordings. And what I mean by change isn't simply the tone, it is also the manner in which words are spoken.\nb. PRO:  The amount of information provided is very nice, your given much information regarding missions, characters, locations and story content.\n\n4. Map:\na. CON:  You are given very little detail on your mini-map and full screen map, making travel difficult, and understanding which way you need to go to enter certain 'interior zones.\nb. PRO:  This is actually more realistic for the era the game is played in as map makers were not as meticulous as they are now adays, and adds to the challenge of the game.\n\n5. Mission Log:\na. CON:  Finding specific missions that you are on, in order to mark key points on your map, can be can be very difficult as it is a bit difficult to understand how they catagorized things.\nb. PRO:  as you move through the missions and add more quests to your log the rhyme and reason become apparent, easier to navagate, but also makes sense.\n\nSo, although there are many cons, I personally am enjoying the game, because the cons really don't break the game play, and the pro's seem to show me that the developer was looking to increase the overall challenge instead of spending to much time on the little things that can be easily ignored.  I understand that when a company releases a game as completed that it means they have fixed the bugs and CONS I have mentioned above.  This is why I only recommend the game to those who are specifically seeking a challenge, and NOT for players who are simply looking for story and graphics.\n\nWell that's my two cents, (Looking back) ok that's more like a buck 50,  I hope this information helps you decide if this is a game for you, and thank you for giving my first review time to read. :)\n\nI hope you all enjoy!!","October 28, 2014","true","37.0"," 177 of 225 people (79%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","79","177","225","11","0"

Risen 1 was very obviously a rebranded Gothic 4 that followed the events of the 'neutral' path of Gothic 3: Xardas and the Nameless Hero banish the gods.  Given its moderate success, however, Deep Silver dangled a bag of money in front of Piranha Bytes and out pooped Risen 2 -- an abomination of a game that somehow missed all the hallmarks of what made prior PB games great.  Apparently Risen 2 sold well enough to justify a Risen 3.  Unsurprisingly there will be no Risen 4.\n\nWhat did PB do right this time around?  Factions are back after their mysterious absence in Risen 2.  And while they don't quite approach the Gothic 1 and 2 levels of distinction they arguably surpass those in Risen 1 (with a very disappointing shallow difference between Warrior of the Order and Mage).  Moreover, each faction has its unique school of magic where spells have distinctive themes and are fueled by different 'currencies.'\n\nThe game is less linear with the ability to choose which island you tackle first; or, you can go back and forth and explore as you wish with little in the way of artificial barriers impeding your progress.  Unfortunately this pro feeds into one of the game's biggest cons: about a third or so of the way through no enemy presents a challenge.  Even on the harder difficulties you aren't at risk of dying save for the occasional one shot from certain creatures if your magic resistance is low.  And while there's plenty of content it eventually becomes a tedious slog through the same old monsters.  In one section on Kila in the final third or so of the game I swear I must have hacked my way through at least a hundred spiders.\n\nThe character system is much the same as it was in Risen 2 but its greatest flaw is that once you decide on the type of combat you want to focus on (melee, firearms, or magic); you can get close to maximizing it fairly early on.  Throw some points in Toughness to take some hits and that's all you need.  Dexterity is needed for lockpicking if you don't go mage (who have spells to handle locks) but the other skills are borderline worthless.  Silver Tongue is useful maybe a half dozen times and there's always an alternative to it.  Pickpocketing merely nets you a few extra items but you'll be swimming in gold soon enough.  Intimidate is equally as useless as Silver Tongue.  After 30+ hours of playing I haven't even touched alchemy or distilling.  Crafting isn't needed unless you're a completionist.  And then there's this 'second sight' ability to let you scout for gold, weapons, monsters, whatever... and I never used it a single time.  If you have a pulse and a few brain cells you will have no problems spotting the loot and the very few levers you need to pull to progress through the game.\n\nMelee combat is as unsatisfying as it was in Risen 2.  Most monsters will go into stun-lock charges a la Gothic 3 so your best defense isn't parrying but rolling.  Risen 1 did it better and while shields were overpowered the simple introduction of a stamina mechanic to prevent you from turtling up would have been the more elegant solution.  Fortunately the magic is better so you can nuke your way through the throngs of spiders, skeletons, and hell hounds you'll get sick of by hour fifteen or so.\n\nThe story is uninteresting and largely unexplained.  Instead of the character from the first and second games you now play as the brother of Patty.  Why?  No reason, really.  Outside of the tutorial section Patty becomes largely irrelevant unless you opt to use her as one of a half dozen or so companions in combat.  You could be random Pirate Joe for all it matters.  I didn't even see a mention of the Titans or the events of the last few games until around halfway through.  All you know is: you died, you need to get your spirit back, evil demon things are attacking, and... you have to assemble a fleet to fight the ghost of a dude who died in the second game.\n\nAn unfortunate companion to the 'story' is the non-stop 'dream' sequences you have whenver you sleep.  You wake up in the spirit world and wander around until you have a brief conversation with characters from the previous games or some big monster spawns, goes BOO, and you wake up.  Similarly jarring are the awful arcade combat vignettes against sea monsters.  Three or four times as you progress the story you're forced into a ship battle where you tool around and fire at it with ONE canon.  Fun times.\n\nRisen 3 is a game that screams 'fulfilling our contractual obligation for X number of sequels.'  And while PB puts in some effort to improve upon the turkey of Risen 2; there are still far too many flaws to justify the series continuance beyond the first game.","June 25, 2015","false","35.3"," 235 of 321 people (73%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","73","235","321","19","12"

The amount of quests I am getting in one location is just unbelievable; I am literally losing count.\n\nThis RPG is set in a world of Pirates with absolutely stunning visuals. If you enjoy taking screenshots do not look further, this game will give you plenty of opportunities to snatch great screenshots from sunset to beautiful sceneries.\n\nGreat open world and apart from quests you have a fair few of other things to do like picking up clams where you can get pearls or gathering food, vegetation for potions/magic, and a must for a good pirate, rum and other distilled substances. They are great sources of health in the game. Argh...hip Argh...hip...burp...Argh!\n\nOne thing I like so far is you do not have to worry about how many objects your character is carrying, just collect them.

Let me talk about my experience and what this game's strong point and weak points. Read first before you point that dangerous thumb at me.\n\nAs a new protaganist to the series, you are the son of steelbeard and brother of Patty who both are on the way to crab island to discover treasure from a map only to run into the army of the underworld and have your soul taken. The only thing you can do is to try to redeem it by battling against the forces of darkness\n\nRisen 3 is a good improvement over 2 in many ways, Fans of PB's  original risen will love it, those who hated/loved 2 will also be welcomed back to the pirate theme with new improvements, and those that are new to the series will be a hit or miss. The game isn't like your typical rpg or Skyrim. It is a third person rpg with different style, rules and combat. Don't be mislead though this game isn't about sailing the open oceans or exploring a massive world but instead lets you explore certain lands of reasonable size that is filled with plenty of quests, dangers, and treasures.\n\nThe combat system itself feels more smooth this time around as as it reverts itself away from risen 2 and taps back to its root like Risen with some added tweaks and with a much more fun magic gameplay. Yes you do start this game off weak, in fact you'll have to depend on your companions which you can choose to bring one at a time during the game to help you. You'll have to count on them because enemies will swipe you, attack you from sides, dodge your attacks and even blind side you when you aren't looking and in groups. In fact hard mode can be quite a challenge during the start  game.\n\nAs you progress the game leveling the way you want you'll start realizing that your efforts will start paying off. You'll start investing in new skills to aid you in becoming stronger  even experiencing better combat which should feel a bit more fluid and much like original risen. You'll also  be able to switch weapons and spells via the bottom hotbars, while combining the use of  items and scrolls becoming more powerful in fact too powerful to the point where you're completely ridiculously almost overpowered, killing enemies in a few hits..\n\nThe game offers you a choice to join between 3 factions. Voodoo, Demon hunters, or Guardians and you can only commit to one so choose carefully. Each offering its own unique skills and spells to help you fight. Some though are similar to other faction.\n\nThe game leveling systems revolves around glory and gold. You earn glory from mostly killing and questing.The quest system in this game is well done in a way so that if you've already encountered the quest you'll be able to turn it in to the npc when it is requested eliminating that need to go back and forth. There are Plenty of quests and things to do in the game to acquire glory and gold.\n\nThe return of magic this time around is more  fun to play with depending on your faction you've picked.You'll be able to utilize spells from that faction otherwise you'll have to buy runes and scrolls.\nSpells are also a completely seperate tree  and requires certain gems to purchase. When you attain spells you'll only be limited to casting by a cooldown timers. For every faction is a spell you can use as a melee spell over and over again.,You can even improve the timer and combo off more or cast faster. Yes I became a mage and I kick ♥♥♥ with a epee in my hand raining fireballs upon my enemies and stealing stuff by just reaching out my hands and did fire bending somagic this time around is  more fun.\n\nAside from the gameplay the sound and music is perfectly fine for this game, the graphics though a bit outdated is much better than its previous series for sure and the game feels more optimized (save for the 8 cores + situation). If you are a fan of the series you will see that it is NOT THAT BAD though could be improved much more. The voice acting is decent for  in the game  though  some are  a bit cheesy (such as bone) or bad but can be looked over because the dialogues actually get a bit better later in the game.. Sometimes you can see the devs joking around with the dialogue by adding really funny questions and phrases and isn't meant to be taken too seriously.\nThe quests themselves in this game contain many lore behind the world of risen 3 and will keep you wanting to do the quest. You'll have retrieval quests, kill quests, subquests, and mainquests. Not all quests are grindy at all or without purpose.\n\nThere are choice dialogues in this game and the choices affects the outcome of what happens. The choice is really up to you on how you want to play the game, maybe you'll steal, maybe you'll use your tongue and intimidate or pick another choice to accomplish your mission. maybe you rather be the bad guy and lose a bit of your humanity or gain humanity. Whatever you  choose to do in the game will either acquire your soul back or help you lose it much quicker.\n\nanyways check the game out. This game might not be the cup of tea for everyone.\nMake your own damn decision on the game. Don't be mislead  by naysayers and research it well.  I beaten the game around 25 hours and thats not doing EVERY quest there is in the game, once I became OP i went straight for the last mission. Reason is because I can save my other quests on the other islands for other playthroughs as different faction. I enjoyed the game quite a bit and hope that in the future they can improve on some of the cons I've written about the game.\n\n\n\n+ Game starts off really slow  and difficult but gets better as you progress\n+ Tons of quests, plenty of glory and gold to be found\n+ Ship battle with sea monsters are challenging\n+ The combat is much better than risen 2 but can feel a bit clunky at first until you progress a bit.\n+ Quests systems completes if you done it already in the world so you don't have to actually grab it to do it you can turn it in as long as you've done it.\n+ Magic is fun, try guardians and firebend.\n+ You can be any class you want to be varying from 3 factions.\n+ Plenty of gear to play around with and stats you can mix and match to your advantage. Legendary weapons included and upgraded weapons.\n\n+- Reused map and game materials from 2\n+- Subpar dialogue and lots of comedy and jokes, sometimes funny, sometimes cheesy, sometimes very bad\n+- Some people will probabaly not like the way the combat is done, you get a certain amount of combo hit and you must dodge or attack your enemy.\n\n- Armor feels more asthetic than useful sometimes, I found myself wearing adventurer armor during the entire game and barely changing to the other armors.\n- weapons animation are all the same, along with fist spells, wish elements played a role against enemies more.\n- combat can be repetitive after you become OP and autotarget can cause issues if you face an npcs you could accidentally hit them sometimes.\n- difficulty scaling could have some improvement.t\n- Voice is decent, main character sounds like Christian Bale's Batman.\n- Graphics needs updated engine, decent at max\n- camera can be clunky during dialogue sometimes\n- The item interface can be reworked much better, hate having to hotbar everything to use it such as self cast spells, also need rework on keybindings.\n-  The game could interact button instead of the attack button as interact, sometimes you accidently just talk to your companion in the fray of things or clicking to find loot because it is all one button.\n- Need patch to fix 8 core limitation that is causing a blackscreen\n- spells are a lackluster\n- World empty after you kill everything, it doesn't respawn so no more mobs respawn.\n\n\n\nfinished on twitch.tv/kenuty on 8/13/2014\nVideo review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epSPg1P38Pk&list=UUXGd7RegfStA25hUftOyVfw","August 13, 2014","true","49.3"," 749 of 1,136 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","749","1","0","50"

It’s the third game in the Risen series. The game was released in August 2014 on PC, Xbox360 and PS3, but the PS4 got a remastered version of the game is August 2015.\n\nThe game plays almost the same as the first two games in the series. An easy to use combat system which makes you counter and parry enemy sword swings whilst you weave in your own attacks. I found the combat system to be very clunky and not very responsive to your input.  Whilst in combat you are able to use your range weapon too; I found this to be a rather pointless addition as it misses the majority of the time even on much bigger targets.  You are able to freely explore the world and take on plenty of side quests. Each of the quests has different ways to solve them, which is a nice element, depending on how you resolve the quest; you may even get a different outcome.  I liked the fact you can play the game in almost any order you choose, meaning you can mould your character exactly how you want it to be.\n\nGraphically, I wasn’t too impressed, for me it looks worse than the previous games. I was playing on 4k and it looked really poor. Texture quality was mediocre at best. The lush scenery when exploring islands does redeem itself a bit, but what’s inside that lushness is some really bad looking modelling. The animation and sound effects are so bad, they are sometimes laughable. I believe all modern games should have voice acting in, and sadly Risen 3 has some absolutely awful voice actors. Every single word that is spoken just feels out of place and does not match up with the game play at all. It almost made the cut scenes unbearable sometimes. During the first fifteen minutes of gameplay, there is almost silence. All you hear is the gun fire, no shouting, sound effects of fights, nothing. It just seems to have very poor production values.\n\nThe game is pretty easy even when playing on the hard settings. The combat system, when you get a hang of it, is easy to use, meaning you can be taking on larger groups of enemies before too long. A lot of the time throughout the game you will be accompanied by a companion which also makes the combat scenes more easily handled too. I only died a handful of times so there isn’t any major challenge to be found here.\n\nRisen 3 does have a very good amount of content to play through. Each chapter of the game has at least 20+ side quests for you to tackle. Whilst the side quests don’t distract you too much from the main plot, they are a good addition to the game, that rewards you with money and much needed experience for completing them. I didn’t find myself wanting to complete a lot of them though; they are all very samey after you complete half a dozen; the side quests in this game are nothing when you compare it to the likes of Witcher.\n\nThe game took me almost twenty five hours to complete, with a fair few of the side missions completed. For me, since I was struggling to get through the abundance of cut scenes and dialogue, I feel that was almost a bit too much, even now I have plenty of side quests I could complete but I honestly don’t think I can put myself through any more of it. You can probably get about 40 hours of content out of this game, and you may even want to consider a second play through given the amount of choice some of the quests offer.\n\nI didn’t have any technical problems whilst playing thankfully. I was able to play at 1440p with all of the graphical settings turned up to max and still have a steady 60 fps. I played the game with keyboard and mouse, as I found that to be best for the previous games in the series, but the game will work perfectly well with a controller since it is in the third person perspective.\n\nTo sum up, I believe Risen 3 to be the worst of the series so far. The first two games had better animation and voice acting in than this one, and to some extent, they even looked better graphically.  The game is currently retailing for £24, 99, and sadly I don’t think it’s even worth half of that. If you are a fan of RPG games and the Risen series, I would suggest you wait till it drops to the £10 mark, just so you don’t feel too let down by the poor production values on show here. Whilst the game does have a vast open world exploration feel to it, it just didn’t live up to my expectations for the third game in a really good pirate series.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Combat was a bit challenging and the first island I chose to explore was interesting enough.\nThen I chose a faction to join.  I joined the mages faction, and then suddenly combat was quite easy.  That alone is not enough to condem this title.\n\nAs I started doing more and more quests, the quest NPCs were just annoying to listen too.  They would take thier sweet time to get to the point of what they actually wanted.  I mean, I can deal with a long winded NPC once in a while, but it seemed with just about everyone, I wanted to scream, GET TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING POINT.\n\nThen as I explored even more, I realised everything was the same.  The same monsters, the same scenery, the same ♥♥♥♥ing loot (the difficulty of a chest to unlock has no bearing on the quality of the stuff you find inside), and for the most part, the same quests.\n\nI played the original Risen and liked it.  I just can not get into this one.  I found myself trying to speed through quests, but then when I got to the point where I needed to do all the faction quests dealing with whatever was important to them, my will to play this game just dissolved.  It was not fun, it was a chore.  It was a repetitive chore.  Only the hope for something new had kept me playing, but I do know there isn't anything new under the sun with this game.\n\nUnless you want to play a repetitive open world game where each area is pretty much the same as any other area, then skip this game.","July 25, 2015","false","18.1"," 123 of 181 people (68%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","68","123","181","17","6"

I give a thumbs up because I loved previous Risen games, and want to support the developer which is a semi indy european company, but I'm not sure if I can recommend this.\n\nOk, the things which Piranha does great in general, does great also in this game: the atmosphere, the exploration, the humor and the side quests. AND Risen 3 does a better job in those things which are generally bad in Piranha games, like it is more polished than previous Risen games, and finally has an approachable fighting system as well, but the story is horrible as usual (even if Risen 2 had a decent story anyway).\n\nSo what's the problem? The problem is that the game is not new. RIsen 1 was an interesting game, and then Risen 2 came out and was able to bring some freshness, so they were different and innovative experiences on their own.\nBut Risen 3 is not more than Risen 1+2 with an updated Risen 2 graphics. It is disappointing even if the game is very enjoyable.\n\nThen for whatewer reason the devs cut the story and the lore of the previous games and introduced a new storyline and arch enemy. It was quiet a WTF?? What made the story more messy is that they made constant references to the happenings of the previous games even if the story line doesn't have any connection with Risen 1+2.\nBecause the story was uninteresting I felt the game a little longer than I wanted. It is a 40+ hour game, bear in mind.\n\nSo should I recommend this game? Well, if you love Piranha Bytes games and want to get all of them, you will buy it. If you enjoyed the previous games but you are not a hardcore fan don't buy it, becuase previous Risen games are better. If you hated them, you will hate also this one.\n\nBut for starters maybe this is the most accessable game. It is the most polished out of the 3 ones with the best fighting system, and becuase it has a different story you don't need to play the older games to get into it.\n\nI personally enjoyed it, but I feel it completely skippable.\n\nPiranha Bytes next time you need to try harder coz ppl won't buy your games!!!","March 28, 2015","true","42.8"," 70 of 99 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","70","99","3","0"

If you want to mash some buttons and get through stuff alright you're gonna get frustrated and angry.\nPeople who have played Gothic and previous Risen games will feel right at home here though.\n\nThe game is in many ways an improvement over Risen 2, I'll sum up all the points I think have been improved over compared to the previous game in the franchise.\n\n+ Much bigger world\n+ Tons of quests and things to do\n+ Combat at sea against sea monsters (ripped from Assassins Creed Black Flag but still nice)\n+ 3 different factions to join (exactly like in gothic 2, you can pick one and stuff will change according to your choice)\n+ Magic is back, there are tons of spells and skills for you to learn (Voodoo is back and awesome!)\n+ Treasure searching from Risen 2 is back in force and theres a lot of stuff for you to find\n+ Companions have more to say and aren't just there like in Risen 2, the game feels more alive. (They give you advice and sometimes really save your life during fights)\n+ Less bugs and glitches than in Risen 2 (although there are still a few minor issues)\n+ Gorgeous evironments! (Seriously, look at some screenshots!)\n+ Music and sound is perfect!\n+ Replayablility because of the 3 different factions (You can only join one of them so you can play the game again and experience it in a different way with different skills and everything!)\n+ Hilarious dialog sometimes\n+ Feels a lot like gothic! (no, seriously it does. The 3 different factions you can join and the overall feel of the game when you're playing is very similar. You even get good references to gothic sometimes throughout the game. Scavengers are in the game and there's a guy called Moe asking for money in front of the tavern :D and those are just a few of them.)\n+ Did a quest for a parrot, got 2200 gold and new armor! (10/10)\n\nUnfortunately there are a few things that just aren't that good...\nI love the game but in order to make this an honest game review I gotta put the negatives here too.\n\n- Voice acting is a mixed bag (For me it was fine but other players will think it's horrible)\n- Armor is really scarce throughout the game, you'll get your faction armor when you join one of them but that's about it.\n(It was pretty much the same in the gothic games though)\n- The game has frame rate issues\n- Enemy AI is horrible sometimes\n- ocasional pop in throughout the entire game\n- Some graphical glitches here and there\n- Clothes of npc's don't look that great sometimes (clipping)\n- Combat is challenging in the gothic kind of way, in the beginning you'll have to run away from enemies sometimes. If you wander off and go to deep in some parts of the islands you'll encounter monsters that are way to strong for you. Levelling is slow at first but once you're strong the game is a lot of fun. Gothic was the same and if someone says it isn't they're lying. I've finished Gothic 1 and 2 for like 3 times so I know how the games are. I don't have a problem with this but others will, thats why I said at the beginning that this isn't for casual players.\n\n\nOverall the game was and still is a lot of fun for me, I'll probably keep playing it for a while like I did with Risen 2. But players that aren't used to this kind of gameplay wont enjoy it as much as I did. I'm sure of that, so my advice to those people would be to play Gothic 2 or try out Risen 2. If you get annoyed as hell and hate the levelling and the overall gameplay of those 2 this isn't the game for you. It doesn't do anything new or inovative, it's made for the fans of those 2 franchises\n(Gothic & Risen)\n\nI give this game an 8/10\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Just started a new game to see if things are different when you join another faction and they are. I joined the Guardians and I have a different ship and some unique faction quests as well!. I highly recommend players to try the game out a 2nd or even 3rd time to see the changes for themselves.\nI know I gave this game an 8/10 but there's just so many good things that i'm seeing that I'm very tempted to raise it to 9 :D","August 16, 2014","true","70.8"," 227 of 362 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","227","362","0","7"

The combat in this game is the most simple yet the most frustrating to the point I would even prefer to have to dodge every swing to survive.\n\nRight off the bat the game gets too spread out trying to send you to 5 different areas and every other person you meet sends you out of your way to help them. I appreciate the openesss of the story and having options but it feels they tried to drown you in quests just for the purpose of prolonging the time to finish everything.\n\nTo top it off, the voice acting is terrible compared to any other game I've played and the graphics just don't feel right at all.

Sadly, it wears off after only a few hours. Most combats are the same, you will probably take the same companion with you 95% of the time and the only interesting situations will arise from glitches.\n\nThe second half of the game will be one long grind towards completing most quests, looting and killing everything there is, because skilling and learning the important stuff from trainers gets extremely expensive.\nYou will not see a single new creature/enemy in the second half of the game.\nBut you will have to suffer through the worst boss fights in the history of all PB games, which is ridiculous, because they somehow built up a reputation for having the worst end fights with Risen 1 & 2 already.\n\nI could go on ranting about many other things, some of which were certainly designed by the Devs on purpose because they are sadists and we the fans are certainly a bit masochistic in return.\n\nNevertheless, once again it is somehow a good game in many aspects as well.

The fantasy Caribbean setting and use of early firearms are rarely seen in rpgs as are open world games that are free of level scaling. Risen 3 is a game where you can find a difficulty 90 lock early on and a diff 10 in the "late game". Of course early and late game are almost completely dependent on where you choose to go and when.\n\nExploration is a strong point of the game and you're always bound to find something useful or something funny at least, whether it's a new weapon, treasure chest, schematic or just two skeletons with apples on their heads and a bunch of throwing daggers stuck in their rib cages.\n\nUnlike in many rpgs gold is useful in Risen 3 and you always need more of it. Even if you accumulate large amounts by the end there's some powerful weapons that you can buy in the end game that will deplete your reserve.\n\nConversations with NPC can sometimes feel long winded and slow but the writing also has a unique kind of derpy charm and the humor can be pretty good if a little awkward. Though the ending did feel very anti-climatic I must say, not that it matters much.\n\nEnglish voice acting's pretty good but the main protagonist sounded very cheesy to me. Overall both the protagonist and Patty looked/sounded a lot better in Risen 2 I think. The main character in R3 is simply generic and bland both in terms of his voice and appearance while Patty was made sluttier for no good reason. Patty was already good looking in Risen 2 but she also had more character and sass appearance wise imo.\n\nGuns and magic make combat quite easy, healing items are overplentiful imo and some of the skills (like distilling for example) are almost useless but ultimately I found the combat and overall gameplay quite fun and that's what matters in the end. It's a shame that some Risen 2 combat elements were removed. Things like salt/sand, the parrot pet, the kick skill but magic and "power gloves" were added so it's not a net loss.\n\nLike all the Risen games Risen 3 is a bit rough around the edges but there's plenty of fun to be had and the 3 factions even give it a decent amount of replayability.\n","February 24, 2015","true","54.0"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","27","34","0","0"

Risen 3 was developed by German developer Piranha bites who are well known for their previous titles including the Gothic franchise as well as the previous two Risen titles. Published by Deep Silver, Risen 3 was touted to be a throwback to the first Risen title by once again boasting more open world and exploration based game play.\n\nRisen 3 takes a break from the unnamed hero of the first two games. Instead you start the game as the son of the famous pirate Captain Steelbeard thus being brother to Patty a familiar face from the last two games who also features once again in this instalment. Searching for treasure on the mysterious crab coast you soon come across a skull cave that has 'Risen' from the ground, get it? Within the cave itself a skull lord appears and steals the soul of the pirate who seemingly dies. Upon regaining is life thanks too a strange shaman doctor known as Bones, another typical cheesy risen joke. The pirate begins a quest around the southern isles to reclaim his soul and ultimately stop this new threat.\n\nMoving away from the more linear and heavily pirate themed second instalment. Risen 3 has gone back to the multi-factional open world style of the first. In Risen 3 you are able to travel throughout the southern isles to visit and explore islands such as Antigua, Taranis,Calador and other familiar places from the previous games. One thing I do really like so far is that exploration really does reap rewards as you can find loot, quests and secret areas in a variety of ways. One new gameplay feature in particular is the ability to swim, while it sounds a little silly it actually becomes a great exploration tool as you can swim offshore to discover secret islands full of loot.\n\nOne of the positive traits about Risen 3 in terms of travel is in its free-form design. You can just head off in a direction and explore, with the only thing stopping you in your tracks being enemies that you are not ready for. Once you finish the starting section you can go to any island that is available to you at that time. You don't have to do the islands in a specific sequence which adds replay ability particularly when you take the factions into account. While on an Island you can travel on foot or fast travel to the various portals once activated. One useful mode of transport is a magic spell that transforms you into a flying parrot, while you cant stay in this mode for long its great if you've just travelled up a mountain and want a quick route down. It's especially useful for those of us with kleptomania as the parrot flight allows you to fly into locations otherwise inaccessible by foot.\n\nThe games combat has always been notoriously difficult throughout the series. One click attacking combined with clunky movement can become very tedious and outright frustrating. The start of the game is particularly tedious as your character has next to know abilities other than basic attacks and basic melee blocking. It can end up meaning that those who like to play on the harder difficulty settings will spend hours upon frustrated hours dying against relatively minor enemies especially in group situations. As you progress in the game, improving your stats and acquiring new abilities from trainers, combat becomes a hell of a lot easier. The combat system overall is massively improved from Risen 2 however it still suffers from fundamental flaws that have plagued the series since conception. Clunky movement, issues with focusing on enemies and of course pistol shots missing from point blank range are all back once again.\n\nThe major redeeming feature about combat this time round is the return of crystal magic. The developers took out magic in Risen 2 something which was largely complained about upon its release. Thankfully magic is back in force this time and I would argue it is the best way to deal with the majority of enemies as not only does it pack a hell of a punch but its the less frustrating option for group encounters. Luckily which ever faction you decide to join, all offer various forms of magical abilities so no matter how you build your character you will have some form of magic to fall back on.\n\nThose familiar with the previous titles won't find much different when it comes to character progression. To improve your characters array of stats you must accumulate glory points. Glory is earned for the completion of quests as well as killing enemies. On top of this to improve particular stats and gain new abilities you must find trainers which are dotted throughout the world. However to learn from trainers costs gold and depending on what you are trying to learn you must be prepared to part with a substantial amount. There are also special items hidden throughout the world which you can recover which add a permanent boost to stats these can be gain via exploration or through reading books to acquire the specific quests.\n\nWhile character progression is solid, I've never liked the way the developers have insisted on putting trainers in the game. The main reason behind this is because you really need the abilities they offer and having to pay gold for them, especially early on when large amounts of gold is not easy to come by is a massive frustration. One thing annoys me even further is particularly when it comes to the sword fighting if your a melee focused character. The ability to riposte is essential against some tougher enemies and a life saver in group encounters. Yet even though your playing as a pirate captain you don't have this ability from the start. You must go to find a trainer and then pay gold to get it which is ridiculous.\n\nAs I've mentioned there are factions in the game to which you can join one. The three factions include the mages, demon hunters and a voodoo tribe. Each faction offers an array of faction specific abilities and quests. Once you join a faction your able to then gain better ranks within that faction which unlocks better gear, quests and abilities. However once you join a faction you cannot join another so choose carefully. Thanks to the freedom that the game allows you can travel and complete the majority of quests on each factions island before making your decision of which to join. I ended up join the mages faction known as the guardians, one for the magical abilities and two for the cool eye piece.\n\nGraphically the game is good but not great. On the PC specifically I would have liked to see a lot higher texture resolutions as much of it looks very last generation console. The world however does look good and immersive. There are some glitches and bugs to be found throughout but these tend to be minor. Sadly once again Risen 3 follows suit in the terrible lip syncing animations as well as poor facial animations as a whole. Similar to the previous games the voice acting and scripting is full of off colour humour and outright cheese. Some of the voice acting isn't terrible but some is just cringe worthily bad.\n\nOverall those familiar with the Risen and Gothic series will be right at home with Risen 3. Any avid RPG player will be able to sink their teeth into Risen 3 and find a good amount of enjoyment from it. However I wonder if many people will not be able to get past the difficulty of the combat at the start, it does require a certain amount of perseverance that I think will send more casual players running for the hills. Risen 3 is certainly a large improvement on the second and there’s a good degree of enjoyable content in the game. At the end of the day, if you enjoy a decent RPG then Risen 3 will be for you however those looking for a more streamlined RPG experience may wish to look to more mainstream titles.","August 12, 2014","true","21.7"," 378 of 656 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","378","656","3","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corpekata/recommended/249230/","Corpekata","Corpekata","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corpekata/","2463 products in account","This "review" may be very stream of consciousness.\n\nSee, I don't think I'd call the Risen series a good game series, save maybe the first game. Well, that's probably a bit unfair. They are good in a variety of ways, just not the traditional ways most games are. The combat just kinda stinks in these games. There's no real way around it. Again, Risen had this issue too but was far lighter on combat than either of the sequels, at least for the majority of the game. It's incredibly basic and spammy, and there's far too much of it.\n\nSo why am I so compelled by this series? I think one of the things Piranha Bytes does well, is exploration. There's always nooks and crannies to explore and side quests to find. These random adventures with the sidequests are among Risen 3's strengths, are often very funny. Risen 3 lets you have almost unfettered access to the game's world once you complete the tutorial area. There's about 20 percent of the game walled off for story purposes, but other than that, you can really just do what you want. You'll have a few major goals, but they are so out of reach that often just following your wandering heart is the best course of action. You'll probably find your way into the main story eventually by sheer accident. There's a spell that turns you into a parrot that you can use\n\nThat brings me to the story. In order to account for that free form exploration, it's pretty basic. You are the son of a legendary pirate (and brother to series mainstay Patty) who gets his soul stolen by someone in the underworld, but you've managed to retain your human body. So you'll need to set out and find your soul, and in the course of doing so basically solve everyone's problems along the way. Now, the series has never had a strong story. For some reason you're a new character, despite that this new guy kinda looks like the old guy, and he's sort of a similar character (the previous hero is probably a bit more polite). So it's kinda weird that you're a new guy that's not very different from the old guy. Like you can actually read reviews for the game and people are actually confused about it, thinking it's the same character. Well, anyway, it's even weirder because like, the game is pretty heavily invested in Risen 2's story. You recruit 3 of the party members from the 2nd game. So, anyway, just a bit weird that they made this new character that's barely different and have him interact with everyone anyway. I'd get it if they were like "we don't want to reset the hero again," but they kinda do it to you anyway at the start. Just sort of a strange decision.\n\nSpeaking of things back from Risen 2, the game heavily reuses some of the areas. Most of them are vastly expanded or changed, but still felt a bit like a retread at times. There are a variety of quality of life improvements, like a fast travel system similar to something in an Ubisoft game. The game has the most ridiculously in depth quest tracking system, so if you're lost you just need to use your log and put "show map marker" so if you're not in the mood to explore, you have that option. Crafting's a bit easier now too. There's more trainers, and most trainers train multiple skills so you likely won't have to worry too much about not having access to someone to train you. Trainers and merchants are all marked on the map after you find them once.\n\nThe levelling system is largely the same but has been reorganized, and not really for the better. For instance, melee skill increases your skill in all three weapon types, so there's not much specializing. Similarly there's like a Silver Tongue (charm) and Intimidate dialogue option often, and these skills are on the same stat too. Most games would force you to pick, be a charmer or be a brute, perhaps tying them to related stats. So it's a little boring that way.\n\nAnyways, game starts off hard, like the others. You'll need to choose a magic faction for story purposes (and also, c'mon, free magic). This magic makes the game substantially easier, at least for the faction I chose, which favors direct damage. To be honest, and I find myself saying this with complete surprise, but I'd advise people to take a melee path. The combat does ever get good but there's some fun to be had once you get the parry ability. The basic magic attacks act sort of like weapon attacks, so you can't really use them with swords. So eventually when I got bored of how easy the magic was making the game I invested in melee and only use the cooldown abilities. Combining sword, a magic attack, and then a pistol shot while dancing around enemies could actually be fun at times. Random gripe but, hey, PB, you're a PC developer. Don't give me 30 moves and make them all need to be on the 10 hotkeys. Give me a scrolling hotkey bar or something. That's something to be said about this game over Risen 2 is that you have a lot more stuff to use, and it gives you it often. Even the magic of the other factions can be used via consumable items, so it really adds to the value of exploring. In R2 it seemed pretty rare to find anything too useful outside of a sword upgrade here and there.\n\nThe game does a good job of feeling "alive." It has a small cast of characters but this allows them to do NPC scheduling. I liked that as you clear objectives like taking back a mine overrun by undead, the miners that were displaced by the undead will go back to work. That sort of stuff. Small touches a lot of games would ignore.\n\nVoice acting is weird. The PC sounds like someone's trying to do a Bale Batman voice via Aaron Paul, and I really hated him at the start. I got used to him though, mainly because his deadpan delivery really works well given the odd stories he gets himself involved in. Most of the party members are good, and I rather love Bones' voice actor. Very strange performance in both games. Graphically it's not going to stun much but most enviroments are well done, and it seems to be far more technically sounds than Risen 2. Fairly certain I had better performance in Risen 3 than R2 on the same hardware.\n\nAnyways, I preordered it so, a quick review of the DLC, in case you ever get the game. The Gnomes isle one is kind of bland. About 2 hours. Not much to do there, honestly, and it feels rather disconnected. One of the big appeals of the game to me was sailing into a port, finding treasure maps and quests that take me to a different island, and just bouncing around. The DLC, by nature, can't be involved in this, so it loses that. The second major DLC is the Fog Island one. This one I like better. It's more involved in the main story, and has some decent atmosphere. Also had some good treasure to be found, while the other one didn't. Still suffers from being disconnected. Both are about 2 hours each, which isn't too bad for 5 bucks, but I'd probably wait for at least a small discount.\n\nWriting this all out sounds negative, and it kinda is, but as much as I have issues with some of it, I enjoyed my overall time. I think PB are really good at creating areas to explore. The aren't too big, not too small, and there's always something around the corner, and they give you. I just hope, now that they have the rights to Gothic back again, that we see them address the combat in the future. I don't need much when it comes to action RPGs, but something's gotta give. Even something as simple as making combat rarer.\n\n\nAlright, ramble done. I don't think I can recommend it outright. Have a tolerance for Eurojank, and like pirates, humor, and good exploration? Probably worth getting. Liked Risen 2? Get it for sure. Hated Risen 2? Ehh, it's an improvement but not leaps and bounds. Wait for a sale.\n\nFinal clocked in time is 45 hours, for those that care about game time. Minus the DLC and a few deaths / idle moments I'd say most people will get 35-40 hours out of it.","December 14, 2014","true","45.4"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","38","57","0","0"

There are also a wide variety of side quests to pursue which provide quite a few hours of entertainment. The crew of your ship which you will build up over time are interesting as they will make comments as you travel with them, some of which are fairly amusing. Another thing that I liked was the skill system, to many games have long complex skill trees that don’t feel like they contribute to much more than the player stats. In risen 3 you can learn any skill you want and allot of the spells are interesting to play with, from being able to blink around the field to turning yourself into a parrot to more aggressive combat spells there is allot to play and experiment with. While I know that some people have had stability issues I’ve yet to crash once and fps drops are small and few so I personally think that the game is fairly stable.\n\nOn the other hand this game does disappoint particularly as you progress, this is due to your character becoming overpowered and there being no real counter balance making combat a chore as the enemies don’t become notably stronger or varied also meaning that there is little incentive to mix things up. Another damming issue is that you don’t have to get too far into the game to have seen every enemy except the bosses. Graphics were another issue, while the environment may be appealing the rest is fairly sub-standard and broken graphics and clipping are a common issue. It’s also fairly easy to glitch a quest with issues ranging from broken markers through to the quest being impossible to finish effectively breaking the game forcing you to either load an earlier save or start a new game. while the game does have some replay value from joining different factions and completing different quests it could do with some incentive to start a new game such as unlocking (significantly) harder difficulties or additional content. I think that the straw that broke the horses back though was the highly anti-climactic endgame. The last few quests and the final cut scene were extremely disappointing because allot of what you had done to that point seemed to fizzle out leaving you asking the question “what, is that it! What the (inset preferred term to express outrage)!”\n\npros:\n.interesting environment\n.the story was great up until the last chapter\n.fully voiced (though it’s kind of expected in this sort of game these days)\n.interesting characters not the best ever but still ok\n.stable\n\ncons:\n.not challenging after a point + various balancing issues\n.anti-climactic ending and no closer\n.can bug out on you either quest markers or in a breaking way\n.poor graphics\n\nIn conclusion I felt that while the game was fun to play it doesn’t feel finished and while I can accept that not all games are going to be polished to a mirror shine they need to pick up the slack in some regard whether that be through the story or the gameplay mechanics and risen 3 ultimately just didn’t do that.","August 29, 2014","false","82.6"," 48 of 75 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","48","75","3","0"

I bought this game based on the various reviews here swearing that the game will get better, but honestly, who wants to go through 5 or 6 hours of gameplay before having fun?\n\nThe combat is clunky. The attacks are not responsive, the characters go through pirouettes, leaps and lunges to deliver a single blow. At the beginning of the game the delay between the strikes in your 3-hit combo are long enough to allow the enemy to interrupt you every single time. You will be reduced to using the same hit and roll tactic for next 3 hours, whittling away at the enemy's health while your companion does most of the heavy lifting... Unless the companion AI suddenly decides to stop attacking or has gotten stuck somewhere, in that case whittle away.\n\nOn the other hand, as you progress you acquire new types of weapons and skills that really add up to the combat. It can still be frustrating, but after 5 hours or so (your mileage might vary depending on the places you visit first and how you develop your character) you start to see where the combat is trying to go. I do not if it eventually gets there, I will update this review when I revisit the game.\n\nThis might be surprising, but the combat isn't what finally pushed me away from the game. It is the conversation that did it for me, and that is quite sad because they went through the effort of voicing pretty much everything. The problem is that the conversations meander so much, there are so many exchanges in one conversation branch that hold no value, they don't develop the characters, they don't introduce lore, nor do they mimic normal conversation. It is really, baffling how much extra effort went where it needed to.\n\nI understand that a complaint for the previous game was the lack of voiced acting or how little voice acting there was, I am not too sure about this, but regardless, there is just too much useless and pointless dialogue in this game, but I might have been able to take if it wasn't for the horrible voice acting.  That's right, there is awkward writing being voiced very badly. This is the first time that this has affected my gameplay so much that I have stopped playing.\n\nAll that said, the game has the potential to improve plenty, perhaps by the 15th hour everything else would be sufficiently enjoyable that you can look past the scrip and voice acting, but if that is the case, it would be better to wait for this game to go on sale, currently it isn't worth the asking price.","August 15, 2014","false","17.2"," 186 of 328 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","186","328","0","3"

What does return though, is a more open world, literally tons of quests with branching options and the return of joinable factions.  The combat is more refined than Risen 2, it flows a lot better.

Through the 30 or more hours it’ll take you to complete the game, you’ll encounter so many locations, characters and situations that it takes far too much time to talk about in detail. Little things, like the two loonies with Anatidaephobia, or bouncer at the tavern on Calador who has the same name as the bouncer in Gothic 2. Risen 3 won’t do anything to win you over if you hated the previous instalments of the series. But then again, that really just means this series isn’t for you. Risen 3 is no huge leap forward, but instead focuses on small but considerable improvements and additions to the formula. It’s not perfect, and you might not feel there’s enough new for your liking, but for me it was just enough. I was never bored throughout my adventure, there was always something new to do, someplace new to discover. The seemingly small environments were teeming with enough life that it felt a lot bigger than it might look on a map. It might not be the proper sequel to Gothic 2 we’ve all been waiting for, but it does its job well enough for me to accept it into the collection.\n\n4/5\n\nFull review:\nhttp://www.pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/risen-3-titan-lords/","August 19, 2014","true","49.1"," 34 of 54 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","34","54","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/a2bradjan/recommended/249230/","a2bradjan","DecryptedGaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/a2bradjan/","636 products in account","Risen 3 promises to bring back the best features from the previous titles in the series as well as features from the Gothic series. In the next installment of the Risen franchise, you are a new hero who must fight the oncoming Titan attack. The world is crumbling, island by island and you must build up a resistance to fight against the horde of Titans. Your soul has also been stolen and you must figure out how to regain it back, claiming it as yours as it once was.\n\nRisen 3 is quite an improvement from its predecessor: Risen 2 in all the right places. The animations, skills, exploration, and graphics have all been upgraded. One of the reasons the Risen series is not enjoyable for gamers is due to its frustrating combat. I can attest to being very frustrated with the combat in Risen 2. The combat in Risen 3 has not been improved very dramatically. The combat system is mostly the same except for a few tweaks. You will still get frustrated at one point or another, but continuing through the story definitely has its benefits.\n\nThe animations during fighting battles have vastly improved, easily having the best animation work out of the Risen series to date. Skills also pour into the combat system more than ever. Yes, you still have to use money to purchase skills. Yes, you still have to use glory to purchase skills. But, the skills you learn in Risen 3 are more beneficial than any other skills in the Risen series. The skills provide players a somewhat easier time in each fight because they are learning extra skills that will help in combat, providing for quicker and more efficient kills.\n\nWhere Risen 3 really shines is its exploration and its storyline. You are a new hero in the Risen universe who has his soul ripped out from a Titan Lord and must get it back. Simple premise, but its a little more complicated. When you wake up, a war between the Titans and humans is going on and your hero is caught in the middle of it. He is then sent to destroy Titan portals, to keep Titans from entering the world as well as forming an alliance between the remaining island factions to ensure humans are victorious. The storyline provides hundreds of quests that people can give you to do in exchange for money, items, or even glory. The quests can range anywhere from "Kill x Amount of Bloodhounds" to recovering stolen items. Factions and exploration are a few main features of Risen 3. You can join three factions: Demon Hunters, Voodoo Pirates, or the Guardians. Joining one over the other reaps different benefits than another. You may also only be able to learn skills if you are a specific faction, which may be of use to you later in the game. Going back to the islands from Risen 2 was refreshing but also disturbing when you see all the destruction that has been caused to the cities. Exploring the large amounts of caves also gave me a Skyrim feel, which I haven't felt for a while. It seems like every place matters to where its at and every place is different and distinct from another place. There is not a huge difference in graphics, but Piranha Bytes obviously took a lot of feedback from Risen 2 and improved some major bugs within the graphical system. The storyline provides anywhere from 10-50 hours of gameplay; depending on how many hours you spend on exploring and how many hours you spend on doing the wide variety of quests.\n\nSomething came back to the Risen franchise. Magic. There is still Voodoo magic, but I'm talking about REAL magic. Such as magic from Risen 1. I loved magic in Risen 1 and I was really happy to see them bring it back for Risen 3. In Risen 3 it is done very well and one of my playthroughs I eventually just used magic because of how powerful it was. If you would like to become a wizard, join the Guardians faction, they are the faction that handles magic.\n\nAlthough, the game is better than previous titles in the series, it has its flaws. One, the combat system. It hasn't been revamped and you will still get frustrated from your "lack-of-skill". Although, unlike Risen 2, if you keep leveling up and buying more skills, you will begin to have the upperhand in combat; which was awesome to see and kept me going. Although there is a TON of exploration, you are visiting the same places as in Risen 2. I really would have liked to see another world, instead of the one from the previous title.\n\n(This is a shortened review for Steam. The full review will be up on my blog ready for anyone and a link will be provided. Happy gaming!)\n\n6.5/10","August 12, 2014","true","54.5"," 119 of 210 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","119","210","0","8"

In Risen 3 they brought back the elements most missed from the first game, in addition to the things that already had in the second game. If you played Risen 1 and Risen 2 you must think already that the change of the charaters appearance is kinda common from game to game. But I don't want to discuss about that.\n\nWell, risen 3 showed a big advance on the mechanics of the plot for two reasons: In the previous games there were only 2 factions to choose (Risen: Monastery and Bandit Camp| Risen 2: Inquisition and the Natives) and in Risen 3 you'll have 3 factions (guardians, demon hunters and voodoo warriors) and also you can choose the side that you will be (of the humans or of the demons) that is decided according to what you do to people. And the second is that the faction and the side that you choose will interfere on the main story of the game.\n\nThe game brought back also the crystal and rune magic from the first game, without letting away the voodoo magic. It also has new kinds of weapons based on the first game.\n\nWith so many things that are based on the first and second game, we can say that Risen 3 is the sum of the others, with some things more.","May 9","true","32.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

First and foremost I am coming to love this game and I hated, absolutely hated the first and second game. I actually just gave both of them to my friend on the day I bought them. I am honestly unsure why I dis-liked the first game, something about it just pushed me away so severely I could not stand it.. That for me at least was fixed in this one.\nIt is fun, I enjoy all the stories and quests and silly little things you can find, despite some bad voice acting at times I do actually like the voice acting and I love the things the main character says. All in all I love this game, but I have one gripe. Honestly the combat is really lacking, even if it is an improvement. No matter how good you seem to get with the combat, you are nearly guaranteed to get hit a couple times fighting a group of two (or three if you have a companion) and if you are fighting a group of three or up you will not avoid damage. That is just how it is. Combat does not allow you to get good enough to really protect yourelf while you deal damage. I found dodging to be more effective than blocking after a bit but still, it was just impossible to really avoid damage... Which really sucks to me because I liked to play games "perfectly" if you will. No mistakes and such. That doesn't matter in this game.\nBut anyway, like I said I love this game, it is great, just don't expect to be to awesome in combat. You will be able to deal pretty heavy damage eventually though. 8/10 for me, only combat holds this game back in my eyes.","August 13, 2014","true","38.5"," 87 of 152 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","87","152","0","0"

Follow along with Gravelvoice McNeverShave and his sister ♥♥♥♥ McNoArmor as they do vaugely pirate-themed things! This game includes such jaw-dropping innovations as:\n\n-Invisible Walls! No more will you have to dread the freedom of exploration! With our patented Invisible Corner system, you won't go anywhere we don't want you to! And sometimes you won't go places we do want you to!\n\n-Combat! With light, heavy AND ranged* attacks you no longer have to devote any thought to strategy! Simply push the attack button until the enemy dies! And with our No-Gain HP system, even trival combat with early-game eneimes will be delightfully treacherous as 3-4 hits will always kill you! Combined with unblockable enemy attacks and unbreakable enemy guard, you will worry about literally every fight! And there's thousands of them!\n\n-Talking! Enjoy choosing from up to TWO dialouge options when talking to characters with the personality of wet cardboard WHILE listening to a character voice so real you'll swear you were talking to a man with a twleve pack-a-day habit!\n\n-Moral Choices! When confronted with a burning orphanage, you can choose to either help the orphans trapped inside OR roast hot dogs over their buring flesh! Sometimes, you won't even know you're making a choice!\n\n-Graphics! With our dynamic light system , you'll be hard-pressed to differentiate rocks from enemy models until they attack! And then it's too late! Plus, NPC's come in up to THREE different models!**\n\n-Useless Minigame! Since doing literally everything other than combat is based off of skills (which involves finding trainers, spending gold, and solving Fermat's last Theorem) you'll be presented with literally pointless lock-picking, arm-wrestling, knife-throwing, and many more!\n\n-Exploration! Never again will you have to worry about trying to find the right hallway! All you have to do is keep going forward! Don't even worry about venturing to outlying areas! If a quest doesn't send you there, we've ensured that it's not worth your time!\n\n-AND SO MUCH MORE! Order now, operators are standing by!\n\nSide effets may include swearing, sweating, rage-quitting, game-breaking bugs, lack of autosave, lack of character growth, lack of character development, and questioning of life decisions. Do not mix with other RPG's. Ask your doctor if Standard Third-Person RPG: Pirate Flavor is right for you.\n\n*Ranged attacks not actually ranged.\n**Excluding female models.

With these three hours, I must confess. I'm sold! However, I will admit faults where they are due. I'll outline the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nThe Good\n1) Shiny enviroments to look at! Crystal clear water, and reflective water bring life to the world. Much improved over number 2 in the series.\n2) Combat mechanics, the skill system is similiar to Dark Waters. They've improved on the "wheel" so to speak.\n3) UI layout, it's simplistic and opitmized. You wont feel, it's a waste of space. Since it barely takes away from the visual sights.\n4) The music, it's well done.\n5) Swaggity swag, more swag than you could possibly swag out to.\n\nThe Bad\n1) Sounds and atmospheric immersion. Combat sounds are sub-par. The enviroment sounds, just seem off. I know, pervious incarnations have had these issues. Hopefully, patches/mods will fix it.\n2) LOS on enemies, so far mobs just seem to see you at a ridiculous range. Sneaking, definitely helps trim that. Movement can be awkward and disorienting at first. Just need to adjust.\n3) Lack of interface options for fullscreen mode. Game started out windowed, I had to ini file, fix it. Not a major deal, but easily fixable via placed in-game options.\n4) Character identity confusion? Okay, minor spoiler...you're not the nameless hero from the other games. Yet, you're with Patty and the character is Steelbeards son. However, you're still nameless. I call him "Ted Dos Lagos" we get it Piranha Bytes, you don't name the "heroes". I'm sure, ya'll over there have some inside joke about it. It's from the Gothic days, and eventually the heroes name get's revealed.\n\nThe Ugly\n1) Claw monkeys!\n2) Facial expressions and animations. They just don't really have a quality feel, it's irky. The combat animations, aren't amazing. Yet, it could've been better. I know, the guys at Piranha Bytes, have it in them.\n3) Lesser polished look on model textures and meshes for bodies They took a step backwards, this go around. Dark Waters, had really nice textures and meshes. I will admit, the armor looks pretty dope, which helps overlook the body.\n4) Dead Veggies, you'll spot dead vegetation on living healthy plants here and there...it's weird to see. I know it adds immersion, it just looks off. Minor gripe of mine.\n5) The dialogue, lots of sarcastic remarks. Lots of profanity for profanity sake. Sailors, like doing that. The voice acting is ugly, but it's not terrible.\n\n7.5/10\n\nOverall, based on my first impressions. It's solid follow-up to Dark Waters. It needs some patching, needs some shiny boot polish, needs a bath. However, it's Risen the only successor to Gothic. You get, what you pay for. If you're a true zealot of the old Gothic series, whom are rare. Give the Risen franchise some more thought and maybe even you can help improve it. I will say, we'll never have another Gothic II. I'm okay with that too. I genuinely feel, the guys/gals at Piranha Bytes, have the best intentions at heart for their products.\n\nEdit: I'm just going to add, if you do still enjoy Gothic II, in all of it's fantastic glory. There are a few mods out there. The community is dim and with little life, I know World of Gothic closed their doors. Folks, are out there though. Just need to try and find them.","August 12, 2014","true","26.8"," 91 of 161 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","91","161","0","3"

The finale for Risen series. At least I hope it is, although the game explains nothing and again the plot feels like a huge anime show filler the main character slashes unimportant ♥♥♥♥ and sub-plot has no real impact on the core story.\nIncipiam.\nThe Risen 3 once again throws us onto the infamous southern seas full of small islands and boring, uninspired pirates of the caribbean theme. I can rightfuly feel cheated (again) by the developer, who promised to dump the failure Risen 2 was and go back to Risen 1 alike tone and released only selected set of screenshots and information during the development time.\nYou start the game on the Crap Coast, fighting poor-♥♥♥ attempt of hitting towards their braindead fanboy scene with scavengers who also loved Risen 2 (because of the stamp PIRANHA BYTES GAME printed on a box - or they genuinely enjoyed it, but this review is not about scat fetish, it's about Risen 3). I mean - oh God, do they really think they managed to create a good pirate theme in Risen 2 and decided to base the whole game around it once more?\nI'm convinced that the developers live in some kind of green-house, protected from any word of critique, letting themselves to hear only braindead applause Risen 2 received from PB-logo's mental slaves.\nSo, we're now a different person, a brother to Patty. A wierd decision if you ask me, because he doesn't feel different at all from the previous "nameless" hero (whom we actually meet in the game, with levitating rum bottle floating above his hand). All right - I guess, because I could play a rock named Tom and I wouldn't feel any difference and the plot wouldn't suffer at all: the main character just grunts, speaks some kind of broken germenglish and the voice actor seems to be jagged (you can actually hear it!), and he mostly says "everything will be all right", "I will do it", "give me more money". Ok, back to the game. The Crap Coast is a training level, where we die and our soul is stolen. Patty cries, buries us and then Bones from the previous game appears out from nowhere and revives us. After leaving the Coast the game gives us few main goals: you need to reclaim your soul, you need to form an alliance to defeat the deus ex machina which is the ghost of Crow. Why is he back and haunts the seas? Duh - TO HUNT YOU! Why? Ummm, I don't know and it's never explained beyond that. It actually is a contradiction, because later it's explained that everything we do helps Necroloth and was planned by him. Why did he send Crow to hunt us? Ummmm... Talk about Star Wars I-III plot nonsense that tries to look good. The whole plot feels like wrote by an 8 years old fan of PB's games. The Crow subplot would actually make sense if he appeared after the plot twist, but he's actually the second most important cause of our actions to form a fleet. The third one is to join the faction which will help you to reclaim your soul and gives a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of quests.\nI've to admit that doing quests in the early stage of the game was fun, as most of them were reminiscent to Gothic's stage of choosing your faction. Also because the new game areas, like Calador and Taranis are actually well designed and are open for exploration. You can actually jump on some roofs to discover some powerful stuff early in the game. You're not too limited by the game and you can actually choose what do you want to do now. To level up in the faction, make and alliance, destroy the shadow portals, or just do minor nonsense. It's a huge step forward from Risen 2, but it's not a big achievement (I don't really believe it is possible to make a worse game than Risen 2 was). Unfortunately they reused some islands and they are as bad as they were previously. Antigua is laughable and Tacarigua is a boring set of corridors with some bonus chests you can't miss.\nThen you perform an unsuccessful ritual in order to reclaim your soul, you defeat Crow and arrive to the SKULL ISLAND. You kill some minor trash mobs, free three main mages and the game ends with one of the most disappointing, rushed, not thought through, cheesy endings I've ever seen, including the shoot-2-bullets-to-win Mara fight. I mean - what the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? The series plot is excactly where it was at the ending of Risen 1! Another titan/titan lord (apparently Necroloth is a Titan Lord AND a Titan at once, which doesn't make sense and contradicts the previous games) is defeated, everyone cheers up and they set sail to the open sea... Watch credits and go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, you just finished a boring filler which is apparently a clue of the whole series. Disappointing, because I really hoped for jumping out from the ♥♥♥♥-hole Risen 2 dug plot-wise.\nGameplay-wise it's a Risen 2 as it should be in the first place. The combat works, character development doesn't feel like a shoveled down gimmick that does nothing at all but brakes the whole game. The skills are thought through and work, but they're still the same broken fundamentals of Risen 2 gameplay concept which is just not fun and boring. Firstly, the game is incredibely easy. Like - super easy no matter which path you take. Muskets were overpowered in Risen 2 and instead of reworking the whole system, they decided to overpower everything. Melee combat is predictable and it's easy to kite enemies, you can actually defeat EVERY type of monster in the VERY BEGINNING (after the tutorial). Imagine my astonishment when I actually defeated some golems with a basic swords, and then mauled down a shadow guardian (which is a reskinned dead guardian from Risen 2) right in Calador. You will meet only two stronger enemies, some kind of flying lizard and an undead beast, but the feeling of character progress is absolutely non-existant. You will see everything the game has to offer in the first 2 hours of the gameplay time. After you master melee fighting/demon hunters' spells/whatever you will just be able to do more mistakes (letting enemies hit you) and you will kill enemies with one or two swings less. Every single enemy has exactly the same set of moves - if they have actually different ones, I didn't see it, because fighting with a big rat feels exactly the same as fighting a shadow beast, only requires few swings more/less. You can beat the whole game not using any potions or spells, actually. I never used demon hunters' overpowered spells and summons besides the Morgoloth fight (the ONLY enjoyable fight that required spells and curses and actual tricky kiting of endless enemy spawn). I crafted the best sword in the game mid-game and 1-2 hit everything. I never used buff potions but a rum for healing. I never learned any other crafting schools as the blue-prints I found weren't simply worth it.\nI can actually see the character system working and worthwile, but not in the game that shows you everything it has in the first hours lets you beat it all with finger up your ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nWhat else? Game boasts with HUNDREDS of quests, but let's make things straight. There's 100 quests at max and I wouldn't be surprised if there were less. If you take a quest "follow person X to point Y" and split it to 7 (SEVEN) separate quests it doesn't mean you deliver 7 more quests. It's still 1 quest that takes 1 minute to "accomplish" - it's only cut into smaller pieces. I think the developer really wanted to "shine" but the "hundreds quests" talk is a fraud.\nI mentioned laughable hitting towards their braindead fanbase. There's more than scavangers. They actually copy-pasted Moe the bouncer that wants all your money before you enter a tavern and Kyle, the guy from Gothic 1 which had a hut that everyone walked through. It's miserable and shows that developers are aware that they can never make nothing new and good at the same time: they're slaves of "those guys who made Gothic" and will never achieve more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinepest/recommended/249230/","vinepest","Owl Cluster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinepest/","481 products in account","(The game took me 35-40 hours to complete, Steam failed to record some of them, so the displayed amount is missing at least 8 hours) If you know Piranha Bytes and their history, you know what you're getting yourself into: A unique and memorable adventure with quirks both major and minor. Virtually everyone would like to see another proper Gothic game, but PB is keeping in mind what the market lacks at any given time and what the publisher may be willing to shell out money for. Back in 2012, it made sense for them to try out a different setting for Risen 2. After all, it had to compete with the likes of Skyrim, and a small studio such as PB has to pick its battles. Risen 2 was a sequel developed from scratch (content-wise) – no easy task, I imagine. They probably could not afford to ditch it all again for Risen 3 and instead opted for a more iterative approach, applying a thin layer of Gothic in the meantime to please the impatient fans. Thus, it feels more like a very large content update to Risen 2 than a true sequel, and PB have not quite delivered on their promise to go back to their roots. I'm not going to talk about story and graphics, as those elements are just solid, do the job and do not stand out to me. What does stand out, is the world.\n\n\nThe world:\n\nThe islands can be visited in any order this time around. They have been lovingly crafted, with many small highlights and cheekily placed treasures waiting to be uncovered. Carefully placed objects tell stories without using words, such as skeletons surrounded by bottles of rum in a secluded spot or a monkey messing around among bananas, voodoo dolls and corpses. There were countless occasions of these enriching little things that never failed to make me smile or ask myself "WTF happened here?". The world is teeming with quests (300+ of them) that mostly revolve around fetching and killing stuff. Their presentation through funny and witty dialogue (which does have its cheesy moments) makes them rewarding to complete beyond the glory and loot you get. Swearing is indeed overused, which is a trademark and a welcome recurring theme in the German version, but probably superfluous in the eyes of the English audience. The world and the characters that populate it can suck you in for countless hours at a time. What bothers me is the use of recycled locations from Risen 2 (such as Antigua and Tacarigua), which, apart from the shadow realm's dark taint, retain their Carribean atmosphere.\n\n\nA thin layer of Gothic, weapons & armor:\n\nPB promised to go back to their roots and create a darker atmosphere. There were indeed (very short) moments where I felt like I was playing a Gothic game again, largely due to the new locations, factions and their armor sets. Roaming through the swamplands in a demon hunter's armor that looks like a beautiful cross between a dragon hunter's armor (G2) and an Old Camp one (G1) felt great. However, once I returned to my ship and met a parrot named Polly that told me to shave, nostalgia was quickly smothered. There are a few reincarnated minor NPCs from the old games, such as Mud (G1), an annoying, needy motormouth following you around for a bit, and Moe (G2), a violent bully demanding a toll from everyone trying to enter a tavern. Such small instances of fan service kindle hope for a more substantial return to Gothic in the future.\n\nAside from the faction-specific armor sets, there is still a huge emphasis on pirate's clothing. This results in an muddled mixture of epochs and settings in places. Moreover, it's a shame that some stronger versions of armor pieces are just recolorings of the previous ones (e.g. a third-rank demon hunter helmet is a shade lighter than a second-rank one). Re-using assets from within this game and the previous one and applying a different coat of paint to some may be a necessity because of the development team's small size and budget. However, it seriously hurts immersion and they need to apply more polish and care to their equipment in future games.\n\nThe types of weapons you'll find are again ripped from different eras and settings. There are Gothicesque axes and maces, there is your typical pirate gear and then there are a few questionable design choices. For example, the strongest musket in the game looks like an overdesigned modern-day (scoped...) air rifle that is made of bright, varnished wood. The fact that it says "way ahead of its time" in the description doesn't help much. By mixing medieval-looking arms, pirate sabers and fancy guns, PB created a rather incoherent set of tools.\n\n\nCombat:\n\nServiceable, but still rather quirky. You'll find that monsters essentially teleport to your location from 10 meters away and repeatedly knock you back in a straight line. This gives a very rigid and stiff feel to the whole affair when it comes to sword fighting. Thankfully, you can dodge and pick up more moves along the way, but most of the time surviving melee combat felt more like exploitation of design flaws than standing up to a challenge to me. Many have said that it gets better later on as you get stronger and master your timing, but I really wasn't enticed to put up with sword fighting for that long. The fact that they re-introduced offensive magic abilities (painfully absent in Risen 2) adds some much needed flow and diversity. Muskets still provide an easy way to avoid finicky sword fighting and just shoot s#it in the face Indiana Jones style. I would not call them overpowered per say, as they behave and do damage as you'd expect, but still quite out of place in a Piranha Bytes RPG.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nPiranha Bytes took Risen 2 as a foundation, made it less linear, a little bit better and added a few excellent islands and factions. The result is a fun and engaging, though incoherent pirate game with a hint of Gothic/Risen 1 and plenty of the old PB quirks. That's a little less than I was hoping for, but about what I was expecting. Overall, I'm satisfied with Risen 3 and I can't wait for what future games might have in store.","August 15, 2014","true","27.6"," 46 of 80 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","46","80","0","0"

I Loved Risen and Risen 2 before this. the aliasing was a bit disappointing when first started up, but using Nvidia's 4K DSR makes the graphics very good indeed - and I'm a stickler for good visuals. Risen is a feel good RPG with great (although remade at times from Risen 2) locations, quests and characters along the way, each having a distict personality. Repeating a location isn't all that bad, it adds familiarity and adds continuity from the previous storylines.\n\nThe Combat, for me, is great, not clunky at all, very simple but the amount of weapons and options you have for defeating foes is plentiful. Do you really want to have a long, drawn out fight with one of the hundred Scavengers in the game, or just get it out of the way quickly and move around and explore, loot chests and complete quests? For me RPG's like Risen 3 (and the first two) are built for exploring, not getting into 5 minute fights at every turn.\n\nThe DLCs are worth getting too, adds hours of extra gameplay and great bonus items, more great quest storylines too! Sad to have completed it! Though maybe I'll find the time to get some replay value by playing as another faction...\n\nFor me, an easy 8/10 all things considered.

It's like a mix of Risen and Gothic 3 and Two Worlds II. You get to play as Captain Steelbeard's son who is your typical hotheaded pirate that loves adventure and treasure hunting. And man his sister is hot. xD\n\nThe detail in the world is amazing. You have to take the time to just look at everything. Explore and find hidden paths and secrets and LOOT LOOT LOOT. You will be looting your a$$ off in this game.\n\nThe controls need work though, I found the controls when fighting to be a little clunky but damn if that Dark Souls type dodge roll button didn't save my a$$ several times when I got caught up in an ambush. I was spamming that button like mad. And there was a nice bit of satisfaction when in a sword fight and finishing off the threat by blasting it with my pistol.\nOh and speaking of finishing off. I like that sometimes you will see a finishing animation after a fight. It's not shown often like in other games where you get tired of seeing the same finishing animations over and over, but you will see them here and there and it mixes up pretty well by offering different types of finishing animations and camera views like when ramming your sword in a guys stomach or catching him from behind in a struggle to cut his neck open with your sword for example. Badass! :D\n\nI was pretty impressed with the detail and animation of the beasts. Wait until you run into that damn alligator. It scared the heck out of me the first time, chasing my a$$ all over the place, the damn thing was relentless. But the detail and its animation was nice.\n\nThe NPCs that join up with you actually help you out. I had left an NPC behind and I wandered off, and next thing I know I was caught up in an ambush. I thought I was dead for sure, Dark Souls dodge rolling all over the place for my life. Next thing I see the NPC running to save my a$$ and he casts a heal spell on me almost immediately and starts kicking the sh!# out the threat. I was like O.O\n\nOne more thing I have to mention. Even though the voice acting is... terrible, you will laugh at the dialogue. There is some serious humor and cursing in this game. LOL. Try wandering off in the beginning and your sister will ask you. "Hey, where you going? Do you even know what your doing? Are you Fu#%ing lost?" And you can choose to hide behind your pride and answer back, "No I'm not Fu#%ing lost! I know exactly what I'm doing!" Knowing damn well you don't. xD\n\nAnyway, I can say I am happy with this game.

It's just the tutorialmap, afterwards there is not very much of that left.\n\nPersonally i liked it, even though it often feels less mature than Gothic1,2,3. But hey, it's not that you're drowning in major quality RPGs to be picky, is it? :)\n\nIt does many things better than R2 (combat, feats, size of world) and it does many things equally good/bad (quite shallow story, ocasionally repetitive fights, etc.) but in the end it's still funny to explore, find the secrets, discover things, visit new islands, fight sea monsters, have sea battles, take different companions with you, etc.\n\nBiggest plus is that the companions (of which there are some to choose) now respond more to the world you are and to the things you do.

The main storyline is not good at all, but there are lots of interesting side quests and colourul characters to talk to.

Lots of relaxed type of fun but overly confusing in some of the crucial quests. Most of it is fairly easy on medium difficulty sans finding a way over the lava in calador and a few other quests.  Good game but i think it's worth about 30-40 dollars and not 50. Good gaming all.\nI've changed my mind about game based on ridiculous crucial quests to join factions. I managed the native one just fine but others are Bugged and unobtainable based on game information.

Though as I said, every class can do everything, which sadly means your decision of who to join in the first half of the game is just fluff, especially when you take into consideration that even the few spells that only a certain faction teaches are still abundantly available as scrolls. This also means that the game doesn't lend itself well to multiple playthroughs.\n\nNow, all that sounds pretty negative, but everything else here is at least solid. I liked most of the quests and NPCs, the dialogue and interactions are fun, the magic is satisfying to use (though that is partially by virtue of being overpowered) and the presentation, while not amazing, still works in creating distinct and cool looking environments.\n\nAll in all, while I still cant wholeheartedly recommend this game to people that are - understandably- still sour about Risen 2, its a step in the right direction and I want to see where PB takes the series.","April 2","true","73.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

While I do admit Risen series has been a lot worse than the original Gothic trilogy, they are still great games in their own sense. At first Risen 3 feels more like an expansion of Risen 2. Lots of assets have been recycled and even a few areas have been brought over from Risen 2. Luckily, however, that feeling vanishes pretty fast when you notice that the recycled areas aren't really that important and all the main areas are brand new, and then you notice how much better Risen 3 does everything. So it ends up feeling like Risen 2 but only less ♥♥♥♥. Risen 3 is a lot bigger than Risen 2, and more refined in almost every aspect. The combat is great, the exploration is awesome and the world is actually open this time around.\n\nIt isn't without its problems however. My biggest problem with the game is that it is WAY -WAY- ---WWWAAAAYY--- too easy! It's alright in the beginning if you play without a companion, but it becomes faceroll in the end. Even on hard. On my second playthrough as a voodoo pirate, I managed to max out all my stats. All 8 stats! Maxed! Why is this even possible?\n\nSo the balance is ♥♥♥♥ed. It doesn't ruin the game, but it takes away all the tension from the last quarter of the game. Possibly even earlier if you use companions, or something else than melee. In order to get a satisfying challenge out of the game, you pretty much have to shoot yourself in the foot, by not using alchemy or companions. Alchemy is probably the biggest criminal here. It is so ridiculously overpowered it's insane.\n\nEconomy balance however, is amazingly well made. There's never enough money if you really want to get the most out of skills. If you're fine with a few skills here and there, you might end up with some extra pocket change, but that wasn't the case for me. The moment I got 10k money, I used them right away, and there were so much more I wanted.\n\nGraphically there's a lot to say as well. The graphics are all over the place. The game looks dated and runs like ♥♥♥♥. I got it running on reasonable fps only after tweaking a lot of the ConfigDefault.xml file. The level design which PB has always been amazing at, is also bit of a let down. Some places are extremely gorgeous, but some places are hideous. There's also a few narrow canyon paths too many for my taste.\n\nThe story is.... Well... The story is. It just is. It exists, but isn't important on any level. I have never cared much about PB's storylines, but I've always loved the world, and the history of it. And here it's interesting enough to keep exploring. But the storyline itself is completely irrelevant and forgettable. Combine that with a pointless ending and that's it. But it isn't the meat of the game anyway so who cares?\n\nSome of you guys played the DLCs of Risen 2? Remember how ♥♥♥♥ they were? Well, the DLC of Risen 3 was a massive positive surprise to me, because both Fog Island and Uprising of the Little Guys are awesome. I enjoyed both of them thoroughly. So those are recommended if you don't have them. Nothing to say about Adventure Garb. It's a pile of gear that I don't use because it's too good for the beginning of the game. As if the game wasn't easy enough.\n\nSo all in all, it's better than Risen 2, but the difficulty holds it down. I loved it. If you're a PB fan, chances are you'll love it too. If you're not a PB fan however, you probably won't like it. I hate to see people bashing the game when they've never liked PBs games. Why do you expect this one to change your mind? The "mistakes" people claim PB makes, are all things that have always been around, and if they were magically fixed, I doubt it would be the same thing anymore. Which would make the old fans disappointed. Even moreso than they already are.\n\nSo yeah. I love it.\n\nSinathor out.","September 8, 2014","true","87.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

The bigger problem is that prologue and chapter one take 80% of game time to complete, while the rest of the game offers very little new content. So the problem is the game got open world game’s curse: as I could go anywhere any time, I did, there were no enemies strong enough to stop me, and locations that opened after choosing the factions simply were not large enough, and no new quests were added. Taking “Gothic II” or “Risen” as reference models, the picture there was absolutely different, every new chapter urged you to re-explore the locations, find what happened to NPC, what new problems appeared, how maps changed.

You will have to understand PB games to appreciate this game. it is a niche game for players who like hard combat Action RPG's like Dark Souls.\n-For returning players from the Gothica/Risen universe, PB made a solid game in Risen 3. The engine is a more efficient less buggy redo of Risen 2, so the graphics and physics are techinaly the same but have now been recoded for less bugs, locked high frame rates, and less stress on your hardware. So if you're looking for a new top of the lin graphics engine on par with a PS4 game don't expect much. The Game was released on 360/ps3/WinPC, so it's made for last gens hardware.\n\n\nYou play a new hero, you are not the nameless figure from Risen 1 and 2, but instead you are one of the sons of Captain Steelbeard, your sister is Patty and you start off the game together.\n\n==FOR NEW PLAYERS==\nPirahna Bytes, aka PB, is known for making EXTREMELY STORY driven RPG's with DIFFICULT COMBAT mechanics. Not combat thats clunky, but combat that reflects starting off as a new character, as you gain skills in combat training you will notice the improvement and growth of your character. If you're new to this kind of game, then the start of the game (first 4 hours) will be a pain in the butt for you. But you will feel your character grow and get a real sense of accomplishment as you gain more skills and stats. It's one of the staples of PB games and it makes it a very niche genre not unlike Dark Souls is a niche genre. I highly suggest purchasing Risen 1 since it's dirt cheap and has no DLC to get a feel for PB games. if this is your first PB game and you don't like the game style you will feel ripped off, but I don't feel ripped off, I love it.\n==COMBAT==\nCombat will be more in line with Risen 1, then in Risen 2. More emphasis on dodging, and reading opponents ques, understanding when they combo attacks and when what they do when you dodge, moving in combat to avoid getting ganged up on, and choosing when to attack is key. Unlike Risen 2 you will not be able to move from Parry to Attack seamlessly, lending a step of difficulty more in line with traditional PB games. Which for PB fans is great, Risen 2 had hard reviews from PB veterans for making the game more cupcake and less hardcore. So Risen 3 is a step in the right direction.\n==CRAFTING==\nUnlike Risen 1 and 2, weapon crafting actually has a USE in this game. A new feature is that you take some of the misc items and combine them with weapons to make a better weapon (Thrusting sword + 2 silver plates+6 iron ore) gets you a Disked Epee, with better stats of couse, it is very money effecient. This is also in line with Guns, Muskets, and all melee weapons, even with the unqiue weapons that require difficult to find parts can be upgraded with lots of rare mats to make superior verions or to change it's damage type. Example the Crest Wave SLASHING sword 55-85 Damage +10 Slashing can be changed to the "Lightning" 55-85 Piercing +10 Piercing *and it has electric particle skin and can partialy pierces blocks*\nPotion crafting is back along with the rare + perm stat potions made from the perm stat ingredients, The raw ingredients give +2, the potions give +5\nMore emphasis on temp buff potions is used since there are more skills to allocate your Glory(XP) too. So expect to use buff potions often to surpass early Lockpicks, Persuade, and Pickpocket checks\n==GAME LENGTH==\n24.5 Hours into the game at the time of this review, i am still in chapter 2, I have 4 islands explored,  2 islands un explored, and just started my 5th island. Like a good book, PB games tend to have 3 acts, I have not chosen one of the 3 factions available yet, and don't expect too until I'm near the end of chapter 2. I have only encountered 2 of the main factions so far. The games factions are the Guardians/Mages from Risen 1, the Voodoo Pirates from Risen 2, and the new faction are the Demon Hunters. You will spend hours revisting islands to find more quests, NPC's, loot, buried treasures, and open hidden passages. These do not feel like tacked on back tracking to add game time thank goodness, but honest progression, both in character development and story. I expect to drop 40-55 hours on the campaign easily.\n==OVER ALL IMPRESSION SCORE==\nUsing 10/10 as a base line for Risen 1\nGothica 3 beng 9/10\nand 6/10 as a Baseline for Risen 2\nand 4/10 as Gothic 4: Arcania\nand 1/10 being Daikatana or Superman 64\nI give Risen 3 a 8.5/10\n\nGraphics 7/10\nThe graphics are last gen but RECENT last gen, so they are smooth FPS on Max graphics and are plenty pretty, PB games aren't known for shiny, they are known for superb story and gameplay.\nCombat 9/10\nNot as varied or complex as Risen 1, it is much better then Risen 2, you can still feel your character grow, and get that sense of accomplishment. PB vets/fans should play on HARD. Pb did a great job getting back to it's roots.\nStory 10/10\nWell written and capable of being a book, deep and lengthy but not stale, and a continuation from Risen 1 and 2. It's fantastic, a game with great plot, it is perfect for the Single Player western RPG fans who miss plot.\n\nIs this game worthy of the PB saga? Yes it is, it is a redeeming light for PB since the goofs of Gothica 4 and Risen 2. A great sign that they are getting back in touch with what made them our favorites. I would compare Risen 3 with Deus Ex 3 in terms of taking a step in the proper direction to it's roots.\n\nIs the game worth the 49.99 USD price tag? YES, most new games cost 59.99 USD, some Early Access games cost as much as 125 USD and are utter crap. 10 dollars cheaper the most AAA games and a positive growth in game style for PB fans makes this a steal!\nPB vets should buy Risen 3 if you are on the ropes.\nNEW PB PLAYERS should buy Risen 1 or Gothica 1,2 or 3 to see if this is the game style you;d enjoy. Feel free to read my review for Risen 1 to see what I mean.\n\n\n*DAY 1 OLD REVIEW*\nFinished my third island. taking I'm taking a break to write a short early impression. I like the game so far, the combat early on was dissapointing but it picked up soon. i restarted a new game and made the entire first level without getting hit once\nIt's closer to risen 1 in combat then risen 2. Main difference, you can't go from Parry to attack, and you use dodging a lot\nOnly found one bug and it's in quest text, there in Antigua, you'll have to find a bag of clothes and it says it's on the FIRST floor, it's actually on the 2nd floor, use a parrot flight to get there\nI am dissapointed that damage types aren't damage styles, now all weapons swing like slashing weapons, makes the fencer in me sad\ni play on hard difficulty, the game is still fairly easy, about on par with risen 2. the soft 50 fps lock is nice. It's superior to risen 2 in story, size and gameplay, i need to play more to compare it to risen 1. if i had to review score it based on the first 4 hours. 8/10 but I'm not into the meat of the story line yet\nPatty broke my heart, they got rid of her curly long black hair, and I'm her god damn brother\nI wanted to continue as the nameless hero and finaly get her in the damn sack!\nIt's a solid game, and worth the 49.99 USD, which need i remind people is not the usual 59.99 of most games. If you played both Risens and liked risen 1 better, you'll like this game. not as much as 1 but more then 2. I think it was worth the purchase\n\nOn to Fog Island next to get the 10% Glory special item","August 12, 2014","true","72.8"," 38 of 70 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","38","70","0","0"

I was a little dissapointed that they cut out my beloved "kick" abillity...\n\nAlthough the story is not that surprising and great it's good enough and is better delivered than in previous games.

Now that I finally got to try it myself, I can say that most of the people's complaints about this title are overstretched by what may be a long lasting hate for the Risen series started from Risen 2, just because it "wasn't like Gothic". This game is a product of high level, featuring an interesting storyline with moral choices that affect your gameplay (even though some decisions that should alter your soul just don't), can be played in many different ways (swordsman, mage, ranged to make some examples) and lets you choose between three factions that provide you with spells that give you more options in a fight (even if the more skilled may stick with meelee, because of the riposte). The animations for sprinting and jumping look strangely similar to the ones of Assassin's Creed Black Flag (I could be wrong), but I don't care because they look and feel more realistic than the ones of the previous chapters. My sole complaint is about the Demon Hunters: I know, I know it's lore... but does he really have to shave his head?!","August 18, 2014","true","75.5"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

Yep, just put your XP into your stats.\n- Combat? Yep, just 3 buttons - evade, attack and block. You can do riposte by blocking at right time and you can do heavy strikes by holding attack, but that about it. Oh, yeah, there are spells that make combat a bit more enjoyable, but you get them only after ~10h into the game.\n- Crafting? Yep, just gather mats and click "craft" to get the item, no random stats or minigames.\n- Lockpicking? Yep, no fail state though. Just a lot of annoyance with complex locks >_>\n- Naval battles? Yep, but so arcadey that you can actually tell the ship to go forward...\n- Other mini-games? Yep, drink game, knife throwing game, arm wrestling game, etc. All come down to either using one button, or just QTE stuff.\nAll of those are VERY basic, but not bad. They can vary gameplay a bit from time to time, but get boring pretty quick.\nIf you are looking for fat loots - you won't find them in this game. Items are pretty limited, but getting a new one almost always feels like a large upgrade. No random stats either. (think Witcher 2 style of itemisation)\n\nIf you still want to be a pirate and good storyline and quests is what you are searching for - then Risen 3 will deliver in full.\nAll dialogues are nicely voices, there's tons of quests to do and places to explore. Quests often has several ways to complete them and some of them are pretty amusing. Once again - all of that is pretty cheesy.\nSo if you don't like cheese or searching for fat loots - this is not the game.\nIf you want RPG, dialogues and exploration - this is the game, and quite good one.\n\nMore in depth look on the UI, mechanics and other things in the lengthy video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFycWGBcVbI","August 20, 2014","true","18.1"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

Without Making this review overly complicated, I enjoyed the gameplay elements so much, but I do have some nitpicks on it. Positive first, the world to me was very expansive and for the most part you could go multiple ways to reach your destination. Also the skill based system for bonus objectives is spot on what I want in a game. The fluidness of combat and movement has improved so much from what it was in Risen 2.\n\nNow for the negative: main characters voice acting I feel was not normal and felt just plain wrong to me. Cutscenes and ending felt thrown in and out of place. The implementation of hunting for additional ingredients, while something I like, doesn't seem fit in without a reliable respawn system for monsters. The implementation of how much glory it takes to raise a skill should be balanced so that it doesn't take into account permanent potion bonuses.\n\n7/10\n\n*very minor min/max character spoiler below*\n\nOnly reason I mention the last item under negative is because I like to min/max my characters, but you have to raise your skills in a way where you drink the permanent potions at the end so you spend as little glory as possible leveling skills.","November 2, 2014","true","41.7"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

As far as I'm aware, there won't be another one. However, that doesn't matter since this final game finishes the series close to perfectly. From the first moment of playing Risen to this last moment of Risen 3, the series has made me replay the games several times, that's how good they are.\n\nThere are a few noticeable differences between Risen 3 and Risen/Risen 2, apart from improved graphics of coure. In Risen 3, the combat is slightly different, as many people before me has noticed aswell. While the combat in itself is very cool and not very hard, your character is pretty weak and your NPC companion has to help you quite a bit. At least in the beginning.\n\nIn Risen 3, you don't play as the character from the previous games. You play as Patty's brother, who I hadn't heard about before playing Risen 3. But that doesn't matter too much since you get to know him during the game and there's a little surprise somewhere in the game if you've played the other games...\n\nI highly recommend playing this game if you've played the former Risen games first, if you haven't. you risk losing out on a lot of the precious story. The combat gets better and better the more you play and it's the kind of game you just want to keep playing, even after finishing it. Even more so since there are different factions that you can join, changing the gameplay for every playthrough (to a certain point).","September 7, 2015","true","29.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Gothic 1, Gothic 2, Gothic 3 and Risen 1 are all absolutely amazing games and I recommend wholeheartedly every one of them. I can even recommend Risen 2 even though it's nowhere near as good as the previous games. But Risen 3 is just too a blatant attempt to extract some more money from the Risen 2 engine and assets without too much effort.\n\nThis game still retains some of PB's trademark systems and there IS some enjoyment to be found if you look hard enough. On the other hand it just exudes an uninterested, glassy, dreary atmosphere. The story is a complete joke, the writing lacks the spark and wit of Risen 2, NPCs are vapid and long winded, quests are boring, character models and entire areas are cynically rehashed and reused and the combat, the greatest strength of PB games, isn't very satisfying either. There's way too much of it and it stops being challenging or interesting very quickly, especially if you go for the mage build. You're just blasting hordes of trash mobs again and again into oblivion. Sometimes it feels like a 3rd person Diablo which is the complete opposite of what PB games traditionaly strived for.\n\nMany fans claimed Risen 2 marked the end of true Pyranha Bytes but Risen 2, even though a significant decline, is still worth playing. Risen 3 is not. It's cynical, disinterested, boring and routine rehash of Risen 2, nothing more.","June 25, 2015","false","38.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

The Risen franchise is no exception.The more you explore the more loot you get, the more loot you get, the more money you get, the more money you get, the more skills/items/equipment you get. To me, this is the attraction of the Risen franchise. Exploration=reward, pure and simple. This is a very important element in any pure single player RPG. This particular element is handled well in the  Risen series of games.\n\nHowever the Risen franchise is still struggling to find a solid identity. The first Risen was very ambiguous, the second chapter, the developers, despite giving the franchise a more polished pirate themed aspect,  were still experimenting with the combat system. This 3rd chapter is wonderful to the hardcore RPG'er, the pirate element still remains but the combat remains slightly clunky and experimental if you will.\n\nHowever, the exploration vs. reward idea remains solid in all 3 games. Risen 3 is a more finely polished example of where the franchise could go.\n\nExploration and completionism is the key in the Risen franchise.\n\nHowever to be perfect the Risen franchise could do well with a lot more polishing.  Some examples being, keep working on the combat system, the combat system in Risen, being the core of the game still feels slighty clunky. I figured out the obvious pattern in the combat system early on. And there is a definite pattern still. This pattern in the obvious timed moves still hinders the combat system from feeling fluid and natural. If you attack at the wrong time, you get hit, if you attack at the right time you strike. There is no fluid inbetween. The combat feels "timed" more so than natural.\n\nAnother aspect the developers could benefit from working on.  Make the skill earning system more complex. The skill system in this game is OKAY but not perfect. It still feels slightly limited. You spend cash on new skills, and you add power points to existing skills to "level them up". However there is no complex skill tree per se. You don't get to master a whole entire set of skills in any one combat style. This all lends to a slightly limited combat system. You can get BETTER at guns...but all you'll notice if you do so is that you do more damage with ranged weapons. To be blunt, the leveling/skill system needs a serious overhaul to feel more rewarding.\n\nAlso very importan to the hardcore RPG'er is, reward all the hard work put into the game with a beautiful well thought out ending. I notice the Risen titles in this franchise have lackluster endings. I realize the games themselves tell a story. But a moving, rewarding ending for a role playing game like this, where hard work and exploration should lend to the game's ending  is needed to complete the immersion process.\n\nI hope they continue this franchise, and fine tune the understandable flaws until they release a game that surpasses all other RPGS.\n\nIn short, this RPG does exemplary on the exploration verses reward aspect. The more you explore, the more you benefit. However this franchise still continues to fall short on the combat system, skill system and endings for the games. This game will tickle the fancy of any die-hard fan of single player RPGs, but there is still a ways to go if the developers want to perfect this franchise.","November 20, 2014","true","72.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

The character levelling/RPG elements are unique and as entertaining as always.  The writing and voice acting are extremely rough.  If you're a fan of exploration, there are hundreds of secret nooks and crannies if you're willing to spend the time to look around.  Unlike the previous games, the melee combat in this one is actually enjoyable.\nThe game does one particularly interesting thing - it opens up pretty much the entire world to you immediately, and the enemies do not scale with your level.  This has advantages and disadvantages.  The beginning of the game is quite hard, but as your character develops, you really feel yourself becoming powerful.  It's very satisfying.  However, by the end of the game, you feel like an unstoppable god and just plow through the same enemies that you've been fighting for the last 30 hours.","November 13, 2015","true","27.5"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

I have put 12+ hours in so far don't be mislead by the "latest activity". You know I really would like to give this game a high rating. The graphix are dated even though I have it maxed "PB it's 2014  C'mon!!". The voice acting is not imo real bad compared to others i've seen "Cough dragons dogma"! and bones he is my favorite npc. Fighting? well... a one button system is not too fun reminds me of Fable 3 but better. Fable 3 "Thumbs down", but Risen 3 seems to make it work "thanks for the magic back btw PB!!". Like others have said it is a timing and skill combat type. You died so your weak and have to slowly earn your way up. Still I know PB could have taken this to the next level if they would have spent the extra time. Seems like a copy paste of the older Risen games. The rest of the sound and music to me seem to be in sync. Again joining one faction at a time wasn't cool but I feel they did it more for a replay effect more than anything "even though the story gives it some weight". It is a solid game for what they did, and the combat is a bi@!h at first but rewarding as you start to feel the flow. Loot Loot Loot is awesome. Gold is a little rare but I hoard my booty so that could just be me. I give Risen 3 Titan Lords a solid 7/10. It is worth the ride but not worth the relese price of 49.99.  If you liked the old Risen games a must buy, shoot even if your a hardcore RPG fan it's worth the ride. Pick it up on a sale I feel in the end you will like it.

I was looking forward to a more challenging Gothic-esque follow up. The game is way too easy for a "Gothic" game. No real challenge, all you need is your trusty fireball spam and you are good to go.\n\nOverall the story is not that great and engaging as the one Gothic 1 or 2 was. Characters are plain and have not much depth to them. In Gothic even a simple guard was more interesting than a named NPC is in Risen 3. Simply put, there is not enough character development going on in Risen 3. (For example Milten the mage from the old camp becomes a close friend later on in the story of Gothic, turns out to be one of the closest helpers of the Nameless hero and in the end helps restore the blade Uriziel. Something like this was missing from Risen 3.)\n\nThe game is fun overall after the first playthrough, but after that, it becomes bland and not that interesting at all. Maybe it is, because it is so simple or it's just me who expected it to be even more challenging than the original Gothic 1 and 2.\n\nOverall, if you are a new generaion player and want to try a "Gothic" game, Risen 2 and 3 are the games for you. If you are up to the challenge, try Gothic 1 and 2 too. (Even though if you ask for my opinion, neither is Gothic 1 and 2 that hard for new generation players to play it, but whatever...)\n\nPiranha Bytes should have focused more on PC players who expect difficult RPGs from them and put less console like tutorials and mechanics in Risen 3. I almost felt like they were holding both of my hands while I was playing. Consoles really ruined this game the most as I see it.\n\nThe DLCs are a sorry excuse of aditional content. They are by far not that satisfying as one would expect. The 2 islands added have only a few quests and even though you meet some old faces from Risen 1 and 2, they didn't hold my interest for long. 1 hour of gameplay per Island is not worth 10€.\n\nEven after all this, I still recommend this game, but you should buy it once there will be a discount, as it is by far not worth 50€. Maybe if they upped the difficulty a bit and added more depth to characters, Risen 3 could have been the game we all waited for so long. (And of course less hand holding and console nonsense.)","November 25, 2014","true","52.8"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

Also every character has it's own personality and position in this game, there are only very few unnamed characters with no kind of background in this world. But this does not only to npcs, but to all items and locations aswell, truly handcrafted!\n+ I love the way magic got implemented in this game! No exhausting mana-potion collection or brewing which I always disliked, but just a cooldown-based system. Some critisize that, I love it and think a lot of games should go that direction!\n+ I do not find the story boring and do not agree with (most) reviewers.\n+ I love flying or gliding around like a parrot.\n- Sometimes there's not enough feedback whether a quest is completed, failed or still pending in status, e.g. before being promoted to a guardian you have to talk to your pirate admiral. He then tells you to kill the undead dogs, swirling around the city. Although this is not hard to accomplish, one may still miss out on some dogs and ask him-/herself, why one can't get promoted. Another example would be the "di fuego" related quests.\n- Sometimes npcs can't follow you and get stuck, however if you wait long enough they will eventually be back at your position (Teleporting and/or going back to your ship or another island helps in this case).\n\n\nGraphics:\n+ I don't know where to start. All people critizing the graphic of risen 3 can't have played it.\n+ I have rarely seen such beautiful sunsets and sunrises as in this game. Just as an example if one stands a bit away from the council hall or tower in antigua and in front of it, and if it's dawn and you look up in the sky, you see the air glimming inside the council hall, with a warm fire enlightening the whole building and if you look up, you have this dark, star filled sky, which at the very edge slowly fades into a warm pink/purpleish kind of color. There were countless moments like that and I can truly say that I have met no game, where the graphic is that atmospheric, some of the steam-screenshots catch very well how beautiful the game looks!\n- I mean, yes, sometimes!!! there are very low resolution textures, but most of the time they don't catch the eye.\n\nSound:\n0 Well, there has been written a lot about this part of the game so I will skip the extensive part and sum up that although I also find that the sound is very atmospheric, there are some downsides.\n+ The german synchronization however is very well!\n\nTo sum it up: If you liked the Gothic series and Risen 1, buy it. The basis for this game may be a pirate setting and of course it plays in the Risen universe, but it catches the Gothic flair from old times quite well and has some (good) adjustments to it.\nAlso I have not played Risen 2 so I can't say which textures got reused etc.\nOne last comment I want to make is, that most of the negative reviews seem to be from people that have played the game only a few hours and could not immerse themselfs in it, whether it is because their personal taste of a game is different or because they were not patient enough. I also think that this is reflected pretty well in the metacritics score which has a lot of negative reviews, but just as much positive reviews and nothing in between, so this game really splits based on your personal taste.","August 16, 2014","true","29.1"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","24","45","0","0"

I put approx 32 hours into this game, and I didnt feel forced to finish it. The voiceacting of the NPC characters was quite good IMO, although the main character was a dullard with poor voiceacting. The combat system, as I mentioned, is very clunky, and using melee weapons will be a bore due to the simplicity and frustration of the slow movements.\nThat being said, this game is of no improvement over RISEN 2, and if you enjoyed Risen 2, then I would recommend this game, as it is nearly identical, without anything new.\nWould recommend if:\n#1.

I can imagine that design meeting:\n\n"Ok, we need a girl in the game. What do we know about girls? Uh... they have boobs. Good, perfect. Make them huge, because pirates would value the extra buoyancy. Now we have a boob pirate... oh! But let's be different, and instead of eye candy she's your SISTER! Right... so, what do brothers and sisters talk about? Being brother and sister, of course! Make sure that she reminds you with every sentence. That way the player is convinced that she's both a boob pirate AND your sister. It's called immersion. Look it up."\n\nI don't think the game was actually written by a real writer.\n\nI've played it for 12 hours. I will probably beat it, and I actually enjoy the game a little despite itself.\n\nThe overall issue that will prevent me from ever truly recommending the game is how poorly-devised the world is. The writing is stupid -- and I use the word "stupid" because it really is the most accurate. It's simply dumb. I actually find myself sympathizing with the writing at times, because the problems remind me so much of the "books" I wrote as a young teen (I'm almost 30). Characters say things ALL THE TIME that create a hundred different questions.\n\n"If he uses magic he'll die like all the others."\n\nWhat others? Who died? Who used magic and had it go poorly? Why does everyone treat magic like it's a part of life, a boon, or a blessing, and then this character acts like it's certain doom OUT OF NOWHERE. Why does no one else reflect this? Why haven't I been presented with lore? Why didn't you use this opportunity to GIVE me lore.\n\n"If you don't do this you'll die."\n\nHow do you know that? Where could this knowledge have possibly come from? Why does the main character not find any of this strange?\n\nThose are just two small examples in what feels like an absolute barrage of inconsistencies. I don't feel like a world has been created here. It feels like a few game designers sat around and threw around cliches at each other until they had a script.\n\nThe main character suffers three-fold: for some reason they wanted him to look like an unlikable version of Christian Bale. His voice actor (or the director) can't seem to nail the mood of a single line. You're constantly being reminded through his gruff cursing that this is a recording of an actor in a booth somewhere, and not a real person. And third, his writing is terrible -- both in WHAT he says, and in his robustness as a character.\n\nSome of the voice actors truly are great. There are good performances that stand out, despite the rest of the game. That point needs to be made. But even these GOOD performances have issues. I feel like no one directing the game's talent had any true vision for what the game was supposed to be or how lines were supposed to be delivered. It feels like a discovery-writer's first draft. OR, the opposite problem, they could have had TOO many creative hands in the development. This is an issue of leadership and vision.\n\nPerhaps the absolute worst thing about the game is that when it makes me laugh (and it does, it can be quite funny), I'm not completely certain the game MEANT to make me laugh. I'm fairly certain the "funny parts" are supposed to be when people curse. I just don't believe the creators were capable of intentionally making me belly-laugh. I don't know if I'm laughing with or at this game.\n\nI go back to my earlier comment: this game is stupid, and I hate using that word to describe things. The game labors tirelessly to convince you that not a single talented designer has ever touched Risen 3. I enjoy it a little, and am rather determined to finish it. But every single person who had a creative hand in this game's writing, design and acting needs to take a long, hard look at other themselves or other professions. I would be embarrassed to ask people for money for this game, and I feel foolish having given them the benefit of the doubt.","August 17, 2014","false","12.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Loved the pirate setting.  Much like Skyrim your character in the beginning plays as though they were crippled but by end game I had improved my skills and was a nimble wrecking machine.  The Thieves Den Island I could have done without.  It was a filler throw in and the game ending battle was annoying not challenging.  Froze up about 5 times in my play through forcing me to close and restart but other than that it ran pretty smooth.\n\nTwo weird drawbacks were the fact that you couldn't add map markers which were absolutely necessary.  No map markers in a buried treasure pirate game?  It came across like a bad joke.  Second was the inability to save a game with your own heading.  It would have been nice to have saved my game just prior to choosing a faction so I could go back and replay as the other two classes but it literally doesn't let you name your save which I've never seen before so it eventually just got over-written which will prevent me from ever going back to this game.  A real shame quite frankly.\n\nGreat price(publisher sale), good graphics, fun skill progression and interesting characters.

Why Piranha Bytes, why must you hurt me like this?\nIt's like you've taken the good parts of their older games and thrown them all out, while at best not doing anything about the bad parts, and at worst magnifying them, or even shoehorning new ones from other games in.\n\nThe NPC Hubs, unlike the ones from about every Gothic game they made, seem empty and dead. The liveliest one is the Guardians big hold, but it's a single one, compared to the countless other ones that simply seem...barren. The inter NPC banter which made the towns in Gothic and Risen seem especially lively is almost completely missing, as is the ambiance that came with it. Most of the NPCs become completely meaningless, after you've done a sweep through their area and finished whatever quest they were involved in. Unlike the previous games, there are almost no quests that become available at a later point, making the gameworld seem even more devoid of life. Because apparently nothing happens while you're away.\n\nChoosing a faction also has almost no impact. There is only a handfull of faction-dependant perks, most of which carry little weight. Apart from that, faction dictates which set of spells becomes permanently available to you, but during one playthrough I found a sufficient amount of scrolls to make that meaningless as well. After that, the only thing left are AFAIK about 2 quests per faction that wouldn't be available without joining. There are almost no other reactions or consequences to your choice in faction. Though that might be rooted in the choice to have no conflict between the factions, which I think is a rather boring design choice.\n\nAlong with the factions comes the comparable tiny variety of equipment. There is a miniscule selection of 3 sets of armor per faction and they don't have that much impact on gameplay, as the values of armor seem laughable (150 points of damage mitigation, of which about 115 are from character attributes and perks at the end of my playthrough).  Though there are a bit more weapons available, a good part of those are already useless at the point one can optain them.\n\nAll special abilities and perks no longer cost any learning points. All that is left is an amount of gold one has to pay for them, which undoubtably enables players to get anything they want without any need for choice. And with the Potion Brewing Perk, which costs 2000 gold pieces, the upper half of the attribute scale becomes meaningless as well. Why invest experience points into enhancing an attribute past a value of 50, if one can instead do it with not that hard to get potions?\n\nThe Sea-Battle minigame they implemented seems like a sloppy attempt of copying Assassins Creed's sea battles, but with only 3 instances happening, none of which are avoidable, I couldn't familiarize with it's mechanics enough to be particularily good. It thus simply became a chore, each one taking about 20 minutes of gametime, while not being any kind of fun or adding anything to the story. The other three minigames were less of a chore, but also weren't required at any point, which is a good thing I guess. Why the hell they decided to implement the seabattles, and do so the way they did still is beyond me.\n\nThe other, more "puzzely" possiblities of the game were mostly ignored. The "trained monkey" sequences were few in number and rarely provided anything of value (only 2 times IIRC). Same goes with the "transform into Parrot" sequences. There was only a hand full of them, and most of them only provided mediocre loot. None of them were in any part needed for any quests, neither main nor side. In fact, there weren't even meaningful possiblities to use them during the mainquest.\n\nThe final battle was (again) only a "whack the damage sponge" with the occasional "follow the damage sponge" which felt kinda anti-climatic.\n\nWhile you get seven possible followers, it's of little meaning which one of them you take with you. They simply didn't add that much, appart from distracting monsters during combat and only occasional lines of banter. The game simply never made me (as a player) care that much about them. Of the three followers that I never took along, there is one whom I never found out anything but his name and his fondness of Alcohol, one I only found out that he had gotten ret-conned into a cruel, mercyless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and one that only seemed to be fond of stealing things. Nothing else. Nothing upon which I could build any feelings towards these characters but disinterest.\n\nSo I have to ask: What the hell went wrong at Piranha Bytes? Why did you build something so completely forgettable, so unbelievably mediocre, so underwhelmingly plain? You guys were the heroes of my youth. A small scale studio, making such incredibly awesome games. And now this... please Piranha Bytes, please stop slacking.\n\nEdit1: "PC Gamer: 83%"...guess thats where the money that would've improved chapters 3 and 4 went.","February 4, 2015","false","34.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Great story, let down by some dodgy voice acting and stilted dialogue. Some of the gnome voices are on the Jarjar Binks end of the annoying spectrum. Sometimes they verge on casual racism, sometimes they say funny things. It's like they are trying to do bad asian accents and sound ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the same time. There are some notable exceptions to that criticism. I thought the characterisation of "Stax" was done very well.\n\nSome criticize the combat system, and I can see why you'd love it or hate it as it requires a little patience. It's real-time-turn-based, if that's a thing; similar to the Gothic games. It's not a mindless hack-n-slash so you need to time blows, blocks and dodging. It's generally easy with one opponent but gets quickly impossible with 3 or more. You need a party to act as combat decoys more than you need them to assist you in fighting.\n\nThe lore is a bit of a grab-bag but I enjoyed the pirate/inquisitor/voodoo/druid/mage/aztec ruin/underworld thing they mashed together. I like sandbox sprawlers that let you jump up to seemingly inaccessible places and reward you with hidden loot. There's no character creation, but it also doesn't lock you in to classes so your character will end up evolving towards the skills you like using.\n\nVery playable RPG fun.\n\n...\nAfter 70+ hours of game play, I can say it's well worth it given the price on release was around half of what a premium game would be. There's some amusing quirks that are either poor translations or dev in-jokes, for example every single bird yields chicken drumsticks. I suppose everything tastes like chicken.\nWhat I said about classes, well you don't need to hold back, you can max out a lot of skills by the end so there's no compromises. There are 3 guilds to join, I played mage because lightening, but going back I'd probably have a go at demon hunter. Voodoo is powerful but to be honest that was my least favourite part of the game.\n\nPirate Patty's boobs are ridiculous. And she's supposed to be your sister, thanks Borat. I recall the character from a previous Risen, but I don't recall her being dressed like a pirate-stripper on halloween. I love boobs but really, it was a bit out of place. Witcher did that way better.\n\nThey swear a lot too.

Likewise weapons/equipment could have done with a lot more variation.\n\nIt's not perfect by any means, but if you enjoy an fun RPG where you wander round exploring it's pretty good.\n\n","October 8, 2015","true","34.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Although this game does have its flaws so far the voice acting is sub par but the dialoge is good (ive only meet a few main charcters though so far, but the main charcater is really the worst compared to all the other pb games, imo. But then again im a mel blanc fan, so im a kinda snob for good voice acting) the movement is very stiff of your character, and take some feeling out at first. Ive gotten used to the melee... and the magic from all the differnt factions looks crazy sick! (as in awesome, which pb has always been good at mage combat, again imo) ... and once you get used to attacking only when you need too, and same with dodgeing, it turns into a game of patience, kinda dark souls style but not necessarily as difficult, but still fun and rewarding (btw, i really like the dodgeing system, where you double tap the move keys in the direction you want to go compared to the camera angle rather than where your character facing.) ive been playing 3 and a half hours now and ive still only been to one island and im nowhere near explored all the lush forsest full of beast and minions, and the cliffs (conveniently staircase-like so you can climb it up and up and up, lol, I guess it gives me an old school nostalgia;) I really enjoy Risen 3 and after I got past the beginning, it started feeling like a world i wanted to explore. (reminds me most of gothic 1 & 2 quest-wise where you've got your three factions, and gameplay handleing/movement, its very much like its predecessors. To me the movement could be less clunky, (which makes it hard for me to play it with a controller) I cant wait to get my magic going though, itll be a whole new game after that! Two thumbs up from me (was a bit pricey but like i said ive been a fan since gothic 1.)

Game runs mostly solid 60fps on my system (660ti and a first gen i7), dips rarely went lower than to 50fps, max settings.\nCombat system really did see improvements, even though many reviewers fail to see them.\nThe new islands are much larger (at least 2 times the space and 3 times the quest density) than the two taken from Risen 2, ( the islands many criticized for being copy pasted, which is only really half-true, they have been noticably reworked and don't play as of a role in the story, I spent as much time on both of them as I did doing one half of one of the three main islands)\nThe UI has never worked this well; instant response times and logical structure make necessary UI navigation easy\n\nNegatives\n\nThe sea battles are half baked at best, luckily they didn't take up more than 5-10 minutes at a time for me. Shame one of them starts off the game, so you see shoddy scripted animations and QTE's as a first impression, when either are rather rare throughout the entire game\nWhile most of the UI is very snappy and responsive, the Inventory system is on a list basis, so scrolling is necessary. I prefered the Risen 1 system of a big open square based inventory, but I did get used to it easily.\nThe overarching story is, as usual, quite cheesy and uninspired. That said: Obligatory "hero looses his abilities" we come to expect from PB games twist is probably better executed than in most previous iterations. Nice set pieces, areas and generally diverse side quests though.\nEnglish voice acting is mediocre to 'meh', with many characters, german v/o is decent for a german v/o, many characters voices dont really fit their characters though. Many german voices are by voice actors that were in RIsen 1 and subsequently in the old Gothic games, so nostalgia bonus.\n\nThat's really the biggest point, nostalgia bonus. If you liked Risen and loved Gothic, like I did, I would recommend, for anyone else, you may wish to wait for a sale.","August 18, 2014","true","31.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Lots of missions to do with multiple ways to solve it. Again if your a Gothic or Risen fan you will be right at home but if this is the first time playing their games then it takes some getting used to, especially on the combat. The story is nice. Magic looks nice as well. You have 3 factions to choose from but once chosen you cannot join the others (same as Gothic series). I have chosen Guardians (mages) and enjoying it a lot. I recommend this game and for new comers just give it a chance and get used to the combat and you will enjoy it how you evolve and get stronger. It might feel crap in the beginning but thats just it, you must get stronger and stronger and your combat skills will improve and you will notice how your changing and getting stronger in the game, you will then see what you worked for.

It continues with the pirate-y themes from the second, which I wasn't crazy about, but it didn't take away from the game too much for me.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are solid enough, and the graphics are decent. The voice acting and dialogue is almost all hilariously terrible, and the story is pretty poor, but I still found myself enjoying playing it.\n\nHonestly, there are better games out there. There are better games trying to do this exact same thing that you could play instead. I tend to have a soft spot for wonky European RPG games though, so take this recommendation with that in mind.\n\nIn the end, should you play this? Maybe. Did you play and like the other ones, and did you want more of that? If yes, get this. You know what you're getting in to. Do you just want an open world RPG and haven't played one before? You can probably find better options. If you're looking for deep character customization or a great story, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.\n\nStill, not bad.

Wow. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port or lack of quality control here. Then when you do get in the game you quickly get several quests after the intro "dungeon". I went to 4 different locations and got owned, so it said to come back to these areas when you level up. Fine. Give me the quest I can do at a low level without making me search 4 locations to find it. Then theres the combat. O the ugly combat. You can parry one maybe two hits from one enemy. If theres more than one enemy, hit and run tactics only get you so far, the rest is luck. Stock up on a lot of healing. The melee mechanics are, flawed, and just downright not fun at all. The environments look decent enough, and the story and open gameplay is what Risen is about so I will continue to play. EDIT: Attrocious! The melee combat is TERRIBLE...  There is a 3 hit combo and a power bash... Heaven help you if there are 3 or more enemies. You just have to double tap a direction and roll around over and over again...

This is a more regrettable purchase than WarZ. Boom! You get screwed by the developers here. They know it, you will know it. It is absolutely disgusting that they come out with something like this.\n\n*EDIT* I came back to the review and figured I should add that when you play this game, just don't expect anything spectacular. I concluded its made to be bad. I can understand that, but not for $50 can a game be that intentionally bad.\n\nOh, its pretty? So what?! It doesn't even preform well and is a mockery of a game that should come out in this day and age.\n\nI feel like I have been pretty ripped off by the quality of this game for the price of $50. I think I have been made fun of for purchasing this game due to the extreme lack of quality and substance. I cannot believe this is even on Steam's market right now to be absolutely honest. For $50 you expect a game to actually be polished and work well and play well. Risen 3 does nothing of the sort. This is the type of game I would have expected to come out in 2003, not 2014 and certainly not for that price tag. It was advertised as an improvement from Risen 2 in every way and offering a new experience in ways of storytelling and combat that will be relished. That is completely false. Actually the biggest load of crap I have fallen for.\n\nThe combat system is the same with no redeeming qualities. Here is how it goes: you strike twice, maybe 3 times, most of which the enemy blocks if they are a humanoid, then the enemy strikes where you hold down the RMB until you get to throw a strike of your own. You can try and dodge, but guess what? The enemy will probably come at you with his strike nearly teleporting to hit you. This is the entirety of the combat system. Nothing built on and certainly nothing improved. Nothing tactical or even trying with this system. It literally consists of just waiting and waiting and waiting. COMBAT SHOULDN'T BE BORING, THIS MANAGES TO BE SO. They should be ashamed for trying to get this game out on the market. The creation of this combat system actually makes me feel sick. Thinking you can slap something that bad together and be happy with it is ridiculous and is part of why this game was just a cash grab.\n\nThe voice acting actually feels like they were joking while making this in the studio. With the main character sounding like he just got out of bed the entire time and Bones (your kool companion) trying to sound interesting and mystical, you can tell nothing was seriously done with this trash. At first I thought it was funny, now its just getting on my nerves and feels like a repeated kick in my junk for falling for this horrid game.\n\nI will keep trying to play this game again but heavily discourage it to ANYONE else because it is in all sense of the word, a cheat to the gamer. I really do feel screwed by it in every way.","August 20, 2014","false","3.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You will get a good amount playtime for your money, and the game becomes alot of fun as soon you figured out the combat system. As the gothic series and the previous risen games, one of the biggest appeals of the game is the exploration. You will always find some hidden treasure and secrets, if you just look for them\n\n\nThis game gets a bad rap for being not as streamlined and polished as some other AAA rpg's, quite undeserved if you ask me. And i'm not a blinded fanboy of the franchise who desperately wants to defend it. I started playing this game after Witcher 3, and the transition was more than rough, since Witcher 3 was  doing everything right that matters in a good RPG.  Going over to risen was very difficult, since the clunky animations, odd combat system, and campy dialogue made it very appaling after Witcher 3. I even stopped playing entirely until i got back into it much later. But if you're willing to put some effort in the game you can get alot of entertainment out of it. Especially if you love exploring, this game will be for you. While the seperate Islands that you will visit throughout the game are not as huge as for example Skyrim, there are still tons of areas to discover that are completely optional, but will always reward you for exploring them.\n\nIn conclusion, i'd recommend this game to every rpg fan, although if you only want to play perfectly balanced and polished games, this one might not be for you as it comes with a series of issues coming from the sometimes faulty game design. If you played and like the previous Gothic and Risen games, you can't do anything wrong with this one.","April 10","true","30.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Featuring a decent magic and combat system, interesting variations on "classess" (factions within the game), interesting and attractive environments, a good looting and gear system and a good chunk of play time, its a game that can be easily enjoyed with a little patience and forgiveness.  The leveling system is complex and interesting, asking you to increase stats to be able to learn perks and improvements to your combat abilities, which can be bought from trainers scattered all over the world.\n\nWhat is wrong with the game are niggles and annoyances more than bugs or bad concepts, and even then are only highlighted because we, as consumers, have come to expect things that aren't provided here.  For example, the story told in the game is threadbare and confusing, never coherently explaining what's going on or why we should care.  This is only exacerbated by the  dubious voice acting, particularly by your own character who speaks in a constant gruff monotone.  There are allusions to the past games that can make it even more confusing, such as a cameo by the past two games protagonist that should be foreshadowing and cool but is instead just strange.\n\nThe dialogue options are not the range you would expect for an RPG, giving you little choice and little chance to actually roleplay, being limited to gruff piratey responses rather than varied.  The combat system takes some getting use to, and requires a combination of attack, dodge, parry and riposte, and enemies have a tendency to mob you even when there are other characters attacking them, resulting in a lot of constant dodging and pot shots until their ranks are thinned and you're back in control.  This can sometimes be exacerbated by clipping problems, or the mobile camera being blocked by scenery.\n\nOverall, Risen 3 is worth playing and enjoyable if your expectations aren't too high, and I would recommend playing it when the price drops to a level that is better value for money.","August 31, 2014","true","34.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Let it not bias you. Risen 3 is all you'd want from the Risens and the Gothics, too.\n\nGraphics\nThe game is gorgeous. Sunlight/Godrays crash through the canopies of the trees; distant mountains cast their shadow on distant land realistically; fire never looked as good; water makes you want to jump right in; distant ruins beckon you to explore them; higher tier armour -- the cloth properly dancing as you move, the steel reflecting the light -- makes you drool as you stare at your hero. The physics engine is also fluid and realistic, enemies falling back after having received their killing blow will tumble over objects or droop down from them.\n\nGameplay\nIt's still what you expect from any Risen or Gothic game: The HUD is simple, and that's perfectly fine. In fact, I wouldn't have it any other way. You can now also change into a parrot with scrolls that you'll find everywhere -- specifically in high places! -- the devs silently begging you to use them as turning into a parrot makes you glide however long you want. There's a little energybar nonetheless which will slowly empty whenever you want to fly upward. It's fun! And as for the combat...\n\nCombat\nIt has improved SO MUCH! If you time your attacks properly, you can swing with heavy attacks almost as fast as you would with normal attacks. This needs some practise, but once you get a feel for it, it becomes easy. For some too easy, though many players still think combat is hard. As you gain enough experience (or Glory) you'll be able to gain the Riposte skill, which, if you time it right, your parry will execute a sweet animation of your hero evading a strike and counter-attacking with a strike of his own. You can also still dodge, which is an ability that can be exploited since there's no stamina bar. I say exploited, because during a dodge you're practically invincible. A fantastic addition to the combat is the finishing move on humanoids. When you kill the last enemy in an encounter, you watch your character execute him. There are multiple finishers. Your hero pushes an enemy against a wall, rams his weapon's hilt into the face multiple times before running him through; your hero turns the enemy around and slits his throat, etc. etc. etc. My most favorite finisher is where the enemy runs toward the hero and the hero steps aside at the last moment, leaving his weapon stretched horizontally in the enemy's path... the enemy runs into the blade, stumbles past the hero and eventually drops on the ground a few strides further, quite dead. Imagine stuff like this with a perfect physics engine. Yes, if there's a ledge a few strides behind your hero in said finisher, the enemy will stumble and drop down the edge instead. Deader than dead. So awesome.\n\nExploration\nThere's so much to see and do and find in this game! Almost every NPC with a name (which is almost every NPC) has a quest or more quests. When you climb up a mountain and see these mysterious places in the far, far distance... well, that telltale feeling rushes through every RPG player -- the feeling that says: I NEED to go there and explore every nook and cranny! And I can guarantee: You WILL be rewarded for it.\n\nFinal verdict\nI love this game. I am not kidding. It's the best thing in the gaming world that has happened to me in YEARS. And that's coming from a guy who fell in LOVE with Gothic 1 & 2, Risen 1 and very much disliked Risen 2. I catch myself playing this game with a content smile on my face. It's crazy. This game is phenomenal!","August 23, 2014","true","51.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dajjer/recommended/249230/","Dajjer","Dajjer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dajjer/","717 products in account","It's a Pyranna Bytes open world RPG. It's got factions, day an night cycles and FLYING. (albeit as a Parrot). I went through my first run through as a Voodoo Pirate due to having the unlimited flying spell. This was one of my favorite features of the Might and Magic series and they included it in Risen 3. I hope PB keeps it for its upcoming games.\n\nThe game does have its issues however. The number one being an over relience on arcadey sequences with its boss monsters. While not as bad as the Risen 1, they are still annoying having them in my RPGs. Why did they feel their games would be improved with that addtion. The game also had some irratating video sequences. They use the same brutal combat sequence for killing baddies as they do challanging an ally. It makes no sense for an ally to get up after you slit his throat . . .\n\nIt make me ask the question, If your original template is the superior Gothic, what direction would you take to make the game better?\n\nThe game world is fairly large but needed a wider diversity of monsters. And it needed more regular human monsters/bad guys. (Remember the bandit caves in Gothic 2)  The bullet shield was wortlhess becasue there simply aren't many baddies with guns. The cities needed more people and way way way more women. And while the game was mostly set in a carribean setting, I would have preferred a couple different climates. ( I admit a preference to snow)\n\nThe UI is horrible. It needs more tabs. Some of the screen inforamation has to be scrolled when there is no need to such a thing. And some of the Voodoo Pirate magic is stored as a weapon and not as a spell. Those items should have been sold as wands not spells.\n\nPowergamers can easily have godly avatars by the mid game if they smartly allocate but since my avatars are usually well rounded (I allocate dumbly) I didn't achieve the near invulnerable status until the end game. Many powergames who achieved that early power, looked at the game as super easy. However that is "never" a problem with me because my main enjoyment of open world RPGS is exploration.  And this game does have it. And couple open world exploration with flying and this game many times had me in RPG nirvana.\n\nThe moronic video combat sequences, the horrible UI and the far too many arcade sequences knock this game down a few notches. But the nicely implemented open world, the over all great voice acting, superior music all coupled with flying take away many of the flaws. I would rate this game 7.8 to 8.5.","September 9, 2014","true","140.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Still a recommended deal if you can get it 75% off, but it's not worth full whack. It's a few steps improved over Risen 2, but sadly still suffers from jerky movement and scrolling control -- easy enough for the programmers to fix by upping the screen refresh, but they don't seem to take such suggestions on board, despite just about every review of earlier games going on about it.  As you progress through the learning curve, and get used to the awkward klunky combat control, you wait in constant expectation of the game getting better -- but it doesn't.  It's island hopping and running chores for NPCs who can't do simple tasks themselves.  "Rough round the edges", but for the discounted price, it's a steal.  Dialogue has clearly been recorded at different studio sittings rather than sequentially and often doesn't flow smoothly, or share environmental reverb effects, or even mesh sensibly.\n\nThere's some minor humour in this dry game when Mud joins the team, but only because he's an annoying pest and a hindrance.  All integrity leaves the game if and when you choose to become a "Voodoo Pirate", that's just silliness, but alas it may be necessary to progress the levels if you can't make headway joining the mages.  Some quests won't resolve -- bugs in the code -- so don't expect to rattle through this one on autopilot.\n\nThey've back-pedaled in gameplay processes to Risen 1, which it resembles a bit too much.  Worth investing in Risen 1 if you haven't got it, as it's the stand-out of the 3 games so far.","October 16, 2015","true","63.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have heard a lot of negative comments about the combat but I actually found it far better than the combat in Witcher 2, it can be tricky to get used to at first but not bad at all. I love the adult dialogue and the fact the main character just tells it like it is: when comfronted by a npc talkin loads of gibberish he simply replied with "What the ♥♥♥♥ are you talking about?". Three different factions to side with, all with different styles of weapons and magics, so it has some replayabilty as you can only side with one per playthrough.\n\nI've never played previous Risen games but I'm considering trying the others because this is such a good game.\n\n9 out of 10 for me.

It's more...classic to say but even so it's freaking great.\nWhen I first launched this game I was a little bit disappointed (and even to this day I am a bit) about the fact that they just changed the main hero like that, no back story on what happened, nothing. Patty got more plastified (meaning her rack got incredibly huge) and well, it just jumps forward without really looking back on what happened in the past game and well, consequences and so. It gets explained a bit later on but still.\nThe main character has a pretty annoying voice at first but later on you get used to it and begin to love it.\nNow, I'm not very good with reviews, I'm just pointing out some stuff that really touched me about the game and also some things that quite annoyed me so don't expect to see some kind of mlg 3valid5me IGN rating here.\n\nI'll just say this.

This game is an excellent addition to their catalogue.\n\nFirst, you'll love this game if you're like me and enjoy the following things:\n\n1.  A large amount of side quests, some of which have multiple possible solutions.\n\n2.  A fairly large world to explore, and many secrets hidden by camera perspective, geography, and whether or not you can turn into a parrot right now.\n\n3.  Being rewarded well for such exploring.\n\n4.  The ability to chose a faction that affects the gameplay.\n\n5.  A challenging fighting system (at least until you max out toughness and nothing can hurt you any more).\n\nAlthough I very much enjoyed my playthrough, here are some things that could be improved.\n\n1.  The moral choices seem to have only small impacts on the game.\n\n2.  The factions aren't developed enough, you max out your rank in no time with just a little concentrated effort.\n\n3.  There aren't as many puzzles as I remember in Risen 2.  Exploring ruins as a pirate necessitates more puzzles and traps.\n\n4.  The majority of the quests are the same regardless of whether or not you joined a faction.\n\nLastly, a piece of advice from an avid off the main path player, join a faction right away.  You get special abilities for doing so that if you wait until you've done everything else, you won't have long to enjoy.  Also, it can save you some back and forth from traveling.","January 1, 2015","true","61.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As expected from other Piranha titles, it's in the exploration the game really shines. The environments are sizeable and detailed, begging to be discovered. While clearly not a triple A. it's still a pretty game. Few studios do atmosphere so well like Piranha Bytes.\n\nThe combat is not terrible as in earlier titles, but it does get old and does not scale well. The last hours will drag on for the lack of challenge, new mechanics and interesting places to visit. It doesn't help that the last location to be visited is also the least appealing.\n\nStill, it's an enjoyable adventure and worth the purchase, especially if picked on a sale.","January 3, 2015","true","31.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Still a recommended deal if you can get it 75% off, but it's not worth full whack. It's a few steps improved over Risen 2, but sadly still suffers from jerky movement and scrolling control -- easy enough for the programmers to fix by upping the screen refresh, but they don't seem to take such suggestions on board, despite just about every review of earlier games going on about it.  As you progress through the learning curve, and get used to the awkward klunky combat control, you wait in constant expectation of the game getting better -- but it doesn't.  It's island hopping and running chores for NPCs who can't do simple tasks themselves.  "Rough round the edges", but for the discounted price, it's a steal.  Dialogue has clearly been recorded at different studio sittings rather than sequentially and often doesn't flow smoothly, or share environmental reverb effects, or even mesh sensibly.\n\nThere's some minor humour in this dry game when Mud joins the team, but only because he's an annoying pest and a hindrance.  All integrity leaves the game if and when you choose to become a "Voodoo Pirate", that's just silliness, but alas it may be necessary to progress the levels if you can't make headway joining the mages.  Some quests won't resolve -- bugs in the code -- so don't expect to rattle through this one on autopilot.\n\nThey've back-pedaled in gameplay processes to Risen 1, which it resembles a bit too much.  Worth investing in Risen 1 if you haven't got it, as it's the stand-out of the 3 games so far.","October 16, 2015","true","63.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's more...classic to say but even so it's freaking great.\nWhen I first launched this game I was a little bit disappointed (and even to this day I am a bit) about the fact that they just changed the main hero like that, no back story on what happened, nothing. Patty got more plastified (meaning her rack got incredibly huge) and well, it just jumps forward without really looking back on what happened in the past game and well, consequences and so. It gets explained a bit later on but still.\nThe main character has a pretty annoying voice at first but later on you get used to it and begin to love it.\nNow, I'm not very good with reviews, I'm just pointing out some stuff that really touched me about the game and also some things that quite annoyed me so don't expect to see some kind of mlg 3valid5me IGN rating here.\n\nI'll just say this.

Well, maybe it‘s not the worst. I heard about Raven‘s cry and it‘s re-release Vendetta which now is taken from steam too, but because of awful user feedback i did not even consider to support that scam of a game. This one on the other hand has plenty of good reviews and feedback. But how? Probably from the people who only played Piranha Bytes  games?\n\nSince the Gothic 3 Piranha Bytes are making horrible games. I remember Gothic 3, it was beautiful looking game at the time, but it had worst combat ever and messed up quest system, i just stopped playing that crap after a few hours.\nI did not play Risen and only tried Risen 2 for an hour or so and uninstalled it. Risen 3 titan lords is a very strong contender for the worst combat in an RPG game. It‘s like Piranha Bytes do this intentionally, just to irritate people.\n\nThe combat makes this game unplayable. It‘s absolutely broken. Your moves are so slow that you just can‘t hit anything, you slowly swing your sword and get interrupted by the enemies attack. If you try to block them and attack after blocking, the enemy just jumps away in a speed of lightning and you miss, then immediately you get attacked again. Blocking does not always work, i‘d say you can‘t block 1/3 of attacks. You/enemies getting stuck on a rock, or camera rotating randomly to the angle where you can‘t see anything is nothing compared to awful combat. The controls are unresponsive and clunky, your character is very slow. In addition to the sword you can shoot a gun which again is so slow that you get attacked by an enemy which moves and react too fast before you shoot the gun. And if you get lucky to use your gun without interruption it misses most of the time even if the enemy is 2 meters away.\n\nBut there are things which will make you laugh instead of being angry. The voice acting, it‘s hilarious, i don‘t know if it‘s intentional but it‘s so bad that it‘s making you laugh. Generic NPC‘s have better voice acting than main characters.\n\nDialogues are boring and uninteresting. Same as quests. It is generic as it can be. Also quest tracking doesn‘t work most of the time. The map is pointless, NPC's or shops aren't marked on it, but gladly you don‘t need to search for shops long in those cities with 3 traders and other 2 random people giving you generic quests.\n\nGame imitates the feeling of open world. Similar to Age of reckoning. But Risen 3 does it much worse. The locations are much much smaller. It‘s not an open world game!\n\nThe graphics probably is the best thing in this game. It‘s average but at least it‘s not ugly. Character models is another thing, they‘re ugly and generic, with poor animations and almost no face animations.\n\nAvoid this game. Avoid it even if on sale at 75%. I regret my decision buying it for that price. It‘s not worth your time, unless you feel obliged to play it because you paid for it, there‘s no reason to play it. Just stay away and stop supporting Piranha Bytes.\n\nPros:\n\nPatty\n\nCons:\n\nGraphics\nVoice acting\nGeneric quests\nPoor combat\nSmall generic maps\nClunky unresponsive controls","February 27","false","4.0"," 57 of 115 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","57","115","6","7"

Let me be me ore specific: For fans of Risen it may be a must have, but for all others that are looking for a good/excellent rpg game which provides you with tons of quests, variety, a good combat system, polished gameplay and game engine, Risen 3 should not be your choice. The graphics engine is really old, textures are not provided in a high resolution, and even the world design (even if it is really good) cannot hide the shortcomings of the really old engine. The designers tried their best but the engine does not provide enough features to create a fully living world and this is experienced in the very first moments you enter the jungle in Risen 3. This fact is reflected if you take a closer look at the scene. The models are, how shall I say, really really bad; no (face) gestures at all, animations are choppy.  Another very important aspect of an RPG is the combat system. This is the biggest shortcoming of Risen 3. First, it is completely unbalanced. In the early stages of the game each creatures might be your death, later on you feel like god and nothing can really kill (except you head for a coffee and it takes you 5 minutes until you come back ...). Second, the factions are more or less a nice to have but after you have learned the most "skills" the spells earned by the factions are just for fun and do not seriously influence the combat.\n\n\nDetailed Review:\n\nImpressions/Opinion:\nI have to admit, I am a very big fan of Gothic 1 & 2. One reason that I bought the game were the reviews that are provided by computer magazines. In fact it was the "open world" which disappointed me already in the beginning of the game. I felt somehow cheated because the game has not the freedom as a Gothic 1 or 2. It still fells like Risen 2. NO, there is no "open world" or freedom in the game, except the selection of the so-called factions. The game follows a strict chapter system and islands are quite linear. The world does not feel like its living. If you have cleared/killed all creatures on an island, you are done, there is nothing left to kill and there will nothing respawn (that’s it). Sure, there are a lot of side quests but there is no real difference between the main story and the side quests. I have played many RPGs but I seldom come across such a bad story telling. The "quests" are very generic like, "kill x", "bring me xyz". It feels like playing an really old RPG in 2014. If you have seen the 5 (including the first one where you start and are brought back to "life") main islands, which are not that big as it looks like in the beginning, there won't come any more (SPOILER: a sixth island at the end for the very last fight/quests). The combat system is useless at its best. In the early game it feels like every creature may be the last creature you will face and after the first 4 hours you get so strong that fights become just a necessity and does not feel like an epic fight. I won't talk about boss fights because they are not really any better but writing about them may spoiler one or two things. But, bosses are just like events, nice to watch. A real challenge is the gameplay and that you do not fall off some shores or edges if you are hunting for hidden places...\n\nTechnical discussion:\nThere is not much positive to say. As already mentioned in the conclusion the engine is old and the models are far from state-of-the-art, such as in Witcher 2 or BioShock Infinite. The models are definitely missing vertices, such as the terrain and everything in this game. The textures have a really low resolution and sometimes they look awkward and misplaced. Furthermore, the game crashes from time to time (if it even decides to run on your system).  The animations of the models are really choppy and are not that smooth as someone may expect for a game that was released mid 2014.\n\nLast words:\nI am just curious why this game got such good review from computer magazines. This game is just a refresh of Risen 2 with some really MINOR improvements. In fact, its more like a joke for 2014. PB you could have done way better and you know it!\n\nFans will buy it anyway, but all the others should think twice!","August 16, 2014","false","22.9"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehD3v1l/recommended/249230/","TehD3v1l","TheDevil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehD3v1l/","162 products in account","So ive beaten the game. My end cutscene went to play and the character starts walking to the camp on skull island. It looked like Bones was going to say something but before he could it cut to the ship sailing out of the island. So if i want that end sequence ive got to kill the end boss again which is ok i never got anything from the story in this game so I will wait for someone to upload it on youtube.\n\nSo complaints.\n\n1) Combat starts off very slow, this is the only game ive ever played where you absolutely rely on your companion to kill things when you first start.\n\n2) Combat requires no skill. You can cheese almost every fight effortlessly there is little to no reward to killing anything except for the 3rd Kraken which is the only truely frustrating part of the game.\n\n3) Glitches, Oh my god glitches i felt like I was playing an Alpha of Risen 3 mind you none of these glitches caused a blue screen, full system crash, or crash of game.\n\n4) Guidance at times is at an absolute bare minimum. I consider myself an Intelligent person and I found myself frustrated more then a few times even after listening to all dialog options. My most annoyed moment would be the Books of Evil quest from the Demon hunters for your first promotion.\n\n5) Dialog was often incredibly annoying and no I am not talking about the Gnomes their dialog was intended to be absolutely annoying. Thankfully right clicking cured this for me just dont do it during a quest giver.\n\n6) Cutscenes throughtout the game are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo excessive and not in a good way like Metal Gear Solid 4's 7 or 8 hours of cutscenes, Most cutscenes in this game are clearly rushed everything from key speakers faces blurring out to horrible choices of background music which most of the time sounded incredibly close to the fight music.\n\n7) Enemy Diversity is bleh. I also took note of the spiders working with the shadows on skull island. Was mostly confused by that considering the Oracle was using them to attack both humans and shadows from what that whole ♥♥♥♥ty story explained.\n\n8) Most points of the game I would complete quests like allying with the Inqusition and it had a moment to do a cutscene or give dialog options and it wouldnt. So when you kill Sebastion it just cutscenes to your boat pulling into its destination and your character saying well they will fight for us. There felt like a lot of information was just skipped over it felt like listening to an average 5th graders explination of their family vacation. There were holes all throughout leaving you wanting much more. I just wanted a "Hey thanks for saving us from that crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i thought he was going to kill me next.".\n\n9) Some skills pop up as weapons in your equipment page whereas some skills like Monkey Trainer pop up as an Item in your inventory so you have to dig and find them. I for instance forgot I had monkey trainer which actually would have been helpful much earlier on in the game but when you buy skills theres no hey idiot your skill is right here when its not going to be in the normal place.\n\nSo in closure I still will not recommend this game until it goes on sale. This game is like Aliens Collonial Marines half made garbage which is only good for killing time when absolutely bored. Regardless of my complaints I did find myself having fun with Demon Hunter skills stacked with blade dancer and how OP they make you if you are melee built. That build literally makes you 2 shot a Shadow Lord in about 1/8th of a second. The game was waaaaaay too easy. I barely died at all with all of them being in the same spot the 3rd Kraken.\n\nThis is one of the few games Ive played and gotton bored while playing...\nI had literally more fun in Aliens Colonial Marines then this and that was a flaming POS with a much better written story.\n\n5/10 its very "Meh"","August 16, 2014","false","30.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

If you wanted Gothic 5 (and we all want it), don't buy Risen 3 thinking that's it. It's not.\n\nRisen 3 is a different openworld from Gothic games. Here you can go just about anywhere since the start. In Gothics... Well... You can't or if you try, you'll die miserably. In Gothics you have to build your character before trying to survive the desert or mountains part. Sadly, because of Risen 2 reviews, mobs got too easy to kill in Risen 3.\n\nRisen 3, apart from nasty CPU cores problem, has almost no bug at all. Gothic 3 had more bugs than patched Skyrim which sounds like a lie but it's not (Skyrim final version still has more than 500 bugs unpatched, Gothic 3 when released had just a few more).\n\nIn Gothics no mobs respawn endlessly (except wild dogs in desert). In Risen 3, some mobs seem to respawn (wildbirds, bigrats).\n\n\n\nRisen 3 is the best exploration game out there. You don't know what's behind a corner and you want to know it.

You start off on a boat sailing to who knows where, from who knows where (possibly this information is known if you've played Risen 2, which I haven't, but I still had no idea what was going on in the beginning of the game), and seemingly out of no-where, you're attacked by pirate sea creatures STRAIGHT out of Pirates of the Caribbean. I don't have the slightest doubt in my mind that the artists had pictures from PotC up on google as they designed these guys.\n\nB. During this intro, the game briefly shows you how to move and look around, jump, attack, unsheath your weapon, shoot your gun, dodge, etc. The controls just feel off to me. If this makes sense, which I hope it does to some of you out there; there are just some games out there with controls so fine-tuned that you could do an obsticle course, jump from object to object, avoid things swinging at you, etc, with ease (think TF2, CS:GO, CoD, Skyrim). In this game there is no way in hell I would be able to jump from object to object or dodge ANYTHING, the controls feel that lousy and unsynced. A side note added onto that... when I hold down the sprint key... I want to sprint NOW, not after a delay of 1 second.\n\n2. The story. (FIRST HOUR SPOILER)\nFrom what I understood, you're a pirate on a jouney with your sister who, by coincidence, has huge jugs, The intro lets you play through getting attacked by a ship of sea creature pirates captained by a "Ghost pirate"... who, after losing all of his men onboard to your sword, summons Gyarados which ♥♥♥♥s your ♥♥♥♥ up and you're stranded on an Island straight out of the TV series "Lost". It then seems your objective is to find or chase down the pirate ghost... at least for the beginning part of the game. I didn't get that far.\n\n3. Voice acting.\nImagine the worst home made movie you've ever seen, then imagine paying those people each $1,000 to actually try to act. That's about what the voice acting is like.\n\n4. Looting, "Open world", other RPG elements.\nA. The looting system is very off from traditional RPGs. Yes, I get games can be different from others, etc, and that's cool, that's awesome, but not having a menu pop up when you go to loot a creature and instead having it auto loot everything and spam the side of your screen\n\nRECIEVED SPIRIT MUSHROOM x 1 !\nRECIEVED RAW MEAT x 1 !\nRECIEVED CLAM x 1 !\nRECIEVED GOLD x 1000!\nGLORY + 200\n\ncan get annoying. Strangely enough, however, if you go to loot a container, you ARE given a menu and the choice to loot whatever's in the container.\n\nB. Despite claiming to be open world, the game is still very linear. To put into perspective, Skyrim is the obvious king of open world games, you can literally go ANYWHERE. The Witcher 2, on the other hand, is pretty linear, and isn't necessarily open world. This game isn't remotely close to The Witcher 2, and is about as linear as a CoD campaign.\n\nC. Other RPG elements such as how the inventory is managed, quests, maps, etc... it all works, but it all feels cheap and rushed.\n\nIn conclusion, the Risen fanboys will hate me and my review, but crossing over from other RPG's like the Elder Scrolls series, the Diablo series, the Borderlands series, etc, I was not prepared for the incredibly, insultingly, low quality of the game.\n\nTL;DR: If you're coming from Skyrim, Borderlands, Diablo, Mass Effect, The Witcher... (all high quality and finely tuned RPGs), and looking for something new whilst staying in the RPG scene, stay away from Risen 3.","December 27, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you wanted Gothic 5 (and we all want it), don't buy Risen 3 thinking that's it. It's not.\n\nRisen 3 is a different openworld from Gothic games. Here you can go just about anywhere since the start. In Gothics... Well... You can't or if you try, you'll die miserably. In Gothics you have to build your character before trying to survive the desert or mountains part. Sadly, because of Risen 2 reviews, mobs got too easy to kill in Risen 3.\n\nRisen 3, apart from nasty CPU cores problem, has almost no bug at all. Gothic 3 had more bugs than patched Skyrim which sounds like a lie but it's not (Skyrim final version still has more than 500 bugs unpatched, Gothic 3 when released had just a few more).\n\nIn Gothics no mobs respawn endlessly (except wild dogs in desert). In Risen 3, some mobs seem to respawn (wildbirds, bigrats).\n\n\n\nRisen 3 is the best exploration game out there. You don't know what's behind a corner and you want to know it.

About what's insanely bad in this game - they spend months making all these fetch quests, all these ridiclously long and boring conversations about basic things but they coudnt do the same for actual lore or story. U can learn everything about a PC who wants a bloody flower for u, but when its comes to lore, to main quest Hero just nods to everything and doesnt question a thing. "Magic portal, yeah, that will work"  Not to mention the story HAVE NOTHING TO DO with titan lords or titan war. Also one of most most dissapointing endings (or lack of it) and antagonists i have seen in a game for a long time Seriously, this is such bad and immature design its not even funny. We have games like Witcher or Mass Effect trying their best to make us belive in stuff we see and on the other side we have PB (Piranha Bytes, risen dev) who looks like drooling kids playing with toy soldiers on the floor in comparison. Anyway, with a heavy heart, I recommend this game. Sure, by the end of the game youre so ridiclously OP u can't die and the game doesnt scale or throw any challenges at u at all.

Let's be honest paying $50 for a game you expect to get something in line with other games out there - Dark Souls, Skyrim, Bound by flame to name a few.  RISEN ENGINE DOES NOT PROVIDE THIS.\nEngine is aged by now, terrain looks choppy, maps are compact and all "sub environments" are right next to each other (nothing new to Risen fans) so this may annoy some people new to the series.\nIf you haven't played previous Risen games - please watch some gameplay videos before buying to see if this is something you would enjoy.\n\nFor Risen fans:  game is definitelly worth it !!!  It is the same oldschool type of gameplay but with improvements and much more polish over old installements.\n\nPROs:\n- Interesting Storyline\n- Cool quests\n- Good character progression\n- much more polished shootas (no reload on the pistol anymore)\n- Nice environments\n- CHEEEEEZY dialogues so common to Risen games\n\nCONS:\n- oldschool RPG meaning some people used to "modern" standards may feel cheated\n- AGED graphics engine on steroids\n- Patty looks ♥♥♥♥ ;-)","August 21, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Pirahna Bytes seem to have a knack with created well thought out land masses that you can remember and recall, long after leaving.\n\nI have played Gothic, Gothic II, Risen and Risen 2 to completion multiple times.\nThe Gothic series is one of those gems that just never gets old, no matter how long time goes by.\n\nBut, to Risen 3.\n10 hours in, Risen 3 is definitely the best of the Risen franchise. Combining multiple islands and quests seamlessly, without much interuption. Including the old Faction based quests and pursuits. Creating the well known atmosphere of past PB games.\nI was scepticle, once I saw the piratey beginning. Felt exactly like Risen 2, which I did like, but not as much as I wanted to. Then after a short introduction on an island, things change and open up incredibly. Like, choose anywhere, and go. And you can swim between many points on each island, yes!  Each island holds a different feel and attitude. With different characters and ideologies.\n\nCharacters have there own agendas and ideas, which I am enjoying. They have added many dialogue sequences dependant on the character that is following you, or location you have entered, or who you're talking to. I have replayed dialogues with diffferent characters, with some interesting dialogue responses, that can change the way the charater interacts with you. Makes them feel more believable.\n\nCombat has it's flaws, but is ultimately enjoyable. Some (me) may find it easier then traditional Gothic combat, but animations and cues are properly executed this time around. No more countering, and finding nothing happens, even though you were perfectly timing the counter. It just works. And crystal magic. GREAT. Really fun stuff.\n\nAlthough fetch quests are prominent, I enjoyed walking between points, as to me, the game looks great.\nI have read many reviews stating that this game looks like a PS2 game, or that it is downright horrible.\nI think it has a very unique style and artistic flow, that combines many new systems that enhance the overall aesthetic.\nAlso, the lighting, looks incredible. Some scenes are truly breathtaking. Yes, there is certain instances, where the game looks kind of funky, but to base the entire graphical experience on these minor flaws is downright stupid.\n\nAnyway, I feel this game is a step in the right direction for Pirahna Bytes.\n\nThough, I would love to see a brand new series, more akin to the Gothic series pop up.\n\nAnyway, great job team! Thank you! :D\n","August 20, 2014","true","35.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Which is good for me, but apparently does not fit well with some people.\n\nI started playing Piranha Games with Gothic 1 and played every game since, so I knew what to expect and am happy to report that the NPCs talk at length about trivial things and have to be forced to get to the point, you only get a fixed set of useful Armor that is restricted to your Group etc.\n\nA lot of people apparently don't like this, but for me that's a Piranha Game. If you liked the first two Gothics, this game is for you.\n\nWarning: From here on there might be Spoilers\n\nAs a long-time fan, here's what I think about Risen 3 compared to the Gothic series and the other two Risens:\nI loved it. It reminded my why I fell in love with Gothic and I am going to play it again to see the way the game goes if you choose to be something else then a Voodoo-Pirate.\nIn comparison to Risen 2 I think it's much better. Which is great, as I thought Risen 2 was way better then Risen 1, so this seems to be a trend.\nEven the usually sucking Piranha Final Boss Battle was bearable. As a reminder, in Risen 1 the final Boss Battle neglected all your "life choices" and stuck you into magic Armor and Weaponry that made you a great fighter, even if you had gone the Mage way and put you into some kind of Arcade-Battle against a Big-Boss. Ugh.\nRisen 2 had Mara, but I only remember from that fight that I didn't like it.\nThis time, it had sucking moments, sure. But I could play to my strengths I acquired during the game and at one point Bones jumped in to save the day, which I assume was a bug, but I liked it.\n\nCompared to the Gothic Series I dare say this is the game I was hoping for when Gothic 3 came out. It had all the charm, wits and anecdotes that made the first two Gothic Parts great and none of the empty world and hastily crafted Quests. Playing Risen 3 I couldn't but think of how great a game Gothic 3 could have been if it came out a year later. Even half a year.\n\nSo all good? Of cause not. There are a lot of things they can do better and I hope they will for Risen 4. But none of the following "bad stuff" really impacted my great experience, so read them as "minor issues".\n\nThe Bad stuff\n- I love the Kila, but hate the Post-Imperialistic, "noble savage", "half naked exotic beauty that speaks in Umpa-Lumpa" stile. You can do better than just throwing together all the cliche to mix up a "tribe".\n- Whatever happened to Patty? Why does she look like some Pirate-Porn Star? Honestly, this kind of "Fan Service" makes me feel treated like a 14 year old with a puberty issue. I see what you thought I would like and feel dirty.\n- Where's my Marvin Mode? One of the really cool things about Piranha Games was the "and now I will change everything to how I like it" Marvin Mode. Missed it greatly. Reduces replay-value. Basically, give me back my Marvin Mode.\n- If I have to hear Bones say "Aus deiner Haut mache ich mir eine Mütze!" one more time...\n- I would have liked a way to solve the Noise behind Paula's house without killing the armadillo.\n- Light. I know this does not happen to everyone, but every time I entered a cave darkness took me like a black flood that even torches could not dispense. Looting caves without telekinesis was basically impossible as I could not see anything smaller then a sword.\n- Story-restriction to Voodoo body-snatching. I get that this could be a story breaker, but there have to be better ways to restrict this then simply allowing it only if it fits the narrative.\n\nThe "meh" Stuff\n\nThese things I could go without\n* Astral View. Never used it. No idea why I would or should have.\n\nThe Great Stuff\n+ The World. I liked to just hang out with the Pirates on Kila or the Kila on Kila (Reaaallly smooth...) or...\n+ The Characters. There are no Diegos, but a lot of likeable NPCs and taking some of them along was great fun.\n+ The Story. It was easy to follow without being too predictable. Yeah, there was obviously some arch-nemesis going to be there for the surprisingly minor-sucking End Battle, but other then that I liked it. Quests were mostly fun too.\n+ Easy mode that means "easy fights" for people like me who take fighting as a "have to do that" in RPGs\n+ Mud. Yeah, really. Loved it. Even took him along after he left on his own free will. That's how it goes with old “friends”...\n++ Parrot-Flight. You'll know it when you get it. I've spend hours flying around.","November 25, 2015","true","70.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","2"

The pirate/island setting is authentic.\n+ The graphics are good enough for me.\n+ Many locations to explore and a lot of secrets to discover.\n+ The music was okay.\n+ Many customization options (melee, range or magic skills. accessoires, armor and weapons.)\n+ The combat is a bit more interesting than the combat in the second game.\n+ No bugs discovered\n+ You can choose one of three different factions. You can choose to be good or evil.\n+ I liked the references to the Gothic series.\n\nCon:\n- The main reason why i cannot recommend the game is because IT IS BORING! The actual main quest that should keep me playing took me about 3 hours. Doing all side quests and explore all the unimportant stuff took me about 48 hours (DLCs included). I have to say that I was not entertained by all this useless exploring and sidequesting.\n- It is better than the second risen game but it is still a bad sequel to the first game. I have no idea why in the world this game takes place in the southern sea while the actual action takes place on the mainland. The story has no real direction and is totally disappointing. I would expect something magnificent from the third part of a storyline. Until now I am not even sure who or what Titan Lords/Ladies are.\n- I finished the game 5 days ago and I cannot remember 99% of the characters. They are all faceless, boring and unimportant.\n- The boss battles are boring and some take a lot of patience because they hide often. (Minor spoiler now: The final boss battle is frustrating as hell if you do not own an AOE attack.)\n- The overall voice acting is terrible. The main character sounds like he has lung cancer.\n- The jokes are mediocre.\n- All choices you make have no real effect on the story or anything else.\n- The game is too easy (even on hard) and monotonous. I became a melee warrior and was just bashing the left mouse button and killed everthing.","February 11","false","52.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game at first glance seemed as a rip-off, appearing rather as an expansion pack to Risen 2, same world, inventory, skill-system, graphics, etc. The game however changed my mind once I really delved into some of the quests. They were great. I can't complain, they were fun, sometimes challenging, and for the most part unique. That's what really made the game for me. That and combat. At first I was upset about the weakness of the character in the beginning but as you learn and become more skillfull, not as a character but as a player, I becomes great. Upgrading weapons and skills really pays off, and in the end, you are unstoppable. Overall I recommend this game not because it was incredibly impressive or original, but because it was incredibly fun.\n\nPros:                                                          Cons:\n-Great combat                                           -Much of recycled Risen 2 material\n-Lots of fun quests                                    -Graphics haven't changed\n-Great selection of playing style                -Voice acting could be better","August 23, 2014","true","31.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I will say that I watched some reviews whining and complaining on how bad this is or how "average" this is but I recommend you get the game on sale if you're uneasy about it. I received it as a gift and I personally think it's been unjustly panned by reviewers. The combat has a learning curve but when you get used to the timing, it can be pretty fun. The story is kinda crazy, most of the characters are nicely voiced with unique attitudes (The shaman is really weird though), but there are moments when you will see a characters face that resembles a previous character you have encountered. Some voices seem off in how the dialog is delivered and the shaman, though funny at times, can get repetitive with his one liners during combat. There is a ton of content in this game and surpirsingly the graphics look quite nice though not mindblowing as this is also on PS3. Thankfully the PC version looks and performs much better (Duh). For those who want fluid smooth animations though, you may not like the attack animations, though it's not as bad as demonicons slo-mo loaded combat. Some may also be put off by the need for gold to learn skills, but you can find places in this game where they basically throw gold at you, if you take on a lot of side quests. The story has a sort of pirate theme but it's overall a means to an end. If you want a blockbuster story, you won't find it here. You may find great gameplay and hours of quests to kill time, but not much hand holding. The map is a very appreciated addition over Risen 2, I found it frustrating that Risen 2 lacked a map, making pathfinding really tedious.\nYou also have 3 factions to choose from, each with unique abilities and gameplay. Overall, there are a lot of reasons to give Risen 3 a try, save for the so-so story.\nGameplay:\n8\n\nGraphics:\n8\n\nStory:\n7.5\n\nSound/Voice:\n7\nReplayability:\n8\n\nOverall:\n8\n","August 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is not a game for everybody as they don't try to please all players and that makes their games valuable.\n\nI was struggling through the first part of the game because since Risen 2 they changed for some strange reason basic movement and melee combat to worse - it feels heavy, always some milisecond later then camera, and in combat the character does some random combos that cannot be stopped (in Risen 1 you had complete control over combos and you had to learn every step in 1-9 ranks) so it could be frustrating even on easy mode...\nBut as someone promised in his review, the game starts to be interesting after joining one of the faction. I would recommend Demon Hunters as this is the new faction there and it has the gothic feel as Mages had in Risen 1. I would advice to play for Mages later, because in Risen 3 they are a bit old and senile, which is good, that it is not the same as in the previous series. Actually nothing is the same. I was surprised how well it was remade, how funny and original was every character I met in the game. That is better from Risen 2, which looks similar, but there wasn't enough of mystic or funny features that would keep me interested.\n\nSo I wish they would release another DLC made for fans of Risen 1 combat where they would implement the old movement system even with funny animations, but smooth, and combat ranks with the advices from trainers, where you would have to learn every new step in combat system.\n\nAdd:\nafter the last patch that was upgrading graphic the camera seems to be more smooth.\n\nI have to say this game would get 10/10 from me and it is GOTTY of 2014 for me.\nIt is because a lot of new varied content that is added in 2nd part of the game and visible progresssion of the main character, how every chapter adds new skills and challenges, it would deserve that.\n\nAlso I have to say I love the voice acting of the main character, so I guess it is subjective if some players dislike that.","June 22, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Woe be unto you if you're fighting in a cave because it's even worse when there's no room for you to even hope the view spasm will settle on an angle where you can still see what you're doing.\n\nI liked the first two so, despite this one not being released where I bought the rest of them, I saw it on sale and picked it up. Unfortunately, between all the forum searching for fixes like editing the config file and Googling for a way to make it work, I've "played" beyond the return window for getting my $10 back.\n\nI really hope they release a fix for this because, despite feeling ripped off now, if the game were actually playable (in any way other than reloading saves and hoping it doesn't go crazy for long enough that I can progress a bit) I think that probably would've been a great deal.","October 15, 2015","false","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I appreciate that they tried something new other than the mindless "click-to-death"-system of earlier games, but this time they just failed.\nInstead of attack-spamming you have to keep spamming evasion rolls, the combat often feels random and parrying is a game of chance, even the most basic critters attack really fast and without a telltale sign. The melee targeting system does'nt work out at all: When you fight more than two enemies simultaneously, it is almost impossible to target a specific individual, so that it is just a random chaotic beating in all directions. Often you hit in a direction where there is no enemy at all, or the focus stays on a recently killed enemy.\n- Balancing is crap. Some boss fights are extremely unfair if you do not posess certain skills or magic spells (the Margoloth fight for example).\n\nAlthough I love the general PB-retro-charme of the game, I can not recommend it.","August 28, 2015","false","40.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Here I had that moment after leaving the first island. The second island I went to felt empty - almost noone there and it was supposed to be a living town. I found a few locked chests, but one single frickin' lockpick. And the battle system is completely lousy. Your character takes ages between sword swings, so much that a few Scavengers (pretty much the weekest foe) can be hard to kill. A fencing duel against a human(oid) with a weapon is a matter of more luck than skill. And there is nothing really driving you to keep going.\n\nLeave this one and play the first Risen or Gothic III.

I got about 60 hours of fun with it using both DLCs.\n\nOn the plus side\nGreat exploration!  They don't limit you so don't be surprised when you finish a quest you didn't even know about yet.\nGraphics are quite nice.  There's an "enhanced" edition rumored but the stock graphics are really quite nice.\nGood quests.  Organization of the quest log can be a bit dicey (was that an island quest or a crew quest??) but having so many quests that they can be a bit hard to track is a great problem to have.\nA nice sprinkling of good humor.\nMostly bug-free.  There are a few bugs here and there but nothing that really hurt my fun.\nGood autosave PLUS quick save PLUS named save system.  Why can't all games do this?\nOn the minus side\nManual level scaling (see below).\nToo few monster types.\nSea battles start interesting but get tedious.  (Luckily, there's only a few.)\nInventory gets too huge to find things.\nThe game is open world and is intent on letting you go wherever you want, with only a few areas locked off.  Unfortunatly, that means that at least half of each island is full of stuff you can defeat with your starting character!  (The fog island DLC is an exception to this.)  So, once you finish a bunch of the first island you go to, the second will be a bit easy and the others will be a LOT easy.  To counter that, you'll need to up the difficulty level as you go along - essentially doing your own level scaling.\n\nThe game has lots of crafting.  You can craft potions, rum, spell scrolls/stones/dolls, and so on.  I collected TONS of crafting ingredients but I barely used any.  Why?  See the previous paragraph.  Why bother making yourself stronger when the game isn't difficult?\n\nWhile the game has major balance issues as the game goes on, don't let that throw you.  The game is fun!  Just don't make yourself too powerful and keep pushing the difficulty up.

After figuring out how to minimize the bobbing of the camera, I played for a while and was starting to enjoy the game.  Then this morning after only 68 minutes into the game, I went in and received an error message saying that to continue I must install downloadable content.  After checking out the web, I found that if I wanted to play the must purchase extra content.  Huh?  I thought I bought a complete and playable game.   How was I to know that at 10 hours or 20 hours, I would be required to purchase more downloadable content.  I might be nickled and dimed until my pocket book was dry.

For a few minutes I thought it might be a parody game, a Sharknado of gaming where the developers were intentionally trying to make things as laughbaly awful as possible. Terrible voice acting, stilted animations, laggy and boring combat and a generally unprofessional polish and feel. The graphics are bizarre; the game came out in 2014 yet somehow looks much, much older. The environments are passable, but the character models are stilted and poorly put together.\n\nThe interaction with my "companion", an entity that a 13 year-old boy would find over-sexualized, was, like the rest of the game, stilted and awkward. She spent much of her time pointing out glaringly obvious gameplay mechanics.\n\nI lasted a half-hour. I cannot imagine the game improved even marginally after that. If this was a game made by a couple of college students for a senior-level games programming class, then I have been overly harsh. Otherwise, this effort is an embarrassment and to date the only Steam game where I have asked for a refund.","August 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I am pretty sure that I did all possible quests, that I collected every piece of loot, and I did not even get tired of it. And still there was room for more, because it did not use the parrot a lot.\n+ Incredible high amount of quests\n+ The fractions: I liked the division of the voodoo pirates, the wardens and the demon hunters. Not only stupid bad guys from king's army and good guys from the rebels.\n+ They finally gave me some Gothic-feeling again:  E.g. you can screw around with some peasants or Jack who was kicked out of his light-house, like in Gothic II.\n+ Something that I found out too late: The evil dialog options are really funny. I really laughed when I was mad at some of the gnomes. (E.g. the one that is enslaved, where you could go and tell him "Sorry, but I needed the money." After you got paid for not telling anybody that he is enslaved.)\n\nCons:\n- The so called "story": Like in Risen 1, the end of the game feels artificially stretched. Risen 2 did this far better. Not only this, the story is just weak in total.\n- Combat system\n- Difficulty level far too low\n( - Despite the environment's variety, there is no snow level :'( )\n\nRisen 3 is, in my opinion, not a milestone in the history of RPGs. But it does quite a good job. Also, I would not have thought about thumbs down, if there wasn't this horrible last island. Why did the developers think like "For the end of the story, let's build the f***ing largest island, tell the hero that time is running out so bad, but still there is time to run from one side of the island to the other, just to find some camps, that aren't even useful." Seriously Piranha Bytes, what the f**k? Moreover, you (the developers) could have just let Eldric and the other two die. I really would have prefered it in this way. But no, even in the hardest fight in the history of humans, no "important" characters dies (excluding Horas). That is a childish story.

I just started to play this game not to long ago and I am really enjoyying it so far.  Graphics are  pretty good considering the size of the game. Combat takes some practice, but very engaging. Money is hard to come by, but that is a good thing, I suppose.\n\nQuesting gets a little confusing as every time you talk to someone with a name, you get a quest. Soon, you have a book load of quests on different islands. Maybe I am doing something wrong. I should start doing them in order, but it is so much fun exploring.\n\nIf you are looking for a game with exploring and I mean really exploring, this game is for you.  There are things to pick up everywhere. Jump on roofs, find niches in rocks, rooms, behind buildings, laying around on the beach and you will pick up something.\n\nYou  have an unlimited storage with no weight restrictions. This can be a little overwhelming at times as you really don't know what to sell or keep.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game.

I'm a hardcore fan of RPG's and enjoy a game that challenges... however sadly after reading other reviews saying that this game just reqires "tactics" and "doging" are just hogwash this game is extremely mediocre and lack though passion a sense of caring and depth. I say this game will hold your interest for about 30 hours. But those 30 hours are rarely memorable and fun. Most of this game is a grind and the combat is messy and repetitive. HOWEVER the most major gripe I have with this game is the "boss fights" they honestly feel like my 5 year old cousin has made them. They are unfun grinds that pit you againts an infinite amount of spawning minions of the boss and the boss itself is heaing constantly, so you fight off 5 of the minions that dont matter because they give you no XP and never go away and then you return to the boss to find it have full health and maximum power after trying to kill if for 30 minutes. It was stupid game design and poor production values resulting in a failed franchise that makes the player angry rather than reward hard work and time. PLEASE PLEASE VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS ENTRY OF RISEN! Go play the First one for a much better game if you have money to spend on something not this. And if you HAVE toplay this game do yourself a service and pay no more than 8$ for it.\n","June 22, 2015","false","21.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Let's start with what was good.\n\n+ Graphics - It's quite beautiful to be honest. Althugh it's too vibrant and saturated.\n+ Music - I cannot imagine wandering in a world of Risen without that smooth guitar tones.\n+ Bones - His quotes are really hilarious.\n+ Quests - This part is the main reason, why PB games (Gothic, Risen) are soo good. Quests are pleasant and noninvasive.\n+ Astral Vision - it's great idea, but on the other hand it makes exploration much easier.\n\nThat's not much. Unfortunately, there's way more things, which went bad.\n\n- It's basically Risen 2 with factions. Even the locations are a little similar. In PB games, armor was always rare but in one DLC you got better armor from start than you got by joining faction. Also - free maps, phew...\n- Atmosphere - This is what hurts me the most. Risen 3 has good music and graphic so why it's not immersive? For me it's due to extremly dull and boring cities. I still have Khorinis (Gothic 2) or Harbor City (Risen) in my memories. Despite of beautiful graphic it actually harms atmosphere. Nights aren't dark enough and as I said it's oversaturated. Back in Risen I remember a night in the Bandit Camp with a torch in my hand and fear in my heart while slowly sneaking through nearby swamps. In Risen 3 I lighted up a torch just in order to take a good screenshot...\n- Companions - They're extremly boring and shallow without any character development. Not to mention Patty who looks like a ♥♥♥♥ with too much makeup. Polly and Bones are the only exception.\n- Difficulty - First playtrough, ultra difficulty, zero challenge. I sweeped all avalibe islands even before I joined a faction.  Shadowlord was surprisingly easy, just let companion to tank it. When I finally joined faction (Guardians) I expected to be even more powerfull. But when I found my attacks were AoE I prayed for quick end. I basically didn't need to improve my character at al, altought I still did.\n- Story - They took a good story of first Risen, transformed it into medicore Risen 2 story, and dumpstered it in Risen 3. This is the last Risen according to PB and obviously they don't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about their original backstory which was good. Also, people like Patty, so let's make our main protagonist as her brother in order to not deal with a lovestory. There were two, maybe three good moments but they really should hire someone from Bioware.","January 10","false","61.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Risen 1 was very good and wasn't fantastic but it wasn't garbage.  Risen 2 was really trashy but kept my attention and I was able to get through it and enjoy the story.  But this game.  Oh my god I have never had a worse combat experience ever.  Game says you can chain 3 hits.  No you can not at all.  2 hits fairly easily but the 3rd will always be interupted by an enemy attack and even power attacking enemy block will just cause them to hit you first or roll away instead.  Combat ends up being this really slow boring grind of slash roll slash roll.  Theres no real strat as you get frames when you roll even if the attack hits you.  It feels like it tried to be a budget darksouls combat system and ended up just being trash.  Story is meh.  Not much to say but pirates and feels like a recycled plot from the second game but much more watered down.  Only play if your fan of the games already otherwise the completely garbage combat system will upset you.","June 5","false","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But don't go in there with somewhat high expectations.\n\nThe story is something between AC4 and Pirates of the Caribbean. Not deep, not shallow, not very original. The phrasing of Quests didn't impress me positively. I'm sure there would've been another way than "Next Quest: Pull on the lever". "Open the temple door" could've sounded a little tiny bit better.\n\nI'm playing with a controller (don't give me ♥♥♥♥ for that, it's easier to handle than a mouse with a wrist beyond repair), and it's just frustrating.\nControls are clunky and it's responding late or not at all sometimes. Press the block button - get hit - block. Dodging in the direction you want? Eeeh, I'll try my best and- whoops got hit. I ended up spamming the Dodge button in every fight.\nHave your weapon drawn and want to open a door or pick up loot? No. Away with your weapon, manually. In a painfully slow animation. Something attacks you and is already in your face? Press B. Then A. Got hit? Too bad. Kind of like the chinese blackmarket rip-off of Assassin's Creed's combat.\n\nThe camera's jerking around making it almost impossible to adjust it to your likings: A slight tilt to the left with the joystick results in a complete turn around-up-down-left-right making it stupidly hard to see or hit any enemy. Even without your doing, it'll just zoom in or out at the worst times. Fighting in a tight spot and dodging, against a wall because you can't really control the direction, and you're done for. It's no help to have a close up on that stone behind me, really.\n\nLots of unneccesary small cut scenes. Opening a chest is fine, but I do not need to see the same kneeling down-opening chest-looking inside every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. They tried to make a kill cam as well, but it only takes time and isn't anything special. I'd rather do without. Accidentally facing Patty and pressing A results in yet another short cut scene whereas she tells you 'Not now, later' most of the time. Voice acting makes it all the worse.\n\nFirst look, the world looks like it's been modelled with lots of love. Second look, not so much. The screenshots are deceiving in my opinion - I just recently built this PC. The best of the best, because I like nice looking games, and i certainly want them to run smoothly.This however, I could play on my Mothers Laptop and it would still look the same. The highest settings are a joke. It's atmospheric, don't get me wrong, But not aesthetic. If you told me that this game came out in 2008, I'd believe you.\n\nAnd OH MY GOD how slow do you have to walk. That is ridiculous.

There's a discover here, the scenarios are incredibly rich, there's secrets everywhere, and the story is compelling. Of course, you can see that the budget wasn't very high: The combat system suffered great improvements, but it lacks some adjustments; the voice acting could be a lot better; the game engine is recycled (still, huge improvements!), some bugs are just really annoying. But still, this game is a must have in every RPG-lover collection. Specially the Gothic fans. Seriously, it's the first time in a decade that a game gives me a Gothic game feeling.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10","August 17, 2014","true","28.5"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","28","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/radnen/recommended/249230/","radnen","Radnen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/radnen/","89 products in account","Full disclosure: I'm coming at this review from an action-rpg perspective, such as The Witcher III, Skyrim and Kingdoms of Amalur.\n\nI've heard people say they like this game and even some people have defended the game's combat, but I can't seem to understand them when there are a plethora of games that have better-feeling combat systems. This review will be a breakdown of the combat system in this game. Bear in mind, I am playing the Witcher III, and yes I am comparing this to a game like that because I need a benchmark for what a good battle system feels like. Because that's the thing I'm not hearing often enough about this game... that the combat system may be likable but it feels far off the mark.\n\nSo, what I dislike out of the gate is the fact I have to unlearn all the best systems in the past. There are no real parry moves, blocking or dodging of any kind. Sure you can roll, but it's really hampered. In other games like Amalur and Witcher III, a roll is a dodge that puts you in a better position to combo. In this game it's more of a get-out-of-the-way move that ends up being a chore for how often you do it, and you can never align it correctly. Sure you can roll out to a better position for comboing and sure if you've gotten used to this system, you may even say it's just as good, but you have to realize you are getting used to a floaty and unrealistic fighting system. I'm just now getting the hang of it and I'm fighting the opponents in different ways than I prefer. It feels really cheap oftentimes to attack in certain ways in this game. The Witcher III seems to have a graceful sliding system with the dodge mechanic that can be used to great effect if timed correctly. But I find the timing in this game to be rather hard to figure out.\n\nThe next gripe I have is with the attacks. They feel very floaty and I cannot feel for where the tip of the sword is, this small concept is proving to be a huge nuisance. Games like Skyrim or The Witcher III have very decent positional relation with the blade. I can tell easily if an opponent is within range. Even more off putting, the character ice-skates to his opponent in the game, which is harder yet to control. Also I've noticed that while in mid "ice-skate" the enemy can still attack you from the front. Which is odd since I'm coming right at it. Games like Amalur which does have a kind of skating system, at least feel satisfying for connecting with the opponent in rewarding ways.\n\nThe attacks also seem slow and the combos don't stack. If I hit the attack button and quickly move to 'parry' or block, it seems to cancel the move which is not what I'm used to. I was half hoping the attack continues and the character moves into a parry stance, much like other games with really nice animation. This subtly makes the fighting feel unnuanced and robotic.\n\nThere are patterns to most enemies you encounter, but they don't have a rhyme or reason. It's quite random how you handle even the most basic encounters. Rolling and attacking, waiting for them to do two attacks so you can get them with one attack. Waiting for them to charge an attack, etc. It also doesn't help that your attacks at first don't seem to deal much damage. Basic encounters can be long winded if you focus too much on blocking and rolling and not dealing enough damage.\n\nGroups are hard to manage. The best solution is to attack randomly until they die off evenly, or getting lucky enough to isolate one of them. But in other games there are usually ways to cope with groups. In the Witcher for example, the character can parry and attack and dodge enemies coming in from the sides or behind and what's better is you can do that by timing it in that game. In this game, the character is acrobatically feable, which makes it rather hard to do any impressive sword swashbuckling. If it isn't one of two states you can be in, you'tre screwed. Even Assassins Creed games get this right. It also helps if enemies all don't attack at once but circle you until they are ready to leap. I know you might think that system is cheap, but it certainly goes a long ways in creating a believable action game where the hero has to fight multiple enemies. But it mainly comes down to flank-parry recognization: The idea you can turn an opponents attack around when they arrive from the side.\n\nFinally, where are the skills? I haven't gotten far enough along to unlock shield-breaking moves, different combos, stun moves, etc. I was hoping to have some experience of this before the first trainers, but the game really hampers you in the beginning and that leaves a rather dull first impression. I find it hard to keep coming back to this game because of it.\n\nThat's my experience with it. So if you prefer really nice action games, please steer away from this or you'll be cursing about how bad this system is before you get any good at it. It definitely is not a system I picked up and liked immediately like Witcher III or other similar, better combat games.","June 25, 2015","false","2.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drachenhexe/recommended/249230/","drachenhexe","Dragonwitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drachenhexe/","514 products in account","The best looking game in the series but the laziest and weakest overall.\n\nExcept for the visuals there really isn't anything that's improved since Risen 2 and much has gotten worse.\n\nThe Good:\n\nI like the visuals, the enhanced edition really looks good.  The models, the colors, and the overall look and feel of the environments are well done.  There are are few small anomalies here and there but nothing horrible or overly distracting.  Weather effects could be a bit better, but it doens't really take away anything.\n\nI like the magic.  While I haven't used all the systems if the others are similay to the way voodoo works then that's pretty good.  While magic isn't a very in depth process it's interesting and diverse enough to be fun to use.\n\nI have always liked the quest system, where you can complete the goals of a quest even before you get assigned the quest.  So if you kill all the creatures in some corner and then come across a guy who gives you the quest to go kill the creatures in that corner, you can complete it right then and there.\n\nSome minor (and major) rewards for exploring.  I like being able to look up at some rocks and ask "What's up there?" and much of the time I am able to clime up there and find something there; a dead body, some gold or food, or whatever.  Very rarely have I been disappointed from randomly exploring the areas.\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\nSo mcuh of in this game is left over from the previous games.  Very little is completely new.  You'll interact with just about everyone you met before in the previous games, many of these meetings are forced and add absolutely noting to the plot. Especially the ones you meet in your very short stints into the underworld which are forced upon you at various times when you go to sleep.  Boring and a complete waste of time.\n\nCombat still sucks ♥♥♥.  You pretty much have the same moves you did in Risen 2 and most of the enemies still use the same tired old attack routines.  Save for a couple of the newer mini bosses and bosses every creature uses the same attack pattern that existed in previous game.  It truly boggles my mind that an alligator has teh exact same attack pattern as the wild beaked birds. Combat adds almost nothing new in installment.  Even my voodoo combat is the same as my melee combat save that it will hit multiple creatures rather than just one.  Not to mention even on hard this game is easy save for the random times the AI just goes ballistic and starts throwing up a stream of attacks there is no way you can defend against.  Also, some monsters, despite how powerful your armor is, will kill in one hit if you fail to dodge.  Combat is an annoying chore instead of a fun activity.\n\nAuto saves:  Autosaves are nice, but they are very strangely activated.  Most are okay, but there are times where they should be used when they're not.  An autosave should activate right a fast travel and tehy aren't.  If you forget to save after a fast trave to your ship and then travel to another island and then get killed by something on the beach, when you reload you'll be way back on that other island.  Also, I have encounterd puzzles where once you solve them you get ambushed and if you don't save and get killed you have to solve the puzzle again.  One took me 10 minutes to solve and I got ambushed, die almost instantly, and had to redo the god damn puzzle.  That's a horrible flaw.  Autosave on complete puzzles is a must.\n\nVague quest resolution:  A few quests are completely vague in how they are supposed to be resolved.  One in particular I have done every single quest on the isle of mages and all I get is "I still have soem things to do before we can start" with absolutely no clue what I need to do or am waiting for.\n\nCompanions:  Kinda hand for combat, though they're really slow to start fighting (I can fimish most foes before the companion even makes one attack) they are almost always in your way when you wanna loot the corpses.  You have to specifically make sure the corpse is highlighted because you companion will usually be right here in your face when trying to loot.  This is annoying as hell.\n\nThe underworld:  Often times when you sleep you're whisked away into a stint in the underworld which serves one of two purposes.  So you can have a brief chat with someone you killed in Risen 2 which adds nothing to the game in the least and another to collect "soul dust" which can help elevate your soul rank, but they always end abruptly as you collect one or two and then a creature appears and kicks you out of the underworld.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nThe main character is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  This guy is absolute o fun to play unless you want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Even if you follow the "good" path everything that comes out of this guys mouth is pure garbage.  Even when you select the nice dialoge option the character sounds like he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that he even has to talk to someone else.  He has set a new standard for me as most unlikable video game protagonist ever.\n\n\nThis game is a disjointed mess.  All of its parts do not equal up to its whole.  Most of its parts are average at best, a few are good, more are bad, and a lot just doesn't make any sense.  All in all, I'm just not really enjoying this game.  Risen 2 was so much better.","September 3, 2015","false","32.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Spend all your glory points into dexterity and influence, you want to stomp everything with powerful blows? Focus on melee combat. You want to survive everything and just run through hordes of enemies unscathed? Max out your toughness.\n\n\nWhat Risen 3 isn't?\n\n-It's not Gothic, which means that you won't relive your days gone by getting mauled by orcs and wargs, it has some nostalgia easter eggs and it's still a Piranha bytes game which means there are some strong points of connection and if you liked Gothic 1/2/3 you'll most likely like Risen 3 too, but don't expect to play another Gothic because it isn't such.\n\n-It's not Risen 2, which means if you played Risen 2 and didn't like it you should tell so in Risen 2's forum, not here.\n\n-It's not a combat driven action RPG, which means that if you care for insane combos with stunning animations and insanely big numbers flying all over the place you'll have to look elsewhere, fights in Risen 3 are milder and more realistic, you won't launch your enemy in the air and slash him 400 times in 3 seconds before he hits the ground.\n\n-It's not a Sandbox game, which also means it's not Skyrim, you won't have heavy modding, you won't have a world that answer to your bidding, you won't have an immense amount of general sidequests that all look the same and have no soul.\n\n-It's not a game you can understand in a few hours, which means that you'll have to put a bit of time into the game before you start to grasp all the details and untold gimmicks of the game's mechanics.\n\n\n\nAnd last but not least, it's not a game for everyone, which means you shouldn't get mad because people buy it and enjoy it and you shouldn't feel offended if others don't like it, it's a game so peculiar that it can only appeal to a core group of people, just like all PB games so far.\n\nAll in all it's a fantastic game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs and isn't afraid of a bit of thinking instead of buttonmashing all over the place.","August 19, 2014","true","43.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I personnaly just had to complete each and every island, do all the quests possible, find all secrets and more - and believe you me, if you want to do everything there is to do in this game, you are going to spend at least 60-80 hours doing so, and if you're not in a hurry - 100hrs in the game is achieveable.\n\nI honestly recommend this game to all those, who loved Gothic 1&2 (and 3 too, why not:)) - this game, in my humble opinion, is worth the money spent on it.\n\nAnd since there are many and many titles, that cost as much, and cannot get the player involved for more than half of the time, I have already spent in Risen 3, I would rate this game at 80-85/100. A very nice title and I really recommend it as a nice Gothic experience.","August 23, 2014","true","47.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I think its not bad for the price. Over all the game is really immersive and fun to play, the melee side of the game isn't bad but, once i got spells the game became more enjoyable. The crafting was interesting, as well as the health potions were booze. So i thought that was kind of comical. Overall give it two thumbs up. I had so many quests i was busy. Very well done game.

Spend all your glory points into dexterity and influence, you want to stomp everything with powerful blows? Focus on melee combat. You want to survive everything and just run through hordes of enemies unscathed? Max out your toughness.\n\n\nWhat Risen 3 isn't?\n\n-It's not Gothic, which means that you won't relive your days gone by getting mauled by orcs and wargs, it has some nostalgia easter eggs and it's still a Piranha bytes game which means there are some strong points of connection and if you liked Gothic 1/2/3 you'll most likely like Risen 3 too, but don't expect to play another Gothic because it isn't such.\n\n-It's not Risen 2, which means if you played Risen 2 and didn't like it you should tell so in Risen 2's forum, not here.\n\n-It's not a combat driven action RPG, which means that if you care for insane combos with stunning animations and insanely big numbers flying all over the place you'll have to look elsewhere, fights in Risen 3 are milder and more realistic, you won't launch your enemy in the air and slash him 400 times in 3 seconds before he hits the ground.\n\n-It's not a Sandbox game, which also means it's not Skyrim, you won't have heavy modding, you won't have a world that answer to your bidding, you won't have an immense amount of general sidequests that all look the same and have no soul.\n\n-It's not a game you can understand in a few hours, which means that you'll have to put a bit of time into the game before you start to grasp all the details and untold gimmicks of the game's mechanics.\n\n\n\nAnd last but not least, it's not a game for everyone, which means you shouldn't get mad because people buy it and enjoy it and you shouldn't feel offended if others don't like it, it's a game so peculiar that it can only appeal to a core group of people, just like all PB games so far.\n\nAll in all it's a fantastic game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs and isn't afraid of a bit of thinking instead of buttonmashing all over the place.","August 19, 2014","true","43.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I found the interface clunkier than the second game's, which is very unfortunate.\n\nThe main character's (English) voice is terrible; I really wish this horrible voice was allotted to a minor character that dies off very early in the game rather than the one person you have to endure through its entirety. While the voices on the other characters are nice enough, with some, like Bones', improving a bit in my opinion, I find the characters less interesting than in the earlier games.\n\nI thought the combat in Risen was too plain, I thought the combat in Risen 2 was *excellent*, and I think the combat in Risen 3 is...not very good, though not necessarily a step backward. I was hesitant to try Risen 2 after my pleasant experiences with the Gothic titles and the first Risen, but after getting it on sale I was extremely impressed and thought it kept the spirit of the earlier games alive. As a consequence, I approached Risen 3 with very high expectations, none of which were really met. I don't think anyone stands to *lose* from trying it, but I can't recommend it.","December 4, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Piranha Bytes' games have never been about mindless slaughter, but rather deep and careful exploration of the rich environment, carefully crafted quests, interesting characters and total immersion. Risen 2 may have strayed away a bit from some of these factors, but I can confidently say that Risen 3 has certainly improved greatly over it, and the feeling and atmosphere of the game is much more reminiscent of the original Gothic games and the first Risen.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints of the previous game in the Risen series was the combat system. This time, however, not only is the magic system back, adding greater variety, but melee combat feels much more satisfying, and it's certainly NOT a left click fest - if you want to defeat a strong enemy, you must dodge, block, riposte and time your hits.\n\nRisen 3: Titan Lords is a game for all the players who loved Piranha Bytes' classical works. Perhaps the plot isn't up to par with Gothic 1's, but nevertheless, as the final game in the series, it has certainly lived up to its promise to go back to the roots - the more observant fans will even notice some very pleasant surprises involving familiar characters from times gone by.","August 14, 2014","true","62.2"," 48 of 100 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","48","100","0","0"

With a few skills and more importantly magic, the combat does not feel half as bad, depending on the faction there are several nice combos to do with magic. i'm loving the demon hunters. Graphics look awsoome, especially distant structures and lightning. Shadows look awsome and very realistic. Story is as great as you can expect from such a developer, leveling is fairly balanced and not too hard. I mostly love the fact that you get magic with every faction, unlike prequals where you had to choose a specific one for it, while every faction still has it's own magic to make a difference between them. I also like how there are faction specific skills. Humor is grately present witch also gives the game even more charm. So in conclusion for anyone that likes a good story, rpg-s, adventures or open world games this is a must have.

Read the review before thinking about rating it!\n\nI thought about writing a review after 2 hours ingame because I was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nIt feels like this game was broken down to basic content because PB feared that games like Gothic or the first Risen would be to bulky.\nThere are some animations missing (climbing a latter, drinking, eating). I think it's because they want to make the game more easy and available for everyone, even for young people. As a huge fan of the first three Gothic games this really hurts me as well as the black screen that you have when you open your inventory, crafting, looting and trading...\nThen I thought "give it a chance" and I played 3 more hours. It is good that I waited. Risen 3 is a solid RPG with a breathtaking designed world filled with hundreds of quests. It is a living world with day/night cycle and great atmosphere. The combat makes fun as well (yes I know many hate it, I did as well but I changed my opinion). If you can ignore the fact that this game is no Gothic then you can have a lot of fun.","August 14, 2014","true","33.3"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Yes and no.\n\nThe bad:\n\n-The story drags a bit in the middle. They do things to improve this and try to keep it interesting, but it's easy to do things in an order which can feel like a slog and not a fun progression of events.\n\n-Companions are tanks. This isn't as much of a problem on the hardest difficulty, but on medium it feels like they are more powerful than you for far too long and are neigh unkillable. If you're spending glory on skills you don't have until you join a faction, like magic or voodoo, this is especially true.\n\n-Voice acting is hit-and-miss. Sometimes your main character can sound like a badass that you'd never want to mess with, other times he has a mouth full of gravel for no reason. Also, there are too many times where you'll hear that the voice actors didn't have good direction and say lines with the wrong inflection.\n\n-Combat can be clunky. I actually put this in both the good and the bad because they improved some aspects, but from friends I know who've played the game on a console the controls can be a pain without a mouse and keyboard. This is where you'll really feel the "companions are tanks", because you can often just roll circles around enemies while your friend rips them apart. Seeing enemies get stuck behind a fence or rock and glitch out during can also break immersion.\n\n-Day one DLC. This is more a knock on the publisher and not the developer, but for ♥♥♥♥ sake stop making Devs do this ♥♥♥♥. It only hurts the customer.\n\nThe neutral:\n\n-Reused areas. I put this in neutral because PB has done this before to great affect, like in Gothic II. Seeing how areas change over time is fun and they are disimillar enough that I didn't feel it detracted from my experience, but it annoys enough people that it can be a negative.\n\n-Ship combat under utilized. This was one of the most fun parts of the game, but like Assassin's creed 3 it just leaves you wanting more.\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Magic system is a blast. Anyone who played Risen 2 can tell you that the voodoo magic left a lot to be desired with a few cool tricks but damage spells that came much too late. Now you have three different schools of magic to play with (rune, crystal, and voodoo) all with fun and unique spells. Instead of a mana pool that gives out over time you have different elements that you can wield like weapons at melee and range supplemented by timed spells with effects like fire rain or summoning. Enemies also have vulnerabilities to elements that you can discover with experimentation.\n\n-Exploration. This has always been a strongpoint of PB games and this iteration is no different. A bevy of secret caves, islands, and treasure to find will keep you wanting to see what is around every corner for hours if you're anything like me.\n\n-Arcane Vision. For anyone who likes collecting every ounce of junk as a metagame this upgradable ability highlights objects so you don't have to worry about missing anything and squinting at every corner. It reminds me of the wisp ability from Gothic II, but much more efficient.\n\n-Huge number of interesting quests. Many may knock this game for having quite a few 'fetch' quests, but it's what you can do within these quests that lets them shine and wash away any tedium. Asked to hand out some crystals to your compatriates? Scam them instead and make them pay for the privelage.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt's a solid 7/10 RPG, 8/10 if you like the PB style of exploration and questing. For any fan of PB's previous Gothic series I'd recommend buying now, but if you're just a general lover of open world RPGs you might want to wait for a sale. The day one DLC added a lot of content but the it will leave a sour taste in your mouth if you buy full price.\n\n\n\n","August 15, 2014","true","31.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

There is lots to do and it does not really hold your hand and explain things for crafting and that sort to you or maybe I just have not found the npc yet. First chest I had to pick it said something to the affect of dont hit the wrong tumbler or you have to start over... I spent way longer than I should trying to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ I needed to do for the minigame. I then cleared my first real island of all the plants and mobs, wonder wtf do I do with all this stuff? I just wanna make a bottle of rum! Or how the ♥♥♥♥ do I sneak? When I lost my soul did I magically forget how to crouch and move slowly? I like that the game doesn't tell me everything I need to know, I rather figure that out on my own. The combat is probably my only real complaint and it is mainly you can't roll off things in combat. I have been on a rock many times about 1 inch off the ground and I go to dodge an enemy and stopped by an invisible wall. Would I rather it be like Elder Scroll where I can really steal anything that isn't nailed down and have hidden caves with bad guys in it for me to kill? Of course I would. Would I rather have the combat more hardcore as in DS? YES! But the game isn't from those devs and it is what it is so I have to ask myself do you have fun? are you even a little be curious to see what happens at the end? I do so I think the game is a success. I read some people saying the game isnt worth 50$ more like 30$ and I almost agree. The graphics, clunky combat is totes a 30$ game but the game has so many quests, places to explore, and frankly I have played to close to 33hrs and I still have 3 more islands and havent picked a faction... and the game seems like i havent even come to the climax of the game yet...

The world is lush and pretty. The theme, pirates and magic, can be a lot of fun. Okay, two good things.\n\nIt also has a lot of things that are not good, and in some cases very bad. The physical mechanics of the game are crap, frankly. You walk like you're on a flat plane that skates across the ground. There are invisi-walls all over the place. More specifically the fighting mechanics, are even worse. All the things that Assassin's Creed IV got right about fighting, such as the pace, the fluidity, and the using of different weapons, are all things that this game gets horribly, horribly wrong. You click to attack, and then there's a pause, and then there is a slow attack. There is no such thing as a fast attack. The enemies, however, do have a fast attack; and it interupts. Meaning there you are, slowly pulling your sword back for an attack, and 'whack' you get hit and have to restart the attack. I could continue on this subject, but there are so many other things wrong that I'm moving on.\n\nThis is supposed to be an open world style game. It is one, in a sense. You have the open world of the path, and the few trees on either side. But wait! What's that toward the end of a path? It's a temple complex! So you enter the temple complex, and then you have the open world of the corridor! Don't get me wrong, the world is open to you going back and forth within the path or corridor. I admit that I've only played the first area, so maybe the world becomes more open later on.\n\nLet's talk about pop-in. Usually, pop-in is a draw distance issue where textures go from either blurry or just not there, to suddenly clear and apparant. In some horror games however, they used the sudden appearance of enemies as a scare tactic. As in, you would be walking along and suddenly BOO! an enemy jumps out at you. In this game you're walking along and enemies will suddenly pop up from the ground. It's not a slow, un-burying of an enemy. It's a quick 'look I can phase through solid matter' jump up. Not only that, but they can go from appearance to attacking instantly. Considering the time it takes for you to be able to attack, even if your reaction time is amazing, you're going to get hit multiple times before being able to land a blow. Also, this game is set on islands. Islands with rivers running across them. There is a lot of water. There are enemies that do the pop-up effect while under the water. The further problem here, is that a lot of the water has a 'foam' effect, making it opaque. That renders these popped-in enemies invisable. So then you get to fight invisiable fast-attacking enemies. I cannot, in any way, describe this as 'fun'.\n\nThere are more things wrong with this game, but honestly I think this review is long enough. So to sum-up: This game is filled with poor mechanics, has a terrible story line (sorry I didn't write a paragraph about this part), has poor voice acting and scripting (or this part), but occasionally looks pretty. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this game a 3. [3/10]","September 9, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The map is almost identical to Risen#2, gameplay mechanics, very similar.  Graphics, again, no major evolution.\n\nThe worst thing about this game though, is the horrendous decision, to move away from the nameless here we played in Risen#1 and Risen#2 and introduce a completely new protagonist, Patty's brother.  WTF ?  Whoever smart guy at game studio made that decision aught to be taken out the back and flogged.  Long-term fans of the franchise like me were looking forward to Patty and the Nameless hero finally getting together in Risen#3.  Totally unfinished plot arc from the first 2 games.\n\nNow, to be clear I loved the Risen franchise, up until #3.  I have recommended the original Risen, and also Risen#2 multiple times.  How could the devs be so dumb as to completely change up the protagonist we came to know and love in the first 2 games ?  Not only that, the world is almost the same as that of Risen#2 with the addition of a couple of scorch marks and some fog.\n\nI totally cannot recommend this game.  I am bored with it now, I already played Risen#2 and I dont want to play Risen#2.5 which is what this game really aught to have been called.  Game uninstalled, and not completed.\n\nSo, the major gripes about Risen#3 :\n\n- Same maps as Risen#2, just with some minor changes\n- Different protagonist from the one we spent 60+ hours with if we played the first 2 games\n- Game feels cheap and definitely not as well done as first 2 games\n\nSo basically IMHO Risen#3 is a cheap piece of crap and a money-making scheme on the Risen name from the developers.  Avoid.","June 16, 2015","false","33.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Just finished four hours playing Risen 3, and it was not fun. The graphics are nice, and the audio is fine. My source of irritation was with the 'combat' system. My apologies for the single quotes, but that was what it felt like.\n\nFirst my gaming background. I've played (and enjoyed) Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Kingdoms of Amalur, Fallout:New Vegas, Dishonored, Fable: The Lost Chapters, The Witcher. All on PC.  Each with a slightly varying combat system, showing that I can adjust to different systems.\n\nPlease remember that I'm giving my experience with the game; these are not criticisms, just reasons why someone who thinks and plays like myself may want to give this game a pass.\n\nMy expectation in playing any game where combat is involved is that the combat is straightforward. That is, the laws of physics apply (I press 'Hit', my character attempts to swing), not the laws of combos (you can only swing at the right time as decided by the game).  And this is my reason for writing this review: Risen 3's combat system is not straightforward as far as I can tell.\n\nHere are the things I observed:\n- in a number of instances (during combat) when I click the left mouse button to attack, my character just stands there.\n- during combat, my character decides to sheath his sword (I believe I can say with confidence that I did not click the middle mouse button by mistake when this occurred).\n- more that 50% of the time, a standard attack from any creature resulted in my character taking damage, even while parrying/blocking.\n- my character would strike a creature, then perform a 180 degree pivot and strike the person behind me. I only clicked the left mouse button once. Force of habit with games like Kingdom of Amalur meant my left hand was firmly pressing the 'W' key to keep moving forward ... didn't work apparently.\n- the creatures at level 1 are incredibly fast. I like a challenge, but the lapse in response time by my character just meant many cycles of: Kill a creature, save, get killed. restore, kill another creature, save, get killed ... you get the idea.\n- in most of the games I mentioned above, there was always 'wiggle' room; you could choose which encounters you wanted, when you were prepared for them. In Risen 3, encounters are about every 50 feet, no getting around them. This would seem that the developers were more focused on combat than anything else. In the one quest where I was escorting Balbor, there were a minimum of 15 different creatures all within a 150 foot radius. (the distace is a guess, it's just to show it felt close) And when attempting to follow him away from the water source, you had no choice (not even sneaking worked, even though it is an available skill) but to engage the animals. I partially blame Balbor, as he went out of his way to 'pull' them towards me.\n\nAltogether not enjoyable. I've read a few comments by some folks in the community here, and some have expressed the thought that this would be solved by 'training harder'. I believe that can be interpreted to mean 'learn how the combat system works and you'll be fine'. My response would be 'but I have'. I know how to attack by pressing the left mouse button. I know how to parry/block by pressing the right mouse button. However, the actions I see on the screen are not consistent with what I want my character to do.\n\nLet me explain myself a bit, using Skyrim as an example (it's still one of my favorite games). If I meet an NPC whose skill level with his chosen weapon is higher than my skill level with my chosen weapon, it's quite likely I'll lose the battle. But I'll lose it because the NPC is better skilled than I am. I can still swing a sword at him, it just won't do as much damage due to my lower skill level. I can still fight and block, until he gets the better of me and overwhelms me. I don't mind losing to a superior foe, as long as I put up a good fight.\n\nBut when ALL of the creatures are superior foes, and my character is effectively incapacitated during combat, it's no longer a challenge, it's a chore. And perhaps some might think me lazy, but the 'click the attack button, wait two seconds then click it again, wait three seconds and then press the Ctrl key as you click the attack button again  to perform the Super/Ultra combo' formula doesn't mean that you've mastered the game as I see it. It means it's mastered you.\n\nI read the description of the game, and viewed all of the videos available on Steam for Risen 3, spending a few days to think about purchasing it. I gave it a chance because it seemed like the character interactions would be interesting and I thought it was along the lines of other RPG games I enjoyed in the past. Except for the combat, unfortunately a crucial part of the game, it was. It would have been a great game to play otherwise.\n","December 21, 2014","false","3.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Which become quite predictable after a short while.\nThis is later mixed up with enemies that can block your attacks, instead of dodging it, or throwing the occasional stone or fireball at you.\nLater in the game you are able to improve your combat skills significantly, you will be able to learn to attack faster, add more attacks to your combos, riposte and interrupt enemies attacks.\n\nCombat feels harsh and unfair at first but quickly becomes menial as you progress in your skills.\nThis continues to the point where you are basically a demi-god, an almost indestructible force of mayhem.\nSome people like it some hate it.\nI personally enjoyed it because it instills a feeling of gratification, like you worked hard to get there and now you are able to enjoy the fruits of your labor.\n\nOne thing about combat however seems quite annoying, almost all types of enemies are able to knock you on your ♥♥♥.\nSending you flying through the air.\nIt makes sense with certain type of enemies such as big rhinos or Golemts.\nHowever I fail to see how a small spider, a lake lizardman ( which is basically a water-ghoul ) or an over sized chicken ( scavanger ) can constantly send you flying.\n\nMagic seems powerful and satisfying, there is no mana just cooldown rates which you can decrease by unlocking various perks.\nThere is a good amount of spell variety.\n\n\nCOMBAT AT SEA\n\nThe game offers some mini games to liven things up a little.\nYou will have to combat other ships and Sea-Monsters.\n\nCombating other ships is very scripted you basically just have to fight some pirates on deck and beat their Leader.\nThis is accompanied by some shooting the board cannon, which feels quite underwhelming in terms of power and destructive force.\n\nThe Sea monster combat allows you to steer your mighty vessel and give the sea monster some broad-sides.\nThis battles with Sea monsters become progressively more difficult, the last encounter is frustratingly difficult.\n\nEverything about it feels wrong, the monster seems overly powerful and have homing shots.\nAfter I beat it I felt more like it was a stroke of luck than skill.\nMany people seem to complain about it, especially since its a " mini game " that you can´t skip.\nIf you reached that point it basically blocks your progress until you beat it.\n\nThere seem 2 ways around this issue :\n\n1. Lower the difficulty, which makes the battle mind numbingly dull and underwhelming\n\n2. Prepare yourself to try it 10-20 times in a row.\n\nMaybe there are some very good players who found a pattern or strategy to use, I personally could not find it.\n\n\nITEMS\n\nAny good RPG like game needs vast amounts of Weapons and Armor and othe trinkets to make you feel like a truly mighty Warrior.\n\nThe game offers a variety of Armors consting of hats, chests pieces, pants, boots.\nDepending on the faction youi will join you get access to 3 exclusive types of Armor.\nAs you progress in the ranks of your faction you will advance from light armor to medium to heavy.\n\nArmors look good and characeristic for their faction.\nYou can also get some general pirate themed armor from vendors or as special rewards from quests.\nThese all look nice but are utterly inferior to your faction armor.\nWith the exception of something just labeled " Heavy Armor " that you can find on your adventures.\nWhich is slightly better than your tier 3 Faction armor.\n\nIf you own the Adventurer Garb DLC you get a set of armor that is slightly better than your first faction armor.\nWhich makes quite a bit of a difference at the start of the game.\nThe armor just looks kind of whacky.\n\nThere are various accessoirs to choose from, such as rings, earrings and amulets.\nThose basically boost your stats and allow you to specialize your skill sets.\n\nWeapons, there are plenty of weapons to be found.\nSwords, Axes and Maces, sabres and fencing weapons.\nI personally could not see a big difference between the weapon types.\nYou get perks for each class, and all seem to do the same amount of damage.\nThere are slight variations but they make no difference in actual combat.\nWether your weapon does 95, 100 or 110 damage does not matter, you still need at least 2-3 hits to kill an enemy in the end game.\n\nSo it just is a matter of taste.\n\nThere also is a Musket type of weapon, allowing you ranged combat.\nIf you choose to use this combat will change slightly but soon falls into the same patterns as meele combat.\n\nLast but not least you are able to utilize dirty tricks, which basically are secondary weapons.\nYou will be able to throw daggers, fire a pistol or crossbow in the heat of battle.\n\nIf you have enough ammunition this can change your combat style a bit.\nHowever it is quite tedious to use in the beginning.\nWithout proper training your will miss a lot, this has nothing to do with your personal skill however.\nIt is purely stat based, an enemy can stand point blank and you still will miss with your scatter pistol ( which is like a pumpgun in pistol form ).\nThere are only 2 components that matter : skill level with your desired dirty trick weapon and range.\n\n\nCRAFTING\n\nThe game offers an extensive crafting system.\nYou can Craft new weapons, repair broken legendary weapons which you can find in your adventures, craft rings and amulets, brew booze ( yay ) and alchemical tinktures.\nYou also can create your own spell-scrolls / rune stones.\nYou gather resources by picking them up ( herbs and so on ), ripping them out of defeated enemies ( requires hunting perks ), finding them in chests, or buying them at vendors.\n\n\nOVERALL GAMEPLAY\n\nThe game plays smooth, you can reach about everything you can see, there are few invisible walls that block you from reaching zones that you are not supposed to reach yet.\n\nI only got stuck once in the environment but could rescue myself with the parrot spell.\n\nCombat becomes boring fast, since its very basic. The old Gothic Combat system is far superior.\n\nQuest / Quest logs are sometimes confusing, leaving you wondering what to do next.\n\nThe game does not hold your hand much, which is nice.\nYou can get additional mini rewards by talking to people that had a part in a quest you completed\n\n","August 19, 2014","true","53.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Unfortunetly, this game is none of that.  The combat is separated into light and heavy attacks that look no different from each other, (Don't even get me started on the hilariously terrible idea of "heavy attack" in swordplay, but I'll spare you my historical rant).  Your light attacks feature a spinning flourish for every single attack except for one that leaves you completely open for counter attack from the VASTLY quicker and deadlier enemies that you face (even the pitifully tiny fish monsters at the start of the game).  Should you choose to string together attacks in a combo your strikes will become progressivly slower until the final strike where the enemy would sooner die from boredom while it waits for the attack. Dodgeing is neccissary but commically utilized, and the "parry" system is downright useless when compared to rolling around like an idiot with invincibility frames.  Secondary weapons are consumable and boring in excecution.\n\nBottom line for combat is that it's unintuitive, boring, and most importantly just not fun in any way.\n\nThen we have the story.  The plot takes after "video game trope A-4" in the fact that it does almost nothing new in its excecution.  Demon overloard was woken up from a nap and now he's cranky, as the player character only you can stop him because why not?  I will say that the distinction between reality and the spirit realm was entertaining for a momment before I realized it had no impact whatsoever on how I played the game.\n\nBottom line for plot is that it's only a background for tearing into new land for looting, no real significance to how you play the game.\n\nSound track isn't noteworthy, while it does serve as an adequate filler.\n\nAnimations are stiff and cringeworthy. Seems like they poured all of their budget into the spinny dance techniques the character employs in his swordplay.\n\nThe only reason I would ever have to want to play this game is the hear the protagonist swear at NPC's more.  It's actually really fun to  have a pirate as the protagonist because he has no obligation towards manners, which creates the  exceedingly rare vaguely pleasant momments in the game.\n\nFinal margin: the game is simply bad.  It's based around systems that are honestly not fun at all.  I bought this game when it was 75% off and only 8 or so Canadian Dollars, and I feel guilty for my idiocy.  I could have just bought a toy cutlass from the dollar store and had ten times the fun this sopping mess of a game gave me.

There is too much combat with the different monsters from the early beginning - the monsters are almost everywhere.  Also somehow it feels that the combat mechanism is much difficult to control than that of Risen and Risen 2 - parry doesn't seem to work as it should be in my mind. Also graphics look somehow ugly compared to the earlier games in this series, and the voice acting is terrible. The map is mainly the same as in Risen 2, but the area you can explore freely is  less than earlier.

Unfortunately I do not know if I will evr buy one of these games again.  I really like being able to fight mobs toe to toe and these games do not let you do that anymore.  All you will find yourself doing is letting you ally (thankfully you have one who follws youa round) beat stuff up for you while you roll in circles around your enemies.  Honestly it makes for very boring game play where you get to look at the fight while cartwheeling around and never actually get to take part.  The story is interesting and kind of fun to follow but the game play sucks.  So if you play games for story it isnt bad... If you play them for them for the whole experiance you should save your money for another RPG.\n\nI would like to note I had similar disappointments with Risen 2 and should have know better before I bought this.","January 4, 2015","false","6.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It has so much heart and character. The world just feels so deliberately crafted. Everything in the game world is placed with a purpose. This design choice deviates from the random events and occurrences in modern games like Skyrim, but brings to the table a feeling that this world was crafted with care and attention to detail. This, among other things such as the loot, craftable materials, varied jungles, caves, beaches, fortresses and more make exploration a real treat! My favorite location is Calador, a volcanic island with a massive waterfront fortress and green bonfires dotting the coastline. It really is a sight to behold!\n\nUltimately, this game is all about getting lost in the vast world and forging your own destiny! It's about exploring and finding all of the secrets and content packed into the game! it's about side quests, and loot, and character progression, and choice! The choice to pick a direction, any direction, and be confident that there will be something new to discover right around the next corner. It's about all of these things... and while the game certainly isn't perfect, it's definitely a rare gem in a sea of mainstream rpgs that all try to do the same thing over and over.\n\nIn short, if you're a Gothic/Risen fan, you know what you're getting into, and this is some of PB's finest work. You may love it, you may hate it, but I urge anyone who's on the fence to give it a shot! I hope you can find as much enjoyment in this game as I have so far.","August 13, 2014","true","12.9"," 31 of 67 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","31","67","0","0"

My fps is just fine but there is lag to the input and the movements are too large and clumsy to feel like anything but a clutz\nCombat is ♥♥♥♥. Partly related to movement and partly mechanics and timing of the attack/combo/parry system. Input is laggy and actions take too much time to have any feeling of fun, it feels like i'm sending orders to a wooden puppet stuck in molasses. Movement and dodging is so slow you can't react to anything you just have to guess if maaaybe the guy is going to attack in 5 seconds so you have enough time to start the animation. The only viable technique seems to be standing around in parry until the enemy finishes their animation so you can start yours.\nMaps are claustrophobic and feel fairly linear. Again, feels like an old mediocre xbox game that didn't have much memory to load bigger maps or display many polygons. You don't feel like you have much room to move around, and movement is so slow and clumsy it's a chore to run anywhere. The 'side' areas are just tiny branches with a few things on the ground to pick up off and then you are back on your one main path again.\nGraphics aren't that great. I like the style but the graphics feel dated. I'm running with everything on the highest settings possible and it'd still get beat by games 5 years older than it. C'mon, my computer can handle a few more polygons or foliage that doesn't look like abstract art.\nBad ui/controls/ai - Controls are super simple.. again feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port. You pretty much just spam mouse clicks everywhere to do anything.. which includes picking up gold or talking to your annoying ai companion. Just from the start I've already gotten sick of trying to pick up gold or something and constantly going into the short 'talk' action with the companion. Her sass gets old reaaaal quick.\nHorrible combat/non-combat modes - There are two basic modes.. combat where your controls are all for fighting, and non-combat for things like running around, interacting with the scene, looting and picking up stuff. And the animation to draw your weapon is laggy and slow as hell. What does this mean? You can either run around in non-combat mode so you can look for loot and stuff to interact with, and then when you get ambushed from nowhere on the tiny maps sit there getting ♥♥♥♥♥ until the monster gives you enough time to finish your draw weapon animation. OR, run around with your weapon drawn unable to loot anything. Awesome choices!\n\n\nPros: I don't really have any at the moment. I like the pirate/magic crossover. I haven't gotten far enough to experience many different skills so I'm really hoping those help provide a tiny bit of fun for the giant waste of money this has been so far.","October 25, 2014","false","6.1"," 29 of 63 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","29","63","0","1"

I dont know how could they implement such monsters again. Enemy will jump in your back from a distance.\n- Monsters everywhere! You cant even walk 3 meters without a fight, if you try to avoid it the enemy will simply rush you. yes they are faster and stronger than you.\n-The difficulty is bad balanced. You can pick between easy medium and hard. Difference is just less enemy damage and less enemy hp. They will still charge you and knock you down, over and over again.\n- The dialogs, it really feels like that the voice actors didnt do their job, but i actually know that many of them where in other games from this developer before. So i guess thats not their fault. My clue is that they simply didnt had have enough time to get into their roles.\n- Inventory..... Didnt they learn enything? I mean come on....

But it does not take very long to know that the fundamental mechanics of a game are flawed beyond repair.\n\nVoice acting is terrible. The first companion foisted on you is crass, annoying and being rid of her is a blessing. The second companion could not be a worse match for his voice actor if the developers had tried. Its really, really bad. And so is his acting.\n\nThe combat is...bad. I dont know why Block/Parry exists. Its useless against, well...everything. Literally, everything. A Chimp-sized monkey will break your block. On the first or second attack. Dodging is, well...time it right. Which is hard, since your character first has to throw his arms into the air theatrically in order to announce his dodge roll. And weapon strikes...I'm guessing the sword he is swinging weighs between 40 pounds and one metric ton, based on the speed with which he swings it.\n\nSome people will claim has the 'usual quirks' of a Risen title.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kozzy420/recommended/249230/","kozzy420","kozzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kozzy420/","478 products in account","PB games are NOT for everyone, the stories won't blow you away, the graphics are usually not up to par with current tech, the camera usually sucks and animations are some of the worst you will come across. Yet there is alot I enjoy with the games PB has made (Gothic 1-3 and Risen 1-3). Risen 3 is here and in my opinion it is the best of the series, Magic is back, melee combat is improved (you still have to go to trainers and learn new moves, improvements,etc.. Some of the series long lasting issues rear there head such as what I mentioned above with the terrible animations and a story that could be alot better). Risen 3 won't win Game Of The Year awards and probably not many RPG of the year awards either with games like Divinity Original Sin, Wasteland, Dragon Age and Pillars of Eternity out or coming out this year, it does have a good amount of issues but for me the good outweighs the bad and overall is my favorite PB game since the wonderful Gothic 2.\n\nThe overall combat is a nice improvement from Risen 1/2, you have the option to put points into skills with glory points you have gotten (from doing missions and killing enemies) and also training with trainers in towns for new moves like Parry, Pickpocket,etc.. These improvements help big time for things like combat,etc... Hit a trainer up for Parry, Speed and what ever type of sword you use (Slash, Sword or another) and you will be kicking ♥♥♥ in no time. This game does not hold you're hand, it is a very nice challenge, although not quite as hard as Risen 2. Combat is not perfect though, there are still some issues but bringing Magic back and improving the Melee abit has gone a long way. Far from a flawless game but a nice step in the right direction for PB, hopefully they can improve even more in this department for the next game.\n\nThe start of the game is a bit slow and can also be very tough, especially for new players. You're character has not leveled up and doesn't have any moves really other than a normal and a heavy attack. Get past the first little bit and things start to pick up quickly. You have lots of trainers to pick from and also a bunch of factions to pick from so make sure to use them. These games don't hold you're hand and you will feel overwhelmed at the start, just make sure to visit trainers and save often and you should be good.\n\nThe graphics are improved from Risen 1 and Risen 2, but its still inconsistent. Some of the landscapes, character faces and colors look gorgeous, while other things like buildings up close and animations are laughable. Although for me I dont expect top of the line graphics or animations from PB games, they are much more than just fancy graphics or animations. Sure I would love a Risen game on a Witcher engine or something (speaking of witcher, the devs said they have taken inspiration from the old Gothic games also made by PB, for there upcoming open world game Witcher 3), but this is a smaller dev team and atleast for me animations and graphics are last on my list. Still there are some spots where I was in awe of some of the beauty in the game, come over a mountain at night with you're torch and you will witness a beautiful scene.\n\nThe leveling up is very good and you have many options with how you want you're character to go. Want to do some thief aspects? Put tons of points into the categories that support pickpocketing and locksmithy when you level up and also go to some trainers and improve that way to. Also depending on what faction you join you will have access to unique things and missions (I joined the mages, which I am liking alot, especially there island, looks like Risen 1/Gothic style.\n\nThe audio and music overall is pretty good, the soundtrack is very good that really kicks in when you are exploring these wonderful levels. The voice acting for the most part is good, it ranges from poor to fantastic, but most are good I will say. The game also has the usual PB humor which I love (Divinity Original Sin also had some good humor to), and the dialogue in general is well done (few cheesy parts but would it be a PB game without a little bit of comedy?).\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of PB games is the exploration and scavaging and Risen 3 does these with flying colors. Each island is different from the last and while some of them are frmo Risen 2, they look completely different, this is the game Risen 2 should have been imo. Also the characters are great and interesting once again, where ever I go in the game I always meet characters that I enjoy talking to, some are funny, some are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and some are in the middle. In that sense the writing of the dialogue and characters is good but the writing of the story is not very good impressive.\n\nIt really comes down to what you think of PB games in general, yes it is an improvement over the first two games but it still has some of its long lasting issues that might throw some people off. But for me I am 30 hours in and having a blast, findng some new areas have me saying "Just another hour Kozzy". Risen 3 has been fun as all get out so far, but I don't expect everyone to enjoy this game.\n\nThe level design is also very well made, each Island I want to explore EVERY INCH. This is something alot of open world rpg devs need to take note of from PB. Sure there is alot of things they can do better, but they have exploring, level design and characters NAILED. What is next for PB? I would love another Gothic game with the improvements made in Risen 3 and hopefully even more improvements down the road. Weither its a new game on a new engine or another Risen or Gothic game I look forward to playing there next game.\n\nSure I wish we could have a new Risen game on a new engine with the best new tech, a better story and for them to keep improving the combat, but in the end I have had a blast and while it won't be my GOTY from a technical standpoint, it has given me some of the most fun ive had in all of 2014. Sort of like indie foreign flicks in the sense that they might not be the best from a technical standpoint as they don't have as much money or people working on the games as some of the big wigs, but they end up doing some aspects better, while some aspects are not as good.\n\nIn the end Risen 3 is a flawed gem that I recomend to anyone who enjoyed Risen 1, Gothic 1-3 to play, it is a nice mix of the old gothic games and Risen 1/2. Will I say it is better made than say Skyrim? From a design perspective, Hell no. What I will say though is that I have had much more fun on this game in 30 hours than I did playing Skyrim 80 hours. For me the characters are much more enjoyable, the exploration is much mroe rewarding, it is much more challening, I have had more FUN and I like the gameworld design better. If you can put up with a slow start, some terrible animations and a meh story, pick this up with the quickness, it is quite enjoyable.\n\nFor me this is the best overall PB game since Gothic 2, it is not as open as Gothic 3 and while Risen 1 was a blast, if we are talking best overall package I have to say this is my second favorite PB game. It definatly has its issues and it seems impossible for PB to nail everything perfectly, but I would be lying if I said I havn't been hooked to my computer since I got this game and that a few things have been a nice pleasent surprise. No its not GOTY material or better than the wonderful Divinity Original Sin that we got this year, but I have had a very fun time with Risen 3 so far, a flawed gem indeed. Not quite the masterpeice it could have been, but still my overall experience has been good to great.","August 15, 2014","true","69.6"," 29 of 64 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","29","64","0","1"

And i don't mean it's hard for n00bs... I mean this game is neither fun, nor enjoyable, the combat is way too simple, way too rigid, has horrible animations, and trying to do any damage to any enemy is impossible when one attack takes 3 seconds to pull off and an enemy can counter in .05 seconds. Parrying is useless, combos are useless, and shooting enemies right in their face, can miss. You can't target an enemy, you can't lock the camera, enemies can circle around you faster than you can respond. They can stun lock you, and even PAST all this, the gameplay is boring and slow as hell. Absolute garbage.

I decided to give this game a shot, however.  From the start, this game hit me in the mouth with a useless tutorial and console tard feel.  This game is a Riften 2 clone, and even more so catered to XBOX.  The story continues the timeline of the previous game, and pretty much copies the combat and magic system of its predecessor.  Which are terrible in my opinion.  The graphics and stability are much improved over Riften 2, however.  Which is a huge bonus because Riften 2 ran like crap on my NVidia 750TI on low resolution and low graphic settings.  This game runs on medium graphics and 1080p with no problem on my rig.  Even with the improved graphics, I found myself looking at identical user interfaces, level up system, and item system of Riften 2.  This, like the second Riften, is a Pirates of the Carribean, mash buttons until enemies die, waste of time.","June 26, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"

Not terrible, but nothing special to look at even on max settings.\n\nCombat is clunky and boring, I'm one for diffuiculty, but this is just frustrating.\n\nThe game is unclear to areas you should be going too. Dailogue is so bad an uninteresting, they try to spice it up with curse words.\n\n\nIt's not about them holding my hand, I went to the begining island after the intro chapter. I fooled around with getting some new gear at the shop and upgrading some skills. Even with these upgrades I would be 2-3 shot by an enemy.\n\nYou get a light attack, a medium attack, a cheap shot (your pistol), a parry and a dodge.\n\nLight attack- everything is faster than you, the chance of attacking and not getting hit at least a few times is slim. Wouldn't be a problem if I didn't die in a couple of hits.\n(Yes there are potions, but excessive prices and the amount of damage you take eats up your money fairly quickly)\n\nHeavy attack- needs to charge and is slow, 75% of the time the monster just jumps away from you and you miss.\n\nCheap Shot- This is kind of cool, but damage is weak and you only have a finite amount of ammo or throwing knifes.\n\nParry- this is useless most of the time, even an enemies light attack can break your guard and since most enemies double attack you get hit anyway. A parry is supposed to break the momentum of enemies opening them for an attack. This is a crappy block function at best.\n\nDodge- My least favorite mechanic, your recovery time almost always leads to you getting hit by a follow up attack or another enemy.\n\nYou end up just blocking and dodging waiting for your companion to kill things. I don't need to be the god of war, but I don't appreciate being a punching bag either.\n\nThe real draw back to the dialogue is the horrible animations, making it almost unbearable to sit through even a 30 second engagement.\n\nI'm sure the game gets better, but almost 2 hours in and I can't even stand to look at it anymore. Reminds me of two worlds, if you remember what that was like I would steer clear of this title.\n\nIn short I would not recomend buying this until it goes on sale and only if you are an older style rpg fan, or you really enjoy the series.","August 12, 2014","false","7.9"," 101 of 218 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","101","218","0","3"

Make no mistake, I get it. I get why they are such great games. Rewarding combat, memorable soundtrack, brilliant world design etc. but for me Gothic 3 Community Patched with Alternative AI and Balancing trumps the first two, and so does Risen 1.\n\nRisen 1's combat is probably the best combat in any similar RPG. The fact that it is possible (though very difficult) to beat the hardest enemies and NPCs with just your starting hero and a wooden stick, is a testament to its greatness. Memorising the enemy's tendencies and combat behaviour is very rewarding, and does not make the game too tedious later on even, as I doubt people will always remember the AI patterns perfectly and perfectly counter them.\n\nDungeons, baby. Dungeons. Brilliantly designed, extremely rewarding dungeons. Of course not too challenging, but you were always under the illusion that you were doing something fairly clever when levitating across lava to morph into a snail to use telekinesis on a lever. The illusion of being a gaming genius and treasure hunter, tomb raider.\n\nThe voice acting is brilliant too - Lena Headey as Patty was sublime and I wanted to have sex with her animated body. I couldn't have been the only one.\n\nAlso, memorable music from none other than KaiRo seals the deal.\n\nI could go on about Risen 1 and how underrated that game truly is, but alas we need to deal not only with the hits of Piranha Bytes, but also with the misses. In comes Risen 2.\n\n...\n\nWhat were they thinking? How...on earth could they have destroyed the combat so utterly. So profoundly. In the beginning there was no dodge either so to occassionally back away you resorted to this very awkward bunnyhopping. Eventually you realised how OP firearms were and just said ♥♥♥♥ it, let this game be over and done with. Moments of brilliance were seen with the rare use of Voodoo magic to complete some quests, and the beautiful world design. But the voiceacting was atrocious, in addition to the animations, music was forgettable and there were severe vegetation morphing issues (granted fixed by the community later on).\n\nI was very very disappointed.\n\nIn comes Risen 3. Combat still not as good as Risen 1, or even indeed the older Gothics, but it is passable. Music is almost memorable. World design is PB at its finest yet again, with so many levels intricately, hand-designed, with loot sparingly thrown into nooks and crannies waiting to be discovered. But the point is that it is good *enough*, it scratches that Gothic itch. The combat, though a lot more forgiving, will still punish you if you are lulled into a false sense of security due to your stats and weapons and magic. The graphics are gorgeous, especially when tweaked, looks better than many dx11 games, though art design plays an important part in this.\n\nWhat was my point? Enjoy Risen 3 for what it is - it is not Gothic 5, it is not the nameless hero (we know his name is Steelbeard after all), it is not surrounded by KaiRo's music, it is cross platform therefore dumbed down for console peasants, it is Piranha Bytes giving us the best they can whilst trying to earn a living (PC sales are usually a fraction of console sales), it is fun.\n\nOh, and remove those rosetinted nostalgia glasses once in a while and smell the coffee. It's time to move past decade old games.","August 28, 2014","true","45.0"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

There were few objectives other than just wondering around and not dying. The landscape didn't really change. The quests were repetitive.  And you played 99% of the game by yourself with no help from NPCs.\n\nRisen 2 made huge strides.  Suddenly you had objectives and travelling companions.  The NPCs were unique and interesting. I saw many of the elements that made KOTR, DAO Baldurs Gate and even Mass Effect great:  The concept of having a ship/stronghold and seeking out and finding NPCs to form a crew/party capable of taking on some monumental task.  In the process you visit different lands that showcase very different environments, keeping the game from getting boring.  At the end of the day, I can say that I would replay Risen 2 a second time, and that says a lot for a game.\n\nSo when I saw Risen 3, I bought it hoping for something at least as good and hopefully better than Risen 2. Sadly I was disappointed.  You are no longer playing as the same nameless protagonist that you played in Risen 1 and 2.  Instead you are playing as the brother of the protagonists love interest.  And instead of being educated and well spoken, like someone who could just as easily be a mage or a pirate, the protagonist is a typical pirate thug. One of the games themes is overcoming your thuggish nature...\n\nYou still have a ship. You still have to gather NPCs and you still get to visit different lands, but it is not fun playing a jerk. I figured there would be a reason why they forced this on me. A plot twist or something special about being related to Steelbeard that was key to the plot.  But it never happens. At the end of the game, I said to myself, "There is no reason I could not have been the protagonist from Risen 1 and 2".\n\nRegardless of the plot twists or other RPG elements they incorporate, this is one choice they take away from you is simply unforgivable. And since the love interest from game 2 is your sister, there is zero romance and flirting. An element that made most of the other big hit titles I mentioned so successful.\n\nSo no, I can't recommend this to people. Even if it was free, you are looking at wasting 40+ hours of your life that you will never get back.","September 24, 2014","false","60.6"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","12","33","0","0"

(Remember not to list specifics)\n- It's humor is not to your liking!\n- The graphics are disgusting! (It's like this game was low budget or something?

ALSO, there are no pros because this game did not impress me in any way; therefore, i did not find it important for me to say something like, "Yeah, this part wasn't totally bad", or "I guess they did this part okay-ish".\n\n\n\n\n\nI found this game to be a waste of $50.  I mean, the game looks and feels like a game i played back in 2003, and it's not even as good as that one.  Now, let me elaborate a bit on what i found to be bad about different parts of the game.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, the combat system. Absolutely awful combat; it feels like you're playing an RTS game(They attack, you block, you attack, they block or don't).  Not to mention the fact that it's nearly impossible to kill more than one enemy if you don't have a follower.  To sum this one up, the combat is, like i said earlier, an annoying RTS game.\n\nNext let's talk about the voice acting.  It's horrendous.  I mean, the way people talk makes it impossible for you to be immersed.  To sum this one up, you'd be better off using JUST the subtitles.\n\nAnd last, let's talk about the graphics.  Well, there isn't much to say about the graphics, seeing as they are pretty non-existent(that's an exaggeration, of course). But really, they are pretty awful-even on max to near max settings.\nTo sum this one up, the graphics are similar to that of a game made back in around 2010(Just an estimate)\n\nNow, to sum everything up, i would avoid this game unless you are a hardcore Risen fan that doesn't mind poor game development, or you just don't mind poor game development and think this game is fun.","August 12, 2014","false","1.4"," 48 of 119 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","48","119","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ruby_Rose_/recommended/249230/","Ruby_Rose_","RWBY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ruby_Rose_/","119 products in account","One of the best RPGs in recent years. Honestly I'm not sure to which game should I compare it, each Piranha Bytes game is its own experience, and I love them for that.\n\nI loved all games in Gothic series and I love all games in Risen series. From the Risen series, I would say that Risen 3 is probably the best one of them, even comparable to the golden Gothic 2.\n\nThe story of this game is solid, it is not the best, not the worst. I've been quite used to bad stereotype-like stories in RPGs (especially open world ones), like TES series, Two Worlds series, or Dragon Age series (in case of more linear ones). Each of these games suffer from black-and-white storyline (from the named ones I consider the plot one of the better ones).\n\nThe gameplay is typical for Piranha Bytes games. The combat system is something different, and very good (unless you just left-click all day long, which is a bad way to play this game and it can ruin your experience). It is better than in TES games, way better compared to Dragon Age series, but a lot worse compared to Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.\nIn this game you can actually dodge hits (which is very common in medeival fencing schools), but well, don't expect realistic fight simulator. But it is action enough, you won't get bored. Plus, guns are very good addition into the game.\n\nDialogue lines are well done, audio for them is also quite good. As for the quests, there is a whole lot of them, but I'd like more impact on game in general, and longer side quest lines. Music is one of the best, it perfectly suits the game.\n\nVisuals are also very good, very nice fire particles, water splashes and particle effects in general. The authors did quite a job on light and shadows, each single island is in a bit different stylized art set and it works perfectly. The graphics quality can compete with any other AAA game.\n\nOf course there are few things that look bad. One of them is, that after performing major actions to close gates to underworld, the islands look unchanged. For me, if green grass would return to that areas it would be perfect. I would see that I did some major impact on game world and it would made me even more happy.\nSecond thing is, I don't really see further lore connection with Risen series, yes it is in the same world, there are some of the characters that were in previous games, but the lore connection is weak. I'm comparing mainly to Gothic 1 - Gothic 2 games here, where the lore connection between those game was really strong and good.\n\nAnyways, this game is worth it. I know it seems average, it isn't. Don't believe metacritic, as some fans of older Piranha Bytes games are downvoting, without even playing it, sadly...","March 2, 2015","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I read a lot of reviews saying it was a Con and not a Pro and that scared me a bit but since it was half off I bought it anyway, and I couldn't be happier with it. The combat system is just a timing based system which requires that you read your opponent when battling them. I think that's cool and realistic really. You can riposte others attacks (turn their attack around on them) even to large monsters like golems n stuff which I think is cool, they're coming in with some massive smash attack and ur just like, NOPE *slap*. Great game. Sure I'm only 30 hours in but I think it's lovely. I'm currently a fire wizard dressed up all cool like, runnin around like prince Zuco, burning like 3-4 enemies at once, raining fire down upon my enemies! >:D and when fire doesn't work, LIGHTNING!! Anyway, if you're up for a fun single player RPG, this is a good pick.\n\nMy only Con: I wish games like these could be Co-op. (Divinity: OS and Dying light for example, also great games that are Co-op.)","March 2, 2015","true","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like you start as a homeless man and ends as a bilionaire. Yeah, at the end of the game you barelly lose health and deal a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of damage, it's nice to feel like that.\n\nStill , what more you have in this game? Nice quests, sometimes very interesting ones, very nice maps, and you are very rewarded when you explore, and theres loads of place to explore in this game. Also is nice to play a pirate rpg.\n\nWhat is not so nice or downright bad? Well, i like a nice story, and this aspect of the game is quite bad, the plot is bad... the protagonist is quite uninteresting, also the combat, it's good and bad at the same time, the enemies can stun lock you eating away your health crazily fast.\n\nSo... if you still reading this, you probably is a bit confused, it's a love or hate game, i hated some parts, still i think it's worth playing, it's nice to not be a viking , or a medieval warrior sometimes, and you'll be rewarded by getting good at the combat of this game. I had the same experience with Risen 2, and it feels weird, but also nice, and don't give up, it's much more hardcore than most games nowadays. I don't want to be an elitist, but having to earn something after working hard for it feel pretty damn good, and sometimes those old school games are right.\n\ntl/dr: just buy it in a sale and try, you'll learn a different kind of gaming.","September 10, 2015","true","54.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spot on. Genre leading in most instances.\nGraphics:  I played the Enhanced Edition.  Graphics were well done with the various environments.\nQuest / fetch:  If you like that sort of game, it’s done really well here.\nWorld is detailed and intricate and rewards the player for exploring\n\nMINUS:\nHorribad dialog.  Not voice acting, dialog.  Unfortunately, this can impede your immersion in the game.  Seems like such an easy area they could have addressed.\nQuest / fetch:  If you don’t like that sort of game, then Risen isn’t for you.\nGraphics.  Shouldn’t be possible to run up a tree then fall off and die.  Minor glitches.\n\nAVERAGE:\nVoice Acting.  I didn’t find the actual voices an issue, but as mentioned the script was painful at times.\n\nAcquiring items/loot:  First third of the game I didn’t like it, but as I played I appreciated the fact I had to actually “look” for items, instead of the usual acquiring by merely walking over them.  However, the drawback is I found myself constantly clicking for fear of missing something.  I liked that they didn’t dumb down exploring and finding items, but at the same time Important items can be easily overlooked.  As such, expect to find things occasionally in areas you’ve already combed over.\n\nCombat.  I hated it a first… until I figured it out, then it was okay.  Yes, I had moments of aggravation and/or camera issues, but it was the exception not the norm.  There are those that hate Risen combat but I’m not among them.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIf you’re the type of gamer who appreciates well-designed areas to explore--and likes getting rewarded for exploring with additional quests and loot, then Risen 3 is most likely right for you.  The Risen series seems to be a love it or hate if affair.  For me, I think Risen does just enough keep me playing each new installment, and number 3 is no exception.   It wouldn’t be RPG GOTY but it would garner a nomination and maybe even make runner up.  Piranha Bytes knows how to build beautiful worlds and design quests, now if only they were just as good when it came to creating stories and English dialog translation.\n\nThis review is from playing the PC version Enhanced Edition with the 3 DLC.  I recommend this game @ 75% off and get all the DLC.  It’s cheap now, and makes the game more complete.\n\nNon-spoiler tips:\nPay close attention to the map, the topography sometimes shows clues while exploring, Don’t forget to look up occasionally.\nGet monkey trainer and listen for other monkeys!\nYou may wish to choose a difficulty above normal otherwise you’ll have tons of spells and items to assist you that you’ll never need to use.  If you’ve ever played a Risen or Gothic game in the past, then strongly consider playing on Hard.  I would consider normal to be too easy for seasoned players.\nI read a few steam guides “what players needs to know” before playing and I’m glad I did.  I didn’t see them as spoilers but rather information that helped me get the most immersion from the game.  YMMV.","January 23","true","114.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get the RPG which are you are expecting from Risen 3, I actually really liked the story, the setting with the 3 main islands (and smaller islands) which had a distinct setting, the huge open World to explore, fight monsters, gain XP, increase your talents with trainers, hunt for treasure chests, win in Mini games, recruit companions... a lot to do.  What really makes this a typical Risen/Gothic game is the athmosphere, and the "dirty rough" dialogs, which work really well in German (likely not as good in English). The voice actors are excellent, and together with some really crazy and funny quests, they made me smile several times, and thats what I wanted to get.\nSo why not an even higher grade? Well first, the story is almost completely dissociated from the Risen 1+2, which is particularly wierd as you start with the "Girlfriend" from Risen2 as companion, but in Risen 3 she is your sister... the 2nd reason is the difficulty... its a bit too easy... and the monsters are not so different in strength anymore... in previous games, stronger monsters like Snappers can kill you in 2 attacks, and you have no chance to kill them... here, you can kill them from the start... which does not make you feel so much that you get stronger with time... and from ca. half-2/3 of the game, you kill everything without much fear of death...\nIn conclusion, Risen 3 is well suited for both veterans who want more of the same formula, but is also good for newcomers, as you dont need knowledge of previous games to enjoy this one.","January 27","true","86.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first glance the game swallowed me with its active environment.  You have the moving oceans, moving trees and grass, animals/vermin/creatures and colorful settings.  While the graphics of the environment was very good in my opinion, the character models did not feel on the same level. Titan Lords gave me a chance to play as a pirate.  With this comes the accent, sea monsters, ship battles and a lot of booty.  (The loot because as far as I know no other booty was obtainable.)\n\nThe games main characters voice annoyed me in every dialog.  Titan Lords is an easy game to play.  The combat felt over simplified.  Most of the beginning combat consists of parry/dodge and clicking one button to swing the weapon.  You do have a secondary weapon which is a ranged weapon.  From early on one of your goals is to join a faction.  This basically outlines what type of weapons and magic you will be learning.\n\nTitan Lords have several quests for you to check out.  By end game with all of my skills even though the game is easy, I felt like my character went from some lame pirate to the ultimate badass.  I had a lot of fun gathering alliances to overcome the shadow.  Get this game on sale if you love rpgs.","February 22","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

FPS does drop when everything is maxed out.\n+ Story is fine. At least I didn't forget what I was supposed to do, when playing this game only 1-2 times a week\n+ Minigames. Although simple, some of them are pretty fun to play.\n+ Exploration. The game always encourages you to look for something special that is hidden near by. It is a very rewarding experience\n+ Map design, overall pretty good and with a nice variety.\n\nNegative:\n- Combat. The most frustrating combat experience ever. I couldn't find any other game where combat experience was that bad. Controls have a lot of delay, some keys don't register so you have to mash the buttons multiple times to make sure it will. The overall dodge mechanic is just annoying and doesn't make the combat fun in any way. In fact, while you are dodging you are complete invulnerable to damage ? Batman Arkham series have shown what a good fun and fluit combat should be like, take notice Piranha Bytes !\n- AI. I don't even know if there is an AI in this game. Pretty much all the enemies just charge straight towards you, and go into attack/dodge cycle. Funny thing almost every single monster in the game behaves pretty much the same way, shouldn't there be a better variation of enemy AI, maybe ? Companions pretty much the same thing, while they do follow you, sometimes they just get stuck and become missing, or they go and run away from you, just to hit a monster. And why enemy AI always targets me first ? The fact that I have companions doesn't seem to matter to them.\n- Glitchy and buggy, for some reason the game kept crashing on me, I occasionally get stuck in the walls, enemies don't care and just go through them. Many other minor issues as well.\n- Difficulty spikes. In the beginning when you are going with melee, you are going to be destroyed a lot. In the end when you go with magic you are going to destroy everything so easily that game becomes extremely easy. Shouldn't there be a different difficulty curve, like easy in the beginning and harder in the end instead ?","October 24, 2015","true","63.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like you start as a homeless man and ends as a bilionaire. Yeah, at the end of the game you barelly lose health and deal a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of damage, it's nice to feel like that.\n\nStill , what more you have in this game? Nice quests, sometimes very interesting ones, very nice maps, and you are very rewarded when you explore, and theres loads of place to explore in this game. Also is nice to play a pirate rpg.\n\nWhat is not so nice or downright bad? Well, i like a nice story, and this aspect of the game is quite bad, the plot is bad... the protagonist is quite uninteresting, also the combat, it's good and bad at the same time, the enemies can stun lock you eating away your health crazily fast.\n\nSo... if you still reading this, you probably is a bit confused, it's a love or hate game, i hated some parts, still i think it's worth playing, it's nice to not be a viking , or a medieval warrior sometimes, and you'll be rewarded by getting good at the combat of this game. I had the same experience with Risen 2, and it feels weird, but also nice, and don't give up, it's much more hardcore than most games nowadays. I don't want to be an elitist, but having to earn something after working hard for it feel pretty damn good, and sometimes those old school games are right.\n\ntl/dr: just buy it in a sale and try, you'll learn a different kind of gaming.","September 10, 2015","true","54.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought for sure it would be an improvement over the previous two Risen games, or at least as good.  How long should you play a game that is boring and frustrating before throwing in the towel?\n\nSince I played a 30 hour game for about 10 hours, take that into consideration when reading this. I was not able to finish, nor would I ever want to. But I paid for it and did not really get my money worth.\n\nThe first Risen game was pretty straight forward, with a simple plot and simple combat with a small yet interesting island to explore. Risen 2 gave you a pirate ship and a crew and added some more complexity. I guess Risen 3 had to get more complicated, giving you too much to do, too many ways to do it, and too many places to go. The combat was sloppy in the first two games, but you were able to endure it and it didn't really get in the way of progress. In this game, the combat should have been cleaned up, but instead it is still clunky and it now gets in the way of progress. The low level enemies surround you and overwhelm you with interupting attacks.\n\nAfter 10 hours, I still felt like a weakling. The game starts off by taking all of your abilities away from you and leaving you with a crappy raft. You have to really work to get it back and it felt like a chore. I never did get my ship back, and I didn't want to grind my life away to get it. I never felt any sense of improvement from gaining experience and abilities. I basically felt like a helpless idiot wandering around an island getting killed by every single enemy I would encounter, doing fetch quests for the locals with little payoff. The game really is a chore. It should pay you to play it.","September 16, 2015","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Save often, the one who gave you a quest can die, as well as trainers, so you need to protect them.\n\nI think it's a great RPG, nice graphics, good voice acting and script (at least so far),  with lots of cool stuff you can do and I bough it at a discount so it didn't kill my wallet.","October 21, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

FPS does drop when everything is maxed out.\n+ Story is fine. At least I didn't forget what I was supposed to do, when playing this game only 1-2 times a week\n+ Minigames. Although simple, some of them are pretty fun to play.\n+ Exploration. The game always encourages you to look for something special that is hidden near by. It is a very rewarding experience\n+ Map design, overall pretty good and with a nice variety.\n\nNegative:\n- Combat. The most frustrating combat experience ever. I couldn't find any other game where combat experience was that bad. Controls have a lot of delay, some keys don't register so you have to mash the buttons multiple times to make sure it will. The overall dodge mechanic is just annoying and doesn't make the combat fun in any way. In fact, while you are dodging you are complete invulnerable to damage ? Batman Arkham series have shown what a good fun and fluit combat should be like, take notice Piranha Bytes !\n- AI. I don't even know if there is an AI in this game. Pretty much all the enemies just charge straight towards you, and go into attack/dodge cycle. Funny thing almost every single monster in the game behaves pretty much the same way, shouldn't there be a better variation of enemy AI, maybe ? Companions pretty much the same thing, while they do follow you, sometimes they just get stuck and become missing, or they go and run away from you, just to hit a monster. And why enemy AI always targets me first ? The fact that I have companions doesn't seem to matter to them.\n- Glitchy and buggy, for some reason the game kept crashing on me, I occasionally get stuck in the walls, enemies don't care and just go through them. Many other minor issues as well.\n- Difficulty spikes. In the beginning when you are going with melee, you are going to be destroyed a lot. In the end when you go with magic you are going to destroy everything so easily that game becomes extremely easy. Shouldn't there be a different difficulty curve, like easy in the beginning and harder in the end instead ?","October 24, 2015","true","63.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought for sure it would be an improvement over the previous two Risen games, or at least as good.  How long should you play a game that is boring and frustrating before throwing in the towel?\n\nSince I played a 30 hour game for about 10 hours, take that into consideration when reading this. I was not able to finish, nor would I ever want to. But I paid for it and did not really get my money worth.\n\nThe first Risen game was pretty straight forward, with a simple plot and simple combat with a small yet interesting island to explore. Risen 2 gave you a pirate ship and a crew and added some more complexity. I guess Risen 3 had to get more complicated, giving you too much to do, too many ways to do it, and too many places to go. The combat was sloppy in the first two games, but you were able to endure it and it didn't really get in the way of progress. In this game, the combat should have been cleaned up, but instead it is still clunky and it now gets in the way of progress. The low level enemies surround you and overwhelm you with interupting attacks.\n\nAfter 10 hours, I still felt like a weakling. The game starts off by taking all of your abilities away from you and leaving you with a crappy raft. You have to really work to get it back and it felt like a chore. I never did get my ship back, and I didn't want to grind my life away to get it. I never felt any sense of improvement from gaining experience and abilities. I basically felt like a helpless idiot wandering around an island getting killed by every single enemy I would encounter, doing fetch quests for the locals with little payoff. The game really is a chore. It should pay you to play it.","September 16, 2015","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a vain effort to keep both "open world" and no "bethesda style monster scaling" they made a game where after you complete a third of it, there is no longer any challenge at all from even the most powerful opponents.

I am not the type to disregard the possible fun and exciting game play simply because the graphics aren't up to snuff by todays or even the standards of 5 years ago.  To be honest I think the games today are focused way too much on graphical appearance and feel and not enough on story and plot development, or character development.  A good backstory can`t be overlooked simply because a game requires a quad-core i7 processor.\n\nThe UI is well done in my opinion and has just about everything one could hope for, and the companions or crew don`t require any micro managing.  I think the idea of massing a crew for a big ship is a splendid plot device though i`m slightly disappointed in only having one companion at a time.\n\nI thoroughly recommend this game to anyone looking for a change from current rpg game types, and most definitely for old time gamers such as myself who appreciate games like this and still play the oldies but goodies.","January 14","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spot on. Genre leading in most instances.\nGraphics:  I played the Enhanced Edition.  Graphics were well done with the various environments.\nQuest / fetch:  If you like that sort of game, it’s done really well here.\nWorld is detailed and intricate and rewards the player for exploring\n\nMINUS:\nHorribad dialog.  Not voice acting, dialog.  Unfortunately, this can impede your immersion in the game.  Seems like such an easy area they could have addressed.\nQuest / fetch:  If you don’t like that sort of game, then Risen isn’t for you.\nGraphics.  Shouldn’t be possible to run up a tree then fall off and die.  Minor glitches.\n\nAVERAGE:\nVoice Acting.  I didn’t find the actual voices an issue, but as mentioned the script was painful at times.\n\nAcquiring items/loot:  First third of the game I didn’t like it, but as I played I appreciated the fact I had to actually “look” for items, instead of the usual acquiring by merely walking over them.  However, the drawback is I found myself constantly clicking for fear of missing something.  I liked that they didn’t dumb down exploring and finding items, but at the same time Important items can be easily overlooked.  As such, expect to find things occasionally in areas you’ve already combed over.\n\nCombat.  I hated it a first… until I figured it out, then it was okay.  Yes, I had moments of aggravation and/or camera issues, but it was the exception not the norm.  There are those that hate Risen combat but I’m not among them.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIf you’re the type of gamer who appreciates well-designed areas to explore--and likes getting rewarded for exploring with additional quests and loot, then Risen 3 is most likely right for you.  The Risen series seems to be a love it or hate if affair.  For me, I think Risen does just enough keep me playing each new installment, and number 3 is no exception.   It wouldn’t be RPG GOTY but it would garner a nomination and maybe even make runner up.  Piranha Bytes knows how to build beautiful worlds and design quests, now if only they were just as good when it came to creating stories and English dialog translation.\n\nThis review is from playing the PC version Enhanced Edition with the 3 DLC.  I recommend this game @ 75% off and get all the DLC.  It’s cheap now, and makes the game more complete.\n\nNon-spoiler tips:\nPay close attention to the map, the topography sometimes shows clues while exploring, Don’t forget to look up occasionally.\nGet monkey trainer and listen for other monkeys!\nYou may wish to choose a difficulty above normal otherwise you’ll have tons of spells and items to assist you that you’ll never need to use.  If you’ve ever played a Risen or Gothic game in the past, then strongly consider playing on Hard.  I would consider normal to be too easy for seasoned players.\nI read a few steam guides “what players needs to know” before playing and I’m glad I did.  I didn’t see them as spoilers but rather information that helped me get the most immersion from the game.  YMMV.","January 23","true","114.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get the RPG which are you are expecting from Risen 3, I actually really liked the story, the setting with the 3 main islands (and smaller islands) which had a distinct setting, the huge open World to explore, fight monsters, gain XP, increase your talents with trainers, hunt for treasure chests, win in Mini games, recruit companions... a lot to do.  What really makes this a typical Risen/Gothic game is the athmosphere, and the "dirty rough" dialogs, which work really well in German (likely not as good in English). The voice actors are excellent, and together with some really crazy and funny quests, they made me smile several times, and thats what I wanted to get.\nSo why not an even higher grade? Well first, the story is almost completely dissociated from the Risen 1+2, which is particularly wierd as you start with the "Girlfriend" from Risen2 as companion, but in Risen 3 she is your sister... the 2nd reason is the difficulty... its a bit too easy... and the monsters are not so different in strength anymore... in previous games, stronger monsters like Snappers can kill you in 2 attacks, and you have no chance to kill them... here, you can kill them from the start... which does not make you feel so much that you get stronger with time... and from ca. half-2/3 of the game, you kill everything without much fear of death...\nIn conclusion, Risen 3 is well suited for both veterans who want more of the same formula, but is also good for newcomers, as you dont need knowledge of previous games to enjoy this one.","January 27","true","86.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was REALLY excited about the game and payed a good price for it.. then boom.. 10 minutes in your rediscover motion sickness and struggle to pull a lever for 10 minutes because you can't have your sword drawn and act as a functional human being.  I feel like a pirate on disability because you run into heat of battle against a rabit and struggle like a dog.  To strike down this epic creature you have to raise your sword high above your head, stand on one foot, close on one and bring it crashing down on the nearest rock because by the time you get a swing out the creature will either (a) already eaten you alive or (b) moved over one inch which made the 3-5 seconds of sword wielding above your head useless.  Blocking is even worse or nonexistance depending how you look at it.  So while your buying running around like a 4 year old yielding a paper roll tube trying to beat up monkeys and playing the 'put your sword away to pickup a coin.. o wait there is another monkey.. get it out, and put it away, but lets look at this so put it away.. o that might be a monkey pull it out crap you will quickly get frustrated with this par-looking game to start with and wonder why you waste your time with developers like this one who can't master the art of smooth game play.","December 29, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is basically the same world as Risen 2. The story is pretty decent, the combat is fine, and the quests aren't repetitive. Considering RPGs, the quests are pretty unique and never felt stale. It took me 30 hours to play through doing almost all of the side quests, so it is a nice size.\n\nThere would be decent replay value if you wanted to try a mage, a swordsman, or a rifleman. The different factions offer replay value too. I don't think the game world is compelling enough to warrant a second go at the story, but I can see some reasons one might.\n\nI'd recommend it mainly because I heard a lot of negativity surrounding it, and I found it to be solid. It's not a great game, but it is a good game. Well worth your money if you have played others in the series.","June 23, 2015","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, they're somewhat campy and are nothing to write home about for the combat system, but the world it creates and the stories behind it rival almost any RPG.  Risen 3 makes a nice combination of the first two to crate what I think is the best game in the series so far.  Graphics are solid, voiceovers are comically approrpriate, and character customization is the best it's been.  8/10.","June 28, 2015","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
