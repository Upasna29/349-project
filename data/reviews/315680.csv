Could there be most explanations and effects for each upgrade I do? please put some undo buttons. The keyboard is dead. I played it like 15 minutes and I am already fed up with it. Please! somebody needs doing some major work here. Zoom-out is impossible and the auto-camera changes made me feel dizzy, why the fuss? Just allow the user the change the camera as they wish.\n\nWould I recommend this game, No, not at this stage. 13-08-2014","August 13, 2014","false","3.5"," 52 of 65 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","52","65","0","0"

The keypad doesn't work, left-click and right-click don't work.... major problems. What is a dancing arrow supposed to mean exactly?\nThere's no in-game help accessible, and no idea how to get to the controls. I had to use Ctrl+Alt+Del to exit.

As far as I can tell all units have the same effectiveness against each other unit. Enemy units that are stationed near fences appear to get a bonus against ranged attacks regardless of their position towards the archer. Let's say an enemy's flanks are exposed and you were to use your archers, you would still do little damage as they're considered protected by adjacent fences.\n\nTL;DR\nThe game suffers from Mobile platform's limitations and is barely suited to PC.\n\n\nAgain the game is fun and I quite like the magic system even though it could use more depth. It would be great if you could practice spells whilst not in battle. The game has its merits but as long as these issues are not addressed I couldn't in good conscience recommend this game. An added option of saving the game and having save games wouldn't be to shavy either.","May 5, 2015","false","3.2"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","32","46","4","0"

Draw a really ridiculously hard arrow on the screen in order to use this one spell to kill the skeleton.  Quit after 10 minutes of trying.  NO help on the forums, no help in game, and you can't escape the first combat to move on!  You just sit there frusterated.    Graphics are beautiful, but with no option to do anything but scribble on a screen and your mouse movements don't even stay on the screen to help.  NOR is there a "hey you've been trying this shape for quite a while, new shape?  Or even better, would you like a guide?"\n\n","September 15, 2015","false","0.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","13","18","4","1"

Basically is like an HOMM game where you buy units, explore, collect gold, kill enemies and repeat the cycle. But at the moment there is no loot system, so you always find only gold. Also it seems you are stuck with a certain type of units (3) and can't recruit / find different units, but this could be just at the beginning and heroes could change later in the game.\n- The camera is fixed, I don't really see the purpose. In certain situations will move in a completely different angle while you are walking making you lose where you were going (add on top of this that there is no map)\n\nThe good sides:\n- The spell system is the thing that distinguishes this game from the others. You have to draw the lines on your screen and then select the enemies. Faster you are, stronger is the spell. If you don't remember a spell sign, you can always select it from the spellbook but this will make it less powerful. I did not really notice so much difference, but probably with stronger spells and more balanced game in future this will be more noticeable.\n- It's really simple and for this price the final edition of the game can fill the void while waiting for your next favourite AAA game\n\nI will play a little more later and update the review and keep looking for updates to see the progress, I'd recommend this game only to people in search of something different and willing to give some trust to developers. But before that, please look at their pages and what they have to say and if you agree or less with them and if they are going to fill the gaps already mentioned in this and other reviews. I don't feel like this is a tablet game, can have his say even on a PC.","October 19, 2014","true","0.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","14","22","4","0"

Everything else? Well, let's just say that it's not worth the $9.99 full price and that I'm glad I got this off Humble store for SUPER cheap!\n\nThe graphics look dated, the camera and movement controls are frustrating, the intro is brief, but uninformative; the story is vague and unengaging, the dialogue: atrocious.\n\nActual battle game play seems better suited to tablets and touch devices. Though I had no problem using it, I can see how some people may have had problems drawing spells with speed and accuracy. This game should be made into an iOS and Android app that supports multi-touch.\n\nIn general, this feels more like an unfinished idea that needs fleshing out and a graphics overhaul. Great Idea, but not engaging enough, not polished enough, and costs too much.","February 5","false","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
