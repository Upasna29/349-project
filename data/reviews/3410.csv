It reminds me of the days when I used to go down to the Council Library and play for an hour (as you had 1 hour timeslots). I loved this game as a kid, and not just this 1, but many other Popcap titles. Popcap Games are really good singleplayer games, probably some of the best offline games I've played, highly recommend them!","June 28, 2014","true","1.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Easy to learn, "plug & play" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.\nAWESOME ARCADE!","September 14, 2012","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a lot of stuff to blow up and the action can get pretty hectic. Some basic upgrade paths allow you to improve your tank between levels. But, it feels like a Flash game with mediocre controls. Controller support with dual analog sticks would make it more enjoyable for me. After playing the first few levels, it didn't grab me, and I had no desire to go back to it later.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snaekie/recommended/3410/","snaekie","Neo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snaekie/","430 products in account","Heavy Weapon is a well conceived shooter with nice cartoonish art style and presentation, which gets a bit too repetitive for its own good. Opting for flat terrain and repetitive scrolling backgrounds perhaps was not the greatest decision in light of the limited enemy variety presented towards the end of the game where everything starts to feel rather redundant. Still, in short spurts Heavy Weapon can be good fun and is a nice diversion once in a while from more thought intensive games; however despite this fact I do not reccomend this game, it gets boring very quickly and for the $10 spent you can get plenty other way better games.","November 27, 2013","false","5.2"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","12","30","0","0"

You are basicly on the only soldier out on the field and must help pervail through a war. You must drive your tank for 9 maps with only 2 live against who knows how many planes.

You even run into planes dropping WARHEADS AT YOU.\nI beat this game once but then there a major turn. All bosses were copies so you must do another 9 maps which I cant beat.\n\nAs for the dislikes :( The music is always the same each map.  Orginally made for Windows Xp and below. I use a Windows 8 and the game can barely keep up with my video card. Upgrades get boring after a while. And onyl other mode than Campaign is Survival. But over all I give this game a 8.5 out of 10.
