Rather, it is advised to stick to the shadows as much as possible. I did not know this, and so had a very troublesome first few hours of gameplay.\nIn Thief, you steal things. That is because you are a thief. When you steal things, they belong to you, and so you can sell them to people and get money to buy other things that make stealing things easier. With this unique system in place, you can achieve a near-constant cycle of owning and disowning various objects in the game world. It is systems like these that contribute much of the immersion to Thief: Not Really Deadly Shadows.\nYou can posess a myriad of useful tools, like a knife. That is sharp, and so it can be used to stab guards, often causing them to die. While to some, like the guards, this may be seen as unhelpful, for a thief, it is actually quite useful.\nWith well thought-out game systems, a very well implemented loot ownership gameplay style, and the ability to own things, I highly recommend this game with something like a 7 or 12 out of 10.\n\nTestimonies:\n"I would own this any day of the week, and you should too"\n"This is fun"\n"I love owning things"\n"I love disowning things"\n"I would disown this game just to reown it"","October 23, 2013","true","10.4"," 794 of 885 people (90%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","90","794","885","74","47"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowsun/recommended/6980/","slowsun","Pepé","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowsun/","114 products in account","One of the greatest stealth games I have ever played. Not for everyone, because this game is extremely challenging and immersive.\n\nStealth is valued highly and resources are scarce. One of the great features about this game is the Arrows that the player (Garrett) utilizes. You can decide for example, to use one of your precious Water Arrows to remove a light source, allowing you to navigate difficult areas.\nThe Blackjack club Garrett has within his arsenal can kill and must be used from behind to render an opponent unconscious, but beware, for the other NPC's will come looking for them!\n\nKilling opponents is a bad idea, knocking them out requires you to hide bodies, light is your enemy and there is quite a good amount of free roam away from the storyline. Breaking into random houses is great fun and if you are careful and plan your robbery ahead you can walk away with a hefty load of swag!\n\nIn saying this, the storyline is intense, the only weak points coming from the Hammerites lore and the lengthy tutorial at the start of the game, however it can be argued that this tutorial is essential, as the game plunges you immediately into the action.\nThe graphics have aged fairly well and the environments the player finds themselves in are beautiful. There are guides to improve the graphics quality/resolution via the community if you so choose.\n\nOne of the things that I have heard so many negative comments on regarding Thief: Deadly Shadows is it's difficulty. The difficulty settings in my opinion are quite realistic, considering you do have a magic eye, high tech arrows and an assortment of tools a modern day criminal would die for, coupled with the fact that this game punishes you severely for breaking stealth.\nI have also heard negative comments about the bugs within the game. These glitches have a minor detrimental impact to gameplay and some are even quite hilarious.\n\nPlay this and see where Dishonoured got all it's positive traits from. Thief: Deadly Shadows is a far superior game to Dishonoured (I cannot stress that enough) and if you enjoy stealth games, then this is one game you should add to your collection.","December 27, 2013","true","0.4"," 93 of 104 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","93","104","0","0"

Rich atmospheres made up of moody and at times very unsettling tones allow one to easily lose oneself in the game world--if he/she can look past its quirks and dated visuals (part of the charm, imo). However, players looking for a challenge will be sorely disappointed as even the "expert" level AI is downright moronic--and laughably so. No surprise that newcomers might be put off in comparison to 2014's Thief (a flop of extremely linear proportions and objectively the most stripped-down of the Thief titles).\n\nEnter the unofficial Sneaky Upgrade patch and mods like Thief 3 Gold. All of a sudden, this already engaging stealth-action gem surges to new heights. With a few simple tweaks, Garrett's once mind-numbingly haphazard pickpocketing sprees will further require careful timing as the City Watch is sure spot Garrett's beady eye in the dark before the player can shout "Azkaban".\n\nPlayers who are itching to spar and dance once more with the Hammerites or Pagans should prepare for a swift, widescreen cocktail of ♥♥♥ disease and updated HD textures to the forehead, and anyone craving the challenge of loot detection/completion as experienced in Thief 1 & 2 (or the option to display the classic Thief HUD) may rejoice, for it is possible to do exactly that and more! Enable Sneaky patch's most punishing (aka realistic) tweaks and play on expert. I DARE you.\n\nFrom the perspective of someone who's childhood was largely made up of Thief 1 and 2, Deadly Shadows in its patched form is arguably the best and most well-rounded entry in the series and it is now more accessible than ever.\n\nPS for those who are wondering: The Shalebridge Cradle chapter is deeply unsettling as ever, sending modern jump-scare titles like Outlast to bed with the lights on.","September 11, 2015","true","112.6"," 62 of 65 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","62","65","7","1"

I have fought and vanquished the best and brightest of the local law enforcement, defeated fanatic cultists from two opposing sides of one very dysfunctional religion, purged the city of its infestation of undead creatures, crushed hulking golems of stone into nothing more than dust, to be carried away with the wind and forgotten forever, listened in on every private conversation, and crawled all over every inch of every brick or stone wall in the city like an insane, murderous spiderman with sticky fingers.(pun not intended, but enjoyed nevertheless) I feel a sense of accomplishment having completed the series, but also a sadness and longing because I know that Looking Glass is no more and Sony now owns Garrett the Master Thief's soul, and copyright. I only hope that Sony will one day let him die with dignity, and then toss his lifeless body into a cuddle puddle in a dark corner just like he did with so manyguards who had the poor fortune to be working when he was stealing everything they were supposed to protect. I will miss the Master Thief, even now I find myself dragging out this review, because once I hit "post" I know he'll be gone forever,(or at least until I upgrade to a pc that can actually run Thief 4) but I must sleep now, for it is 4:30 am and I have to be up around... let's say 1 pm... you know, for lunch.

"Oh well" ran through my head, and i started up a new game.\n\nEntering my first Thief level was like visiting an alien planet. I was confused about controls, things seemed wonky, guards pathfinding was a joke to me, hiding in a sliver of a shadow (in plain sight) wasnt right to me, and then... well...\n\nI went sneaking like a snake through Lord Ember's castle, knowing only of his family dispute and a valuable gem that was kept in the basement. When i first got there, i hid behind a cart for 20 minutes wondering if i could ever move and if i did, what friggin button threw a flashbang. After mashing my entire keyboard and deducting that it was the 'I' button, i moved on in wonder and awe of the Amnesia-esque enviroment that surrounded me. Slowly learning the ropes, i died to a guard carrying a torch, when i thought i could distract him with a loaf of bread to the face, lesson learned.\n\nEvery guard was a puzzle to solve, and every treasure was a wonderful reward. Sneaking around in this game has been the most fun and soul-searching experience i've ever had, and i've only completed the first level. I havent even touched on the "open" world yet.\n\nWhile the graphics are outdated and there are some issues with the settings, it still made me enjoy myself.\n\nMinor bugs, yes.\nToo many loading screens, yes.\nI've heard tale of a mod that fixes those things, but i havent tried it yet.\n\nMy conclusion: Definitely worth every penny.\nI look forward to beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.","December 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","98","41","42","11","0"

When it came out, the general consensus was that it wasn't as good as the first two Thief games, but I felt it rightly earned its place within the saga.\n\nWhat stands out the most about Deadly Shadows is its immersion. From the beginning I found myself intrigued with the world presented in the game, and the rich lore that serves as the backdrop. Taking place in a dark, Dickensian fantasy world, Deadly Shadows pits the new world order of the steampunk "Hammerites" against the ancient and magically luddite-like "Pagans". With different factions vying for power and for the services of the main character, Garret, the stage is set for plots, intruige, double-crosses, and a whole lot of sneaking. The story grabbed hold and sunk its (Sometimes terrifying) teeth in deep.\n\nI can only hope that the next game in the series, simply titled "Thief", will live up to its predecessors; like Deadly Shadows did.","January 2, 2014","true","22.9"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","37","38","0","2"

You are Garrett and you have to find out what the Prophecies of the Keepers are. Because you are a Master Thief, the keepers use your abilities to steal certain items which involves the prophecy.\n\nThe game is a first/third person stealth game where you can roam around the city. Steal from houses, pickpocket random people on the street and do whatever you can to get money, between missions. It all feels quite alive in all the small areas of the city and it's always fun to find new routes or hiding places from the guards as you bag all them precious stuff.\nThe people talk to each other, saying Good evening or bugger off as they walk by. Making it feel like a should be.\nMissions are done in special areas where you can't get in when you are just roaming though.\n\nHowever, I said hiding. Though in this game you can hide from a guard who spotted you in a shadow that is about 1 meter away. The AI isn't the smartest around. Once a guard killed a, what I think was a bandit, and when he walked passed it 15 seconds later, he wondered how there could be a corpse on the ground and directly want to scan the place for enemies.\nWhich in most cases, is the player because well...nothing is as suspiscious as wearing a black hood.\nBut even in missions, I once had an AI regularly walking and suddenly fall to her death, alerting everyone in the area.\n\nI think that has to be the worst and maybe the only real problem of this game as the other thing that springs into my mind, is how awfully bad the physics system is. Bad but a good kind of bad. Everytime you will be amazed at how bodies go there way in this game.\n\nBut other than that, this game is a wonderful game. The story is interesting, the difficulty gradually gets higher as the game goes and the level design is just wonderful. Especially props to 1 certain level which could've been a stand alone horror game. *Shivers*\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game for it's story, gameplay and level design.

Some of my favorite in the series.\n\n+ Given a choice of what order to accomplish certain levels.\n\n+ The stealth in the game is top notch and find just the right balance between realism and fun. For the most part if you get seen or heard it was your own fault.\n\n+ Great story, dialogue  and voice acting\n\n+ Certain levels have a haunting atmosphere, if you love horror certain levels in the game really fit that criteria.\n\n+ Great conclusion to a great series.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- loading times. This game suffered from the 'console sydrome' that was prevelant during that time period and thus levels were split into smaller chunks. Loading time can be a nuasance.\n\n- The game's objectives especially outside of main missions are unclear at times. Often times you will be searching for what you need to do when it should be more obvious.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is my favorite game in the series, although most would disagree, I find the game really refined the elements of the series in one cohesive package. I loved the story and the levels and the lead up to the finale. I found the level design in Thief 1 and 2 although good, to be too big for their own good leading to a very disorganized level design.  Thief 3 is a game worth checking out no matter what the price is.\n\n","September 2, 2014","true","14.0"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","34","36","0","1"

However, Thief: Deadly Shadows proved itself a firm favourite and true classic on my list (I owned the game on disc when it was first released but had to re-purchase on Steam so it was compatible with my current PC). It's true that the graphics are now very obsolete compared to more modern titles - but it has been around for over ten years! - and I still have fond memories of exploring, stealing, sneaking, and eavesdropping.\n\nGarrett is perhaps one of the most memorable game characters and superbly voice-acted by Stephen Russell. Garrett's real strength lies, not in combat, but stealth, utilizing the shadows, and on occasion render troublesome guards unconscious with the blackjack. He's also in possession of dagger, although players favouring more a killing nature doesn't really have much bearing on the gamelay as it did in, say, Dishonored.\n\nThe levels themeselves are extensive and credible; compulsive explorer players may desire to linger and search these sandbox-style maps to the full in order to collect 100% treasure. Such ill-gotten valuables are then sold to a fence and money can purchase useful tools and items to help Garrett in his adventures: flashbombs can be deployed in sticky situations, water arrows extinguish torches, oil flasks can cause guards to slip, noise arrows distract and misdirect guards....and many others handy for certain tight situations. The City itself is divided into several districts and offers a few (but not many) distractions from the main story; regarding side-quests, Deadly Shadows isn't on par with Deus Ex: Invisible War (even though they shared the same engine) and Garrett can only break and enter into about a dozen buildings, only a couple of which contain prized treasures. One particular level stands out as a ground-breaking piece of atmospheric story-telling: the chilling Shalebridge Cradle was regarded as a tidemark by Thief fans and became famous within gaming circles. The hairs on my neck stood on end thoughout the entire level!\n\nBut there are a couple of niggles: one of which that Garrett can't swim despite it being possible for him to fall into water proved a frustrating possibility. With later games catering to more aquatic-capable characters, such as Deus Ex, Assassin's Creed II onwards, GTA San Andreas, Dishonored,  even the recent Thief title,(sometimes swimming was actually an option or requisite to a particular mission in these games), here Deadly Shadows stumbles on the credible side. Alternatively, I would have preferred an 'invisible forcefield' keeping Garrett safe on the pier. Admittedly, not entirely plausible for world immersion, but less frustrating. Another annoying gameplay issue would be broadhead arrows: these things should be lethal - yet, once alerted, sometimes it took about four of them to kill a guard. I can understand one wound enraging an enemy, but surely a second would cause them to have second thoughts and retreat hastily from the scene? It would have been more fun and plausible having a bloodied guard stumbling about alerting colleagues, forcing Garrett into hiding once more.\n\nThe main story itself concerns an imminent period of darkness about to engulf the City. It's up to Garrett to explore locations in a bid to uncover clues and fulfil counter-measures in order to prevent this from happening. Cutscenes are excellent affairs explaining the plot as it thickens and motives behind each mission. Garrett himself (Stephen Russell) regales the player with a determination, as if talking to himself but steadying the nerves.\n\nAlthough an old game, it's one that has aged well for veteran gamers with fond memories, and guaranteed to return now and again to sample such a fine brew.","October 11, 2014","true","67.1"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","33","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/6980/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Thief: Deadly Shadows is the final installment of the original trilogy of Thief games. It runs on a new engine from the previous two games, and so things work a little differently, this time around.\n\nThe first thing you'll probably notice is the updated graphics, and the second is the fidgety movement. Deadly Shadows has the ability to be played from a third-person perspective, but unlike, say, Oblivion, it seems as though the third-person control was built *first*. As a result, Garrett jitters a bit when starting and stopping movement, and you can see your hands and legs as they actually are, and not, like with many first-person games, as two sets of limbs apparently growing directly out of your face. Of course, you get used to this after a couple missions, though you won't necessarily get used to occasionally seeing things in your hands at the side of your screen when you turn too quickly.\n\nI jumped several times when carrying bodies, all the way from the first mission to the last.\n\nThere are ten missions this time around, as opposed to Thief Gold and Thief II's fifteen a piece. To make up for this, The City serves as a free-roamy hub area where you can thief around for additional loot, sell whatever loot you're carrying, and buy supplies for future missions. There are also main story objectives to complete, along with optional side quests should you seek them. Missions themselves are shorter, owing to the smaller level designs - undoubtedly a result of the engine change and graphical makeover. The relatively small levels are then chopped into even smaller segments with load screens in the middle. While it's, again, something you'll easily get used to, it does occasionally make building layouts seem a bit odd when thought of as a whole.\n\nThe enemy AI has been improved. Guards will notice bloodstains on the floor, doors which should or shouldn't be open, and other guards missing from their posts. On normal difficulty, however, Deadly Shadows is much easier than Thief II (which was, in turn, far easier than Thief Gold). Series veterans looking for a challenge will absolutely want to play through on hard or expert. The difficulty of levels never really increases much over the course of the game (indeed, the toughest level for me was the third or fourth one I played). Though later in the game the hub world does take a couple difficulty spikes, by the final third I was carrying the maximum amount of all available equipment, with more than enough cash left over to replace anything I might use by the end.\n\nSpeaking of the end, all difficulty aside, the finale felt appropriate enough to earn a mention, here. The final level is a perfect fit for a game about burglary, and the final sequence is a perfect fit for this specific game about burglary. Even the ending cutscene wraps the series up nicely, allowing me to walk away feeling very pleased with my time spent with the series as a whole.\n\nThere are some other notable differences, here and there. There are now factions, so you can ally yourself with or against the Pagans and/or Hammerites. Levels now have loot-collecting requirements based on the difficulty you are playing on. Darkness is blueish, rather than stark black, so you can see what you're doing easier. Also it looks prettier, if you're into that (especially with the shafts of moonlight which pour in from any window they can). Lockpicking is now a little more involving. You have to get closer to knock people out, now. Stabbing requires closer quarters, as well, as Garrett now carries a dagger instead of a sword. And there's now a large emphasis on the Keepers' use of glyphs, which seem a little out of place when there was no mention of them even being a thing in previous installments.\n\nThe differences take some getting used to, but I urge you to keep playing until you do. Thief: Deadly Shadows is a worthy addition to the franchise, and once you're steady on your thief legs it's every bit as fun as the previous games. So get settled in, plug in your favorite pair of headphones, and let's take a walk on the Thief side.","November 10, 2013","true","23.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Instead of simply going on to the next mission after completing one, you go back to the city. Here you can do everything from purchasing arrows and equipment, to stealing from the citizens, to picking on the guards.\n\nPlus, the story is a bit more open. Not sure if this is a spoiler or not, but at one point you can choose whether to become friendly toward the Hammerites, or the Pagans, which affects the rest of the game after that.\n\nInstead of a sword, you have a dagger. Makes backstabbing much easier.\n\nNo rope arrows, but you can eventually purchase climbing gloves. These are AWESOME, if you can figure out how to use them. :D\n\nOil vials. Can be ignited to make a temporary, impassible wall of flame, or can be used to make guards slip, slide, and fall down elevator shafts, if you know what you're doing. Awesome.\n\nThe ability to go 3rd Person in the game is interesting -- at first it detracted from what I was used to in the Thief series, but I quickly got over it.\n\nYou also now have the ability to press up against a wall, suck in your gut, and thus become almost invisible in a dark hallway. Reeeeaaaally creepy putting this to the test for the first couple times.\n\nLockpicking is a little more immersive and realistic, as well.\n\nNeeds some tweaking to make it work on newer machines (opening cutscene is an instant crash for me). One thing that sucks is loading screens within missions. But all of these issues are easily fixed. Just look up some mods for Thief: Deadly Shadows and you'll be set for an amazing time! :)\n\n9/10. Would be 10/10 if there were rope arrows and no need for mods to patch problems. Still, WAY better than the new "THIEF" knockoff (aka Dishonored 2).","January 31, 2015","true","40.0"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","22","27","3","4"

Playing this game makes me sad because stealth games just aren't this good anymore. The game is both challenging and feels rewarding when you complete a job. Each mission is like a small open world and it is up to you to explore each level and figure out the best ways around the guards. The game shows little to no mercy when telling you where the item you need to steal is. This is up to you to figure out and it can get frustrating sometimes but it is just so rewarding to finially weave your way through the level and finially claiming what you must steal. The only complaint I have about this game so far is the dialouge for the common guard is a bit cheesy and stupid. Also, the guards are absolute morons. they have no peripheral vision and they do not react if you shoot an arrow and miss. However sometimes the guards can be smart especially if you accidentally move into a lighted spot and one happens to spot you a mile away. This game has about 30 hours of gameplay, and that is not filled with cutscenes and trial and error moments. It is actual gameplay. Overall it is a great game and I find myself addicted. One of the best stealth games I've ever played.","December 27, 2014","true","34.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

Reminding alot from it, but set in a\nMedieval or Victorian-like age with both electricity,\nmagic and beasts.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nIt's mission based but also played in open world.\nYou are playing in a city divided into areas where\nyou can freely walk in between them as you progress\nthe main story. You will find sidequests by doing\nyour own exploring. All parts of town have their\nstores where you can either buy equipment or sell\nyour loot.\n\n\nMusic:\n\nThe music blends in with where you are and what\nyou're doing, well enough that you don't think\nabout it that much, just the way it should be\nmade for a stealth game to not steal your focus.\n\n\nSound and Voices:\n\nThere are really funny voices and conversations held\nbetween people. This works excellent to fill the\ntime you sometimes have to wait, before making your\nmove. The monsters voices are equally as good but\ninstead made frightening. Some monsters have\nvery heavy footsteps along with it, to make them\neven more scary, while you are standing close pushed\nup in a dark corner.\n\n\nGraphic:\n\nAlot of shadows, since it's always night time.\nThe monsters appearance are better than in most horror\ngames out there.\n\n\nMovement:\n\nIf you come from the Splinter Cell franchise, you will\nadapt to these controls in no time, it uses quite the\nsame basic moves with both more and less from it.\nThe game gives you the option of switching between\nfirst and third person viewing perspective, which is\na really useful feature in certain situations to make\nthings easier.\n\n\nStory:\n\nThe game starts off slowly, with you doing some regaular\nthefts, before escelating into a much darker tale.\nSet for you to collecting necessary artifacts, in order\nto rid the evil. Along the road you will constantly have\nto deal with various groups of people, some are more or\nless friendly, depending on how you treat them.\n\n\nBug and drawback listing:\n\n*Movement suffers alot from bugs and will be the main\nfactor in the game ruining your stealth.\nThe most problematic one being where you in mid air\nwill freeze in a hovering position, after having jumped\nagainst an object to climb. The way to fix this is done\nby drawing an arrow quickly, by just tapping it, so you\ndon't have to shoot it.\n*You can easily get stuck if jumping and landing down\non narrow areas.\n*Climbing up and walking on ledges is very clunky. You\nwill keep falling off, as you for unknown reason is\npushed out and prevented to pass by invisible barriers.\nAs soon as you start slipping from a ledge, you can't\nsave yourself, you are guaranteed to fall down.\n*Crouch toggling has a bad registering.\n*Candles may sometimes keep illuminating after being put\nout and in rare cases even be unquenchable.\n*The crosshair of the bow is not depicting the correct\nx axis trajectory of it's arrow, you will have to aim\nto the side of it instead.\n*Objects and bodies on the ground can spasm out at random\nif coming into contact with another object, this will\nof course alert any nearby enemy and ruin your stealth.\n*Certain none special loot on mission levels don't shine.\nThis makes a 100% loot run a living hell, forcing you\nto check every single small object on the map to make\nsure it's either loot or junk. Keep lifting and putting\ndown unneeded objects will ruin stealth.\n*Some of the loot are unecessary hidden on top of book-\nshelves high above your field of view, unless you jump.\nAgain, this is something that will ruin your stealth.\n*Noise-maker arrows are not working that well.\nThe enemies are programmed to prioritize where the sound\nemerged from, the source, so they will often instead run\nwhere you sit rather than to where you shot the arrow.\nThis is because the noise starts as soon as the arrow\nleaves your bow instead of triggering on impact.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nDespite having its heavy movement bugs, I highly recommend\nit as long as you're not too much of a perfectionist.\nYou will have to endure some frustration with it now\nand then, but I think it's worth it to experience what\nthis game offers in fun and creepy level.","December 28, 2014","true","55.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","0"

You steal for a living. This incredible skill you have, will make your life quite complicated. This is the third game in the series.\n\nFirst off. Don't let the hours I spent on this game fool you. I have played this game so many times, countless of hours. I just have not owned it on steam until recently. I bought it again, because I think it is that great. Let's see when I have more time to return to it..... Just to make it clear, I am a great fan of thief. I have played all the games, and countless of fan-made missions. I am eagerly awaiting the new game (even though I am also a little bit worried about it). I have also played the entire dishonored game plus all DLCs, which I consider to be the best spiritual successor of the thief games up to date. I love stealth games, and I consider Deus Ex (and mark of the ninja) to be great titles as well, which I have all completed.\n\nSo, the game:\nThere was one thing that this game did really well: atmosphere. I love the other thief games, but I think this game was outstanding in this area, and in a way, that is what thief is all about.\nAt the beginning, this game was not too well recieved. I think that is because of two things:\nIt was made with a console in mind, and it was compared to one of the greatest PC games of all time: thief 2. Trying to be as good as that game, is no easy task. But it actually think it did rather well in my mind. (Also, it was made by an entirely different game studio because "looking glass" went bust...)\nThe other problem was that consoles in those days had quite limited resources, so areas could not be very large, making the game feel small with many loading screens. Now the PC did not have that problem, but the game was designed for the console, so....\n\nBut there the problems end in my mind. Because the rest of the game is really very good. And if this title would not be compared to its predecessors, I think everbody would agree it is a great game in its on right. There where some changes, but I think the essential "thief" was still in this game, and it was well made.\n\nGraphically, it was quite a thing when it came out. It was one of the first games to use dynamic shadows, and it required quite a PC to run well. Today that won't be a problem, but the game still looks and feels great, because the atmoshpere and design is that good. It serves the purpose very well even though you don't have the most amazing latest graphics. For example, Deus ex (invisible war) was made with the same engine, and that game has not aged well. I think it is because the art and the vision was so much better in thief than deus ex, so you forgive the graphics in thief - they are not in your way as much. But in deus ex the graphics turn you off a bit. A great examples that it is not always about the technical stuff, but how that media is used, and in thief it is used well.\n\nIt used to be a problem to run on modern PCs, but I find that this steam version works well, and there is also a lot of patches and support from the community that makes this games run better. There is an update that makes the game look better for example.\n\nBut what the game did even better was sound. You had to listen. Where are the enemies? Do I sound too much myself?\nThe music is sparse but just perfect. The sounds from the environment creates a great atmosphere. And sometimes the void of sounds was creppy too. Also the chattering that the NPS are making are fun to listen too. The original thief perhaps was better in this sense, but this game still kept some of that humor very well.\n\nThe story and levels in this game is also very good. And long, really long. You won't complete this game quickly.\nThe game is also one of the most scary games I have ever played. Not because of the monsters, or cheap scares, but because the atmosphere is that good, and because of the "uknown". Thers is one level in this game I think should go to history as the most atmospheric level ever in a game. If you have played this game I think you know what I am talking about. The first time I played that level... I have never enjoyed and suffered so much at the same time, playing any game - I wanted to go on, and quit at the same time...\n\nYou can play this game in third person if you like, but that is just wrong. This game should be played in first person, or it is just broken and less immersive. This is a game where you need patience, perception and wits. Feeling vulnerable is half the charm of the game, waiting in a shadowed corner hoping the "whatever" won't discover you. (this game was also new in a way that the NPCs could carry light sources, lighting up areas that previously were dark, making the games more interesting)\n\nThis is not a fighting game, you are a thief hiding in the shadows, where you are quite powerful. I miss games like these. Let's hope the new thief game is ok. But the 3 thief games that exist are still alive and worth it, with tons of modding and fan-made missions. And there is also dihonored of course...\n\nThis is one of those games you should complete if you considerd yourself a PC-gamer.","December 26, 2013","true","5.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It starts with a faction asking you for help (not willingly) to retrieve a certain artifact from a church of the religious Hammerites. At first Garrett, the main character, not wanting to get involved in any political game refuses, but then thinks of all the good stuff he could "borrow" while he's there... What starts simple, gets a little more complicated later on. Not spoiling anything, let's just say that it is somewhat unexpected (but in a good way!) and surpsisingly scary sometimes (yes "The Cradle", I'm talking to you).\n\nThe game encourages you to really sneak around and not be detected, since a confrontation doesn't end well for the player in most cases. But don't think that this is an unforgiving game, as the game provides the player with a good variety of tools to make all the sneaking around possible. For instance, there is the Blackjack that can be used to knock enemies out silently, there's the Water Arrow which is used to extinguish fire based light sources from a distance creating areas of darkness, the Moss Arrow that is used to create a grassy spot where it isn't noisy to walk on, or the option to simply grab something fom the environment and throw them to lure enemies away. And if you screw things up, there are also the "escape" tools as well, like the Flashbang, that blinds the enemy giving you time to hide again, the Oil Flasks in which the enemies can be slowed down in case of pursuit by sliping on them (or to be set on fire if shot with a Fire Arrow, creating a true firewall), and so on. And if you really need to fight, you have your bow (which can kill the enemy instantly, but only if he/she is not aware of your presence) and dagger (you can also backstab unaware enemies with it), which is possible to guess, isn't very effective in a direct assault on armored sword wielding angry guards (but possible to beat with the help of some Health Potions)\n\nWith all of the tools in the game, it is even possible to beat the game without a single confrontation, lethal or non-lethal. These items give you a nice balance in the game, making every mission possible to be approached a different number of ways.\n\nThe game can be played in a first person perspective, which is more immersive but a little more problematic, or in a thid person perspective, that makes the game easier since you can take a peek at corners without moving for instance.\nAs I stated before, the first person perspective can be a little frustrating, a good example of this is when you lean: the purpose of this is to be able to look from the safety of the shadows without compromising yourself too much, in previous installments of the series, this manouver was one of the most important of those games, it was easy and quick to use, in this game however instead of the character just leaning his head out of cover like it was implied by the movement of the camera in the other games (there was no third person perspective in those), here the character literally places himself to the side really slowly, which compromises you instead of giving you an edge on the enemies.\nIn fact, it can be dangerous to use sometimes, as it can make you fall from a ledge if you're trying to lean near one for instance. So this kinda forces you to use the third person perspective a lot more than you could wish for.\n\nBut this isn't something that can take you away from the game, it's a minor inconvenience that doesn't break the game. You can face a wall and then put your back on it if you think an enemy is going to walk by TOO close to you (can be a life saver) and the movement modes give you more strategy options: you can run, walk crouch, and sneak, each one presents a different speed and noise, so choosing carefully how to approach a place or enemy is always a good plan.\n\nThe AI can be unforgiving, or just plain stupid. Sometimes it will chase you relentlessly for a long time, and sometimes it will give up at the first corner. At least it is good to be surprised sometimes and have to adapt to a certain situation. It is just weird (but necessary in a certain way in this genre) that the enemies see you and may even engage in combat, but later forget that you were there when you hide ("It was probably just my imagination").\n\nThe game takes place in The City (that's the name presented by the game), and it is kind of a free opened world. "Kind of" because of the engine limits, since the game can't handle large areas, there are a lot of transition places which requires the game to stop and load content, breaking the pace of the game, and making it really annoying when you are just trying to explore. The missions take place in separate places of the city, and can only be accessed once, so you can't visit the mission areas prior to reaching them in the story.\n\nGraphically, the game looks really good for its time, great particle effects lighting effects and shadow projections (which you can use to see the enemy coming or the opposite). There are a few problems with colision detection and you can get stuck sometimes requiring you to reload the game in a previous save slot, but thankfully, that's really rare (unless you want to climb everywhere).\n\nThe sound in this game is great, the musics, the ambient and the voice acting are terrific (and comical sometimes as intended). People talk about you in the streets, or think out loud that they must be seeing ghosts and so on, and that's all very convincing.\n\nThe game is pretty long, without taking consideration the times you will reload and try again going through a certain spot or the load times themselves, so it provides a good ammount of time of entertainment.\n\nIn the end, even lacking a few things that made its antecessors great (like the Rope Arrow), Thief Deadly Shadows still greatly succeeds in delivering a solid stealth gameplay and at the same time gives the player liberty to approach the tasks at hand many ways differently (but that doesn't mean without a little punishment) giving the game a good replay value. And with its lenghty campaign, it will certainly have you immersed in its world of intrigues and surprises for a good (really good by the way) time.","January 26, 2014","true","46.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

Despite that, the developers have put in an effort into recreating the world of Thief.\n\nIt takes what was best from Dark Project and adds a new layer of surreal horror to it that results in one of the most widely playable games yet. The setting is familiar to the first instalment and the story becomes similarly weird and mysterious. The controls have improved over Metal Age and enable a flawless exploration of the world. The story is what really tops the two previous titles.\n\nHowever, the dated graphics engine means that loading screens are plentiful and levels are small. It's been streamlined for the Xbox crowd and the consoles limitations and features a bunch of nonsensical elements which were not present in previous Thief games. Getting wedged in the scenery is not a rare event and the rag-doll physics are lazy and unnatural compared to what they should have gone with - good animations. The game now uses a ‘City-hub’ rather than the assumed natural progression between missions as seen in the previous titles. Deadly Shadows is a lot more linear, and suddenly rope/vine arrows and scouting orbs don't exist, and Garrett has forgotten the ability to swim as he dies the instant he touches water. The combat system as expected is not one of the Thief’s strong points, and it would be safer altogether, to just avoid an enemy in the first place.\n\nDie-hards fans might consider it a disgrace to the Thief series, and as a whole, it simply does not live up to the legacy, but despite all of this, the game does deserve credit for maintaining the Thief atmosphere and keeping the series going.","May 19, 2014","true","12.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It's a great stealth game. One of the best, really. Its got stellar stealth effects. Light, sound, it all has an effect. Its fun using your wide array of items to either kill or knock out an enemy, or sneak by unseen. The bow is paricularly lovely in this game. The water arrows you use to put out torches are particularly unique. The city is pretty nice, even though it's small, it still manages to feel alive somehow. The areas are fun, filled with different paths you can take to complete your objectives. Which path will you take through the shadows? You choose. And its really fun sneaking around in the shadows. To me personally, this is one of the few stealth games where it isn't like " I'm right in front of your face and you still don't see me, you stupid gaurd ? " And while THAT much is great, there IS a reason for it. Because if you run this on windows 10 the game is so effing dark that you probably see as much as the gaurds you sneak past can. On windows 10 the brightness toggle doesnt work. And it starts off very dark. And there isn't a thing you can do about it. It's very frustrating. But as far as I know this problem is only on windows 10. Aside from this glitch, the game falls flat in a few areas. Even though this is a stealth game, the combat should be noted. It's awful. If you get caught and are engaged in combat, you might as well just retry from check point. I doubt this will matter to most people, but it still needs to be noted. Aside from that, they don't tell you how valuable resources are. They give you something likw 20 arrows, and you have to save them and not use them in the first mission, as if you spend all the money you make from the supposedly " rare " object you steal in the first two missions gets you enough money for around 17 arows. Yeah. Anyways, this is still a really good game, and an amazing stealth game.

There are especially two scenes I remember for their uniqueness when compared to other gaming experiences I had up to that time.\n\nThe first one was in Shalebridge Cradle. I entered this old decaying building in the middle of the night. On my path to the uppermost level of the cradle I was crawling up that long and wide circular stairs, when the athmosphere and the sound of the scenery won: I could't bear the tension and closed the game. The next day, in bright sunlight, I tried it again - and failed after seconds. Too vivid were the horrors I imagined lurking in the halls beyond.\n\nSo I got reinforcements and brought a friend who - unlike me - had played and loved the first two titles of the series. That actually helped and - slowly - I made my way up the stairs. I can't remember the exact place, but soon  afterwards I looked at the crossing of two hallways. So many directions the evil that must be lurking in this building could come from! Cautiously I approached the crossing, listening for treacherous sounds, when I suddenly saw something moving in the dark. My heart rate increased when I went to investigate it. But I couldn't find anything in any direction. Then - you know what's coming! - I turned around, only to find myself eye to eye wuth the first of the gruesome remnants of this cursed place. I screamed like a little girl and ran! Then my friend and me had a good laugh.\n\nIn the other scene I remember I was lurking atop some walkway which was built at noticable height to allow good overwatch. I believe this was when I made contact with the pagans, but don't know for sure. However, I saw some female guard on patrol right below me with no one else in sight. I braced myself and jumped down, expecting to hurt myself. Instead I landed gracefully right behind the guard who, to my excitement, screamed in surprise without turning around - paralysed be the shock. Once I understood what had just happend I took advantage of it and landed a clean hit with my trusty blackjack before the scream ended to knock out the poor guard.

I was excited to hear my favorite video games were getting a third installment. Then I played this...\n\nThe first time I played through this game, at every turn I sighed and thought bitterly about how such and such was different from this or that in the first two games. And almost every instance was different for the worse, not better. I finished the game with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. I've played it again before writing this review, this time deliberately putting the high expectation bar out of mind. The result has been a more enjoyable experience. It's a shame but I suppose what I'm saying is that I enjoyed this game more when I lowered my expectations for it, ahaha. NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\nThe gameplay is just... poorer. It's obviously geared towards facilitating console play, using a newly added third-person perspective, adding a "loot glint" sparkle on lootable items, etc. This has several drawbacks.\n1) It decreases immersion, but I admit that is a subjective complaint. Maybe you don't think so.\n2) It allows you to "cheat" by pivoting the camera around corners to scout rooms. That's just bad. On the other hand, if you try to play first-person, Garrett now has the silliest "peeking" style. He no longer leans left or right. He now STEPS out to "peek" around corners. And, yes, this is visible to enemies and changes your exposure on the light crystal. It's completely useless in first-person and completely superfluous in third-person. It really only does one thing: allows you to eavesdrop through doors.\n\nThe floating head physics we had in the originals is also out. He has a solid body now, but unless you use that third person camera, you'll find Garrett's body and legs bumping into chairs and tables, making all kinds of noise. What else... oh, he's forgotten how to swim. Water is now an insta-kill border in the game.\nHe has a turning radius like a van now. This is most frustrating when traversing ledges and pipes. If you turn your head and walk on a pipe you might fall off as he takes a wide semi-circular path to straighten out. Also, weird bug, occasionally when you jump in the air or try to mantle something he'll get "stuck" and hover around in a frozen falling/climbing animation. I'll admit this is useful sometimes because he makes no footstep noises while he flies around a few inches above the ground.\n\nThe graphics have been "improved" but at terrible cost. Whereas, Thief 1 and 2 had absolutely sprawling levels that you could run from end to end on a whim, Thief 3, as I'll be calling this, has mid-level loading zones! And they are every bit as obnoxious as you could imagine. And like the rest of that stuff I've mentioned, this has unfortunate consequences. When you zone, time freezes in the previous section. If you try ducking into another section with the City Watch in hot pursuit, when you return they'll be exactly where you left them, in mid-sentence even.\n\nThe story, that all-important story, is pretty good. Yes, it's not all bad here. I think it ties everything up fairly well; however, the execution was not excellent. The final scene, meant to invoke a "coming full circle" effect, came off as contrived. I also really miss the distinctive art style of the mission briefings and cutscenes. The briefings are just voiced-over text paragraphs now, and most of the cutscenes went for a realistic CGI direction and they.... do not look so good. The best ones invariably slid back towards the "moving comic" style of the originals.\n\nThe quality of the in-game dialogue and texts has taken a steep, steep dive. Of particular note, the speech of the Pagans almost seems like it was written by someone who listened to some of the original Pagans and just tried to mimic that, not someone who was originally involved in the process. It just sounds... silly. Garrett lampshades this by blatantly stating they speak in a funny dialect that focuses on the letter 's'. This doesn't excuse things.\n\nConclusion: I do recommend this game, but only just. Play it to see the story through to the end. Despite all my criticism, this game isn't terrible but it doesn't hold a candle to The Dark Project or The Metal Age.\n\nP.S. Credit where credit is due: The best part of the game is without a doubt the Shalebridge Cradle mission. It's creepy, it's atmospheric, it calls back to Gervasius' library (Thief 2). That single level shines like a gem amid the rest of this game's muck.","January 17, 2015","true","91.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

To combat this the devs needed to inject it with diversity. At times the lack of fleshed out design imposes restrictions on player choice. Some levels are too linear though some have multiple ways around and multiple ways to tackle chokepoints. At your disposal you have a blackjack for knocking out enemies and diverse range of arrows (fire, water, noise, broadhead, moss etc) and other paraphernalia from holy water to mines. (Additional melee combat exists but it's fittingly pointless). I can't say how the game changes on the hardest difficulty. Maybe it requires you to get all the loot or maybe it makes loot more scarce so more importance is placed on player choice and sacrifice regarding item purchases. I'd prefer the latter.\n\nThe game lets you leave trails of cadavers but ideally you would just sneak past everyone for obvious reasons. The types of cadavers... well the devs weren't exactly liberal with enemy variety. Most react the same when you hint at your presence but later in the game they get a bit more anomalous and ergo stealth becomes more tense. Stealth is implemented well. It doesn't solely focus on realism as that would detract from the fun factor.\n\nThe cutscenes are flawlessly done which help spur you on through the intriguing story. The old fashioned art style in these cutscenes along with the inflated, overlapping and echoing sound also really help accentuate the fact that this game will indeed be an unsettling experience.\n\nThough you can't talk unsettling without mentioning the Shalebridge Cradle. Not even nepenthes could calm the soul from what this level has to offer. Hope leaves and grief sets in and grows as you progress through the level. Dark paranoia consumes you via a richly constructed soundscape and haunting scenery. To this day the only game that I've found that competes at inundating you with complete foreboding ambience is the Ocean House Hotel (V:TM-B). Morbid curiosity poked me through to the end of both these levels and left me exhausted, relieved but also fascinated on how both areas exceed 99% of dedicated horror games. Maybe that percentage can be lowered with the highly anticipated collaboration between Kojima and Guillermoh♥♥♥♥youkonami...","July 21, 2015","true","35.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/6980/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Thief: Deadly Shadows is the third Thief game in the original trilogy. Since original developers of the first two Thief games,  Looking Glass Studios, ended up closing due to financial troubles, Ion Storm was the one to develop the final game in trilogy, releasing it in 2004. Thankfully, this company hired some developers that were working in Looking Glass and based game development on their original vision of the third game so you can still be sure that true Thief game plot-wise and great conclusion. Oh, and it's based on Deus Ex IW engine which is heavily modified Unreal 2 and is known as being bad.\n\nIt's also was developed for both Xbox and PC and yet, console restriction hit PC version as well. Enjoy tiny levels with loading gates. And intro automatically running if you stay in main menu for some time.\nXbox version and PC are very close to each other. Xbox version makes some interesting use of gamepad, where you can easily set a needed speed with analog stick and it also gives ramble feedback during lockpick minigame. But then agian, Xbox never recieved any patches, so stick with PC.\n\nTechnically, it's one of the buggiest games around. Or more exactly, it hangs on this territory where bugs aren't strong enough to completely stop you from playing yet you will be kept reminded that they exist and will meet them around at every corner. It would make Bethesda explode from envy. Then again, what else would one expect from makers of Daikatana. Hell, this game even had a bug at the launch that would always reset difficulty to normal. At least it got fixed. Yes, Steam version has latest version.\n\nLike, everytime the game was loading something, it would show my desktop twice in the beggining, which was annoying me. Then the framerate often goes awry when there are multiple light sources present on the screen. Maybe because it doesn't support more than one processor or just because of bad compitability. And sometimes it just crashes on quicksave. At least in these cases it wouldn't get corrupted, thank goodness for that.\nAnd then I heard that some people had issues where lockpicking minigame does not display on screen. In such cases some suggested turning off V-Sync. But some still had troubles.\n\nEh, you really should download some of community patches. Really. Though I played without any, because all yay vanilla experience.\n\nThe game continues the story of Garrett the Master Thief in the City. Twice did he impact and restore the balance of powers as evidenced in previous games. The last time he stopped the Mechanists with all their mechanical progressive view. As a result the City seemed to abandon everything that they have done. Actually, it went into such extreme of Medivel style category, that there is almost no Steampunk left. As a result Thief 3 seem to have the most bland, uninspired envirmoment and seems to lack same charm of mystery and Fantasy/Steampunk that I came to like about original. It's all about cartoonish blue darkness now. Which isn't to say that it doesn't have a few immersive memoriable levels. And music does fine job sometimes too. But yea, it's not same anymore.\n\nBut hey, those few levels are indeed very moody and nice experiences. Even if most of them are gray and bland.\nLike Museum level with low-humming music and creepy recordings. Or the mansion level while there is storm and rain outside. Or even the famous Cradle horror-level which, while isn't going to scare anybody nowadays and also quite bland overall, still provides an interesting level-plot and exploration of it.\n\nAnd in this game you will get yourself close with Keepers and their prophesies, with game providing good conclusion to the series. I am not going to spoil much, but it's quite interesting to follow. Just a shame that cutscenes aren't even. Half of cutscenes are nicely drawn animations. And another half is made using ugly, by comparison, in-game models. Oh well.  And no, animations aren't in same style as the first two games. No briefing either, aw.\n\nAnd to be honest, first impression with the game was just godawful. It combines the third and first person view into one ugly movement that seem to be bad in both modes and there are tons of glitches. It seems like the first person is done just by moving camera to where the head. Ok, that doesn't sound too wrong and it's nice to see your hands and legs. But, don't know how to explain, but the way it controls in first person feels clumpsy, like the game has to synchronise your movement with one of model animations. Heck, the head camera seems to lag and rubberband around the body itself. Even leaning may make you fall off the edge sicne it's uses slow clunky animation that shifts your collision box along. Heck, it even takes a second for body to turn around when you start moving in different direction.\n\nThe third person perspective isn't much either. It's not as immersive experience. And then I am not sure how I am supposed to turn around while standing in same spot, with PC default controls. Which also reminds me that game was so rushed that they didn't include mouse sensetivity in options.\n\nSo yea, it's more about you trying to get used to first person control, while switching to third person around corner to peek around without revealing yourself, which you can view as nessercary "cheating". And then the clumpsy movement add up to overall bugginess. Like not being able to pick up some ragdolls. Or some items in chest. Or being able to pick one through the locked chest. Or seemingly not being able to stand up near walls. Or getting stuck after jumping attempts in some strange hovering state where you can't jump anymore until you pull arrow with your bow. Or hell, getting stuck between two barrels where I had to knife one of them for whole two minutes until I finally knocked it out where it rolled down the slope, fell and made woman on another side of wall gasp. Is this emergent gameplay that everybody makes buzz about?\n\nGameplay-wise it also got changed around. Like, Garrett changed sword to daggers. Which may sound fancy, but it means no more cool sword fights. Now combat sucks, as you can't block, just you trading damages with enemy. I know that it's not something player is supposed to do, but it was cool to do some sword-fight when backed into corner. Then agian, escaping is more viable there as NPCs get tired from chasing after Garrett after some time and have to stand and take a rest. And hiding in shadows is as easy as ever. By the way, this game was one of the first to use dynamic shadows, like in Doom 3. And it makes use of them heavily, graphic-wise. Gameplay-wise? Nah, nothing to do with moving shadows, nothing programmed to recognise that. Oh well. At least you can blow small candles up now.\n\nIt also turned lockpick into minigame. Nothing exciting, it looked interesting at first, but soon you will realize how limited it is and how tedious it gets as it gets longer and longer futher in game.\n\nIt also includes city hub thing. Which could be better. It's a nice time waster of sorts, you can pickpocket, unlock some doors and steal objects so you could sell them and buy yourself supplies of items. But it gets old to avoid same guards around most corner. It has pathetic faction system where you have to do some small things so they will not attack you. It's easy to do and there is no conflict between trying your best to amuse both factions, no interesting things happen otherwise. It does get funny when, in order to appeal to Hammerites, you shoot arrows at explosive rust bugs only for everybody in the city to freak out and call out you as murderer. Meh, it's mostly fun only to see chaos later on in the game, as silly as it looks.\n\nIt's not something I would highly recommend to new players, but those who want to see conclusion of the Thief storyline will be happy enough. Too many loading gates and glitches though.","March 13","true","24.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

Very few times did I scream with anger at the computer because something broke, or my character got stuck in something illogical or anything that got me pretty ♥♥♥♥ing mad at the first two games. However, this one does seem to have lesser variety in scenery. The cradle level was specially fun :)\nThe hub system gets a bit annoying with all the respawning guards and having to knock them out every single time, but it can be dealt with, and if you're tired of sneaking past them you can easily outrun them if you know where you're going.\nThe map is INCREDIBLY annoying , it does not show where you are,  and this becomes a major bother when you save somewhere in a level and get back to it some other day.\nThis game is strange in that Garett sometimes moves like he has net lag, it feels like he stops a bit or gets thrown back a bit sometimes, like he is suffering from rubberbanding, somewhat strange.\nThe wall climbing feature could be improved a bit, sometimes it does not work properly, but you can finish the game properly.","March 7, 2015","true","21.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I have just started this game, but wow i love the depth, plot detail, and faction elements they have put in this story.\nThe music is awesome. It sets the tone.\nThis should be a standard for gaming.\nIt's a sad shame that so many games coming out are garbage (even so called AAA), cash grabs using hype and graphics to win over mutton head casual gamers (read: CONSOLE coming to PC).\n\nI heard a little about the demise of this game dev company and it's sad. We gamers should be rewarding good game developers by passing the word, likewise pass the word on the garbage to stear clear of buying.\nFinal note: have you noticed how many "alpha", "beta", and "pre-release" games are being sold on Steam, and then they fail to finish or deliver?\n\nP.S. Thief 3 Deadly Shadows is better than Thief 4 for it's immersion and story arc depth. Graphics aren't everything!\n\nEdit: now that i have begun to play the game a bit i have found some annoyances like a "jump" bug. Garrett gets stuck in the jump animation and kinda of floats around.\nAlso, you can get stuck behind objects.\nI also wish the city was more in depth. The pathways are pretty linear, and Thief 4 actually has a more interesting city, imo, but Thief 4 has HORRIBLE loops of AI voice samples (the Polly Adler loop, for example). The guards are actually better in Thief 3. They have more interesting pathing runs and voice samples (ie: the Hammerites constant reiteration of their orthodoxy: it's creative).\nThe loading screens are immersion breaking.\nThe mob AI can be pretty stupid ( like every other game).\nI wish there was more rooftop traveling. At one point Garret  calls rooves "Thieves highways". I hope more "highways' come later, because right now, its just a truck stop.\nGarrets apartment is also needing something to it. Thief 4 actually has this better as well (with your trophy boxes).\nAnother annoyamce: you can't alt-tab while running Thief 3. If you alt-tab, your computer basically locks up and you can't close the game. Steam overlay doesn't work with it either.\n\nBUT so far i really like this game, and highly recommend it!","February 9","true","40.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

These days, on a fast system and with some tweaks, many of those issues are moot.  And some of the differences between DS and Thief 2 are easier to accept now as design changes rather than blasphemy.\n\nIts environments are fun to explore and often atmospheric, but it doesn't have as many wide-open or weird levels as previous Thief games.  The lack of rope arrows is also unfortunate.  But it's a strong Thief experience that you're not likely to get elsewhere, and its story nicely concludes the trilogy.  It also adds to the Thief recipe with a bit of sandboxy-ness in the City that joins missions together.\n\nMy major gripe is that blackjacking can solve almost all situations, at least on Normal. I didn't play Expert because the high loot requirement can get tedious, but maybe on Expert you'd have more need to use other tools.\n\nA few basic setup tips: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=118325427","August 20, 2011","true","31.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I think it's still brilliant (also own it off-steam) to play.\nSetting is a fantasy city with a bit of steampunk for good measure. You play as a thief mostly avoiding combat and try to find the valuables in the level while checking the mission goals. To that end you want to stay in the shadows or walk on carpet as enemies can see or hear you. You can club guards from behind and hide their bodies from the patrol routes of other guards. You have a limited set of tools like flashbombs, water arrows to extinguish torches or moss arrows to place "carpet". Levels are mostly open like in Deus Ex and it's fun to find the way around the guards and play hide and seek with them. Also there are a lot of hidden treasures or secret doors to discover. And there are really scary parts too.\nCan recommend to anyone who likes stealth maybe not for too casual players.\n","December 17, 2013","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I had them running on older machines, but wanted them on this one. Fortunately, Steam made them available, capable of running on my Win 7 machine.\n\nI'm still waiting for Thief 4 to come out.

If you're impatient like me you end up dying countless times on city streets (you taffer!!!!!!!!) before getting to a mission start. (I cheated prison so many times by just quitting to the title and loading my last save. Heh,)\nBut as I got the gist of this game (see: STEALTH game, duh), I liked the challenge. The strange, dark, magic-tinged story ending up roping me in. I never had the classic Thief expeirence, either, so I don't really have a basis for comparison. For me, this game is an enjoyable ride of stealing, blackjacking innocent bystanders, and killing the witnesses so they don't get the guards (see again: taFFER!!!!), while trying to figure out a whole lot of creepy cult shenanigans.\n\nPros:\n-Atmospheric, tense gameplay with creepy, heart-pounding moments (zombie ship??? more like NAH SON I'M OUT BYE) (see also: giant rat things?? NOPE)\n-Multiple ways to tackle most missions, challenging, wide range of gear\n-Diverse settings for missions with unique sets of characters\n-Inriguing story\n-Garret's voice acting\n\nCons:\n-Glitchy gameplay at times (i.e. floating Garret, getting killed by a guard because I couldn't jump on a freaking ledge to escape, occasionally freezing)\n-Outdated visuals, if you're turned off by that\n-Slighlty moronic NPCs, whose dialogue and behavior range from funny/unique to downright predictable\n\nAll in all, 9/10. I really enjoy this game and spent far too many hours of a single day trying to figure out how many blackjacked corpses I could stack in the shadows before someone discovered me, along with a lot of yelling at my computer ("it wasn't me that time I swear111!!!" "did I see somethin--NOPE NOPE YOU DIDN'T" "goawaygoawaygoaway")\n\nFinally, I am a horror wimp and almost ♥♥♥♥ myself during the stupid freaking insane asylum run.

It has the best storytelling by far. The new mechanics are a mix of good and bad. The shadow system is more accurate but the blackjacking is terribly clunky and requires you to line up shot directly from behind which will fail and probably ruin your plan if the target pivots at the last second. On the other hand the ability to switch into third-person perspective gives things a more realistic feel and is tactically useful (although rather cheap because it lets you see around corners). The leaning is useless.\n\nThe levels are not bad. By my count three of them are mediocre and six of them are good to outstanding. Many people think one of them is the best Thief level of all time.\n\nI think the real problem, after you mod out the loading zones, is with the hub city. Often it's good and adds a lot of nice (though completely unnecessary) mini side-quests. But at other times it's just a nuisance having to go through two or three transitions and avoid a handful of patrolling guards just to get to your next mission. It also never feels like a real world. It's too small and the NPCs are too obviously just spawned NPCs.  On balance the formula of the original Thief games worked better. All missions with no filler.\n\nAnyway the reason I'm writing this review is because I think this game has an undeservedly low reputation. It rounds out the trilogy well and should have been the basis for a much better 3D Thief game.","May 4, 2015","true","36.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/6980/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","Thief 3: Deadly Shadows was a brave attempt by a declining Ion Storm Austin to create a worthy sequel and ending to an amazing trilogy. On paper, they did everything right. They got the vast majority of Looking Glass Studios staff on-board to make it, they swapped technology to the Unreal Engine and set out to make the series more appealing to a broader audience. The end result however, was a different story.\n\nIn Thief 3, Garrett is once again the lovable misanthropic protagonist, stealing and hiding his way through another adventure. As expected, you will visit a wide variety of interesting locations and settings to foil yet another attempt to destroy The City.\n\nThe story of the game is incredibly well written and maintains the high standard of story telling that Looking Glass prided themselves in writing. The musical score and general ambience is handled by Eric Brosius and, as expected, the atmosphere is just as gripping as it was in the previous games.\n\nInstead of playing mission after mission like in the previous games, the game is based around a 'hub' system; Garrett will have to make his way from his apartment through The City's streets to his next chosen objective, all the while keeping an eye out for pockets to pick or people to mug. Just make sure the City Watch aren't around before you attempt to hold someone up in the street. You'll need to visit fences around The City who will sell your stolen goods for you and shops to buy the equipment you'll need for your next mission.\n\nThe game plays out over the course of 9 days. Each day, you'll have to leave your place of residence and explore the streets. Each day will bring something different so it encourages you to investigate areas you've previously explored to find things to steal or to find new story elements. You'll be exploring a City that has largely recovered from the aftermath of Thief 2 and is slowly sliding back into a more magical steampunk state, visiting grand cathedrals, mansions, museums, libraries and, of course, The Cradle.\n\nIf you've never heard of this legendary level, the game is worth purchasing for this level alone. I won't go into too much detail about it but I'll say this... It's an amazing horror experience that will have you terrified from beginning to end.\n\nThe AI is both much improved over previous games but incredibly stupid at times. They'll remember past events and people they've met in the streets, monsters or otherwise. They'll remember if they've been robbed, found bodies in the street or seen blood on the floor and run away if they're outnumbered. Unfortunately they'll end up trying to hide in the middle of the street or accuse you of crimes you may not have committed.\n\nThere is some top quality voice work in here too especially for the monsters. The monsters up close sound so creepy that it'll send shivers down your spine!\n\nFor all its good points however, this game has some major problems. Thanks to this game being primarily designed for the Xbox and it's 64MB of RAM, the levels of the game, whilst being incredibly detailed for the time, are small, cramped, fairly linear and had to be split up into sections so the Xbox could cope. The PC port truly got shafted by this decision.\n\nIon Storm Austin also, for some insane reason, decided to take their completely butchered version of the Unreal Engine they used for Deus Ex 2 and made Thief 3 with it, albeit with some drastic improvements. The engine was a pretty damn impressive renderer for the time and does great dynamic lighting but performance wise, it was terrible. It runs fairly well on the PCs of today though but, back in 2004, you were lucky to see even 30 FPS on the most powerful of computers of the day.\n\nOverall, it's a satisfying end to a trilogy that was truly amazing from start to finish. Even though Thief 3 is considered the weakest of the series, it has its good points and I can highly recommend it!","April 20, 2013","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","3"

But I would also tell you to play theif one and two as well. they are sneak-em-up action games well worth playing for their storyline and ever evolving game play. Deadly shadows is only the lesser in game play because they made a stupid move to put it on consoles as well. instead of giving them diffrent codings we lost many abilities like being able to swim and clim ropes and so forth, as well as some stability in some places. That said the odd glith here and there (many are funny as heck to explit when running from guards and so forth). If you want to use a joy pad i would advise you to hunt out a good emulator as there seems to be issues with setting joy pads for game play in this steam edtion of the game as it crashes when you try to set them.

PC version 1.1\n\nGood things that are good\n\nThe overall banter from everyone as you do your thing is very funny. Many guards have different personalities (normal, drunk, sick, tired) and talk to each other very realistically.\nGuards next to each other will actively inform one another about the situation at hand. It's also funny that everyone thinks unconscious people are dead.\nThere's a good amount of gameplay, and the levels are interesting for the most part. The hub world is surprisingly well thought out, and the changes it undergoes as the game progresses are impressive.\nThe horror mission is actually pretty scary, people weren't kidding.\nThe story is interesting enough to keep you wanting to move forward. It's not fantastic, it's just interesting.\nThe tools you are given to mess around with are great and have significant impact on the enemies and environment.\nMoney is good and there is a lot of money everywhere. Probably won't be able to spend it all, though.\nThe AI is fun to elude and doesn't cheat you for the most part.\nIt's not a bad game. I can't recommend it, though, because of the glaring issues throughout that ruin the experience.\n\nBugs / Annoyances\n\nLOADING\nLoading your game takes forever. Moving from map to map takes forever. Quicksaving is quick, but quickloading is slow as hell.\nLoading happens a lot in this game. It gets very grating very quickly.\n\nMOVEMENT\nMany times when you jump, your jump is cancelled and you are stuck in a sort of hovering mode. In this you can't jump and can't climb. To get out of it, you must draw an arrow and then put the arrow back. This glitch is by far the most annoying one, and will ruin dramatic moments or great escapes.\nYou can climb onto ledges, but a lot of times it does not register, and if you are falling at any speed it will refuse to latch on. This means that if you make a jump but start slipping off the edge, you cannot grab onto the edge - you're doomed to fall.\nSmall items on the ground, including corpses, will impede your movement and jitter the camera. Sometimes the physics has a bug and causes an extremely loud collision noise (which alerts anyone around).\nThe game has two sneaking buttons, walk and creep. The game tells you to walk over loud surfaces, but later on you'll actually need to creep, because walking ends up being too loud. Crouching avoids all that nonsense.\nYou can climb out of the environment if you find the right place to do so.\nThe hitbox for pickpocketing is really tiny, and that hitbox stays with worn items that fall off of people. Picking items up off the ground is a pain because of it.\nDeep water instantly kills you. If you slip off a dock because of bad ledge detection, you're a dead man.\n\nBLACKJACK\nThe blackjack is such a bizarrely complicated tool it needs its own problems section.\nBlackjacks, when used properly trigger a scripted knockout sequence masquerading as normal gameplay. This is a state that is ideal to reach, but you must be standing to do so. Standing is not advantageous because then you start making lots of noise or are more visible. So, the convoluted way to knock someone out in this game is to crouch walk over to them, stand up and stand still, then click and hope that the sequence triggers.\nBlackjacks don't need the scripted sequence, but it makes it a lot easier.\nYou can't knock someone out who is in an increased state of alert. This is seen in guards as them having their weapon drawn. This is a fine system, but some enemies don't explicitly use weapons, so their alert and idle states look identical, causing lots of infuriating blackjack failures.\nI don't think you can knock people out who are sitting down. It never worked for me. Chairs are a huge problem because of that.\nA blackjack hit that is successful makes no blood, but a blackjack hit that isn't successful makes blood.\nSometimes guards die when they hit the floor. I think this is because the torch underneath them burns them to death. Either that or they fall on the sword which gives a significant physics impact. Either way, you can tell they died because of the loud scream they emit while unconscious.\n\nTOOLS\nSometimes noisemaker arrows don't make noise.\nFor a grenade, the gas bomb has a ridiculously small area of effect.\nArrows do not seem to come out of the center of your view (where the crosshairs are). They have a bit of left-wards bias, so if a column is to your left you have a high chance of hitting that instead, wasting the arrow.\nThrown items have this problem but to a ridiculous degree. If your throw is obstructed the game will simply not throw the item, keeping it in your inventory. This is not good when you are trying to gas three people trying to stab you and can't throw the grenade because you weren't turned to the right far enough.\nThrown items are thrown underhand, not overhand, with significant force. Most of the time you will hit the ceiling with your item because of how high the throwing arc is.\n\nAI\nThis game is almost completely free of cheating AI, but it has some cheating scenarios.\nAI can see items through walls, like chairs and tables. This is triggered when searching for you, accompanied with a quote like "maybe they are by the _____").\nIf an AI finishes fighting another AI, they will seek out another target a few seconds later. This ignores light level, which means you can be targetted instantly by simply being an observer in complete darkness.\n\nLEVELS\nThe horror level is GREAT for the first half, but there is a specific moment where it turns horribly boring and not scary.\nA lot of levels take far longer than they should.\nThere are opportunities to use your items in the levels, but they only become important in the last few missions.","June 16, 2014","false","27.1"," 28 of 56 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","28","56","2","1"

Much better than the first ones. The graphics are better and so are the levels. The levels are tighter, filled with more interesting things, and aren't hollow giant areas. This eliminates much of the wandering around with no clue.  The levels have better atmosphere, and the lighting is looks better too. There is also a better job with actually telling you what you need to do. There are still some problems. The knocking out is very spotty. Sometimes it won't knock out or kill someone if they are looking for you even if they haven't seen you and you are behind them. This makes no sense as the only way to draw them to the dark is make some noise so they come over. You can never tell if the attack will work. Sometimes if you are in front, or on the side, or 2/3 behind them it won't work and they will start attacking you. This makes no sense because of you surprise attack someone in the head in the dark, even if it isn't exactly behind them, it will do the same thing. Similarly you can shoot them in the head with an arrow and sometimes it will kill in one hit but if they are on the lookout it wont.........(?) Also you can never tell if you are close enough to hit them or not. The sound can be spotty too and you can't tell if they will be able to hear you or not. It is annoying how you have to go find the store to sell and buy things with how confusing the towns are and how your map tells you nothing. It would be better if you sold and bought stuff before each mission like in  the old days. All in all it is a better game, except still the supernatural creatures take some of the fun out of it. 8/10","November 18, 2012","true","34.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

Deadly Shadows boasts 3rd Person View, well-defined shadows, a city hub rife with foes and easy marks, and several unique missions that can be solved in a multitude of ways.

There are some great individual parts here ("the Cradle," for example, is a very effective haunted orphanage level that presages stuff like "Amnesia" in various ways) and the game still plays more or less the same as the previous two, but unfortunately it can't move beyond its terrible engine. Like "Deus Ex: Invisible War" (another disappointing early 2000s follow up to a classic game), T:DS uses the Unreal 2 engine, which means levels are divided up into tiny hubs with MASSIVE load times between each (undoubtedly at least partly a concession to memory limitations of the XBOX at the time). Not only does this make the game's open world portions a headache to navigate (imagine playing "Assassin's Creed" only to have the game pause and load for 60 seconds every time you travel 50 feet), but it also completely ruins the previous games' best feature, replacing the massive, intricately designed, maze-like levels with more economical (and boring) affairs.\n\nStill, it's not an awful game, just an interesting example of the fact that when it comes to game engines "newer" is not always better. While it was definitely showing its age at the time when it came to graphical "wow" factor, the Dark Engine was way more versatile and adaptive to what the designers where trying to do here than Unreal 2. So it's a shame that they abandoned it (although I imagine the decision was mostly just because Unreal 2 was more console friendly than Dark Engine).","January 11, 2013","true","23.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here is why I am not recommending this game in its current form: the game by itself is basically unplayable on Windows 10 due to all of the bugs. In order to even play the game, the sneaky upgrade mod must be installed. Even then, there is still a lot of stuff that is broken. For example: the in game brightness controls do not work so I am having to turn up the brightness and contrast on my monitor to 100% so that I can maneuver around some of the darker parts of the game. If the bugs were fixed, I would give a thumbs up but until then, I would avoid playing with Windows 10.","May 1","false","1.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/6980/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","The last game in the Thief series, before its reboot, and I just can't play it. I have played all three of the games in order, without ever having played any of them before. To make matters short, at least at the front of this review, the only game I like out of the three is Thief II, though I only really enjoyed about 60% of that game and found the rest of it rather lackluster.\n\nAs my other reviews say, the first Thief was good in virtually everything except for the level design, which killed it for me. The second game continued with all of the proper mechanics and had much better levels, at least for 60% of the game (as said above). This game, however, has much more issues with it than just the levels.\n\nFirstly, the game is terribly optimized with a horrible engine. From the start of the game, I had this weird stuttering issue where the camera would essentially shake as I looked around, bugging my eyes. Even with patches and such, the problem still occurred, though eventually it vanished for some weird reason. Regardless, that ended up just foreshadowing everything else I would have problems with in the game.\n\nThe game even just crashed multiple times for me, for what reasons I could never tell. I never had either of the first two games crash or freeze (nor did System Shock 2).\n\nThe levels themselves take a relatively long time to load. Now, I'm not an impatient person, and I understand if the level is initially loading up for the first time, but even just reloading a save I made 10 seconds ago will end up taking nearly 1 minute or more to load. The game first just goes to a black screen for about 20 seconds, then it will go to a loading screen, and finally get back to the level. But the weird thing is, about 50% of the time I would load a save or a new area would start up, the game would do a weird "freeze." The level would render but there would be no sound, and I couldn't move, attack, look around, jump, or do anything at all. What is odd is that the level would "start" in a halfway manner. For instance, at the beginning of the second mission, I could see subtitles of the guards talking outside, but the sound wouldn't play. Then about 20 seconds or more later, I could finally move and the sound would start, in the middle of their conversation. This happened in any place that I would load or enter.\n\nIn terms of the controls, nothing is smooth. Just walking straight would have the game become choppy occasionally, but not because of a frame-rate drop. Getting near walls, even several inches away, would sometimes cause me to stop moving properly at the same speed. Leaning left and right is terribly slow and choppy. Jumping feels like you are disconnecting and reconnecting yourself via a chain to the ground. The third person isn't really anything well done. And of course, I ended up no-clipping through some walls in a few places and dying.\n\nEven attacking isn't proper. The very first guy I went up to in the second mission, I tried to use the blackjack on him. I was standing exactly behind him and never moved, and it took FIVE times for the blackjack to connect and knock him out. The first four times it just swung and nothing happened. I didn't bother moving, nor did I look at a different angle. I just stood exactly still and it missed four times, while neither of us moved.\n\nFurther, just in the second mission, the game made me lose my controls multiple times as well. I don't know what made it occur, but twice when I was walking around, the game suddenly disabled my ability to creep, crouch, jump, or press against the walls. I could still walk and run, and I could still swing weapons or shoot arrows, but anything that required me to change my stature or get off the ground wouldn't work and I had to reload.\n\nIn terms of looks, the graphics are somewhat better drawn, but they look more dull and less life-like. They don't render properly either, often flickering or disappearing throughout the level. The compass and visibility marker at the bottom is ugly; the menus are worse in design, and it is silly that things like options aren't available unless you quit the game. Big shining objects and doors are annoying.\n\nThe game is missing some interesting items such as the Rope Arrow. The lockpicking is really nothing better than before. I thought it was better at first, because it was more interactive instead of just waiting, but in reality, you just twirl the mouse while clicking over and over. The only thing remotely better is the inventory as you can see the items as you swap through them, instead of trying to remember where a given item is in the list.\n\nThen you have the AI which is dumber than the first two games. I saw multiple guards walking into walls repeatedly. One even got onto a set of stairs, then went down 3 steps, back up, then back down, over and over in circles. Even more funny, in the City Hub, I knocked out random civilians and people just walked by them as if nothing was there.\n\nThat's another thing... the City Hub. I thought it was going to be an interesting addition, but in fact, it isn't really. The areas I explored weren't that big, and there's only like 5 doors you can go into at a given time anyway. Essentially, it seems it only exists to add more roadblocks between you and your next mission, including having to repeatedly return to sell loot and buy new items (though I understand that more so). But really, it is a boring stopping point between missions.\n\nNow, despite my complaints with the first two Thief games, as I said, I thought Thief II was the best (which seems the general consensus) and I really enjoy the story and world atmosphere. However, I think the interior of the games actually ruin those things, for the most part. I didn't even get far enough into this game to see where the story was going, because of all of the above issues; but I finished both of the first two Thief games, even though I nearly hated the first one because of its levels.\n\nThis game was easily the worst of the three overall, and I just can't put myself through anymore of it. Next, I will try my luck with the Thief reboot, though I already hear many people hate it. Here is hoping there are some better things done with it in comparison to Deadly Shadows.","February 15, 2015","false","3.0"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarflare/recommended/6980/","solarflare","squiddingme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarflare/","169 products in account","A clumsy game. Movement physics akin to wading through mud, a recurrent jumping bug and obnoxious level transitions destroy any momentum this game could have had. Ion Storm couldn't get right something that Looking Glass Studios mastered four years before them. Curiously, after the technical disaster of Deus Ex: Invisible War, Ion Storm did not think not to use the same engine, warts and all, for Thief: Deadly Shadows.\n\nThere is a third person mode and a first person mode. In an attempt to create two cameras, neither is particularly well implemented. The first person camera is tied to Garrett's model, and his animations are awkward and twitchy, which could easily induce motion sickness in some players.\nYou will return to the City hub repeatedly after each mission. Each time, you will have to sneak through the same areas, around the same City Watch guards, patrolling the same paths. Ion Storm somehow did not realize this would instantly become incredibly tedious.\nMovement while crouching is absurdly slow, meaning to get around you will want to stand up and run. I cannot express in words how unbelievably braindead this idea is. Furthermore, it is now impossible to keep pace with a guard while crouching, so in order to pick his pocket you will need to stand up and run.\nBlackjacking is strangely convoluted: when you are behind someone, standing, the guard isn't searching, Garrett is raising his hand and the blue moon aligns, you might trigger a scripted knockout sequence. Otherwise you'll just have given the guard a friendly tap over the head that alerted him to your presence.\nGuards will notice when you put out lights, discouraging you from ever using water arrows.\nGarrett makes no sound at all when creeping or crouched, so there is almost never any reason to use moss arrows.\nAs a result of this, you will most likely never spend any of the gold you can now accumulate over the course of the game. I finished the game with some 25,000 unspent gold and a full inventory of items I never used. At least in Thief 1 and Thief 2 I would spend all my gold on items I wouldn't use since there were no item caps and gold did not carry over between levels.\nA braindead lockpicking minigame that you will repeat over and over and over again. It locks you in place, so you cannot quickly check your surroundings without awkwardly fumbling out of the lockpicking minigame.\nLoot now sparkles, so you do not have to look around to find it.\nThe climbing gloves are a poor man's substitute to rope arrows. Often you will try to climb a stone surface only to find that it is blocked off by an overhang, if you can even climb the surface at all—it seems as though the rules for which surfaces you can climb are not very consistent.\nGarrett has apparently forgotten how to swim, and simply drowns instantly upon making contact with water.\nWhy in the ever living ♥♥♥♥ would the loading zones prompt you whether you want to move to the next area with a yes/no choice? I moved into the loading zone, I obviously want to load the next area. Do not ask me twice, you are not a Windows GUI.\nExpect problems even with the Sneaky Upgrade, as the Thief: Deadly Shadows engine is poorly optimized. I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone.","August 7, 2015","false","24.7"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","38","12","32","7","6"

Stealth games are my ♥♥♥♥, and I've always thought that they are more immersive and fun from the First Person viewpoint. I spoiled myself on Dishonored, watching through it in it's entirety before actually ever playing it, so I never got the chance to truly enjoy it. Because of this, aside from reading a few rave reviews, I went into this game completely blind. I was hoping to be surprised, and I can't say that I wasn't. Only a minute in, and the annoyingly slow run-speed of my character had already begun to irritate me. The graphics were a minor annoyance, as to be expected in a game this old, but the enviroments themselves seemed bland and lifeless. Upon reaching a ladder, my character proceeds to dry hump it repeatedly instead of actually climbing it. Eventually, I managed to overcome the incredible obstacle, and was able to continue onwards. Until, the game simply shut off. I didn't know what had happened. Had the game crashed? I tried booting it up again, but steam claimed it was already running. After about a minute, a new window of the game opened. Now, I've played a lot of older games. In fact, over 75% of the games I own come from the 90's. But never before had I seen a game that loaded by shutting down and then starting a new window. Being of a mind to go into game design myself, I was baffled as to why anyone would ever use THAT as a method of level loading. But even then, I was not deterred. Obviously, the rave reviews I had heard for this game had to have some basis. I continued on through the tutorial, which I was beginning to become quite sick of. For a game that had been flaunted as allowing you multiple ways through a scenario, this game had only allowed me an extremely linear set of options so far. After thirty minutes of slow-walking, I made it through the tutorial. Finally, I was free to play the game! I loaded the next level and decided to see if I could possibly take a more lethal approach. I attempted to snuck up behind a guard and stabbed him... Which is apparently not an instant kill. Having alerted every guard within an 100 mile radius, I decided to simply let them kill me so I could restart the level. After all, I had to assume the game had saved my progress automatically since I was offered no option to do so myself. I assumed wrong. There didn't seem to be a saving system of any kind, and I was sent back to the beginning of the tutorial. Unwilling to waste another 30 minutes of my life, I uninstalled the game and was thankfully able to get a refund from steam.\n\nSo, to anyone reading this, don't waste your money on this game. Ignore all the rave reviews claiming it to stand the test of time. It does not.","March 15","false","0.4"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","1","10","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Goldbat/recommended/6980/","Goldbat","golbat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Goldbat/","86 products in account","This review will be amended as I play through the game. If you strongly disagree with any material in the review, please leave a comment on my profile and we can discuss it further.\n\nThe first thing you notice about Thief: Deadly Shadows are the load screens. These are understandable, given the higher level of graphical detail in this installment and being a home console release, but they are a bit disorienting compared to the much quicker load times of the previous installments. What's more noticeable are the various gameplay and story text blurbs included on these screens. For a series which previously established a noticeable lack of handholding the player, being reminded that you can knock enemies out with the blackjack is insulting.\n\nBut once you arrive at the title screen the problems really begin to pile up. There's no option to view the intro this time around, instead forcing players to idle at the title screen for a short time before the intro starts (more on it later). The carefully designed pre-rendered mechanical background has also been abandoned for a 3D Thief logo rotating Deus Ex-style against a 2D background. The background depicting the City lit up at night during a thunderstorm is also questionable. If I had to guess I'd say that the setting or story of Thief: Deadly Shadows is more nature-oriented, maybe revisiting the Pagans or some impending conflict judging by the storm.\n\nThe intro is noticeably lazier this time around, recycling a large amount of story art from the previous two games, as well as failing to provide any art that's relevant to the story in Deadly Shadows. The motion capture used during the action scene looks noticeably worse than what was seen in previous games, and the cheesy loot-collection jingle used during a cinematic made me roll my eyes.\n\nIn the options screen the ways in which Thief: Deadly Shadows restricts freedom for the players rears its head. There's no rope arrow, and the default binds for the various arrow types are different than the defaults for the previous two games. Forward leaning, an important part of collecting loot, is removed entirely, and the option to move forward slowly is gone as well. A button to toggle between a first and third person view exists as well, just so you know how much this game panders to a console audience.\n\nThe briefing screen has undergone a number of changes from it's previous iteration. Players can now perfom tasks while listening to the brief at the same time. This isn't really much of an improvement, since in the previous games briefings could simply be skipped with a button press. The briefings run for longer than in previous games and without the snappy editing and accompanying art they can be quiet boring to listen to on their own. There's no equipment to buy, and players are already told the explicit limit of what they can carry rather than just a large black box to group things in. An extra difficulty option has been added, and players can manipulate various difficulty factors such as AI behaviors.\n\nFrom the first moments of gameplay is when Thief: Deadly Shadows makes some of its strongest impressions on the player. Since it's a sequel running on a new engine the first moments of the game will have to work hard to offset whatever difficulties people have to adjusting to the new engine. Deadly Shadows manages to accomplish this poorly, by asking the player to walk, showing motion that feels extremely restrictive. You can even switch to 3rd person to see how ridiculous Garret's walking animation is.\n\nThe tutorial level is a joke, plain and simple. The amount of handholding and bottlenecking the game does to introduce things to the player is a complete departure from how the series has operated before. Placing the player into situations devoid of tension do little to actually teach them about real gameplay.\n\nAlso no freeview while climbing ladders. lol at the nonexistent range on the blackjack and the bow taking up most of the view.\n\ngame has crashed multiple times within my first time playing, uninstalliing, dogshit game.","August 30, 2015","false","1.7"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","0"

It's really not suited to open-ended environments and it shows in this game. About half your computer's power is spent trying to draw shadows and as a result, the levels themselves are too small and 'boxed in' to give this game the free-roaming sandbox feel that it's trying to achieve.\n\nI can't fault the atmosphere in this game. It's very dark and eerie, right down to Garrett's growling voice and background ambience when reading books. There are subtle prods towards cults and witchcraft and you find yourself in some very unfriendly places as the game progresses. It comes to a climax with 'the Cradle', the penultimate level of this game which is deemed to be one of the spookiest levels in a game, ever.\n\nHowever, the core gameplay is flawed. Moving about the world is a clunky experience. I like how you can look down and see your body, and that you can pull yourself up onto things, but I still felt disjointed and distant from the world. It just doesn't feel quite right. This extends to the combat, lockpicking and every bit of this game.\n\nThere are occasional flashes of brilliance, like when I discovered another thief who I found breaking into the place I was sneaking about in. Running away from guards / black figures (COUGH Cradle) is a nerve-wracking experience and discovering hidden treasure makes me happier than I should be.\n\nThis game is a very odd relic, stuck in an awkward transition period between old and new-style games. At the time, you could consider it a quirk of the game or assume that you were doing something wrong. Sadly, it just isn't worth playing today. Play Dishonored instead while you're waiting for Thief 4 to be released.","December 7, 2013","false","0.8"," 16 of 48 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","16","48","0","2"

The inability to run and the general slugishness of the movement made interacting the maps dificult. It sounds like all of the guards are being played by Gilbert Gottfried or Wallace Shawn, with dialog written for a childrens cartoon, which kept me from ever feeling any real tension or even caution.\nThe fighting mechanics were all but nonexistant, the plot seemed terribly dull, the enviroment was dull, the music was dull, and the lock mini-games were pointless; lockpicking didn't provide any risk or challenge - as in the Elder Scrolls, for example - but rather it was just moving the mouse around and drifting half asleep.","January 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 3 of 19 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","3","19","0","0"

For the layman, that means that this game is not that good. It's mechanics are broken (blackjack works 1/4 the time, freezes while trying to jump on a box in front of him like a ♥♥♥♥♥, turning corners while crouched was stilted), light sources go through walls, badly programmed (choose between bloom and AA? uh, ok) and it really is boring. You can literally stand right in front of someone and they wont see you till you are behind them and swinging a club at their head, then they take the club like a champ and go into alert mode. However, they dont inform anyone else of their findings. I stole a mission item and the guy who owned it said "someone stole it" and promptly went back to walking in circles. He was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that some guy would take it and then it is stolen and he goes "♥♥♥♥ it, I havent walked around this hallway enough times, I'll get to that later". I shot a chick in the face with an arrow. She ran away. Tried to jump through a window and the guy acts like I'm telling him to fly. Jump? Out this window? How about I just leap in place and alert everyone around me intsead? Great. ANY other game with stealth elements made in the same era is better. I was legitimately sad to not to like this as every reviewer in gaming history thought this game was the pinnacle of stealth gameplay. Yah, if you dont play any other games. Perhaps compared to what came out AT THE TIME but that would be a stretch because i could probably find a dozen games i would rather play than this.\nPurchase at your own risk.\n","March 20, 2014","false","2.8"," 0 of 19 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","19","0","0"

The game has robust and intriguing characters, a reactive environment and surprisingly realistic stealth, and an overall enjoyable thrill of thievery and sneaking around.\n\nThere are some things, however, that make this game awful. First is mostly a technical issue of screen problems and spontaneous lag, although this can be fixed with patches or some tweaking of the files. Not a dealbreaker.\n\nThe combat's sluggish and unappealing; it doesn't flow well at all. Which, to be fair, it's not supposed to (stealth game, and all, that dagger's a last resort), but even when forced into combat, Garett really can't do much.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of your game completely wiping your save files when you try to save. No warning or reason, it will crash on the save screen and wipe your current saves. That being said, you can download save files from the internet and continue as you wish, but honestly, doing a lot of hard, sneaking work, going through the first few chapters and getting the game down, and then it wipes your saves?\n\nDo not buy this game.

It is full of lots of juicy sneaking about and knocking people out from behind. The maps and the city between missions are full of opportunities for exploration - lots of alternate routes and hiding spots to explore, and ways to use the environment to your advantage. It's also full of different items to use, particularly an assortment of specialty arrows. For instance, one kind of arrow makes a bunch of noise where it lands to draw guards away.\nOne of the last couple of levels remains near or at the top of my list of most spine-tinglingly creepy moments in video games ever, and that's speaking as someone who didn't bat an eyelid at Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\nThe plot is also reasonably interesting, though I expect it helps if you've played the first two already. It finds ways to involve you in a pretty good variety of different situations. The levels themselves have plenty of interesting twists and turns, and are very well-designed.\n","May 23, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is all about being a thief and staying hidden.  If you're looking for fast paced action, this game is not for you.  The main focus is on the story.\n\nPros: The city is well crafted  with easy to recognize light and dark areas.  The clearly visible hiding spots are blended well into the environment making for some great atmosphere.  As you move around the world picking locks, extinguishing fires, and stealing valuables, the guards will notice anything out of place.  You really will feel that your actions have meaning in the world.  The stealth mechanics are almost unmatched.  But the best thing about this game is the story.  With excellent voice acting and plenty of cut scenes you will be immersed in the world.\n\nCons: Although the city is completely accessible, the game is a little linear.  As with most games the mechanics aren't perfect and you may find some funny quirks.  Nothing game breaking though.\n\nOverall, a pretty amazing game for the time.  The stealth and guard A.I. are phenomenal, not to mention a great story to boot.\n\nScore: 8.8/10","August 25, 2013","true","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has been updated with excelent graphics and advanced AI guards capable of being scaled from "dimwits in armor" to "omniscient and nearly invincible" who are able to investigate events with decent intelligence. The game reveals significant plot information pertaining to the previous two games but is more or less able to stand alone. The game does suffer from somewhat irritating bugs but most of these aren't game breaking. The game lacks the vast maps of the previous games but makes up for it somewhat in the variety of the missions and the relatively large quantity of them. This installation in the franchise boasts an explorable City environment where most people are not immediately hostile. The game is included with the previous two in a relatively cheap bundle and as such is a bargain.

This level is honestly the scariest level in any video game I've ever played (maybe apart from some Amnesia moments). By the time you reach it you've gotten so wrapped up in the well-built story that it affects you more. It's pretty morbid.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, really 10/10. It is very ambient, moody, dark. The cinematics are this weird sort of animation style, quite cool. The story line is interesting enough to justify wanting to play on just to find out what's up. The world in the game is detailed and fascinating. It's not sandbox but at some points pure anarchy can be caused on the city streets with guards and factions going nuts.\n\nA negative thing is the controls. I found that Garrett controlled very stifly, jumping feels awkward and he doesn't always seem to fit naturally with his environment (e.g. problems climbing, staying on narrow ledges). It's really irritating at times.\n\nI bought Thief 1 and 2 but can't get them playing on my PC so I've only experienced this game. So far I'm super impressed.

I got into this game without expectation, because it was the first thief game I have ever played. It turns out I got just about everything that I like most about a game from playing it. A fantastic story line (a very lengthy one too), stealth mechanics that are actually good, a great atmoshpere, characters, sounds, level design, and so many others that I look for in determining how well I like a game. Overall I was rather impressed with the whole thing, particularly the characters, the way the cutscenes were animated, and the graphics weren't all that bad for a game that was released in 2004. This one was an easy one to get immersed in, and I wish I had the ability to wipe all of my memories of this game so I could play it like it was new over and over again.","August 24, 2014","true","56.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a tad clunky, not as polished as it could have been, but a ton of fun. The story is amazingly interesting. The unique setting is enjoyably more realist than past entries in the series, it has a touch of steampunk and a touch of fantasy but neither is overpowering. The game takes place in one big city, which is littered with lore, loot, sidequests, and main missions. Exploring the city, instead of simply being transported from mission to mission (as in previous thief games), makes the experience feel more cohesive. Furthermore, this extension of the atmosphere conveys the place of the hammers, the keepers, and the pagans more clearly. Sadly, some of the items (like the rope arrow, invisibility potion, speed and slowfall potions) from the previous games did not make an appearance. The maps are a bit cumbersome to use because your current position is never indicated, forcing you to navigate by compass; luckily levels are, generally, simply laid out...but still assuredly interesting. Great atmospheric music! The mission 'Robbing the Cradle' is spookier than most horror games and the highlight of this game IMO. Unfortunately melee combat is a bit of a joke, and load times are a bit long. Despite this game's few unpolished aspects, I think its overall game design is fantastic and its gameplay undeniably fun. It's mysterious, suspensful, and satisfying. Good game, great Thief... highly recommended for stealth fans!","April 5, 2015","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While some may compare it as the lesser of the first three thief games, I personally found my most enjoyment Deadly Shadows.  For those who have yet to play any of the original thief games, I would reccomend this as your first.  The story is enjoyable, the controls are fluid, and the option to use third person is very helpful.  The interface is much more intuitive than Thief 1 and 2.  The graphics, while not great by today's standards, are 100x better than the first two thiefs.  Think of the graphics for Half Life 2, Morrowind, and Far Cry and then compare those to the graphics of Half Life (the original, not half life source) and System Shock to see the night and day difference between this Thief and its predecessors.  There are some random game crashes when playing in Windows 8, but changing compatability settings to windows xp service pack 3 seems to fix this.\n\nI would definitely reccommend this game.","March 10, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No way to exit from a situation with sheer force: Garret is not a muscle boy and will get killed soon.\n\nPros:\n+ excellent stealth system, balanced with combat: you are almost forced to stay out of fights as long as you can, and are rewarded for what you get, not for who you kill;\n+ maps are small but it's easy to get lost. No map indicators, only static drafts: I love this game for the courage in forcing the player to play in a conscious way;\n+plenty of freedom in planning your path.\n\nCons:\n- the graphics has not aged well: the game is only available in 4:3 resolutions and will flicker whenever the menu is opened. So poor performance;\n- since there is no map indicator, it's easy to get lost and get stuck with the mission. So far I was fine without googling, but I don't know if I will keep it up like this;\n- kind of awkward commands: sometimes you need to be in certain positions in order to get on a ledge or box, that exact position. Engine limits, I guess.\n\nAll in all, an awesome stealth game - the CORE of stealth games.","August 11, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an interesting take on a stealth game, and the story is actually pretty interesting and builds off of previous games. But you don't have to have played the previous ones to really understand this one, it just makes mention of events that happened in the previous games.

The voice actor is sadly bad in my opinion, his voice sounds a bit mouthy, but that is just me. Also the location's on the map usually highlight to show your location in the past thief games, in this one to me it doesn't. It doesn't show where I am, so it's basically useless.

The voice actor is sadly bad in my opinion, his voice sounds a bit mouthy, but that is just me. Also the location's on the map usually highlight to show your location in the past thief games, in this one to me it doesn't. It doesn't show where I am, so it's basically useless.

Very atmospheric.\nQuite lengthy, too. Lots of fun things to do.\n\nIn-between missions (After the tutorial level and the mission after that.) you can explore parts of the city and complete side-quests and find secrets, and just screw around, all with amazing atmosphere.\nWhat I did was I gave myself a ton of money with Cheat Engine so I could screw around with the game's wide array of items.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is to use Oil flasks to watch people slip in a slap-stick Home Alone movie manner.\nGood fun.\n\nI also like the implimentation of the wall-hug.\nOnly thing missing is Rope Arrows, the climbing gloves are pretty awesome though.\nSpidermaaaan spidermaaaan got his powers stolen by garrett's haaaand.\n\nThey're also kinda glitchy.\nYeah this game has some strange bugs and glitches. On rare occasions in certain areas, when climbing onto a ledge you could fall through the world.\nOccasionally, Garrett levitates due to a glitchy jumping system which is easily fixed by equipting the bow and arrow (any kind of arrow), clicking left mouse to hold the arrow, and then cancelling the shot with the space bar. You could also tap the mouse button to quickly do this.\n\nOh and Garrett can't swim anymore. Not that there's much water in the game anyway...\n\nI really like how the skybox has these cartoonish silhouette buildings with yellow boxes representing lit windows. Very well done. Really amazing atmosphere.\n\nThat reminds me, the lighting engine kicks ♥♥♥. Shadow volumes for the win. They don't have the blurry pixelation issue that more modern games have when it comes to lighting... New games have shadow resolutions... and they can be highly intensive... They also seem to have striping issues. Some people who play skyrim have striping issues with the shadows in that game.\nShadow Volumes need to be brought back into gaming. They could be used to create a sun ray effect, aswell.\n(Because shadow volumes is basically a method of extruding some polygons and anything within the bounds has their illumination set to a low amount to create a shadow, why not use those extra polygons instead of using them merely to emulate shadows? Emulating Shadows AND volumetric lighting would be killing two birds with one stone.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game, and I hope you will too.\nIf only it wasn't planned for a multi-platform release... Imagine what the game could have been.\nThere were some amazing parts in the game like the Thieves highway in Old Quarter. Imagine a massive city with a thieves highway creating a shortcut. The vision feels so ahead of time in my opinion.\nI could just imagine what the game would have been like if it didn't have to develop around the Classic Xbox's limitations. I mean some of the Xbox version's missions had to be shrinked...","January 5, 2014","true","44.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Alright, I confess - I miss the swordfighting the previous games had. :)\nWell, seriously, apart from that, everything became more "small scale". Streets became narrow, maps small and sectional (comparing to the maps of first two games, where you could easily get lost)... As I learned, this was done in order to be able to port the game to consoles.

It's not perfect and in terms of graphics and sound it shows it's age. However, the story is compelling if you allow yourself to see past the game engines limits. This is most likely a love it - hate it game due to it's age. I played this when it was new so the ability to replay the game was special. The "Orphanage" area is still completely creepy and honestly scary at times. The game improves as the story unfolds so continuing to play will be rewarded.\n\nThe basic mechanic of "Stealth" is what makes this game. You are Garrett, a master thief. You are not a fighter, you are a shadow. You do best when you knock out guards or, better yet, sneak past and continue. When you're deep in a Mansion and you snatch that special loot ... you realize that you haven't completed anything, now you must escape into the night with your prize.\n\nTo me, this is the only game in the Thief series that is worth playing and it shouldn't be confused with the other installments. This really is a stand-alone game.\n\nThis game does suffer from some NPC issues where they will behave in a frustrating manner. You will need to adjust your gamma and brightness at different times so you can "see" the shadows in which you can crouch undetectable.\n\nIt's difficult for me to rate this game so I will give it 2 ratings.\n\nFor the ability to be Garrett in an excellent story with an expansive world I'll rate this 8 out of 10.\n\nCompared to the expectations of modern gamers ...

While some may compare it as the lesser of the first three thief games, I personally found my most enjoyment Deadly Shadows.  For those who have yet to play any of the original thief games, I would reccomend this as your first.  The story is enjoyable, the controls are fluid, and the option to use third person is very helpful.  The interface is much more intuitive than Thief 1 and 2.  The graphics, while not great by today's standards, are 100x better than the first two thiefs.  Think of the graphics for Half Life 2, Morrowind, and Far Cry and then compare those to the graphics of Half Life (the original, not half life source) and System Shock to see the night and day difference between this Thief and its predecessors.  There are some random game crashes when playing in Windows 8, but changing compatability settings to windows xp service pack 3 seems to fix this.\n\nI would definitely reccommend this game.","March 10, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can still make out the details in dark spots, which is good because you're always thinking about the brightness where you're standing and thus how well people can see you.  It gets very tense when an enemy's on that cusp, trying to decide whether to go on alert or shrug off seeing or hearing you.

No way to exit from a situation with sheer force: Garret is not a muscle boy and will get killed soon.\n\nPros:\n+ excellent stealth system, balanced with combat: you are almost forced to stay out of fights as long as you can, and are rewarded for what you get, not for who you kill;\n+ maps are small but it's easy to get lost. No map indicators, only static drafts: I love this game for the courage in forcing the player to play in a conscious way;\n+plenty of freedom in planning your path.\n\nCons:\n- the graphics has not aged well: the game is only available in 4:3 resolutions and will flicker whenever the menu is opened. So poor performance;\n- since there is no map indicator, it's easy to get lost and get stuck with the mission. So far I was fine without googling, but I don't know if I will keep it up like this;\n- kind of awkward commands: sometimes you need to be in certain positions in order to get on a ledge or box, that exact position.

Perhaps I hold it to such a high standard because it may be saturated in nostalgia, as I have played it at a young age. This is the third game in the Thief series, and if you can't stand the older graphics of the first two games, I would recommend picking this one up, although even these graphics are relatively dated, so keep that in mind. Thief has a level of atmosphere that I haven't really seen any games match in comparison. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and creepy at times. There is a horror mission that might make the game worth picking up alone.\n\nAs far as story goes, you may have guessed it, your'e a Thief. Your'e character is Garrett, a cynical, and sarcastic loner, that just wants to be left alone to ply his trade. As you start out you're just doing thievish things, but then the story takes a mystical turn, as an old guild of sorts requires your'e help. The story has some underlying themes as well, that I think are noteworthy. I would recommend downloading the fan made patch if you have windows 10, as this may cause slight glitches. I give this game a 10/10. In part because of nostalgia, and I think it would truly deserve this rating at the time it came out.","August 15, 2014","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/6980/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","As far as I'm concerned, Deadly Shadows is to the Thief series what Invisible War is to Deus Ex, and I don't mean that in a bad way, because I enjoyed both. I mean this in terms of, it's using the same engine with similar system requirements, and suffers from similar problems.\n\nLet's start with what was added. The visuals are great, and even if they lack color, the pristine detail of nearly every model makes it look a generation ahead of its time. A lockpicking mechanic introduces gameplay more complex than "hold F to unlock". The city now serves as a hub, allowing the player to sell loot and buy equipment, and explore for extra challenges in an open-world environment. Even backtracking doesn't seem very tedious, due to the presence of hostile who roam the streets. A faction system allows the player to make friends or enemies with the Hammerites and Pagans, who in turn can provide backup in combat and freedom to explore their respective domains.\n\nHowever, a few things were removed. Rope and vine arrows are gone, replaced with gloves that allow Garrett to climb some walls. Also not present is the ability to swim. While Deus Ex: Invisible War dealt with this by simply removing water, Deadly Shadows has the player die in it, which just makes it seem like a tease. Moving the equipment purchases to shops means that, to restock, a player can no longer buy just before a mission. It goes hand-in-hand with the depth of city exploration, sure, but it makes a significant chunk of gameplay time just restocking. On a side note, the prices of these goods is far lower than that of the previous titles, so I don't find myself running into the same problem I had with Thief 2 (running out of useful items) as often here.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game, though, is the inefficient and somewhat clunky (modified) Unreal Engine 2, which, as I stated earlier, was also used in Invisible War. The small areas are handled considerably better here than they are in IW. Enemy patrols and depth of level design are well done, but the level transitions between these smaller levels is a sword that cuts both ways. On one hand, it provides a quick, if unfair escape from pursuit. On the other hand, enemies are left in the exact same spot and alert level when doing so, and going back to the area will lead to a pummelling.\nHandling also feels a little awkward. The hit detection isn't all that great, and I frequently found myself falling from places against my will because the ledge detection is so awful. My most common problem was with the jumping glitch, where Garrett will appear to be floating just above the ground, with no ability to jump or crouch.\n\nOverall, it's a good Thief game, a good stealth game, and a good game in general. Apart from the occasional crash and the removal of some perfectly functional mechanics from the previous games, this one successfully experiments and improves on a few of the other gameplay aspects.","June 22, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This level is honestly the scariest level in any video game I've ever played (maybe apart from some Amnesia moments). By the time you reach it you've gotten so wrapped up in the well-built story that it affects you more. It's pretty morbid.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, really 10/10. It is very ambient, moody, dark. The cinematics are this weird sort of animation style, quite cool. The story line is interesting enough to justify wanting to play on just to find out what's up. The world in the game is detailed and fascinating. It's not sandbox but at some points pure anarchy can be caused on the city streets with guards and factions going nuts.\n\nA negative thing is the controls. I found that Garrett controlled very stifly, jumping feels awkward and he doesn't always seem to fit naturally with his environment (e.g. problems climbing, staying on narrow ledges). It's really irritating at times.\n\nI bought Thief 1 and 2 but can't get them playing on my PC so I've only experienced this game. So far I'm super impressed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/6980/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A somewhat sandboxy Thief game with side activities you can do in town when you're not on a mission. Specific activities however are activated from finding notes and eavesdropping on chatter which you can also do on your own time or within the time given.\n\nSomething that was pretty much shown on screenshots of the game is Garrett himself in third person; the option to go into this perspective feels weird at first since the first two games were strictly first person though it may not take too long to get used to. This function can prove useful and makes the implemented lean function relatively obsolete.\nThere won't be anymore swimming either for anyone as in no one, not even Garrett, can swim now; people simply die from dropping into big bodies of water.\nWhen trying to climb over walls or obstacles or whatever it doesn't seem to always work, which can be very problematic when making quick climbs while a guard is very close. The game would think you just jumped or dropped from a small height which would make a sound for anyone close to hear.\n\nAnother big change is the lockpicking. Instead of having to manually select a specific lockpick to pick a lock and then select another to finish the job you go through a more involved way of lockpicking. This time you go through a small & simple lockpicking minigame that's a little more realistic and can be a lot faster the more you get used to it.\n\nLike the first two games directions aren't straightforward though your compass is now implemented on to the UI. For a number of missions you'd have to find a map for said location you'd have to go to if you're seeking any form of directional help though it isn't mandatory. Also many of the things you find that progresses a mission are pointed out a lot more. The mission levels themselves feel a little smaller and somewhat more linear as in there's not too much to walk through and not too many additional ways to reach objectives.\nThis time around, after you think you've stolen enough loot or completed a mission, you have to actually go find a fence to sell the loot you stole for gold and travel to another shop to buy equipment.\n\nIt's still overall as somewhat clunky as the first two games but it's at least still pretty satisfying to thief around.\n\nSide note: The game would crash for me every time I finished the tutorial level without downloading a sort of patch.","April 28, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps I hold it to such a high standard because it may be saturated in nostalgia, as I have played it at a young age. This is the third game in the Thief series, and if you can't stand the older graphics of the first two games, I would recommend picking this one up, although even these graphics are relatively dated, so keep that in mind. Thief has a level of atmosphere that I haven't really seen any games match in comparison. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and creepy at times. There is a horror mission that might make the game worth picking up alone.\n\nAs far as story goes, you may have guessed it, your'e a Thief. Your'e character is Garrett, a cynical, and sarcastic loner, that just wants to be left alone to ply his trade. As you start out you're just doing thievish things, but then the story takes a mystical turn, as an old guild of sorts requires your'e help. The story has some underlying themes as well, that I think are noteworthy. I would recommend downloading the fan made patch if you have windows 10, as this may cause slight glitches. I give this game a 10/10. In part because of nostalgia, and I think it would truly deserve this rating at the time it came out.","August 15, 2014","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got you covered.\n\nYou want a story that strings together the locations in a coherent way, but doesn't try to be more than it is?
