So you know, take my opinion with a grain of salt (but you should always take opinions with grains of salt.)\n\nSeriously though, if you need a small game you can play for five minutes on your lunch break, Instant Dungeon is pretty rad. Absolutely tiny, a fair few game modes to unlock and there's always a highscore to beat, with the high speed instant death maze spelunking always keeping you on your toes.","November 25, 2014","true","0.1"," 61 of 84 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","61","84","0","4"

(Although after some attempts runs can get long).\n\nObviously I haven't covered every aspect of the game as I like to keep my reviews fairly short, however I will add that at the time of writing the developer is active and very much in touch with the players.\n\n= Fantastic little maze-dungeon highscore game.","December 14, 2014","true","11.1"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

Look no further! This game is what you need!\nDeveloper: With the Love Studios\nPublisher: Flying Interactive\nRelease Date: 25 November, 2014\n\nInstant Dungeon! lives up to it’s name.\nOnce you press New Game you are in a Dungeon … in an instant!\nHence, the name Instant Dungeon!\n\n…\n\nWell after we cleared let us go into the Dungeon for that we shall find treasure and save Princesses in despair!\n\n\nThe Story is … Well there’s no Story but who needs a Story anyway? Let’s cut the chase.\nIn Instant Dungeon! you slip into the role of a number of certain Characters. By default the characters are chosen randomly since it doesn’t matter which Character you are. However if you happen to like one you can choose this character and happily die with him as many times as you want. That’s it. There’s no Story of some sort but to be quite honest you don’t even need one. The game is fun without one. Not to mention it’s the perfect game if you just want to delve into a dungeon without any hassle.\n\nWill you choose to be a heroic King? Or will you be a Wizard? Or are you someone else each time you visit the dungeon?You can choose several different game modes. In Action Recipe you explore the dungeon and collect treasure to earn a high score and in Boss Blend you enter Boss levels to collect treasure.\nSo there’s pretty much a game mode for everyone out there but in order to unlock those you have to reach a specific Level in Action Recipe.\n\nNow we shall slay some dragons!... or not?What else is there to say? Well the game is fairly simple.\nYou choose a mode and you spawn in a Dungeon (duh!) and you make your way through hordes of Skeletons, Zombies and Goblins and certain Bosses.\nNow the thing is you spawn without any weapon or armor and you can’t kill anything in Instant Dungeon! unless you find a Dagger or an Axe or if you fancy the arcane you can cast a Fireball right into this Goblins face! The only downside is … you can’t kill a boss. Well they can kill you but you can’t kill them. But fear not! You don’t even have to. Just collect all the treasure while they try to burn you alive. It isn’t all that hard and the treasure is the sole reason we entered the dungeon anyway!\n\nAfter I found myself some nice treasure …I have to say the game is better than I expected. It’s outstandingly good at what it does.\nIf you are in need of a quick dungeon fix this game is the perfect solution for you.\nOverall I enjoyed playing the game and I can see myself getting caught in the depths of the Instant Dungeon! everyone now and then.","May 26, 2015","true","0.8"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","26","35","0","0"

I am glad I did because it is super fun. The game takes the new mechanics of procedural generation and mixes it with old 8 bit themes and gameplay. What results is a solid game with the right amount of addictiveness that will keep you entertained for hours.\n\nYou play as any number of the randomly generated heroes and your goal is to make it through the maze like levels and progress deeper and deeper into the dungeon. It is a roguelike with no carry over so after each death its a clean slate. As you delve deeper into the game it becomes much harder with larger levels and more and more baddies in each level. There are items, both offensive and defensive, that you can pick up to help you on your way. From axes, throwing knives and magic spells to shields helmets and torches to see better.\n\nIf this was all the game had it would be worth the money and then some but the creators decided to throw in even more awesomeness. There are several different game modes. There is a questing game mode where you have to kill x amount of a certain bad guy, there is a saviour mode where you have to save another hero from the boss and escape without dying plus quite a few more mode that I have not unlocked yet but fully intend on doing.\n\nAll in all this game is a $2 gem that everyone should play. Unfortunately I feel like it was overshadowed because it release the same time as this Thanksgiving steam sale.\n\nIf you found my review helpful let me know by clicking yes at the bottom. Until next time cheers\n","November 28, 2014","true","4.1"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","22","28","0","0"

Good variety of items, good variety of game modes, and provided a decent challenge at times. The enemies are mostly the same, save for the amount of treasure they drop and some very slight AI changes. Most of the achievements are very boring stat grinds, but they're easy to farm if you can figure out which modes to play on.

Want to go spelunking and see how far you can get and what score you can get with no real need to worry about story and real progression then give this a boot up!  There's definitely an interesting variety of weapons/items you can grab and use as you get further into the "dungeon".\n\nAchievements were kind of a pain, especially the last few (the wraiths in particular).  If you can get far enough in the normal mode (level 40 I think) then you unlock a mode that definitely helps with that particular type of grinding.  Some of the modes are just...a huge difficulty skip as it puts you practically into the further levels (with respective monsters and lightning conditions).  The "quest" and "retrieve a friend" modes were amusing to tinker with.  And if you want to compete with a leaderboard there's that too.\n\nFor the cost it is and for what is really there (the pictures and videos on the store page basically show it), I felt it was worth the cost.

You have no abilities of your own, your interactions with the dungeon are entirely through the many items you'll find scattered around. Weapons can be thrown at enemies, scrolls offer various defensive, offensive, or beneficial effects, torches and keys do exactly what you think.\n\nThis is, simply put, the most adorable dungeon game ever. You pick from the roster of bubble-headed characters and are plopped into a tiny dungeon with happy music. Enemies present like cuddly stuffed animals and move about with silly little animations. Defeat an enemy with an item and it crumples to the floor with a dejected frowny face.\n\nThe first time I got killed by an enemy because I goofed up, I said "Oh no!" and chuckled when I got sent back to the very beginning. Every time I lost thereafter was exactly the same. I run into a happy weretiger; I get run over by a smiling pumpkin; the happy boss guy blows me up; "Oh no!", chuckle or laugh. The most annoyed I ever get is "Eh, I shouldn't have done that." Even losing itself is somehow fun. In no other game in my Library or collection would my reaction to death and losing all my progress be the same reaction that I would have to seeing a kitten get stuck in a cardboard tube.","October 1, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The beauty of this game is in its simplicity. It's the most basic kind of dungeon crawler, and as the name implies, one that you can just pick up and play anytime.\n\nGameplay revolves around collecting power-ups, avoiding/killing monsters, finding a floor's key, and then finding the exit, with bosses every five levels in the main game mode. This simple formula, combined with the mechanic of each progressive floor getting darker and thus more challenging to navigate, provides a surprising amount of fun, and the atmosphere is, at times, unquestionably tense.\n\nLike any good rogue-like (as this could be classified, were it more prone to complexity), Instant Dungeon is designed to be played over and over again, each death teaching the adventurer a new lesson. Expect to die many times and, depending on the type of person you are, possibly curse the monsters that murder you. (Maybe that goes without saying.)\n\nSadly, my achievement-centric style of playing Steam games ensures no future play session of Instant Dungeon will be as fulfilling, thanks to my gapless collection of colorful trophy squares.","March 24","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is in my eyes the best part of the game. If you die, you only have yourself to blame and no one else. Also the weapons are quite easy to use. Especially awesome are the bosses. Every five levels you get one, and as far as i saw, i liked them. Ecept the Boss-dungeons, the other levels are to an (to me) unknown extent randomly generated.\n\nThe only negativ point i found so far, is only due to personal preference. Seeing you are getting coins (which i now know are for highscore) i thougt it had some RPG-component, buying weapons, armor or other equipment (maybe later, i do not have every mode enabled yet).\n\nConsidering the low price and the hours of fun you can get out of the game, i can only recommend it.\n\nAlso, from my own experience, if you have a problem running the game (actually was kind of my own fault) the guy who programmed the game will not rest, until it works.","December 14, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

One hit means death and starting over.  It's a basic maze puzzler with a fantasy setting of dungeons and monsters.  It's not easy - large mazes, lighting, and challenging boss monsters will require you to think and strategize.\n\nHowever the game has many different modes of challenge - from collecting treasures to completing quests, to rescues, and more.  The better you do, the more modes you unlock - which does a nice job of challenging you to do better and master the game.\n\nA great retro look, solid game play, a bargain price, and something you can play for a few minutes or a few hours, this is definitely a game to look into.

That wouldn't be so bad, as the action and the aesthetic are enjoyable, but there is no form of checkpointing whatsoever; it doesn't matter how non-challenging and pointless the first ten levels are, you will have to go through them again in full every time you die in the main mode, and it is very easy to die.\n\nAlso, so many of the achievements are variations on "use/collect/kill a large number of Game Element X" that if you want to unlock achievements, it feels like a huge grind-fest, and if you want to progress through the harder levels, it feels like a capricious grind-fest having to get through the levels which are a cakewalk to you now before you reach a challenge.\n\nIt's a real pity, because the limited visibility navigation that the game is largely built around is actually really cool, and with some more content and maybe some limited checkpointing capacity, you could have a really excellent game here.\n\nUnfortunately, it falls short and is more frustrating than fun.","July 19, 2015","false","16.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qwikstreet/recommended/326720/","qwikstreet","Qwikstreet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qwikstreet/","47 products in account","This is a fun little game. It is a good filler of 5 to 10 minutes of time after your initial session with the game. I enjoy the dungeon crawl mixed with Pac Man. Every game you start off on level 1 and progress through larger, harder, and darker levels mixed with boss levels. The levels are created randomly along with monsters and items for every game (except the boss levels). As you get into the higher levels, your choices of weapons, spells, and items increase. The one downfall I have is each killing item/spell is a one hit kill on every monster I ran into (except bosses). It would of been interesting and harder if certain monsters acted differently with lesser items like the beginning throwing knives.\n\nThere are various modes other than the story mode to keep it some what fresh.\n\nI picked this game when it was on sale and was a steal. It's an enjoyable romp for what it is billed as which is practically a 5 minute filler. If you see it on sale, especially a heavy discount, I would buy it. Depending on how deep of a discount, I would buy again as gifts for some close friends.","December 27, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/funlerz/recommended/326720/","funlerz","Funlerz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/funlerz/","123 products in account","Instant Dungeon! is a pixelated show of purely random adventure. You can quickly start up the game, select what type of adventure you want to have and start delving into an endless stream of dungeons. There are plenty of different game modes, ranging from easy to insane!\n\nFor such a simple game, just pac-man with power-ups and more monsters than just ghosts, it can be challenging and frustrating. But most of all, it can be fun. Running around avoiding zombies until you get a scroll so you can blast them with a fireball and make a dash to the exit is always satisfying in this game!\n\nEven if you lost the game and die, it will start you off in a brand new dungeon for you to explore so you don’t even have to go back to the main menu, as long as you don’t mind playing the same game mode again. The only bad part about this is that each dungeon looks identical to the last one, just with slightly different layouts. The graphics are charming enough but after a few rounds you wish all of the walls didn’t look so similar.\n\nOne of the biggest things about Instant Dungeon! is that it is a very classic-style dungeon crawler. Simple graphics and simple gameplay. To really round out the classic feel, you have got to play it with a controller or joystick of some kind; it just feels perfect when you do!\n\nBut for such a small procedural game, it does a pretty good job with the generation. There are no dead ends that would allow you to get cornered by a single bad guy, although if two came at you then you might be in trouble. Even the music in this game is procedurally generated so you have new beats to listen to each time you boot it up.\n\nA vast array of enemies, powerups, and game modes keeps the game interesting. For $2 this classic arcade dungeon crawler is a steal! It’s a good time waster when you have a few minutes to waste away and want a great distraction!\n\nMy rating for Instant Dungeon! - 7/10","February 23, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You would think that as you go further into the game it gets harder as you go, well it's surprisingly easy because most of the time the exit is rendered literally right next to where you spawned with the key right next to it. The game seemed hopeless but there was one saving grace that actually made this game truly enjoyable. The Adventure Mix mode makes you utilize all of its items and gives the player something to do. This mode gives you interesting tasks to do in the dungeon itself. Weather it be killing 5 skeletons or collecting  gems through out the dungeon. This mode truly saves the game for being boring and it keeps it fun and refreshing.\n\nIf you are interested in this game be sure that the first few gamemodes are pretty crappy but there is one gamemode that makes this game worth the $2","January 24, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are multiple gameplay modes which add a little bit of variety and provide varying degrees of difficulty (e.g. Weak Sauce gives you multiple lives and the opportunity to collect more treasure and wrack up higher scores, while Soul Succor allows you to dungeon crawl in complete darkness).","November 2, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The randomization definitely adds an addictive aspect to the game. Playthroughs are similar, where enemies will scale with each room in succession, but never exactly the same. It's good for short sprints or marathon runs in quest mode.\n\nAll in all, is it good for two dollars? Yes.","November 3, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
