It follow the tale of (you guessed it) the champion of the gods and the choices and dilemmas he faces in his destiny. The story is a decent length, when compared to other Choice Games interactive novels. The pacing is quite good, and there are a fair amount of action moments in the story. It took me only an hour to read, so interpret that how you will. The story is pretty good, and the author's creativity shows through clearly, blending their own writing style with the lore of the gods and fate. I did not notice any spelling or grammar errors in my reading of the story. Overall, an enjoyable read, especially at sale price. Supporting these kind of stories if you enjoy them also helps get more published on Steam. If you ever enjoyed stories about Greek mythology (Heracles, Perseus, etc.), this is  a must read.","July 17, 2015","true","2.7"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

Most of which I own on other devices out side of Steam.\n\nOut of all those Choice of Robots would be my favorite with MechaAce close behind and I recommend both because while the plot is still somewhat linear the branches have more impact. Champion of the Gods, follows more along the lines of FateHaven and for those unfamiliar it comes down to making a choice, and still being shoehorned along one path.\n\nI still yearn for a save function as well, most argue that it gives choices more impact but ultimately it really kills replayability, want to see what happens at the end if you pick choice B instead of A? You have to replay the whole thing. From the beginning.\n\nIt's frustrating. Also, I don't know offhand if there are keyboard shortcuts, I've tried some of the obvious choices but it seems the mouse is the only method to advance through the pages. Nothing even lines up either so you can't just place your mouse and click to skip through dialogue you've already read.\n\nConsidering the amount of games they have under their belt now this still hasn't changed, and it needs to.\n\nThe writing is alright, it's the main (and arguably only) appeal of the game so how does it hold up? It's good. It's still has the draw that will keep you up for 'just a bit more' to see what happens next. Recently it's come to my attention that some of the wording in their games is due to their political stances and requirements they place which just seems kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The thread is in the community discussions, might be gone if you're seeing this later but it might not.\n\nIt's not the reason for the No vote though, the reason is I'm sick and tired of the crap save system. I want save points, I kept bookmarks for actual books like this why can't I have save points so I can go back to a point in the story without GOING THROUGH THE ENTIRE GAME?!","July 21, 2015","false","3.1"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","5"

This game was a very pleasant exception to me.\n\nThere were moments when I thought "damn, I wish the author thought about including this or that". But just playing a bit further revealed that the author actually thought about this too. It was one of the rare games, where by the end of it I actually felt like it's a complete story, finished just the way I wanted it to end.\n\nThe stats are non-intrusive and absolutely logical. I have never felt the urge to redo something just to fix my stats a bit, like I did in some of the games.\nThe choices and consequences are there and of the two playthroughs I've had, I didn't find a single choice that wouldn't at least change a scene or two, which is great - the replayability is definitely there.\n\nAnd one last thing I simply MUST mention. The game is finished. With the current trend of many great games (CYOA, I mean, of course) being "Part 1, wait for another game to see what's coming!", it's a breath of fresh air. The pacing is great. The length is perfect. The endings are satisfying. And yet if author wanted to, he could still write a continuation to that story, I bet. That's how you do these games. Amazing.\n\nSo, overall, this is one of, if not the best Choice of Games adventures I've been through.

I wasn't sure if this one would end up standing out or not from the demo, but it did. Then length is very good, so it's worth it's money at least in content. It doesn't tackle any particularly new ideas, but it's not trying to as much as set you in an ancient tale. This is fine, it does it well. You feel like you have quite a bit of agency, some of the twists are not easily predicted, I found no obvious bugs in mechanics or dialogue, the stats you built are meaningful and consistant, and the writing quality stays solid through to the end. It might not be a title I recomend to people who are new to text adventures or CoG brand in particular over some other riveting titles, but it is a really enjoyable game. The price is pretty reasonable for the content, but if you're not sure about it, picking it up during a sale is resonable. If you come to enjoy the genre, definitely check out their website for more of their games since they're not all on Steam.

By that I mean, it does not COMPARE to choice of robots, in my opinion, the best of the "choice of" games so far. The usual formula is here, your actions effect stats and how the story plays out, but not even close to the extent choice of robots did. It has one storyline and you have no choice but to follow it, want to rebel against the gods entirely? Refuse to follow their commands whatsoever? Sorry cupcake, you're being forced to. The story itsef isn't...bad, its just limited by how little your actions seem to affect the story.\n\nAlright, I'm gonna give you an example, late in the game you come to a point where your character sees...and you get three options to what type of person they are, but no matter what you choose they are completely enamoured with you from the moment you meet, and the choice does absolutely nothing but affect what clothes she/he may wear and that is it, that's what you get. This character is by all means, the central love interest, but he/she has absolutely zero personality, no offence choice of, but you've managed to make a "♥♥♥♥ on beanpole" character IN A TEXT ADVENTURE. The story is incredibly linear even down to the fine detail, early on you get a choice of what powers you have, but from that point on the only interest in combat sections (of which there are less than 7) is trying to figure out what stats these decions go by, you picked speed? Find the option that includes any of the following words: Quickly, swift, evade etc. Oh and another thing, THERE IS NO FAIL STATE. You are physically incapable of losing this game, choice of robots made me value my characters life because I knew if they died I would have to start over, no matter how badly you may fail you just spring back up and keep moving.\n\nYes, ok, it involved me when I played it, but half of that was assuming there were other directions to go in, I was expecting the ability to be the villain, to have another hero replace me and have a climactic final battle that didn't rely on stats but your own personal intelligence, but nope, its all just stat registering and more stat registering. The game made me value some of the characters, but then I realised in the act of writing this that I only valued their lives because those steamy lines of text were about all that was keeping me going...as well as that sweet sweet achievment.\n\nIt's an ok game, its by no means an open game, I say it's far inferior to some of Choice of's other games, like choice of robots, by that first, then buy this, if you still feel like it. You aren't getting out of here without a recommendation champion of the gods, but only just.","July 24, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have enjoyed it so far. The replayability is huge and feels always different. This story is my 5,00 Euro worth. If you like reading interactive stories then Champion of the Gods is worth it. You can do it with friends and family, asking how to person would act. You can create many character personalities, someone who is cynical about god or one who is zealous or cut everyone in your way with your anger. It is your story.\n\nPros\n- Multiple ways\n- Good balance between action and peace.\n- Low priced\n- Simple English\n- Very entertaining\n- Long stories\n\nCons\n- No music. (Is easy to fix, just get some good music in the background)\n\n\n\n","July 19, 2015","true","4.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/textfield/recommended/386520/","textfield","Textfield","http://steamcommunity.com/id/textfield/","97 products in account","I really like the story and i'm still playing it.\n\nI Know this is a text-adventure game, but it's still too lazy on the front-end side. As a designer, here are my notes to improve that feedback;\n\nBetter Typography for less stressful reading experience\n\n- I think the typography is really weak. The dialogues, story and any other text-based information uses the same style. I think the emotions, the story and the dialogues should be used with different typographic presentation. (for example; dialogues should be bigger and more contrast in color, whereas the story could be a bit smaller.) I believe this will in general reduce the stress for the pages that have TOO MUCH TEXT.\n\n\nSounds (Background / Ambient) as feedback\n\n- Also, i think background music / ambient sounds would be very effective for the game. When in battle, a more dramatic music, or when in a Town Hall or somewhere near danger, a bit stressful music. Also when your attempt fails or works. I mean there are tons of opportunities of aural feedbacks.\n\n\nSubtle Visual Elements\n\n- Yes i still know it's a text-adventure game, but subtle visual elements would enhance the gameplay feedback still.\nFor example some background image when your environment changes, or again, when you success or fail. Or when one of your stat increases - decreases, or you have a new gift etc. I'll talk about that in the GUI section.\n\n\nGUI\n\nThe game also has GUI in the "stats" section. Which contains your characters summary, her stats, attributes, gifts etc. These are visual elements, but for some reason they are poorly presented, and even hidden from the game. Text is visual, and i think representing those Attributes, Gifts, Items etc. in-game as a Graphical User Interface would be much more powerful. (Blizzard's spell icons is a nice example)\n\nThose elements i just mentioned are used in the game called Cypher, it looks like a REALLY nice text-based game. I just think being a text-adventure game does not compensate the lack of visuals still. I'm having fun, but i sometimes get bored when it's a huge chunk of text with no visual polishes in it.\n\nI recommend it though.","July 19, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hence I will not waste my time complimenting the brilliance of writing and intricacy of the game’s world – these elements are default for them, which are a great responsibility and a sign of player’s trust at the same time. Let us instead consider this particular gem.\nUpon reading about the game being inspired by Greek myths I dreaded the prospect of dealing with another mash of centaurs and gorgons for the tenth time.

I hope that just like in life, having some principles will give me some of a reward ^^.\nSeriously, if you ever feel like you could enjoy the game, just buy it, it's quite cheap and brought me as much excitement as some games/mangas/books/shows/films that i have played/read/seen.\nIn my opinion, putting in some well drawn pictures once in a while could make it even better, but after i finished this game, i'm still gonna rerun it, and when i'll be bored of this one, i'll buy another of the same style.\n\nMy opinion : JUST-FOCKING-GOOD","July 23, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hence I will not waste my time complimenting the brilliance of writing and intricacy of the game’s world – these elements are default for them, which are a great responsibility and a sign of player’s trust at the same time. Let us instead consider this particular gem.\nUpon reading about the game being inspired by Greek myths I dreaded the prospect of dealing with another mash of centaurs and gorgons for the tenth time. Boy was I mistaken. There is none of typical tropes of ancient Greece in this story. There is no Zeus or Hades; in fact you probably will not meet any of the familiar names. So what is the deal with Greek inspiration then? The developers done somethings I didn’t dare to dream of. They have captured to vibe of ancient Greek tragedy in their narrative. The feeling of a struggle against forces beyond your control or comprehension permeates the story. The questions of fate and free will aren’t mere peculiarity any more – they are vital. And no matter what you do the gods will screw you at their first whim in ways you can’t even guess. You are just a pawn in a giant game of cosmic chess.\n…\nOr are you?\n…\nThis is a very exciting game. “Choice of robots” probably still holds the gold, but “Champion of the Gods” takes a definitive silver amongst the developer’s works.\n","August 8, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But much like a how a book can pull you in, this story can be so engrossing that you look past the archaic nature of it and enjoy it for the sum of it's parts.\n\nBecause I've played some of their previous titles and trust in this developer to deliver quality text games, I jumped on this when I saw it on sale for 2.99. It did not disappoint.\n\nYou play the role of a mortal that gradually becomes aware of their growing power, and of a greater destiny. But this power does not come freely, and the responsibilities that come with embracing it ( or are thrust upon you, depending on your character ) lead to many challenges.\n\nThe game borrows here and there from Greek culture, mythology, and folklore to set up a world to tell the story you want to read. You can play the part of the brave warrior, a reluctant hero, a cruel tyrant, etc. The story itself will generally go in the same vague direction every time, but enough of the details change that if you can get absorbed in your character and the various outcomes, you will enjoy it.\n\nThe only things that bothered me were that sometimes the choices didn't make it clear which stat an action drew upon. For instance, during a battle scene, I thought throwing a spear might rely upon dexterity and quickness, and chose it because I thought it fit my character. Nope! Turns out it's more strength than anything else. There's a few moments like that, but you can figure out the lion's share of the choices.\n\nAll in all, I had fun with it. It took me just over 5 hours from start to finish, but I feel I got my money's worth, and I've yet to start my second run. The ending hints at more games to come in the series, and I sure hope so. I want my chance to break even with the Gods for all the guff they've given me.","July 19, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not. This is a very amaturish and not very compelling choose your own adventure.","March 16","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Had more fun with this one than all the 'Heroes Rise' stories put together. Might also be because I like the overall setting better, who needs super powers when you can stylishly dismount some bandit from his horse? Also I got to kill a giant snake monster thingy by slicing up it's heart, because I'm a badass. Hahahaha! Oh, also may have kinda wrecked a city...whoops...\n\nPros:\n-Multiple endings\n-Story is really good\n-Setting is really nice, I could actually pictured a Greek-esque landscape and everything\n-You really like you are the character engaging in battle and being diplomatic. Atleast I did personally.\n\nCons:\n-linear is certain places, but that's the nature of these kinda games.\n-Attribute system seemed a bit, unbalanced. Hopefully a sequal or spin-off will have an improved version it.\n-Where is said sequal and or spin-off?????? Lol that's not really a con. :P (It could be though, just sayin...)\n\nI'd mos def play it again and recomend it to everyone. 10/10","March 23","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The adventure is epic, the decisions really feel like they matter, there are so many ways to succeed and fail and the feelz!  Great story, great writing, takes a little bit from homer's odyssey and other greek-like myths butt still feels fresh, well planned and very well thought out.  Tin Star will be the next one I purchase and play after this one.","May 3","true","84.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
