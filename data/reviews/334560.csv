In Square Heroes you create your owngenetically engineered killing machine that's only goal in life is to kill anything that moves, fight off aliens or even collect gnomes because gnomes are cool.\n\n+Nice cartoony graphics\n+Characters, both player and computer are well designed and somewhat remind me of BattleBlock's design\n+Quite a few different maps, each in a different environment\n+Quite a few different game modes ranging from Team Deathmatch to Gnome Hunt\n+Lots of weapons to unlock as you level up\n+Lots of character headwear to unlock as you complete achievements, each one has a different buff and debuff that goes with it\n+Great AI with different difficulty settings\n+Takes a fair few kills to unlock your weapons once in a match which means it's difficult for someone to get miles ahead of everyone else\n+Super simple controls\n+Bucket loads of fun when playing with friends\n+No idea how they achieved this but even when players have a super high ping the gameplay is still super smooth and there's very little lag\n+Nice music and sound effects\n+Has great local co-op and you can still play online even with four local players\n+Has a Achievement Hunter reference, as an AH fan this makes me very happy\n+Awesome devs who are super friendly, very active in the forums and fix issues with the game very quickly\n\n+/-The devs have focused on getting the multiplayer right and have neglected the singleplayer portion of the game, if you're looking for MP only then that's great but if you want some good SP too you might be disappointed\n\n-You can't create private matches, kind of annoying if you're trying to play with five friends and a random player joins\n-Apart from changing your character's colour and their headwear there's not much in the way of character customisation\n\nVerdict:\n8.5\n\nA super fun multiplayer experience with nice cartoony graphics, well designed characters, lots of unlockables and great devs to back it all up. If you're looking for a fun multiplayer experience with friends I strongly suggest you picking this awesome game up!\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","April 11, 2015","true","1.9"," 65 of 77 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","65","77","3","5"

That's the best description I'll ever be able to come up with for this game. A game that's meant to be played with friends (surely you've at least one of those).\n\n"I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Let's face it, friends make life a lot more fun.\n\nCharles R. Swindoll"\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Square Heroes.\n\nGameplayThe player gets to customise a character that will later be used as a personal weapon of mass destruction, or as a punching bag. Not only will that character fight with pride and honor, killing foes and moving up the ranks, it will also gain new weapons and abilities to allow the player to be even better at whacking said foes. Both graphics and soundtrack/sound effects are merely a drop in the ocean of awesomeness that Square Heroes is. I do, however, strongly advice playing it with friends. If you don't have any, I'm sure you can find some on google!\nThe more you play, the better you'll become, even if it’s only due to better weapons/abilities!\n\nPros Easy to pick up;\nControls are as simple as they come;\nWith each level comes a new weapon/ability, thus keeping the game interesting;\nCartoonish graphics, which make smacking your friends a memorable thing;\nThe soundtrack is good and so are the sound effects (whack whack!);\nGood variety of maps;\nVery fun multiplayer.\nCons Single player mode lacks some excitement;\nCould use some more options to customise the character.\nVerdictI'd give it a 8/10 Really fun game to play with friends, you'll surely enjoy whacking their virtual pawns.","April 21, 2015","true","1.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/334560/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nSquare Heroes reminds me of a mash up between Awesomenauts and Worms. This fast paced side scrolling twin stick shooter grabs your attention right from the start. The cute art style is very well presented, and the music is oddly catchy.\n\nGameplay wise, you are a square with a jetpack, and you have to complete tasks depending on which game mode you are playing. These vary from team death match right the way up to Capture the gnome. My favourite has to be "Capture the Gnome"; it is essentially domination type game where you have to hold the gnome (flag) for a couple of seconds in order to capture it. This can lead to some pretty crazy scenes at the gnome point, more often than not; it results in someone blowing 3 or 4 other people up in order to save anyone at all capturing the gnome.\n\nEven though the game has just come out, I was very easily able to find a game online and jump straight in. Even though I ended up missing the first five minutes of the match, this seems to be a very see-saw type game as you can soon catch up with everyone else.\n\nYet again, this is another game with added local co-op and is an excellent game to play when you just want to kick back for 15 minutes or so. I highly recommend playing Square Heroes with your friends on voice as it is an absolute blast.\n","April 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","21","32","3","0"

I gotta say, i got this first on desura, and it's nice to see this game on steam. I was happy to play this on steam now but sadly there arent still many players around the game. The game kinda has the gameplay of Square Off, dual stick side scrolling jetpacks and shooting, the gameplay itself is mostly pvp and atleast it has its single player option but not much of a story. The game itself is fun and very well for my controller. It's a great game and i recommend this game to those who like this kind of side scrolling shooting games.","April 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

With more coins collected, you'll automatically upgrade your arsenal through out the match. You'll then take that newly earned arsenal and blast your player controlled enemies for points! It's an easy to get into multiplayer game that has a fair amount things to collect and upgrade as you play.\n\nThe game features a cartoony aesthetic with hilariously expressive characters, with a vibrant and bright color pallet. It also offers a variety of game modes to play through, such as death match, team death match, capture points, and survival. There's also lots of incentive to replay as you can upgrade your weaponary, as well as earning new cosmetic items to add in that extra spice of flavor.\n\nThe game is definitely multiplayer focused. The single player that is available is little more than a basic tutorial to teach you the game's mechanics. The single player in the game to be honest isn't all that engaging, it's all about shooting your friends and strangers online. That's where the potential problems may come. Though the game itself is quite fun when playing with real people, it can be difficult finding any one online to play it. From my experience with the game on day one of it's release, I've had over a dozen games and only about 2-3 of those games had actual players in them. The majority of my experience were with bots. This isn't really a negative point on the game itself, but is something people need to be aware of before investing money into Square Heroes. If you have a group of friends who are willing to all get the game, you'll have fun. If this impression is incorrect by the time you read this, and the game explodes in it's player base, then you'll have fun. BUT if the game still has the same population online when I played it, it can get a little boring playing with bots 80-90% of the time\n\nOverall Square Heroes has some interesting ideas, my favorite being the arms race in the beginning to mid portion of any given match, and can be a whole lot of fun with some friends or strangers you'll meet online. But be aware, the game is relatively mundane when playing with bots, and from my experience with it, there were more bots than players online. I really hope that changes because I think Square Heroes has some real potential\n\nPros:\n- The arms race mechanic is very interesting and a lot of fun\n- Lots to collect and upgrade\n- Very accessible and easy to learn\n- Good aesthetics\n\nCons:\n- (from my experience) low online population\n- Might be too simple for some","April 10, 2015","true","2.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

With several game modes to choose from like Survival (waves of baddies), DM, TDM, and Capture the Gnome, you pilot your gravity-defying Square Hero through the arena, fighting baddies or players for XP and coins and possibly capturing a gnome or two in the process. XP levels your character up which unlocks new weapons for your loadout and fancy (and funny) hats to customize. You start a match with nothing more than a melee weapon (baseball bat, wrench, rubber chicken, etc etc), and by collecting coins build up an economy to unlock a range of weapons and powerups including multi-shot pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers, medical packs and ammo drops. There is a single player element to the game that introduces you to the game and then challenges you with some pretty insane bots. Controller support worked great for me, and can be played KB+M as well.\n\nFinally, a party game that you can play WITHOUT having to be at a party. Play by yourself, find a game online, or if you're fortunate to have someone next to you, you can duke it out on the same screen.","April 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The bots come in different difficulty levels, but are never as smart as a human.\nThe game also includes different hats and weapons that are unlocked via achievements or leveling, although the basic gear is just fine, so you are never at a high disadvantage towards high levels.\nBasically, you are shooting small aliens to gain gold, which unlocks higher tier weapons in this round. In coop, these aliens attack you, in the other modes they are harmless.\n\nThe singleplayer consists of a short tutorial and then several matches against bots with different maps, settings and rules, and finally the match against the Alien King. It's really more a preparation for the MP or a way to gain levels, although you can easier gain levels by just creating an offline match to your rules.\n\nWhat I really liked was the response of the devs to the problems I reported. It never took long to fix them and they always answered me.\n\nThe downside of this game is that it's player base is small, so you either bring your friends or you take the high ping problems. Or just do it with bots.\n\nI had my 10 hours fun out of the game so far and I still play it with my friends.\n\nTL;DR: Nothing special, cheap, casual fun, but recommended.","February 26","true","10.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fruitsaladhd/recommended/334560/","fruitsaladhd","argent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fruitsaladhd/","77 products in account","A fun, simple and at times challenging new indie title\nOriginally playing this at the PAX AUS indie booth late last year, I greenlit it almost immediately that night. Why? The concept is great, the graphics are simple, gameplay is also very smooth and flows well. Currently there are 8 gamemodes, including Deathmatch, Gnome Hunt and Last Alive, which have either solo or team variations. Survival and Kingslayer are the remaining two gamemodes, all giving the player a fun and challenging experience playing against AI or in Multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer is a huge part of this title, right now following the games release it doesn't seem to be that awfully popular, which I hope can change, as it really brings out the exciting, tense and even frustrating atmosphere. I played a few LAN matches with a controller on a single screen with around 4 people including myself and it was great, if you get taken out, it's not the complete end of your chances of winning. I must admit the snowball factor early into each match can be quite daunting, as players who collect higher tier weapons early can easily destroy any chance of you have of getting back into the game.\n\nWith enough players this game has the potential to become an amazing Multiplayer hit and I'm looking forward to the day I can easily jump into a game with others and enjoy the game to the point I know it can reach.\n\n+ Fun, challenging and unique gameplay experience.\n+ Multiplayer and Co-op.\n+ I haven't encountered any bugs thus far.\n+ Gameplay is very smooth, animations and effects are great.\n+ Very easy to pick up and play straight away.\n+ Tutorial covers everything you need to jump straight into multiplayer.\n+ Playing with a mouse and keyboard is just as easy as a controller.\n+ Trading cards!\n+ In-game achievement and leveling system lets you unlock hats!\n\n- Could use a bit more character customisation, maybe body shape changes, jetpack variations or facewear like glasses/moustaches.\n\nFinal verdict: 9/10","April 9, 2015","true","1.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Simple, fun, runs with no problem on my not so good laptop and I would be playing online matches non stop if there were more people online to play! More maps and more players and this game would be perfect. There's no pay to win dominating others and no endless lag when things start exploding, only pure shooting fun. So yeah I definately recommend it because it's a great game to play on multiplayer and the more the merrier. ^^","March 29","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

In Square Heroes we make our Square hero and we fight other ones while we also fight aliens. The story isn't there but this is more of a gameplay thing. Square Heroes really reminded me of Worms just a little faster. The game is incredibly fun alone, but when you get inside a multiplayer match the fun level rises to new heights. The game gets even more crazy when you have a full man team and it's a free for all. But there's also other game modes like capture the gnome which is exactly what it sounds like. The soundtrack is surprisingly good and the final level song is my favorite song. But it also has a few problems. The final boss is incredibly tough. Everything leading to that point is relatively easy and then a sudden difficulty spike. Some bugs which i hope the developer patches out like achievements not showing up when i clearly unlocked them and some minor ones like enemies clipping through walls in single player. Overall Square Heroes is a really fun indie game and if you like fast paced twin stick shooters this game is for you. I give Square  Heroes a 7/10","April 10, 2015","true","4.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

The online scene is practically dead, I've tried several times to find games online and have had little success, the "Online Players' counter has yet to reach over 10.\n\nOutside of that glaring issue, the game really is a bunch of fun. A twin stick shooter that is easy to pick up and play with friends with tonnes of fun to be had. As you play you level up and get new weapons and guns which keep things fresh while still feeling balanced. The basic levels design and gameplay allow for a really easy pick-up and play style of game, allowing it to cater for the hardcore and casual crowd.\n\nEach round starts off with just a melee weapon, as you play the match out you get gold which is then used to unlock the next tier of weapons. It's a little snowbally at times but that just adds to the fun and intensity! You’ll be screaming as you rush for capture points, get massive killing sprees or lose all the money you saved up for that next tier of weapons! You have your usual Death Match, TDM and KOTH game modes.\n\nIf you really want to get the most out of this make sure you have some friends to play along with. It supports local multiplayer so it might not be bad just to pick it up for the odd occasion you have some friends over. Really I can only recommend it on that basis, otherwise it might be best just to pass on it for now and wait for a sale where it’ll get picked up and hopefully bolster the online scene, even if only for a couple of days.","April 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

It's different.\nThere are zero lobbies and it's up to you to find some friends to play with you as you should not rely on the player base if you are looking to buy this game.\nThis game should create a massive giveaway on reddit and other sites as this game is perfect in it's genre and price range but has a lack of players, and if more players would be active than the sales would increase including faster development.\nDon't just leave this game if you can't find lobbies, this game is worth the play and that's why you should ask on the forums of this game if someone would like to play this game with you every now and than.\n\nNow more about the game self:\nIn this party game you play online with other players and friends or even bots in different game modes, there are a bunch of game modes but the most popular one is of course Team Deathmatch, you have a jetpack where you can fly around the tiny maps, armed with shotguns, rocket launchers, pistols or even melee's ( you can earn new weapons by leveling up aswell ) .\nIt's quite a simple gameplay as you just ran into each other and start bashing someone to death till you reached the death limit or time limit.\nThe game has got all possible elements that should be included and that's something to be happy about.\n\nLet's continue to the game rating now:\n--- Positive points ---\n\nGreat gameplay, won't be boring thanks to all the game modes variations\nAutomatic map switching, motivates me to play more because less action to do to start a new match\nSteam achievements\nSteam trading cards support\nDecent cartoon graphics\nMost fun when playing with close friends ( that counts for every party game though )\nHuge potential of becoming bigger\n--- Negative points ---\n\nDead player base\nSummary:\nI hope this game will get resurrected... this game has all the goodness inside itself.\nI'm excited for the day that i can finally play this online without having to gather all my friends together.\nFor this price tag, and even the price tag on third party sites is it totally worth !\nSo developers, make my wish come true !\n\nRecommendation:\nI recommend every party gamer here to buy this game at full price as you can play it with your friends and you'll surely enjoy that and the full price money can be used to continue development and maybe even faster than usual.\nThis game just needs some marketing events to become viral aswell\n\nHappy hoping everyone !","February 16","true","6.2"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","1"
