It is also a genuine visual and aural feast, and a game that presents level and specific sort of challenge that simply isn't seen anymore.\n\nAs is fitting for game's adventurous feel, its levels tend to be huge and exploration-heavy, and often require reading of various clues and careful scrutiny of one's environment in order to proceed. They are always expertly crafted and pleasing to the eye, be they ancient temples and moody ruins with their exquisite architecture, dark spaceship interiors or, especially, Na Pali's unforgettable outdoor locales. Many of Unreal's environments look genuinely beautiful to this day, which is no small feat.\n\nAnother expertly crafted element is the soundtrack, which simply cannot be praised enough. Whether the tracks are subtle and evocative, perfectly fitting for game's slower and exploratory sections, or fast and pumping ones that enhance many of game's intense gunfights, they are always excellent and memorable.\n\nNow, game's gunfight are perhaps its most unusual part, one that will make it or break it for most players. Unreal opted for something quite different from the norm: while it has its share of simpler enemies that are focused on simply attacking the player while moving in his general direction (say, some of Na Pali's native fauna), major part of the game is exact opposite from mowing thru hordes of uninteligent meat. Unreal's most dangerous enemies are sparsely placed through its spacious maps, they are agile, hard hitting, constantly in motion and surprisingly intelligent (they will dodge your projectiles, run to cover, fake death etc). Surviving your encounters with these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s requires fast reflexes, awareness of your immediate surroundings and understanding the nuances of game's varied and creative (and highly satisfying, if one allows it to be) weapon arsenal.\n\nThis is a must play, and for a particular kind of player that can fully appreciate it, Unreal remains truly one of a kind game: one that was unique back in the day, and one that is even more special today.","January 12","true","31.9"," 63 of 68 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","63","68","2","5"

This is one of those games that you NEED to experience before you kick the bucket as it's pretty much the pinnacle of FPS before the massive decline.\n\nThe story is pretty simple, you're an inmate who's prisoner transport ship crash landed on an alien planet and you'll need to explore lengthy, non-linear levels to progress, you can learn some of the games interesting lore by reading messages left on the dead bodies of humans, reading diaries and scripture on walls, similar to that in Metroid Prime where you learn all the lore from scanning objects and alien text on walls.\n\nThe graphics are incredible, especially being that it was originally released in 98', which was one of the best years for gaming in my opinion. The sound is superb, the weapons sound deadly and powerful. The atmosphere is relentlessly amazing through-out largely thanks to the sound effects, music, scenery, amazing lighting effects and all round amazingly designed levels which see you exploring large layouts, filled with many paths and many hidden secrets while fighting bad-♥♥♥ enemies that fake their death, dodge your attacks and have different behavioural attributes.\n\nThe weapons in Unreal are varied and each behaves in a very unique way, my personal favourite being the Flak Cannon which sends shards of flak at your opponents, shredding them to pieces and has an alternate fire of a grenade that explodes on impact.\n\nI honestly envy you if you haven't played this yet, I'd kill to be able to see everything in this game for the first time again, it's an experience made by true masters who took so many obscure factors into consideration that its scary, this is one solid shooter you don't want to miss out on.","January 2, 2015","true","18.4"," 62 of 70 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","62","70","4","0"

It was pretty badass with something like 64 different shades of brown.  Then once day this company named Epic asked themselves, "What if we created a similar engine and used it to run a game with colors and maybe a few trees?"\n\nAfter some development, Unreal was born.  The engine itself has gone trhough many overhauls and is the groundwork for some of the biggest and most badass games.  Quake engine however didn't get near as much support from outside developers.\n\nThe story isn't all that special and graphics haven't aged all that well, but the gameplay is balanced and guns are fairly creative.  Most of what you'll see in Unreal Tournament's arsenal started here.  Do yourself a favor and bump difficulty up a bit from normal as you wont see any difficulty until about midway through the game.  Also have a heart and don't shoot the goofy looking guys with 4 arms.  They have enough problems to deal with, read the popups from your scanner and you'll understand.\n\nDo buy and enjoy.

And for a 1997 game, that's a serious achievement. The world of Na Pali is wonderful, it's filled with a good amount of lore and fabulous sights. The musical score is amazing. It's a journey to experience at least once.\n\nIf you haven't gotten enough of it after 12 hours, the game offers a built-in sequel (Unreal 2 is not an Unreal game), "Return to Na Pali", which expands and revisits some of the locations. However, while it can rise further above the main game in terms of quality, it also sometimes falls way below. It's still good, though!\n\nOverall I just can't recommend this game enough.

And also because my graphics card has been dead since October and I haven't replaced it and I'm suffering "gaming-withdrawal".\n\n\n\nI was 17 in '98. After a decade of console playing, upon graduating high school, that summer I decided to celebrate by building my own computer. Unreal was the first FPS I ever played, on my first homemade computer.\n\nFunny: after my Windows '98 was up and running, I went to my local CompUSA to buy "Doom", since that's all I'd ever heard anyone talking about. It wasn't in stock, and the guy behind the counter said, "Yo, have you heard of Unreal?" And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nI was blown away. Sets were colorful, AI was challenging (oh SNAP i just shot him that ♥♥♥♥ faked his death!), music was atmospheric, weapons were fun, SP campaign was LONG.  Every time I killed a Skaarj I triumphantly screamed ♥♥♥♥ YOU, B♥♥♥♥ and emptied my clip into his carcass just to make sure he wasn't faking me out.  I played that game STRAIGHT for like eight months. Easily 300+ hours. Many times in the middle of the night with earphones blasting and my eyes popping out of my head like a cartoon: WTF IS THAT ♥♥♥♥ HOLY ♥♥♥♥ ITS COMING RIGHT FOR ME OH YOU WANT SOME TOO???????  DIE MOTHER♥♥♥♥♥♥RRRRRRRRRRR DIIIIEEEEEEEEEE          XFGUDVTUFTYFBIYGYNGOGOIUMIP<:LKLK>*!@(Y\n\nI only stopped playing when I went back to CompUSA in February 1999 and simultaneously bought my second and third video games for my PC: Half-Life and StarCraft. But that's another story.\n\nTL;DR\n\nUnreal's graphics are dated, yes. But the gameplay is still strong. I still get excited when I enter that dark slug temple and hear the tribal drums beating over the sounds of bullfrogs and waterfalls.\n\nUnreal was the greatest, man.\n\n\n\n\n\n(interesting side note: because of "No One Lives Forever" i never actually got to play Doom 1&2 until 2004, right before Doom 3 came out. wasn't bad...for sprites.)","February 22, 2015","true","4.6"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","27","29","5","3"

But most importantly the deadly ferocious Skaarge: a capital alien race seeking complete control over Napali's resources and claiming it for their own ideal purpose as their planet with its innocent 4-armed inhabitants called the Nali, using them as slaves for their corrupted tasks. The Nali fear the skaarge and the terrors of Napali but they seek and pray for their savior where ever they may be to save them from their control from the skaarge and the threats of Napali to bring them hope and haven to their race, who is you (duh). As an ally to the Nali people they'll aid you in any way possible providing ammo, items, secret routes, and sanity from whatever that was left that they had in their home planet that is now the Hell's Sanctuary. Progressing through the vast beautiful world of Napali you'll encounter many fascinating yet horrific locations such as ancient sky temples, abandoned vandalized villages, other crashed humanoid piloted ships, and finally finding the Skaarge Mothership in order to find and destroy the "Source" and ending the Skaarge race once and for all making your escape from Napali with a low fueled but reliable escape pod and float seemingly in space hoping for someone to rescue you to safety..\n\n[Return to Napali] (Expansion Pack)\nOnly realizing that your vision of "safety" turns into a return to hell when you're captured from another different human incorporated ship (The UMS Bodega Bay aka Unified Military Service) and be forced to be sent back into the hellish world that you survived again to locate the "Prometheus", a ship filled with rich and viable weapons information in which the captain of the Bodega desires for greatly and chose you as their scout due to your cunning experience and survival that you had already on the planet. Once fighting your old pals once again, you locate the ship and find the weapons information in which the Bodega demanded, only realizing after listening to a past recording of another UMS ship that provided a brief description about the Bodega's dark background of its greed and misfortune. You are later attacked by the Bodega's soldiers as they were planning to get rid of you once your mission was complete in order to let no one know about their schemes. After wiping out their attack squads you continue on your own path once again to find an escape out of Napali and getting your revenge to the Bodega. After finally locating your (more improved) mini space shuttle you then escape Napali for good and encounter the "UMS Bodega Bay" tricking their attack upon your ship you manage to take down their ship and thus escape with victory and hope that you'll finally find your safe "Haven"...\n\n--My Opinions--\n\nAs a childhood classic of mine, I strongly recommend this game for those who love both FPS and are adventurous and love suspense, mystery, and survival in a game. As I already briefly explained the plots to both the game and its expansion pack (or DLC), I can't give it any more other reason to why this old but still decent work of spanktacular beauty, excitement, and challenge is not worth the buy. Already with its amazing architecture, creatures, and story, it is filled with such well composed music that truly brings you with the feeling of sparking your imagination for exploration, survival, and adventure. Despite its exciting intense gameplay, it does have some tedious puzzles that may take some time and thinking to pass but they aren't that bad. Lastly, it also comes with a game editor which captures the essence of its infinitive sense of creativity and exploration of a never ending journey. From designing your own world built by your imagination for the whole world or just your friends to endure your own world in the Unreal universe.\n\n9.5/10","December 30, 2013","true","69.9"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

A game that I am sure of many people will remember for it's amazing graphics at the time. Even now in 2015 as I am writing this review, I can still say that Unreal is a great looking game with an amazing plot.\n\nUnreal is a fast paced 1st person shooter with a huge campaign, as well as the possibility to fight in deathmatches, capture the flag and many more gamemodes with bots. The levels in this game can be quite difficult to navigate trough and have many secrets to be revealed, but are all extremely well made. There is a large variety of weapons that you'll aquire troughout the game as well as a large variety of enemies that you'll encounter in Unreal's large amount of levels, giving you the possibility to shoot your way out in every way imaginable.\n\nA thing I should also mention is the difficulty of this game. There are 4 different difficulty settings in this game, easy being the easiest setting and 'unreal' being the hardest. What they did is actually improve the enemies' AI, increase their damage and decrease the amount of ammo, health and upgrades you will find troughout the levels. This is something you'll rarely encounter in nowadays' games where they will just increase the damage you'll take and decrease the damage you deal. Unreal has a great way of spicing up things by making it more difficult in different ways.\n\nLike any other game, it needs music. The music in this game is not just some lousy drums and some silly beeps here and there. No no, there's a lot more to it than just that in Unreal. Each and every track is extremely well made and adds a lot more to just a simple level where you pass a cave or tunnel. As soon as you'll enter a spaceship for example, you'll notice the music will change to a more electronic style which fits really well with the level.\n\nAll in all, Unreal is a great fast paced futuristic shooter with a nice variety of weapons, great enemy A.I. and an amazing storyline that I could reccomend to anyone that doesn't care about graphics, but about gameplay instead.","January 15, 2015","true","106.7"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","0"

When I found out it was on Steam, the nostalgia rammed into me like a train.\nAnd it turns out that nostalgia is still hitting me as we speak.\nUnreal Gold is essentially a bundle of both the original Unreal (the singleplayer campaign), and Unreal Tournament 99 (the multiplayer and botmatch portion). Both are very enjoyable and nice to come back to every now and again.\n\nAs a child, I mostly did botmatches because they were so much fun! There were a variety of gamemodes, weapons, and maps (Radikus and Tundra being my favorites). The gameplay is pretty fast paced, which keeps every match interesting.\n\nIn regards to the singleplayer, it is sort of a "figure out where to go by yourself" sort of campaign. I don't know too much of the story, but all I know is that you crash land on a planet and you were apparently a prisoner of some kind.\n\nPlus, the online mode is STILL ♥♥♥♥ING FUNCTIONAL. Holy Jesus this blew my mind when I tried it for the first time. Some servers have mods that change the gameplay entirely, or give you new weapons to toy with. It definitely was worth waiting a minute or so.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like aliens, fast paced combat, O.P bazookas, nostalgic environments and violence up the wazzoo, get this game. You won't regret it. (Unless you are a slow-paced shooter playing scrublord.

However; What makes it special is that it was released on its own source, engine, and everything else. It is freely changable with how you play it; Game-speed (overall except of the music), the way you see your weapons (Right, left, center, hidden), and with the custom hud.\n\nThe game is ambientic. You feel like you are going forward the way you ticked those maps off without any kinds of annoying loading screens. And it feels good when you finish the game. Very dramatic.\n\nGenres: Action FPS + Puzzles. If you are the lazy thinkers of this generation please do not waste your money on this lovely game. All the time it requires thinking and knowing were are you going, were have you been, etc. You do not dumbly shoot the aliens. Never.\n\nSince the game is old and never gets updated now it contains glitches. If the button is not working, or the door is not opening feel free to use a console. Gladly they do not ruin the game. (Multiplayer is not dead)\n---\nWeapons.....are unreal. Dispersion Pistol is the cutest~ Automag is for scouts. Stringer is for semi-minigunners. ASMD Shock Rifle is for semi-snipers. Eightball is NOT for rocketjumpers. Flak Cannon will work for anyone...for the shotgunners I would say. Razorjack....love this thing (But not anyone will), GES Biorifle is for spammers! Rifle...for tryhard snipers. Minigun for minigunners...and Dispersion Pistol for kawaii people. :3\n\nItems....are adorable (Some of them) Invisibility is useful but helpless when you attack someone with it. Flashlights are quick. Flares are useful at dark levels. Nali Seeds....good for people who like to eat healthy stuff~ Everything else you will find out yourself.\n---\n\n\nAnd overall...what can I even say now. Title sais it all!\n\n72/10 Would play forever more, with a lovely Dispersion Pistol and a Razorjack~\n\n","June 16, 2014","true","12.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

In my top 5. The atmosphere is mind-blowing, it still looks really good, has one of the most funkiest soundtracks ever (Deus Ex and this had the same composer) and one of the best arsenal of weapons in any game ever. Unreal released in 1998 along with two books that no one knew about and sported the all-new sleek Unreal Engine. Return to Napali was released a little later and Unreal Gold is just the two combined (Return to Napali can be lahnched seperately in the New Game menu). It had tons of content at release. A single-player (or coop if you like) that took me 20 hours long on Godlike (look below for info on 227i patch) and a multiplayer with tons more options (although arguably still worse) than Quake II. Bots being the prime example. This game would keep you entertained for a long time, and there's also an expansion pack!\n\nNote: There's an unofficial patch for this game called the 227i patch (and varieties), not made by Epic Games, but approved by. It includes widescreen, tons more graphical options, fixes a bunch of bugs and inlcudes two new difficulties. I feel the difficulties need a quick mention. In original Unreal there was Easy, Normal, Hard and Unreal. With the 227i patch there's more difficulties and they have changed. Now there's Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard (equal to Unreal's Unreal difficulty), Unreal (harder than Unreals Unreal difficulty) and Godlike, which is more of an insane difficulty no normal person is meant to play (I did finish it on that difficulty tho so bow down and praise me). Don't play on Godlike. It's the worse thing on the planet.\n\nPros:\n+Incredible soundtrack\n+Great graphics\n+Brutal weapon arsenal\n+Good compatibility (works fine on Windows 10)\n+Fantastic atmosphere\n+Awesome intro\n+Huge variety in levels\n+Sick enemies\n+Great multiplayer maps and bots (Unreal Tournament however is far superior)\n+Long length\n+Alt fire mods on weapons is new\n+Innovative\n+Unique\n+Return to Napali expansion pack is great and adds new weapons and enemies\n+Sound effects are all unique and really good stuff\n+Huge environments, I mean, really big\n+Non-linear\n+Super complex environments at times\n+Great sci-fi world\n+Multiplayer bots\n+AI is some of the best still\n+Lots of multiplayer gamemodes\n+A singleplayer coop feature\n\nCons:\n-Return to Napali expansion pack is very easy\n-Godlike is the biggest chore on the planet (227i patch's fault)\n+There's barely anything wrong with this game tbh, it's the closest to FPS perfection there is which is a big statement\n\nSound: 10/10\nGraphics: 8/10 (very dated obviously, was released in 1998 after all, but still looks really good now)\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nContent/Replayability: 9/10\nOverall: 9.5/10\n\nThis is one of the best games I have ever played. Get the 227i patch and you're in town, don't play on Godlike though. Very Hard is probably the best option if you want it quite difficult. Matches original games hardest difficulty.","January 13","true","34.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Unreal was the first shooter to make me care about the story experience, I wasn't just here to mow down hordes of aliens, I was a survivor and to continue being a survivor I had to discover this new world's secrets. Told through snippets of detail from crew logs, lore, and environment design, Unreal challenges you to explore and conquer. It leaves you craving explanations and closure while making you dread them just the same, the next corner could have a hidden piece of armor or a Skaarj lurking in the shadows. Draped in atmosphere to accompany the tension Unreal brought its powerhouse visuals to full effect in '98, the advances since make it pale to today's graphical feasts, but it's still easy to get absorbed into the world of Na Pali. Unreal brought a lot more to the table in 1998 with great multiplayer modes, but then it was also far more expensive, it's easy to recommend a single player playthrough for dirt-cheap steam prices.

Unreal Gold is an updated version of Unreal, which was released in 1998 among other FPS classics. Unreal is pretty much what happened when Epic Games looked at Quake 2 and said "Yeah that's good and all, but what if we did that, with awesome graphics (for the time), exelent lighting, a unique weapon lineup, and an amazing soundtrack?" And from that, Unreal was born. In Unreal, you go around from map to map (which are generally really huge), shooting an alien race known as the Skarjj, while occasionally helping out another alien race known as the Nali. Unreall has amazing variety in the themes of levels, one minute you're in a crashed prison ship, the next you're in a mountain area, and then the next you're in a mine, and it keeps going on, introducing new and varied areas. Unreal also has an amazing soundtrack, who it's composer would later work on games like Deus Ex. I love the soundtrack in this game, as it has inspired other soundtracks from games that arn't even in the same genre (Freedom Planet for example). The graphics have aged decently. While the texture quality and low poly enviorments and NPCs look bad by today's standards, the lighting in this game is absolutely amazing, and puts other games with great lighting like System Shock 2 to shame. Unreal also has AI which is extremely impressive, even to this day, that almost moves around like another player at times. Unreal's biggest strength however, lies in it's unique weapon lineup, which inclueds the Upgradable Energy Pistol, The Razorjack, The Bio Launcher, and The Flak Cannon to name a few of the awesome weapons. If I had to choose a favorite weapon, it would probably be the Flak Cannon, as it gives a satisfying punch to when you shoot an enemy at point blank. I don't have too many problems with this game to be honest. If I had to nitpick any problems, it would probably be that you do move a bit too slow for my liking, and that sometimes these maps can be extremely confusing to first time players. I also really didn't like the Return To Na Pali expansion included, as many of the changes made to it break the fundamentals of Unreal, and it just doesn't hold up too well. If you like old school FPS games, then Unreal Gold is a game that you should play before you die. I highly reccomend patching the game with The OId Unreal patch, that fixes many bugs the game had, and allows you to run the game in modern resolutions. It's completely Unreal that a first person shooter like is this awesome. If you're a fan of Old School first person shooters, or even FPS games in general, then I reccomend you check this one out.","March 12","true","25.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Just Unreal released in 1998. Return to Na Pali is one of the biggest craps I've ever played. Unreal (1998) is really well-made game in classic FPS style. Gameplay is addictive, weapons are diversified and every player will be satisfied. There's also some nice maps but in fact I can find few levels (Chizra - The Water God Temple, Bluff Eversmoking...) which I really hate. Unfortunately, I saw some AI bugs but it's some kind of Unreal's appeal. I confess I was not interested in the storyline (I know just the overall meaning) so I won't tell you anything about it. Last levels are really great for me - short, "quick" and good. ;) I played it on 'unreal' difficulty level (the hardest) and I finished the game in more or less 20 hours (I have started it twice).\nI have to say something about Return to Na Pali... It is really bad. I thought it will be as good as Quake's mission packs...but no. Levels are boring. I was waiting for the ending during the whole time. I met AI bugs in every level. What about new (3) weapons? Hm... I was using just two of them Combat Assault Rifle (yeah, it is one of my favorite) and Grenade Launcher which I don't like. The third - Rocket Launcher is just weak and useless.\nI finished this erm... mission pack in 8 hours. And if you really want to try it I will just tell you that I prefer to abacinate myself rather than play this again.\nUnreal Gold is worth buying. But you should try just the main Unreal game.","April 22, 2014","true","33.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","2"

I loved this game just the same as I did Doom, Quake, and Rise Of The Triad. I would say just about everything about this game was top-notch and even to say a better game than many I have played today. I found the environment and atmosphere of this game to be breath taking and indulging. The music only add to the vast and vibrant levels by making it feel like there was a form of suspense or seriousness or maybe just that relaxing music to make you feel like you do not have to worry about much right now on this alien planet. Also, I must mention the AI and enemy design. Not only did this game have insanely intelligent AI, the overall character of the opponent shined differently for each of them. I would say that I played the game completely on Unreal difficulty but still to be that intelligent in the game at all is awesome. They have strafing manuevers, dodging, approaches based on your weapon(yes they will try to charge you if you have an Automag out rather than charge you with a Flakk Cannon out), they can feign death, and even go get help if they feel they might lose the fight. Then, the story. I did not find the story the most compelling but definitely something different and likeable and of course the main protagonist is silent but that just means he is much harder to judge while he remains mostly neutral anyway. Finaly, I would recommend this game to absolutely anyone that plays video games and has not played, even if you have played it, play it again.","January 12, 2015","true","44.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The game was unlike anything PC gamers had seen before, it had innovative weapons, beautiful graphics (for the time), and a very complex story that some people thought was boring, while others found it worthy of a literature adaptation. But with Unreal Gold, you can experince this game in the way it was truly ment to be played. This package not only contains a slightly modified version of the original 1998 game, but it also contains an expansion pack that practically continues the story of the original Unreal game, this expansion pack goes by the name of The Return to Na Pali. In all seriousness The Return to Na Pali is a really good expansion pack (albeit shorter than the original game) that contains new weapons, enemies, and levels (obviously). I must warn you that the original Unreal and The Return to Na Pali are quite possibly the hardest FPS games you will ever play in your life. Seriously, there were some levels in these games in which I died more than 10 times.

Do not forget to install the OldUnreal patch if you play this on a modern computer !!!\n\n\nI'm a big fan of the Tournament series so when I saw this in the Steam Xmas sale I decided to give it a try. And this went straight to my all-time favorites list. A true masterpiece still after 18 years.\n\nPerfect atmosphere, great level design, fantastic soundtrack, well designed fast-paced combat with the always so great Unreal series weaponry. No excessive cutscenes, no overly linear levels or invisible walls, no commanders constantly telling you what to do during the next minute. Just you and a bunch of weapons, fighting the endless stream of different enemies and trying to figure what the heck is going on in this mysterious alien world. There's just nothing especially wrong with this game. Of course the graphics do not quite match today's games, but for a 1998 game they look excellent. It's only a minor drawback after all, unless you're all about eye candy.\n\nI bought this for about 2 euros but this is well worth the normal price of 10 euros.","March 15","true","27.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

To this day it haunts my dreams with it's large open maps, complex level design, and stunning graphics (for its time). You can't go wrong if you are into older FPS games and this game has always stood out and been unique.\n\nThis particular Edition comes with the Return to Na Pali expansion (Which is lower quality imho, but it's still worth a playthrough.)\n\nIt features a lot of pretty unique weapons, all designed to show off different aspects of what the engine could do, and they end up being so different that it's actually refreshing. The levels and environments are also varied and interesting. Some of the levels in this game are seriously impressive (I'm looking at you, sunspire). The game is still pretty damn pleasing to look at as well, despite it's lack of polygons and lower res textures, the level design really makes great use of the engine and puts a lot of other 3D shooters of the day to shame.\n\nWhere I feel this game really excels above all else, is it's music. It has some of the best video game music I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. Seriously it's an amazing soundtrack, check it out, especially if you like Alexander Brandon.\n\nThe game does have a story, but  it's not shoved down your throat. Instead it's told through a universal translator item you obtain near the start of the game, it will pick up various messages from dead bodies, books, computer terminals, and can be read to learn about the world and characters in it. The translator also often tells you what a switch does or provides important clues to progressing (This game can be a bit troublesome to navigate compared to most of the linear games we get these days).\n\nReturn to Na Pali actually has some "cutscenes" that are basically monologue of the main character over a section of the map, these can be skipped and some of them weren't even working for my last playthrough.\n\nSo now for the downside, this game has some crashing problems, and by some, I mean a lot! There is a good community made patch that you really should seek out before playing as it removes a vast majority of the crashes.\n\ntl;dr: Awesome and unique FPS with a lot of variety in weapons and environments and some of the best music I've ever heard.","April 4","true","9.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The scenery was breathtaking on release, and still doesn't look that bad today. The levels are almost always well designed to reward exploration, and often have multiple ways of getting around. The music is exceptional, and worth a listen to even if you don't own the game. The story does its job well, and the atmosphere is superb.\n\nMy few complaints would be that some of the mechanisms for opening doors can be arbitrary and confusing at times, as are the few points where you have to kill a certain amount of enemies to progress.\n\nOverall, you won't be disappointed with this game.","December 29, 2014","true","55.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

The levels are huge and mazelike and it's easy to get lost, unsure of what you're supposed to do or what that switch you just flipped actually did.\n\nBy normal FPS standards Unreal is slow paced, maybe even boring, but it's an interesting history study when you think of it as a sort of "proto FPS RPG" that focuses more on exploration and world building than constant pulse pounding action.","December 7, 2014","true","20.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

As you play though you unlock clues about your role on the planet and your destiny. The second addition to this is rather weak however.

It was one of the earliest forms of awe I can recall when I was navigating through the wreckage of the prison ship and going outside onto an alien planet to confront brutes and skaarj and all the other nasty crap. The story was pretty neat, the graphics, at the time, were awesome. The mechanics were, and still are, pretty solid. This series, including the follow up Unreal Tournament, were easily one of my favorite games to play as a child and experiencing it again as an adult took me down nostalgia avenue and socked me right in the feels.\n\nThe action, again, feels smooth and the fights all feel pretty visceral as you blow your enemies to chunks. The environment is as much fun to look at as it is deadly because among being a great FPS it's also got some decent platformer elements combined with some slight puzzle solving areas. Keep in mind none of this is really too difficult but some secret areas can be accessed for more loot or plasma pistol upgrades which really go a long way to making the end game less difficult. As you go through the levels you will find data pads or letters or messages that sort of reveal parts of the story as well as adding some depth to some of the weird scenes you come across. Bodies laying around a room full of guns or some lone crates with chunks of what used to be people beside it tell a story which really adds a lot of immersion to your playthrough.\n\nMy only real issue with the game is that some of the graphical settings don't seem to really work but this could just be my machine. Brightness and screen size seem to be constant issues. The only setting that seems to work without issues is 800x600 which is fine, but since I can't really adjust the brigthness level and it seems too dark.

As soon as you finish the first stage and enter Napali Falls I was in shock and awe at the graphics, scenery which was overflowing with atmosphere.\n\nIn this day and age of Extreme Graphics engines, Unreal falls behind but back in 1998, Unreal was about as cutting edge as you could get, back when your eyes would bleed rainbows at the power of the Unreal 1 Tech engine, but I feel I must come to a conclusion.

The maps are huge, with many "secret" areas to uncover, and lands to explore, and maybe even encounter a friendly alien just waiting to open a secret to only whom is aware of to unleash some wicked weaponry to use against your foes. The game has stellar ambience with it's soundtrack and design, and can be quite freaky, if not terrifying at times. This game is very twisted in design, unfortunately this sometimes goes a little out of hand, as it can become quite confusing. Regardless of the small flaws, Unreal was still worth my purchase of a retail copy. While quite different from the sequel everyone hated but I enjoyed fairly enough, this game takes you back to the past of exploration in first person shooters while still being quite linear to an acceptable degree.

There is a story told within the game - mostly in text logs and level pacing.

For older computers that was not a problem, but for todays more powerful rigs and technology, it is. The game essentially runs without a hitch, but to make it playable you will need to download community patches to address the issue of having unlimited FPS.\n\nUnreal Gold is an excellent title and despite the years gone by it still stands fast in terms of quality and entertainment to be derived from it.

It blew everyone's mind at the time with how visually impressive it was, featuring some of the most immersive environments ever created. Of course, Halflife came out later the same year and diverted everyone's attention somewhat, but the the original Unreal remains a must play classic. Set in a futuristic techno-gothic universe with a Mayan touch, Unreal is a fairly long game (unlike many of today's) that should provide a satisfying experience in one of the most unforgettable worlds to be created. I hadn't played this in many (about 10) years, and the nostalgia overload as the second map began (stepping out of the prison ship onto the alien world, and THAT music starts) was well worth the reduced price of £2.99 I can tell you! Not all of the level design is as innovative as the outside parts, there are some Doom style dark futuristic corridoor moments to add variety, and the medieval looking parts are vaguely remeniscent of Heretic. There are some instantly memorable level designs here, and a soundtrack that in places is just unforgettable. The enemy AI was very intelligent for its time, the Skaarj and their dodging in particular will cause you to waste plenty of ammo if you don't aim well. Being that this is Unreal Gold, it includes the Return to Na Pali expansion which despite apparently not being as good, is a good addition for extra gameplay. Then of course, you get the original Unreal Botmatch. We all know what this lead to, and indeed it does work like a proto version of UT, featuring several maps (Deck 16 for example) in their original incarnations. A classic that should not be missed.","December 31, 2013","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play the game as Prisoner 849, who was on a transport ship going to a Moon base prison. However something happens and you awaken with the ship crash landed on a mysterious planet. You blast your way through the game with a whole range of different creative weapons, whilst exploring the planet and trying to figure out what happened to the transport ship by reading varies journals, as well as figuring out a way off the planet.\n\nFor its time the graphics were unreal, with amazing looking environments, lighting and textures, which are more well detailed, especially up close. The levels vary from large open fields with a few houses or caves to explore to smaller areas such as a spaceship or a temple. Each area looks unique and it’s easy to distinguish one area from another. The weapons are fun and unique to use such as the bio rifle which shoots green toxic globs and the flak cannon which shoots out shrapnel, which can ricochet off any surface. The enemies vary from slow moving aliens which fire rocket launchers, to fast moving enemies which shoot projectiles at you, almost every enemy in the game shoots a projectile, only a few will use hit scan weapons. The enemy AI is extremely good and are very challenging. You will find yourself dodging left to right to avoid enemy projectiles whilst shooting them down, which can get very intense. From beginning to end this game is a wild ride and is worth a playthrough.\n\nThe expansion Return to Na Pali is good but doesn’t live up to the main game. You get a few new weapons, which whilst fun to use aren’t that interesting and some new enemies. The story is told a lot more straight forward, through cut scenes and audio blogs from prisoner 849 if you play as a female. The levels for the most part well designed however the level layout makes no sense, in one level you’re in a base which is located in the middle of a cliff and the next level you’re in the mountains.

But first let me tell you that I must've spent MONTHS on this beauty of a game simply because of the amazing atmosphere of EVERY SINGLE LEVEL it has, and its all SP. Most of this game may be its SP, (Single Player) BUT I swear its very fun. Why? Well, let me say that this was one of my early childhood games. It was the second game I ever played, under Quake 2. I believe it was the game I played the most when I was that young. If not this one, then it was Jazz Jackrabbit. (HUGE congrats to those who know what it is, its so obscure these days) Oh, yeah, I REALLY hope Steam brings Jazz Jackrabbit (...2...) here, because I really miss it. The only way to get it is on Amazon. :( Anyway, I'm getting off-topic here, I went all the way to like the 4th-5th level, I mostly knew the second and third levels out of all of them, though, because they were the ones I replayed the most when I had no idea what I was doing as a very little boy. I loved the music on the third one, which, let me say. THIS GAME HAS THE MOST AMAZING MUSIC EVER. Just play through every single level, and tell me it doesn't. Oh, yeah, right, speaking of levels, this game hasn't got much of a story whatsoever, but most are lengthy and there's a TON of levels, enough to keep you busy for a whole month. Trust me. The MP's the practically the same as Tournament, sure, Tournament featured a whole new bunch of things that could be considered balancing to some but I still prefer Gold for even MP purposes. Gameplay's thrilling. I can't say much else, lol, I think that getting the game on a sale is definitely worth it for every FPS lover. I also encourage anybody who enjoys video games, music and ambience to play this, because all three things are top-notch in this game.

Certainly it's not the gameplay. As a classic FPS it can be excused for being mechanically little more than a long string of bullets being introduced to faces, with the bosses being able to take more bullets to the face than most. Admittedly that's a bit of an undersell, since compared to things like the Dark Forces Saga the enemies are pretty varied in their attack forms. But even then only the Skaarj (quick-moving backflip enthusiasts) and Mercenaries (with their shields) have much in the way of techniques that warrant a change in strategy beyond "pull out a bigger gun."\n\nBut for some reason that's apparently the appeal of classic FPSes, sprinting at high speeds while commiting genocide. In which case that's kind of hard to fault. But it's not my preference, so why my love for this game?\n\nThe answer would have to be "atmosphere." Like with Morrowind and Metroid Prime, I'm a sucker for games with a strong sense of place and meaning. Unreal has a sort of psuedo-fantastical feel to it that, along with its minimalist storytelling, gives the game a somewhat mythic feel that's hard not to love. And while the particulars of the layout tend to be fairly nonsensical and "gamey," Unreal's level design is based largely around huge locales that let you explore the ins and outs of them in a way that gives a very tangible sense of scale.\n\nIt's not perfect, and in many ways has not really aged well, but whatever mechanical failures Unreal has is eclipsed by the wonderful weight of its atmosphere. It's still second to Metroid Prime in my not entirely humble opinion, but if it was visually brought up to speed and given the gameplay quality of, say, Half-Life... that'd be hard to top.","February 22, 2015","true","49.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While not the first game to implement skyboxes, it was one of the first to show what one could do with them.\n\nThe game takes place in the alien landscape of Na Pali. You explore this rough foreign location while dealing with the locals that get in your way. Unreal's engine was very innovative for the time. It tried to do a lot of things to stand out compared to it's main competition: Quake 2.\n\nWhile Quake 2 was a corridor shooter taking place in futuristic bunkers and facilities. Unreal took place in jungles, and temples worshipping long dead gods. You find a universal translator early on in the game and the raw detail that goes into the backstory of Na Pali is extraordinary. You can see this legacy continued in later games such as Morrowind and Halo.\n\nThe Gold Pack comes with the core game, plus it's expansion pack.

It's certainly worth buying on Steam just to have it available if you're looking for a walk along nostalgia lane.\n\nFrankly, it's still a functional game and I'm enjoying coming back to it with two extra decades of general gaming experience. I'm not cheating so much and allowing myself to explore, rather than noclipping through all the doors like I did as a child. I'm reading every translator popup I can find, something I didn't do before.

The basic plot is that you, Prisoner 849, are aboard the the prision ship Vortex Rikers when it crashes on the planet Na Pali. From there on out you have to fight to survive as you trek across the planet looking for a way off.\n\nAlso included in this pack is the expansion "Return to Na Pali", which adds addtional content and game-play.\n\nUnreal has recieved several updates from the community so the game can not only be played, but run at a decent level of graphical quality. Some of the models are a bit '1998' looking still, but even that is being worked on. There is of course many mods, maps, skins and all the usual community content out there to exend the game in ways you see fit.","April 24, 2011","true","35.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's also something that is still a little unique for an FPS with no RPG elements, it's very much a shooter that plays like an adventure game, relying on all of that genre's tropes and cliches rather than those set by its doom-like predecessors.\n\nWhere the game doesn't hold up is in graphical fidelity; to be expected for a game made in 1998, but for a title that sold itself on the strength of its scenery and set design it's a little disappointing when you realize you can play it on two rocks ducktaped to a piece of glass so long as it was assembled after 2008. I suppose that's nitpicking though, the atmosphere is great and its not hard to see why the scenery was considered some of the best for its time.\n\nThe long and short of this review is get it, it's historically important and cheap even if it wasn't a fantastic game. The fact that Epic declined to continue making games for this series and instead focused solely on Unreal Tournament is one of the biggest disappointments in all of gaming.","June 25, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The original Unreal is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Lots of awesome original weapons, all with alternate fires, all super fun, and with such meaty sound design. And you gotta love those super deep-voiced grunts when you jump. Lots of fascinating enemies and NPC interactions. Really great lore and worldbuilding from the text logs you can observe, and a real sense of scale and gravitas with the story despite the complete lack of dialogue. No cutscenes, all real-time and ambient, but with sick-♥♥♥ music. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant map design, with breathtakingly expansive levels to explore.\n\nAesthetically, everything in the game is just beautiful, even today. Such colorful and lush sci fi landscapes and architecture, and not just the usual everything-is-metal-and-high-tech stuff you often think of when thinking of sci fi settings. It's truly an alien world... And the enemy AI is actually challenging and crazy smart, which is just astounding considering this is a game from 1998 and how lame AI often still is today. The game is really challenging in general, and it is very long.\n\nWhen I think of a true JOURNEY of a game, I think of this very Unreal right here. No ♥♥♥♥ing Tournament, just plain-♥♥♥ original Unreal 1 right the ♥♥♥♥ here. It is positively... UNREAL, the places you'll go in this game. The very definition of an adventure. People always going on about how great Half-life is, but I honestly feel this game might be a notch or two more amazing than Half-life, for the same sorts of reasons Half-life 1 was/is awesome. And I do ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE Half-life. This game... This game gave me feelings, guys. Real ♥♥♥♥ing feelings. I was truly in awe. This game should be recognized more, and it has my 100% recommendation, especially considering the price.\n\n\nThe expansion, Return to Na Pali gives a bunch more levels for even more Unreal goodness and continues the story directly where Unreal 1 left off, but the player character is suddenly given a voice, and I think that goes against what the original Unreal was about. He'll (you'll) talk in between levels in some dumb kinda unncessary monologue about what just happened and what's going to happen next. So Return to Na Pali is the same fun as Unreal 1, but with some mediocre new narrative style. So even including Return to Na Pali and Unreal 2 (which goes even further into the voiced characters, try-hard hamfisted story ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t territory, and is really quite a different kind of game altogether), there truly hasn't been another game quite like Unreal since Unreal came out all these years ago, and while the Unreal Tournament games aren't bad, I think it's a damn shame Epic (Mega)Games never made another game as incredible in the way Unreal was. Here's hoping for a really good current-gen remake of some sort; this singleplayer Unreal truly deserves another chance in the spotlight. Or perhaps a whole new Unreal game altogether, if they can nail it like this one did, and take away from the stains of Return to Na Pali and Unreal 2. It is one of the most amazing experiences I've ever played, and I wish more people could understand what I'm talking about by playing the game for themselves. So go do that, reader! It's totally worth it, trust me on this one. That so few people talk about this game just astounds me. And there's also multiplayer, yes.","January 7, 2013","true","54.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is little room, reason or reward for the stealthy approach and everything but The Nali want to kill you.\n\nPROS\n- Good graphics\n- Polished mechanics\n\nCONS\n- Poor pacing\n- Visceral satisfaction is low.\n\nVisceral satisfaction is a weird thing. You know like how in DOOm you never seem to get tired of liquifying a bunch of imps.  Yeah..

There are several different types of aliens to shoot from shark-like creatures to huge titan beasts, there are also upto 13 different types of weapon with alt fire modes. As you progress through the game, you find new weapons and power-ups which can be useful, there are also ammo, armor and health packs which you have to use wisely to conserve resources. When you first buy the game, make sure you adjust the settings to your preferances and optimize the game to run best on your device, I recommend changing the graphical/audio settings, character models, controlls and interface settings before you start playing. There is also multiplayer and bot matches, which host about 20 additional maps, you can set up a match with your friends or if you don't want the fuss just start a bot match and practice, get a hang of the maps and weapons to learn while you progress.","August 31, 2014","true","33.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This was the game that kickstarted the Unreal Engine's legacy across the game industry. Now despite being a tech demo, I thought it was a fairly challenging game. Annoying at times, but challenging nonetheless. The Enemie AI is smart, the Graphics (while they have aged not too well) still look pretty and the levels are ENORMOUS thanks to the engine itself. The beginning of the game literally takes you from id's corridoor/indoor shooting and introduces you to shooting in the wide open outdoors in a vibrant, colorful but hostile world!

Unreal is the point where modern FPS was born and the engine itself became groundwork for modern game developing tools .\n\nThese days we take much of what Unreal introduced for granted as a base line for what FPS should be. However back then it was ambitious to create a fluid FPS game in 3D .

I rememer playing the original Unreal not too long after it came out and loved it, but was at that middle school age when finishing games wasn't always my top priority, especially with a game like Unreal where most of the jazz was about the multiplayer experience. Deathmatched with my friends into the wee hours of the night back then. But man, what an absolutely amazing single player experience. Just a few pros to name off the top of my head:\n\n- Music is perfect for the setting, really adds to the ambiance.\n- Story is engaging and delievered in a very unique style.\n- Graphics acually hold up really well.\n- Really solid AI, especially for a game made in '98\n- Fairly challenging, even on lower difficulties. Prepare to use your brain every now and then for puzzles.\n- And most importantly just a flat out good old shooter. The gameplay and guns are just plain fun.\n\nI highly recommend grabbing Oldunreal's 227 patch before diving into this. It really modernizes the game in a few different ways and makes for a really awesome original Unreal experience. Really glad I picked this up during the Steam sale and finally finished the single player campaign. I got it on the extreme cheap, but Unreal Gold is still worth the $10 non-sale price.","July 15, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it hasn't aged well in the slightest it's nice to remember how impressed we were back then stepping out of the spaceship into what seemed like a huge environment, and that waterfall. Even though now looking at it the landscape is sparse, blocky, and low resolution, imagination and sentimentality still fills in the blanks.\n\nThe controls aren't quite as tight as fpses nowdays, and you realise just how much you take for granted in modern games.

There are lots of guns, items, and open areas to explore. This proves that Unreal truly revolutionized the modern shooter.
