Ok oddly enough no unity logos no unreal logo but adobe air? Literally the thing that only purpose is to make phone apps? To make matters worse whenever you start it up it has an unistall button right next to play button (perhaps a bit of foreshadowing right there).\n\nNow once you get past that little ordeal you go to the options menu A.K.A the mute and not mute button(s) oddly enough there are two of them for all that i can tell are for headphones and speakers. There is no resoultion and iff you have a monitor like mine 1920 x 1080 prepare for the biggest black bars you will see on steam (although it turns out some of it is just your untextured inventory).\n\nPlot:\n\nYou play as the brother of another brother who are apperently still not on a first name basis so from now on you play as bro 1 and you are looking for bro 2. Bro 1 comes back to england from...doesnt tell you ok, and you recieve a letter from your bro 2 telling you he found a break through in inter dimesional travel, but soon goes quiet and soon he goes missing along with the rest of his team, and can you guess his line of work in the pursuit of DIFFERENT DIMMESIONS? archeology....archeology....arc....E...ology. Well its good to note that the plot is as hair brained as the optimzation, but back on track you go to Tibet for some reason to his exact location...somehow and your adventure begins!\n\nGraphics:\n\nIll say it now this is the one plus of the game, it feels like your inside of your journal as the MC writes down what he sees and tries to describe it through his "doodles" (couldnt think of a better word). Though as i've said this game is odd so instead of creating an inventory in a POINT AND CLICK GAME you get 2 big, black, bars boom now thats game design you think its just poor optimization but BAM it turns out its just untextured black screen who's laughing now?\n\nnote: it still has a bad resoultion i just found it funny how they made it worse.\n\nGameplay:\n\nAhh...the best for last, I dont know how you mess up the gameplay in a point and click but they found out how. First off the item names are flat out wrong and will confuse you example one: you pick up a knob at the start becuase it only tells you half a tutorial for some damn reason. so what is this knob for a door? the gong near by? nope you combine it with a stick to make a hammer...THATS NOT A KNOB, i dont know how they even managed to code this game if they cant labble something a hammer head or even a stone, then it gets worse becuase bro 1 doesn't know what an oil can is and calls it and oiler....thats not a thing its an oil can game.\n\nnext is the eye spy part of the game wher you look in those places that are a tad off in search of handy tools, yeah this is hilariously easy everything sticks out or is just flat out presented to you in a turd colored basket by it being in the black part of your screen. So you know how long it took me to beat it, to make it so even a mentally challenged beaver could play theres a walk through button, thats right the game PLAYS ITSELF, if you ever feel the need to comment dont worry the entire game has a button which sends you straight to there face book page just in case you were actaully managing to be immersed in this pile of Tormentum's (A much better game of the same genre)  fecal matter, shattered.\n\nBut frett not for this game's play time is only 1 hour, by me, im dreadful at these types of games and by anyone who plays these types alot i wouldnt imagine it taking more then 30 minutes. also you know that dimessional stuff they babble on about in the kind of existing plot, doesnt exist in the gamplay they are just doors. Fun.\n\nNit Picks:\n\n"Russian localization\nHi. Russian version will be able a little bit later. I try to do it next week.\nПривет. Русская версия будет доступна немного позже. Я постараюсь сделать это на следующей неделе."\n\nthis isnt an update this an announcement at best\n\nthe menu button takes you to the main menu and the exit just closes the game instead of the menu.\n\nFinal summary\nThis game is everything that's wrong with new realeases, promised sequals to make up for an incomplete boring game, a poor plot in a plot driven game, poor gameplay in such an easy formula, odd design choices and little attention to detail in a genre only popular do to the attention to detail in the game.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThis game commits the three b's Boring, Broken, Bad avoid this and don't expect much from the sequels if they manage to come out.\n\nEdits made: spell checks\nFound out this game is free on a couple sites and is just a glorified flash game, and that the sound buttons are for ambient, while the other is for SFX.\nDate is 7/22/15","July 22, 2015","false","0.2"," 93 of 127 people (73%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","73","93","127","15","8"

There's no storyline (or not much of one), often no hints or help (except for the obligatory Youtube video walkthrough), and the door you need to open to escape is usually readily visible but locked. The genre then expanded to allow for multi-room scenes, and one of the most famous representatives is Mateusz Skutnik's "Submachine" series of games. Abandoned is so well done that many people (including Mateusz himself[www.kongregate.com]) found the parallels striking. It's a very good room escape game.\n\nYou can find Abandoned on the usual sites on the net. You can play it there for free, but if you buy it on Steam, you get slightly better graphics (the images were scaled down for free online publication), and of course you're supporting the developer. I did play it on Kongregate (it was in my "to do" playlist, actually) and then bought it here for 50% off (release promo).\n\nAfter downloading, instead of being ready to play, a game installer starts which actually installs a DRM-free copy of AbandonedHD on your computer. There's a bit of a glitch as the game is showing screens to the right and left (and on a bigger screen presumably also top and bottom), but you can probably ignore that. After that, it's all point&click and brains.\n\nHints that I would have needed:\n1. If you are exploring extra well, you can find up to 4 secret symbols that will allow you access to as many bonus story pages at the end of the game.\n2. The puzzle at the very top with the cube and the two switches can be solved right there, it doesn't need anything that is elsewhere.\n\nThe playthrough took me about an hour (of course the walkthrough is only 9 minutes, but that's ok). The production values are cheap: it's a flash game with hand-drawn graphics; but the soundtrack is effective, the puzzles are very well designed, and the game works well.\n\nIt's short, it's cheap, it's recommended - and if you have doubts, look for the free version (search for "Abandoned" and "Krutovig") and check it out before you buy. Or get a refund.","July 22, 2015","true","1.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

But he disappeared, leaving only journal entries giving you tantilizing hints.  Follow in your brother's footsteps and discover the mystery!\n\nThe game consists of a sequence of screens that you can click left, right, up, and down to move (if possible depending on location) from screen to screen.  There are items you can pick up and use.  Unlike some other point-and-click games, this one does not hold your hand and show you possible moves.  Click everywhere until you figure it out.  Usable items will show up at the bottom of the screen in your inventory.  There are also journal entries your brother left behind that you can gather and read for clues.  Use the items by clicking on them in your inventory and dragging them where you want them used.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly logical and mechanical.  Though once or twice there were times when it didn't make sense because I could have done something in real life but the game wouldn't let me do it.  But overall they were good puzzles.  Some of these point-and-click games and hidden object games have crazy uses for items.  I'm happy to say that this is not one of them.\n\nThe graphics are a huge plus for me.  I love the cartoon look.  Or hand-drawn, or whatever it's called.  It just looks so cool to me.  But that's personal preference, and you can decide for yourself if you like the screenshots.\n\nThe music is just kind of spooky ambience background sounds.  Nothing special.  But it definitely fits the theme of the game.\n\nTime to Finish: 1 hour or less.  Depends on how quickly you figure out the puzzles.  Also there are optional bonus items to find that reveal some more of the story.  You can find them along the way or return to the game after you finish.\n\nOh, and I guess there's a free version online somewhere.

It's actually quite nice looking. It wont win any graphics awards, but it looks perfect for what it is.\n\nAll told, it took me around 45 minutes to complete.

Standard PnC fare.\n\nThe story itself was sparse, and yet completely worked within the scope of this game. It did feel like it ended prematurely, or at least felt like a cliffhanger from where a sequel would commence. No word on whether that will or wont happen, but in my opinion, it should.\n\nI feel like this game is a nice interlude between other games. I'd say it is worth the asking price, but you may want to wait for it to reach dollar status before buying if you arent really into the genre or arent willing to take a chance on a shorter game. That said, it's definitely worth your time. It wont blow your mind, but you also wont regret playing it.\n\nI think all told, I'd give this around a solid 7 of 10.","September 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I only used the wikipedia near the very end for the fourth light bulb but I walked around alot. The secerets are a nice touch but easy to find. The game being made in flash makes the game to go below 30 FPS although my computer sucks, this is still a problem. One of the major problems that I had were the glitches. Suprisingly none of these were game breaking except one but that was fixed with a restart. For some reason, at least for me, I could see other panes while in each individual pane and this allowed me to move to parts of the level that would be otherwise impossible without doing the proper steps to do it vanilla. This allowed me to skip a very large part of the game, that invloves a broken train, and get to the next part. Now I did not know this until I watched a walkthrough but I could have completed the game without ever going through that part. In other parts, it just looks ugly. This could be a problem when playing in higher resolutions such as 1920 x 1080. The length of the game is short as it only took me less than 2 hours to complete. This game may or may not be the game for you but I enjoyed the story and I want this to be a positive review.\n\nI understand how lame this review is but I suck at reviewing games.

It's similar in some fashion to a masterpiece called 'Rhem' in that the puzzles themselves hold the atmosphere of the game as well as help tell a story. The developer is from the Ukraine and can be found here... http://krutovig.com/about-me/\n\nThe biggest disappointment here is that English is not his native tongue and that is particularly evident when you compare the grammar and literacy of the various notes hidden around the place which tell a hodge podge story thrown together from all sorts of various inspirations starting from the movie 'Cube' to the game 'Metro 2033'. Having said that you can also tell that the developer is really trying to produce something which gives you a sense of wanting to explore and solve the mystery of an alien landscape.\n\nHere lies the gem of the game. The map layout is actually really well designed and the puzzles compliment the whole entire journey without it being that hard at all. In fact even though an ingame connection to a walk through is kindly provided by the developer it's hard to imagine that you will need one as there are plenty of clues to the observant eye. Just as you begin to get immersed in this out of world experience the story finishes with a question mark and another door which leads to his sequel of this game 'Abandoned 2'.\n\nAlso there is four magical letters you can find and hilight which will present you with four additional diary entries by your brother as a special ending if you care to go that extra mile.\n\nIn final I really did appreciate this short adventure and will be looking at his next. I do suggest that the developer seriously thinks about hiring or gaining the confidence of a volunteer writer which could help enhance this story. As for map and puzzle layout, you seem to have nailed it by presenting a worthy enjoyable experience. The cartoon or animation could do with some slight tweaking by adding in a more detailed artwork and beautiful backgrounds. Having said that it was still quite justifiable though it seemed cheaply drawn because of its numerous unique settings it constantly presented to you.\n\nYou seem to be on a good thing here, hopefully with further improvements in both art and story this game will never truly be abandoned.","January 19","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

If you get the game in a bundle, you can play it in Steam if you want, but there's no achievements or cards to be had. It was a fun game and I recommend it if you already own it or you want to find it online, but I wouldn't reccomend paying for it. There also isn't anything extra in the Steam version because the walkthrough I had to use for some parts (some puzzles are very convoluted and require lots of walking back and forth to find the right things) was for the online versions and took me all the way through the game.\n\nTLDR: If you have it already, play it.

My fault for not reading other peoples' reviews, but it is a simple Flash-based room escape game that has a meaningless plot and some decent puzzles, but nothing too difficult.  It can be finished in approximately a half hour to forty-five minutes depending on the player, and then it's done.\n\nMy downthumb is simply for this version of the game.  By all rights, it's a decent room-escape and a nice little time killer that's decently thought out.  I just don't know why there was a commercial release when it's available everywhere.  Still, I hope it allows Krutovig to explore bigger ideas and maybe come up with something much more profound in the future.","September 7, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it's a decently clever point and click adventure, that offers an interesting setting and doesn't succumb to adventure game logic too much.  The puzzles might be a bit on the easy side, and the story itself could probably use a bit more fleshing out, the former I think works well enough for a game like this and the latter is largely because this is just the start of a potential series.\n\nHere comes the caveat though: there is a free version of the game available online (also posted by the developer), and in fact the steam version doesn't have any less features than the free version.\nSo it might only make sense to buy the game if one wants to support the developer.  Otherwise, I would say keep any eye on it but maybe hold off on a purchase.\nThough the game isn't that expensive, so you wouldn't lose much either way.","August 2, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, unlike other commenters, I had no problems installing or running the game on my laptop. It was a smooth, glitch-free experience.\n\nGameplay:\nThe puzzles are fairly intuitive, and if you are willing to think creatively and pay attention to details, you will not need to resort to a walkthrough. I personally liked the challenge level, it was a brainteaser without being frustrating.\n\nThe tone of the game is supernatural in nature, so don't expect everything you see to make sense; however, there is a solid adventure-gaming logic behind each of the puzzle solutions. (Ex. Why does hitting a gong have the effect it does? Who knows? But you don't need it to make sense to understand the simple item-combination puzzle behind it: You know you need to hit the gong, therefore you know you need something to hit the gong with. You can easily suss that out on your own.)\n\nMy only complaint is there were one or two hotspots that could have been implemented better (I'm looking at you, Secret #3).\n\nStory:\nThis was where the game started to fall apart for me. The plot is a rough outline at best, and is mainly a hodge-podge of vague sci-fi and adventure tropes. It doesn't feel like it has any real substance, and there wasn't enough of a payoff at the end for finding all the hidden clues. It just left the game on a hollow and abrupt note. I understand this is the first in a planned series of games, but I am still left with a lingering sense of "is that all?" I think if the game had been a bit longer, with a more substantially developed plot, it would have been more satisfying.\n\nAs is, this is a decent point-and-click puzzler that will give you 45-90 minutes of brain-teasing fun. The graphics and music are great, and the story is not-so-great, but overall the gameplay is solid.\n\nI would give it a 7/10. If you are unsure about it, play it online for free. If you like it and want to own a copy, it's worth paying a dollar or two to support the creator.","January 4","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a short, simple point and click adventure. It doesn't take too long to solve, although there are a couple of puzzles that are a little infuriating - it's not that those ones are hard, more that I really couldn't be bothered going through the steps of solving them. But I did and I managed to finish it.\n\nAs you can see from my play-time in game, it took me half an hour to finish. I don't have a problem with that for the sake of a few pence. Heck, I made the money selling trading cards (for other games) so it didn't cost me anything.\n\nShort, simple, clever in places and worth half an hour to an hour of my time.

I wouldn't say I am bad at puzzles, but when they don't make sense then I can't be bothered. Of course the fact that there's a direct button to a walkthrough inside the game proves my point. A good game with puzzles that make sense doesn't need a walkthrough, at least definitely not one linked directly inside the game by the developer itself. The developer should simply have made the game itself more logical and clear. I am honestly not inclined to just watch the walkthrough and shadow every move from it in the game.
